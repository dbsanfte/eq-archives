<b>EAST COMMONLANDS--</b>
 <br><br>
This week many of the Freeport Guards were fired after a ploy to gain them better wages backfired on them.  Most of the members of the guard, which cover the greater Freeport area, including the desert edge of North Ro and sections of East Commonlands, have been affected by low wages and lack of "Looting rights" to things they kill.
 <br><br>
Twenty-two guards submitted their resignations, fully expecting the city council of Freeport to beg them to stay.  Instead, the council accepted their resignations and now all twenty-two are out of a job.
 <br><br>
When reached for comment, many of the guard had harsh words, saying "Lights out, a_City_Council", and "Say your prayers, a_guard_union."
 <br><br>
On a related note, the City Beggar's union has received a boost in membership in the last few days.
<br><br><br>

<b>FREEPORT--</b>
 <br><br>
It's not the first case of inter-racial love seen in Norrath, but this one has sure stirred things up in Freeport.  Stirred up so much that the guards of the city have united, despite their religious differences, in an attempt to calm things down.
<br><br>
All morning and late into the afternoon a female Troll has been tearing up the city in search of her beloved.  Very few souls have been brave enough to interfere with her frantic searching, and so the details are sketchy.  One of the dockside merchants gave a first hand accounting from his bed in the Temple.
<br><br>
"<em>Bash.  Bash.  Bash.  That's all she said.  Bash.  She was like a huge angry machine, pounding and bashing everything in sight.  I tried to run, and I think that was my mistake.  Like a raging bear she came after me.  I guess the motion attracted her.  She screamed at me: BASH!  I tripped over one of the fool guards as he was trying to run away in that heavy armor.  I probably saved him the beating of his life.  He got away, but his clumsiness earned me these...</em>"
<br><br>
I have to report that the lumps on his head and back were astounding.  It is a tribute to the healing power of Quellios that he was able to speak at all.
<br><br>
As I write this the militia is, finally, beginning to organize a method for calming her down.  They are going to send one of the brave members of the Society of Antonican Bards in to try to soothe her with song.  When trying to gather information for this article, I overheard the brave bard, Nepenthia, tell the militia something about duty and responsibility for one's own.  She also muttered something about our very own editor.  I was unable to hear the whole comment, but I'm certain that the brave bard was suggesting that Absor might be a better talker.  It is widely known, at least by all of the cub reporters, that Absor is a ladies man, and it's likely that he would be best suited for this task.  Unfortunately he had to leave town with some haste this morning, certainly following up on a story that is too important to leave to mere cub reporters like myself.
<br><br>
I am sending this report in now because it is convenient.  It seems that the militia is sending a rather large contingent to the offices of EQX right now.  I guess they are seeking to put the great minds there to use in case the brave bard fails.  So I have asked them to deliver this for me while they are there.
<br><br>
I will follow up when I have more information.  We send all of our prayers with the lovely Nepenthia as she takes on this dangerous task.
