<b> Magic </b>
<br><br>
EverQuest is keeping lots of its magic details secret.  It is mainly mana
based, and requires temporary memorization from your spellbook.  It is
unclear how spells are gained, but the majority will likely come from 
training with your guildmaster after each level gain.  I also speculate that
some spells will be earned from completing various quests.  This is a standard
magic system that has been tried and true for many games in the past.  I'm
sure that there will be plenty of surprises, though.

The magic system in Asheron's Call is as much of a joke as its combat system.  
It is a recipe system, where mages spend a significant amount of time sitting 
around with lots of spell components mixing and testing, mixing and testing.  
If the mage gets lucky, she could discover a brand new and powerful spell that
no one else knows.  Apparently there is a system to the madness, where a
particular ingredient is always associated with Fire, for example, which could
help in figuring out the spells.  It is the developers' hope that mages will 
keep their findings secret, since they are more powerful if they are the only 
one with a particular spell.

This obviously has a lot of problems.  For one, it's boring as hell.  
Two, all combinations will be put on someone's web page eventually.  
There is no getting around it.  Someone will be wanting those hits, whether
for advertising dollars or even just to crank up their hit counter for an 
ego boost.  The information could also show up in a hint book, where they 
care more about sales than they do about their character's power.  Thirdly, 
what happens when they add new spells?  Mages get to sit around trying all 
the same combinations again, to see if maybe it makes something this time 
around.  Did I mention it was boring as hell?
