The Ogre’s hold the lands near Oggok with tribal ferocity, killing anyone whom
trespasses on their lands. The mountains have been found rich with ore, and this
leads to the constant fighting in the borderlands with humans and Ogres. The humans
may have been miners, adventurers or serious war parties out to kill Ogres for the
sake of territory.

In this highly possible scenario the Ogres have a few advantages, both only in
theory and most likely in fact. If you take the given NPC Ogre brawler spawn as moot
point and instead look to the advantages EverQuest brings "having home turf."
Assuming that there are bank boxes in Oggok for Ogres to use, I doubt humans or
allied human adventurers would be able to use the same bank box, let alone enter
the city safely. I also imagine that Oggok would be the prime "home point" for Ogres
who die. Thus, Ogres who die in their own stomping grounds would be back in the fight
relatively soon compared to humans who died and were sent back to Freeport or Qeynos.
Worse would be the fate of non-humans with more distant return points for death.

Now I assume that any group worth the invasion into Ogre lands would have a common
return point and plan ahead with backup gear in good places, which would be a welcome
addition to larger group combat tactics. Of course we don’t know just how big of an
effect bank boxes might have on the game, since they might be coins only and in
limited cities, all has yet to be determined since it will be tested in beta.
