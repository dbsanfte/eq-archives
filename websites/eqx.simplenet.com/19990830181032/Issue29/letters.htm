Well, seems my letter has caused quite a little commotion on the EverQuest
front. I feel that I have to apologise for the sort of immature air that
hovered about it, as I had written it after a particularly nasty incident
and I had never thought (or intended) that it would be published.
<br><br>
Secondly, I have been very pleased with the response when I came back to
#EverQuest and was confronted about it. Although one op who shall again stay
nameless was less than kind about it, Soltan, BlkStaff, and the majority of
the other ops were quite willing to hear me out, and held no grudges.
<br><br>
The previous letter was aimed more at the same op that I mentioned above,
and I still stick by my opinion that op status shouldn't be granted to
him/her. When he/she is in the room, some of the other ops that were
otherwise very nice (out of a lack of a better word) almost instantly turn
cynical, abusive and rude.
<br><br>
As for the others I mentioned, again I state that a nasty incident had
occured just prior and I needed a vent for my anger -- those names just
popped into my head.
<br><br>
I thank the majority of the ops for their understanding, and the regulars
who make it a fun place to visit... most of the time ;)

<em>[Ed: I have to say that I need to be more careful about the letters I publish.
I do not want EQX to become a place for readers to air their greivances, except as
regards this publication and me.  So I want to appologize for publishing the first letter
and starting this whole mess.  In fact, I should not even publish this letter, as it
is not a particularly good appology itself.  But I felt the need to complete this thing.
Consider it finished.]</em>
