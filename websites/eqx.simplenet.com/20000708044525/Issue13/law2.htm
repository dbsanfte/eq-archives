	3)  The defendants claimed that the problems in 1 and 2 above would be corrected.  The plaintiffs say that they have not fixed this.
<br><br>
Well, I’m not sure on this.  Again, never played.  But I think I know what the plaintiffs will use as their argument here.  They will say that Origin lied about fixing these problems to keep people from canceling their subscriptions.  They will say that these lies, at first, were believable enough to convince people to pay one more month.  Again, if this has (or has not) happened to you, send me some facts.
<br><br>

4)  The defendants represented that Ultima Online did not require a $10 monthly fee.  Obviously it does.
<br><br>
Geez.  Not even I believe this one.  In the text of the legal documents they list text from the UO box.  "A monthly service charge is applicable after your free trial period ends."  Ummm…  the ONLY thing I can think of is that they are claiming that not listing the actual dollar amount is some sort of false advertising.  No way, no how.  Sorry.

5)  The defendants indicated that there would not be a credit card required to play.  The plaintiffs say it is.
<br><br>
Well, I know nothing of this either.  Again, send me some facts so that I can be enlightened.
<br><br>

6)  The defendants listed minimum computer requirements to play the game.  The plaintiffs say that computers meeting these requirements are not always capable of running the game.
<br><br>
Interesting.  If your machine meets the minimum requirements, but won’t run UO, let me know.
<br><br>

7)  I think this one is that the defendants attempted to limit the plaintiffs legal rights as regards warranties.
<br><br>
All I know of this are rumors.  But I read some folks claiming that they were not allowed to return opened UO boxes.  Let me know.

Please help me to gain the facts here.  I think we all want to know.  I don’t want to do a poll.  Do not send me any "This lawsuit sucks!" mail.  Don’t send me any "UO sucks and they need to be sued!" mail.

As to how this affects EQ and the rest of the gaming industry, well we don’t know yet.  It could make game companies gun shy.  They may become reluctant to produce games that might advance the industry for fear of failure and legal action.  It may make those companies more careful about producing a less than acceptable product.  We may see a flood of such suits regarding the game industry.
<br><br>
And we may not.
