	"Oghma?"  "Oghma!"  "C’mon Ogh, wake up!"  I awoke to a familiar voice, then realized that the broken figure in front of me was Arthedain.
<br><br>
	"Arth?", I gasped.  "Arth, it’s you, oh sweet Brell, what happened to you?  Is that Amlaith, I can’t even recognize him, what happened?"
<br><br>
	Arthedain closed his eyes in pain.  "You lied to me, Oghma, it wasn’t supposed to be like this."
<br><br>
	Stricken, I could only nod in response.
<br><br>
	"We fought like we were supposed to, we didn’t make any mistakes, they wouldn’t let us die cleanly, they kept hurting me and hurting ‘Laith and hurting me and hurting ‘Laith until I didn’t know who was being hurt any more, it was like a knife in my heart every scream that came from ‘Laith’s throat.  YOU LIED, YOU BASTARD DWARF!"  This last phrase came out like a scream, but his torn lips and ravaged throat couldn’t sustain any more and his great heart had given out.  He had nothing left in him but his anger, and that was only enough to keep him breathing.  "Honor towards thy foes, is that what you said?  There was no honor there,  we fought bravely, and they didn’t honor us for it, and now Amlaith will never see again."

Arthedain fell quiet, his breath coming in hoarse, ripping gasps.  His arm twitched, the arm that must have been bound then torn free.  Laid bare to my sight were the tendons and thews of that once mighty arm.  I looked for a place to lay a comforting hand, a place that would not cause any more pain.  I took the rag soaked in healing herbs and wrung it out, and placed it gently on his forehead.
<br><br>
	For a while the room fell silent, as I thought about what had happened, and what was happening in the mighty heart that gave so selflessly.  Words flashed through my head, trying out combinations of meaning, of nuance.  Then I shut my eyes and threw all those words away.
<br><br>
	"Arthedain, you are the greatest human I have ever known. War is not the songs I sing nor the stories I tell.  War is about fear, and hatred, and brutality, and there are only few shining moments when it becomes transcendent, a monument to the spirit.  I should have told you about the moments when it’s not honorable, the moments when the fear of battle sets your bowels quaking, the moments when you are crippled for life by a foe so superior to you in ability that you never stood a chance.  I was wrong not to have told you of these things.  I tell only the stories I think you should hear, or the stories you beg to be told.  I told you, Arthedain, these stories because I saw in you a power, a fierce desire for good.  As you grew older, you never ceased to amaze me, and in my arrogance I though that I had been the one to point you on your path.

"Honor is not a gift you give to your foes.  It is not the grace of mercy, nor the leveling of a playing field.  Honor is a gift to yourself, for it is the act of honor that gives us our goodness with which we can withstand evil.  Honor is the alabaster pillar of your soul, and you have the highest, straightest, and strongest pillar I have ever seen."
<br><br>
	"I will do everything in my power to see that you and Amlaith are fully healed.  Your path from there is yours to choose.  I will not try to influence you in any way."
<br><br>
	I left the room then, and rode all day and all night to the clerics of Rivervale and found Lord Ayrent De'Vryce, a cleric in Fraterni Lux.  I begged him to heal the two warriors who had risked all so others could be safe.  He left that morning for Redtree to see that all would be done for them.
<br><br>
I haven’t seen Arthedain since, but I hope to hear news of him.
