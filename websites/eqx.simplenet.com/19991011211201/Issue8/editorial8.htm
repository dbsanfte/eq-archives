<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 8!</font></p>
<p align="justify">I wish Kit could see us now!  Things are really taking off here at EQX. 
I am proud of our staff, they do good work!
<br><br>
I wanted to say that I am grateful to Brad for responding to my alarmist article last issue. I have 
my faith back now.  Thanks a bunch Brad.  Now where's our game, dangit!
<br><br>
I am starting to get the pre-beta itch again.  I have no idea what happened with me on the 
first.  I missed the IRC chat because I mis-remembered the time.  I show up just in time to 
hear Brad say that he is only taking two more questions.  D'oh!
<br><br>
Darn it, I just don't have anything to rant about this week.  I guess I'll just shut up then.  ;)
<br><br>
Thanks for reading.
