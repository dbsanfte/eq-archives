The different areas in EQ, they seem to have been added just so they would have one of each (jungle, Mts etc)  Do these need a history? (I think each region should have its own past..) Are the players up to it(making up the history, if brad and his 'crew' does not)? can they add more to the region then just its name and thats its a jungle with temples in it, etc...? In other words...make this one about role-playing, particularly about regions :)</em>

This question was replied to in <a href="../Issue37/expressions.htm">Issue 37</a> by <a href="../credits/keafa.htm">Keafa</a>, but I'd like to revisit some things about it.
<br><br>
Thanks for your question, Sutam, and the chance to talk about my favorite topic (well, ok, I have a lot of favorites :) - the creation of Norrath's history and the interaction players can have with it.  This question was one I actually asked at one of the monthly chats ages ago, and I followed it up with more pertinent ones in the chats and on the message boards.
<br><br>
EverQuest will ship with a fully developed history.  All the races and areas will be fully detailed, so that there is a cohesive history of Norrath when you start.  This means that we'll all have some nice reading to do at ship, and we will have a background with which to weave the tapestry of Norrath.
<br><br>
Racial interactions will be explained, the histories of the cities and their interactions with the surrounding evil or good monsters will be a part of this.  I hope that some of it will be things we can learn from NPC's and some of it things we can learn from text history somewhere, whether it's a book with the box or a text file on the CD.  It's more fun sometimes to learn things in-game.
<br><br>
After this published history, though, comes OUR history.  One thing I asked Brad was if there will be the ability to make books in-game.  I was hoping that we could have something like this, so I could publish as Oghma in-game.  I think it would be very cool to have players pick up "Oghma's book of bardic lore", "The Ballad of Stump", or even something like "The secrets of Paw revealed, by Oghma".  I would like this kind of information only available in-game, and not on some web site.  While I know that there will be "spoiler" sites all over, those of you who like role-playing more, I think, would like to be able to have that same information available in game, where their characters would find it.  After all, that's where your characters would find it.  In the Library in Erudin, for example, or maybe some place in Qeynos or Freeport. In answer to my question, Brad said that there won't be "books" per se, but there will be something like that and he thinks that we will be pleased with it.  I hope it is something very similar, because it would add a lot to have a character tell another character "Hey, I got a copy of Oghma's "Flora and Fauna of Qeynos Hills", lets go there now!"
<br><br>
989 also intends to have quests and ongoing player events, which will further develop the official history of Norrath.   Players who participate can and should write down their adventures.  This community is blessed with a lot of motivated writers, and those best able to chronicle their adventures can certainly add to the Norrath experience.  Those adventures will be packed with adventuring information also, in a narrative form.  Reading about how one character made the Qeynos to Freeport run to get to a quest in Freeport should hold valuable information for anyone wishing to take that trip - the monsters encountered and how they were avoided.  For another example, with racial communities, it would be interesting to see how dark elves react to dwarves in a book "Heart of Darkness - a dwarf's account of his adventures in Neriak". :)
<br><br>
When I played UO, I made the attempt to read the history and use it in my playing, but it was difficult enough running from predatory players that it soured the experience for me.  Norrath will be different, and I hope to learn and create history for myself and others to enjoy.
