"By Bristlebane, this place reeks" muttered the rogue as he shifted on his
lofty perch, the stench of death, decay, and defilement permeating the dank
air. "Ozy will pay extra for this one, for sure." Kendrick adjusted his
gear and shifted forward a bit to get a better view of the happenings
beneath him. In the darkest of the dark places in all of Norrath, three figures
convened below him.
<br><br>
The largest of the three knelt at the edge of a dais, trembling in terror.
The other two, though not brothers, bore a marked semblance to one another.
The taller, clad in dark red robes the color of stagnant blood and inscribed
with arcane runes, paced back and forth agitatedly. The other, wearing an
ornate, flowing black robe, stood by with a detached expression on his dark
face.
<br><br>
Vashaar turned and faced the Orc messenger, his face beautiful even in rage,
and spoke slowly and quietly in Orcish. "So you failed me? You failed to
capture her?"
<br><br>
The Orc winced as if struck and nodded cautiously. "Yes, Favored one. We did
not know we would find her so soon. We were not ready."
<br><br>
"You know the price of failure," Vashaar said, and nodded to the black-robed
necromancer. Aezar nodded slightly in acknowledgement, his face assuming a
cruel smile as his hands began tracing ornate designs in the air. The Orc,
clearly terrified, staggered to his feet and made as if to flee. Dark
tendrils coalesced around the Orc and engulfed him, swallowing him and his
screams whole. The screams trailed off, the darkness dissipated, and the Orc
was no more.
<br><br>
The wizard stood facing the mural of Innoruuk, his 'Father', that filled a
wall in his Sanctum. "Your Orcs are pathetic, Aezar. A simple task they are
given, and they fail."
<br><br>
Aezar nodded sagely. "They certainly are, but if I had not dispatched them
to look, you would not know where your 'bride to be' is. The loss was
minimal, and you have the upper hand again, my 'Lord'".
<br><br>
Vashaar whirled to face the necromancer, sensing insult in his tone. "Your
initiative is admirable. I know you always have my best interests in mind
when you act without my knowledge or counsel. Do you know why I know this,
Aezar?"
<br><br>
The necromancer straightened his posture and bowed "Because you are the
favored of Innoruuk, the One that was prophesied, the One who will lead us
all into the Loathsome Age".
<br><br>
"And because my zealots would rend you of all your internal organs should
they believe you wish to betray me. Do not forget that." The wizard smiled
ferally, white teeth gleaming in his beautiful, indigo face.
<br><br>
Aezar nodded once, slowly. "Yes, there is that as well. So, now that we know
where she is, we should move against Kelethin immediately and seize her."
<br><br>
"No, that would not be the wisest course of action." Vashaar turned and
walked to a table, picked up his goblet and drank deeply from the scarlet
wine within. Setting it down, he turned toward his associate. "Tunare is
strong there, too strong for us now. And that meddlesome Erudite is
involved, which...complicates things."
<br><br>
"Tunare and her children are fools. We should crush them in the righteous
wrath of our Father. And I think you overestimate Ozymandius to fear him
so." Aezar maintained his stony countenance, knowing full well what he had
implied.
<br><br>
Vashaar stalked towards the necromancer, his eyes glowing with intensity.
"I. FEAR. NO ONE." Inches from Aezar's face, his expression daring the
necromancer to question him.
<br><br>
The necromancer nodded silently, his expression unchanging.
<br><br>
"Only a fool would underestimate Ozymandius. He can still thwart the
prophecy, even though he knows only a small portion of it."
<br><br>
"And that is my point," replied Aezar calmly. "He is running around like a
froglok on fire, trying to find clues to the plan that you hold before you,
painted as clear as night in the scriptures. He will never have the entire
picture until it's too late. Your caution is unwarranted."  The necromancer
stepped over to the table and sipped of his own wine, gazing into the
scarlet fluid introspectively.  "We should strike now, while he is still
confused."
<br><br>
Vashaar chuckled and turned to pace again.  "You have not faced him, you do
not know. He may be bumbling, but he is also frequently lucky and not
someone we should dismiss lightly. No, we must get him out of the way."  The
wizard paused before the table, gazing down at the map spread out upon it.
Reaching out, he touched a point with a delicate finger.
<br><br>
Kendrick quickly pulled out his spy glass and put it to his eye, trying to
get a clear view of the location indicated.
<br><br>
"I will contact Varsoon in Qeynos. Bayle does not have enough to do and I
feel his enemies should arise from the ruins and wreak vengeance upon him
and his people." Vashaar chuckled again. "The price is of little import to
Varsoon-he will assist us in this willingly."
<br><br>
Aezar walked over to the map and glanced down at it.  "I know a group of
Trolls that would like to teach the humans of Freeport a lesson or two.
Perhaps they can be coaxed into action...with the proper incentives, of
course."
<br><br>
The pair continued discussing the map, laying out plans to inflict havoc
about the world and further the cause of hate.  Kendrick committed each plan
to memory, barely breathing and concentrating all his energy on being
non-existent.
<br><br>
Aezar nodded, "I see.  Not only will you keep Ozymandius and his cronies
confused, you will also make every place in the world less safe than
Kelethin, forcing him to keep her there to keep her 'safe'. Truly ingenious,
my Lord.  Shall I then go oversee the Orcs in their preparations?"
<br><br>
Vashaar turned and smiled, though there was no trace of happiness in it. "Of
course.  And on the way, you will visit Mistmoore."
<br><br>
The necromancer's ever-present composure cracked, showing his discomfort at
the thought. Then it snapped back quickly into place. "Mistmoore, my Lord?"
<br><br>
"It is the only haven of Teir'dal on Faydwer, and we will need them when the
time comes. You are to go and negotiate with the Lord of Mistmoore and find
his price to aid us." Vashaar continued to gaze upon his servant,
his expression slightly mocking.
<br><br>
Aezar's eyes spoke volumes, but he only nodded. "Of course, my Lord. I live
to serve."
<br><br>
Vashaar waved his hand and turned back to his table. "Leave me now."
<br><br>
Aezar bowed again and turned to exit, leaving Vashaar deep in thought.
After a few moments, he gestured for a guard to come to him.  The guard
walked quickly to the wizard's side, standing at attention.
<br><br>
"Fetch Daedeloth for me"
<br><br>
The guard quickly left.  Vashaar continued his scrutiny of the map when a
tall, slender Teir'dal entered the room, pausing at the door to bow.  "You
summoned me, Favoured One?"
<br><br>
"Yes, Daedeloth.  I need you to take care of something for me."  The wizard
turned to the table, picked up a pen, and scribbled out a note.  Picking it
up and handing it to the necromancer, he said, "Have this delivered to
Varsoon, and begin making your way there.  Varsoon will have need of you."
<br><br>
Daedeloth took the message, bowed again, and withdrew from the sanctum.
Vashaar returned his attention to his table.
<br><br>
Kendrick remained very still as Vashaar stood and gazed down at the map. The
wizard nodded to himself, as if answering some inner query, then turned and
exited his sanctum. Kendrick waited the span of 60 heartbeats, straining his
ears such that he could almost hear water condensing on the stalactites near
him, then slowly began lowering himself down on his rope like a half-elven
spider.
<br><br>
Hanging upside down, slowly and silently sliding down into the room, he came
in reach of the table. Mentally checking his notes with those on the map, he
spotted a tome on the table. Not understanding the text within, but
sensing it's importance, he carefully reached out, closed it, and slipped
into his specially designed pack. Then, just as carefully, he began to
ascend the rope, making no more noise going up than he did coming down.
<br><br>
Once he reached the top, he began his horizontal trek across the ceiling,
back to the air shaft he slipped in through. Ozymandius had insisted that
there was no way for any non-Teir'dal to enter the Third Gate of Neriak,
much less the sanctum of Vashaar himself. Kendrick chuckled to himself,
remembering his boast "If air can get in, I can get in."
<br><br>
The departure was being far more difficult than the entrance, as he had
gravity to assist him before. Having to hold his breath for minutes at a
time, squeezing through passages no larger than his head, and dragging his
pack behind him on a lead, he made his slow, careful way from the warrens
and out into the forests of Nektulos. Gazing about quickly, he slipped down
the hillside and began his long journey to Freeport, mentally counting the
fortune he would squeeze from Ozymandius for the information he recovered.
<br><br>
Kendrick chuckled quietly. "Hmm...with this much money, I might even be able
to afford that blonde wench in High Hold." Smiling broadly, he jogged off
into the darkness.
<br><br>
<hr color="black"><p style="text-align: justify">

Aezar quietly made his way to his chambers, only the rustling of his robes
marking his passage. The iron bound door opened ahead of him silently, as of
its own volition, and closed again behind him as he entered.
<br><br>
Crossing the room to his work table, he knelt before it and lifted a flag
stone from the floor beneath. Within the hole he uncovered was as small
wooden box, inscribed on all sides by ornate runes and markings that he had
never managed to translate.
<br><br>
Lifting the box carefully, he stood and set it upon the table. His fingers
ran along the top and sides delicately, as if caressing a lover, then his
thumbs flicked the catch and lifted the lit.
<br><br>
The contents of the box radiated the purest of all evils. Dark smoky
tendrils crept from within, crawling about the necromancer's arms like
serpents as he shuddered slightly in macabre pleasure. His hands reached
into the box and
gently lifted the contents: a small vial in the shape of a demon's skull,
the mouth holding the stopper to keep the liquid within. Gazing into the
eyes of the skull, Aezar could see the oily black fluid moving within,
seeking escape.
<br><br>
"Soon, my love. Soon you will find escape. Soon Innoruuk will know who his
favored one really is. And soon Vashaar will know pain beyond his wildest
nightmares." Aezar stared into the dark light from the vial, his eyes
showing little resembling sanity.
