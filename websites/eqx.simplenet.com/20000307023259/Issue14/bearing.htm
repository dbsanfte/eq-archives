Well, first off I want to thank all of you that told me of their experiences with Ultima Online as it relates to the issues of the lawsuit.  I am grateful to you all for helping me out with this.
<br><br>
I suspect that the only way to do this is to list the complaints again, and add your responses.  And, of course, my comments.  There is no way that I can include all the responses, so I will use the ones that are representative.  I also want to be clear that those that responded to my article are certainly not a fair representation of the general population of UO players.  So it’s obvious that the responses will be skewed, and this would never get me college credit in a statistics class.

1)  The defendants claimed that the game would be playable "24 hours a day, everyday".  The plaintiffs say that it cannot due to frequent server crashes.
<br><br>
Most of you had something to say about this one.  For example:
<br><br>
<em>As for not being able to play 24 hours a day 7 days a week, this claim
is bogus as well. What the document should have stated is that you are
not able to play on a given shard of your choice 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week. It is very very very rare that all shards are inoperative at
once so a player can still play, just not with his usual character.
While this may be frustrating, it in no way violates any of your
rights.</em>

<em>(Sorry to have sounded like a OSI rep in that last paragraph. I hate it
when my regular shard is down, but I can still play on any of the
others. I would be willing to bet that OSI/EA uses a similar argument
as I did).
<br><br>
Each shard undergoes weekly maintenance, but will often crash at
unscheduled time as well. My main shard crashes usually at least 3 time
a day (it is one of the worst ones). Before (around XMAS) it crashed
upwards of a dozen times a day.
