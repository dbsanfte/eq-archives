In regard to Ians <a href="../Issue13/balance.htm">article</a> from Issue 13:
<br><br>
Ian Ash makes some very good points in his article entitled "Keeping 
Balance with Shifting Weights," however I feel that I must comment. UO did 
indeed "pound in the posts," but in a negative way. We, as  beta testers, 
were very rarely listened to. I know that I routinely filed page long bug 
reports with possible reasons and solutions - all of which seem to have 
been ignored. There were and are numerous posts on the various sites about 
ways to improve on UO's problems, yet OSI still believes that they are the 
only ones that know what is right. If OSI had actually listened to, and 
acted on, the suggestions of its beta testers, they would not be having the 
problems that they now face.
<br><br>
I only hope that Sony has listened and has learned, because Origin has 
clearly become blind, deaf and dumb.

There has been a lot of talk about PKilling and the no-PKill choice that will be included in EQ. I think that this is a good idea in theory(so was communisim), but I see several draw backs right now. If you look at 11.3.1 in the faq it says that a non-PKill can become a PK just by healing a PK when the PK is attacking a monster. I can predict guilds being no PK and people refusing to go adventuring with a PK because they don't want to become PK.
<br><br>
Also it is my opinion that guild spying could be a problem in EQ. Example: Bob is in guild A and guild A is at war with guild B. Then Bob creates a new character and joins guild A with that character. He then tells guild A information about guild B like: guild meeting times, hide outs, or treasure locations. This would result in the down fall of guild B due to robberies or ambushes by guild A.

<em>[Ed: Hi all.  I just wanted to let you know that I received many letters in response to
my article about the lawsuit against Origin.  There were too many to include them all, and
not nearly enough room here.  So I wrote a second article.  Look for my article
<a href="bearing.htm">Bearing Witness</a> to read some of the responses.</em>
