Just wanted to drop yall a short note: Have been reading your site extensively, and Archanalia is incredible.  He is very talented in writing and I love to read his stuff (and i hate reading :-)  Very creative, to the point, and concise.  Went to college for just a bit, and one piece i read in English Comp that stuck in my head was one written by Orwell: it was all about junking $5 dollar words, and writing, rather than impressing.  Ole Arch has a handle on that, and an ability entertain and keep ya interested.  Just wanted ya to know I think he is great.

<em>[Ed:  Archanalia threatened to kill me if I didn't post this one.  :)  Actually, what can
I say, I agree with Arcan on this one.  I also wanted to thank Arcan for suggesting the more informative
pop-ups on the issue buttons off the newsstand (as if that made any sense).]</em>

Response to Oghmas article in Issue 13, <a href="../Issue13/religion.htm">Roleplaying Religion</a>:
<br><br>
<em>'Actual heroes have had conversations with these entities.'</em>
<br><br>
Yes! well documented, just read the Iliad, even the bible, Act of the
Apostles decribes
that Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes because they were
beleived
to heal a cripple. Note : Biblical critics question this passage. They dont
think it happened, they
cant understand how Paul could be mistaken for Hermes. Was not Hermes
working in Paul helping
him spread his message?
<br><br>
But I think you are confusing Monotheism and Polytheistic. For the Greeks
the Gods were there
and they were all to be worshiped, they all had their days and temples. The
Greeks did not even have 
a word for religon, the Gods were there, can you not see them? It was
worship of the many. They did
have philosophy which dealt with issues that many religions deal with
today, for example what happened
in the afterlife was a philosophical question. Different philosophy's tried
to get as many followers as they 
could.

Monotheism worshiping the one. Lots of examples of this today. 
<br><br>
So where does this fit into a online rpg? Well in most RPG's you get your
power from 1 God. I am a follower
of Yam, he gives me power and followers of other Gods must be destroyed.
Sounds like Monotheism to me?
Or I am a Druid, I worship the Sun and the Wind and the Rain and the Earth
even the Rocks perhaps. Polytheistic?
Or I am theif, When I steal I say a prayer to the god of trickery, when I
am going throu' the land of the undead
I say a prayer to the God of the underworld asking him for safe passage
throu' his domain. This is unlikely
to work in the game.
<br><br>
Note : About the Greek stuff, I am not computer programer, that is just my
understanding.
<br><br>
Keep up the good work, and good luck with the Beta,
<br><br>
