Comment on Straylight Saga
<br><br>
<em>Ed. - I wasn't going to include this letter because it really doesn't do enough to explain what's going on. I've heard rumors about this, and that's all. But I get a bit concerned when someone is more concerned about the 'script' of their roleplaying than they are with the evolution of the characters. I'm not condoning whatever it was that happened. But I would like to think that a real roleplayer is not interested in a script, that's what actors are for... Absor; </em>
<br><br>
Your reply to Leexa regarding the her post of the difficulties encountered with her Straylight Saga surprises me. Though not involved in the saga myself, I was impressed with the initiative and effort that I have seen go on around it. In a game that is mostly devoted to Hack-n-Slash gaming, ala early adolescent AD&D dungeon bashing sessions, it is very difficult to have a story line take place without this limitation imposing itself. 
<br><br>
I thought your response rather high-handed and lacking in any sort of empathy for the difficulties the group is encountering with the practice of Verant when it comes to their so called events. You know as well as the rest of us who have been around for a while, the GM sponsored events <em><I>are</em></I> indeed nothing more than power-gamer events, slated towards high level characters and once more, centering around hacking and slashing your way to a goal. 
<br><br>
I also found it somewhat hypocritical of you to on one hand say you haven't heard much in the way of details, and then accuse the player of being more interested in a script and therefore being worthy of the title of actor rather than roleplayer. If her interest in seeing the integrity of the storyline she's involved in being preserved, marks her as an actor instead of a roleplayer, then so too is every GM and player who has ever picked up a printed adventure module and ran with what the author wrote. 
<br><br>
Character evolution and roleplaying do occur outside of storylines, that much is true. But that doesn't mean one should trash a storyline at an outsiders whim. In this particular case, it would be very similiar to if you were to be running your weekly game in the back of your local hobby store (many hobby stores I've been to have a back room devoted towards letting their patrons run games there), and then having the store owner come in and state some change in your campaign with but scant acknowledgement of the direction and components of your campaign. Granted, I realize that the best option with this analogy is for the GM and his group to relocate somewhere privately, but in EQ we don't have that option. 
<br><br>
You are obviously a expierenced roleplayer and GM, and I have often respected your various articles for the thought and content behind them. But your above response indicates to me that you have let hubris and arrogance color your perceptions, making you dismissive of the problems rather than doing a little digging and getting some details. If you had bothered to do some research and discovered some details that would indeed have marked Leexa blindly devoted to a script, then it would've been justified to claim she was being more of an actress than a roleplayer. As it is, you grunt and pass judgement on her and all the players involved with the Saga without bothering to learn any details. You need to take a step back and a step down when reading letters like that, and do a little research before you go around labeling people. 

<br><br>
<em>[Ed. - First, let me say that I am sincerely sorry about the tone of my response.  I'll make no excuses for it, and I hope Leexa, the folks involved in the Straylight Saga and our readers can accept my apologies.  You are, of course, correct.  I have become judgmental.  I should have either investigated the circumstances behind the letter, or not printed it at all.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we will ever hear anything from Verant or the GM involved about what happened in this matter.  That will tend to make any discussion about it one-sided.  This leaves me in a difficult position when it comes to letters that take Verant to task about any such incident.  My first impulse is to not print such letters at all.  Other sites do that well enough, and since I can't expect to hear the other side of the tale, it seems wrong to allow commentary about one side of the issue.  However, because I have heard good things about the Straylight folks, I decided to print it anyway.  Now that I have done so, I ask Verant to comment on the matter, if they wish...]</em>

Hello!
<br><br>
Browsing through EQ Express' issue 92 I found a letter that made me
blush instantly. Here's excerpt:
<br><br>
[..] that same night, there was a lvl 5 ranger in our group. He was not
helping us much with kills, but he sure was looting them all. We had to
tell him three times to wait his turn to loot. The message finally
got through when our leader told him to wait his turn or get kicked out
of the group.
<br><br>
That was my character (who wishes to remain anonymous as the blame is on
me, his puppetmaster ;). I looted the first two scrawny gnolls, then
told myself to stop, then when backing from the third I kept the right
mouse button and entered the loot window... I know that it looked awful
from the outside. I just wish that Mary (the author of the above
excerpt) knew that this particular case should be blamed more on my
inexperience with both the Everquest and group hunting than on my lack
of consideration. I hope she'll enjoy playing the game.
<br><br>
[...] at the end of the fight, the ranger was very low on life, so I
laid hands on him. Not a minute later, he left the group!
<br><br>
Here my memory fails me, so I accept full responsibility. Had I known
more, I'd probably behaved better. It shows again how important the
topic of the mentioned article is. I hope we'll meet in Norrath someday,
so my little Ranger will have a chance to repent...
<br><br>
Voytek, the inept Puppetmaster
<br><br>
<em>[Ed. - Add this letter to the last one, and I think we can all see how wrong it is to jump to conclusions.  Raise your hand if you're guilty of assuming the worst of someone based on too little information...  I would raise both of my hands, but I still have some typing to do...]</em>
