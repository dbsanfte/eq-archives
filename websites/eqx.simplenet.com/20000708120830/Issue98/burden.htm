With a resounding clatter the whirlwind crumbled to the ground dispersing all that it had once held firmly in its grasp.  Rocks, loose coins, bone fragments all were cast across the ground.  With a few minutes search I managed to locate the items that were worthwhile.  Amid the few gold and silver coins was a hunk of ore, as yet unrefined, that could be used to make metal, had I the skill to do so.  Regardless, it was worth plenty on the market.
<br><br>
So I picked it up with both hands and dropped it into my bag with a resounding thud.  This was the third piece I'd picked up today, and while they aren't large enough to take up all the room in my bag, they are heavier than one might imagine.  I was lucky the bag didn't rip as I picked it up with considerable effort and set it over my shoulder.  As I began my run back to Freeport it occurred to me that there must be a better way of hauling this stuff around.
<br><br>
It was once said that the Dwarves of Kaladim employed small pack animals in their mining efforts.  Without these animals it would have taken nearly a century longer to carve and clear the caverns that now house the modern city of Kaladim.
<br><br>
They were not the only ones to use pack animals.  In fact, the splitpaw used a great number of pack animals in the clearing of their cavern.  They called these pack animals… Humans!  Slavery was a common practice among the gnolls of both Paw and Blackburrow for many decades.  And presumably that is how they built their homelands.  In fact, when in Faydwer, anyone who goes to Crushbone can discover that to this day the Orcs there still use slaves gathered from the other races of Faydwer.  Dwarves, Halflings, Elves, all can be found working side by side for the betterment of the Crushbone King.
<br><br>
Make no mistake, I do not advocate slavery.  Far from it!  I just find it interesting that so many people over the decades have chosen to forego use of pack animals, and in some cases slaves.  So I did considerable research on the subject, spanning continents when necessary.
<br><br>
First bit of history I learned is that the gnolls on the continent of Antonica had a considerable problem with slavery nearly two centuries ago.  In Blackburrow they were known to use humans from Qeynos and wood elves from Surefall glade, but were often hurt by slave uprisings.  One tale of an uprising in Blackburrow, carved on a storyteller's wall, tells of an uprising that resulted in the death of the king's guardsmen as they were overwhelmed by the hordes of slaves who took their mining picks and used them against their oppressors.  So fewer slaves were used in later expansions of the caves of Blackburrow, but pretty much the same results happened.  In fact, anyone who walks the upper level of Blackburrow today can see the unfinished caverns and the occasional ore cart, both left to decay with time and lack of use.
<br><br>
The splitpaw suffered a stranger fate.  They had to venture into the higher Karanas to take slaves of travelers on the road and from the farmhouses which dot the countryside.  But because of the lack of humans that far out into the wilderness they had to sometimes go all the way to Qeynos hills and barter for slaves from the Sabertooth gnolls of Blackburrow.  The trip was treacherous, as anyone who runs that way will attest  Just picture the same trip minus the guard towers and you get a picture of what they had to endure.
<br><br>
What caused the end of slavery in the Splitpaw however was the great winter.  It's not often that the world gets as cold as it did around one and a half centuries ago, but at that time many of the free animals that roamed the plains died from the cold and vegetation withered.  There was simply no way to sustain both the slaves and the Splitpaw themselves.  They took to eating their human captives.  Note that by all accounts gnolls actually despise the taste of human flesh, but these were desperate times.  And with the slave population depleted, the gnolls never again regained their slaves.  Especially with the advent of the bridge linking South Karana and the posting of guards all about that wilderness.
<br><br>
The dwarven custom of using pack animals was actually dispensed with out of mismanagement, though they deny this.  According to the dwarves all of the pack animals were stricken with a disease and died.  The tale I heard in Felwithe as a child was that the dwarves carelessly expected the animals to work as hard as the dwarves themselves did.  When one animals would fall they would simply replace it.  Eventually they drove the various pack animals they used to extinction.  With that, mining in Kaladim has slowed tremendously.  To this day there is not one four legged animal in Butcherblock that is capable of carrying burdens.
<br><br>
Note that there are races who never used pack animals.  Many of the elven races find it distasteful and even highly disrespectful to use an animal to carry your burden.  They view this as slavery and the disdain for the practice has long prevented anyone, resident or outsider, from using an animal as a beast of burden.
<br><br>
Perhaps the greatest pack animal of all is a tremendous untapped resource, even to this day.  I speak of the Mammoths of the northern reaches.  The barbarians of Halas actually revile anyone who would use these beasts, but do so for the simple reason that they consider them cowardly and weak.  No self-respecting barbarian would use a pack animal; he would be viewed as a weakling by his kind and they fear he would grow weaker from not having to carry his own burden.
<br><br>
There actually is a deeper reason, and it's a simple method of keeping track of the ecology of the region… The idea is that a man should only be able to harvest from the wild only as much as he can carry.  If men caught and tamed Mammoths and then used them to carry more goods, the place would become barren of all manner of life as the barbarians ran through their resources faster than they could replenish.
<br><br>
If one were to look at much of the world they would find that to this day there are few animals capable of sustaining a burden.  It has been argued by religious scholars that the gods have seen to it that this is the case.  They claim that the nature gods have made sure that those beasts that walk Norrath are not capable of carrying much, and therefore this has been their preservation in the world of tool-using humans and other of the upright races.
<br><br>
When I began my study I found it a bit strange that I would actually be researching a non-phenomenon.  That is, the "lack" of something.  But it was obvious that the sentient races had thought of this concept of "beasts of burden" before and their non-use today is what drove me to dig for a deeper reason.
<br><br>
I must advocate the non-use of pack animals today, even as my back becomes stiffer and my hands gather blisters with the weight of my pack.  The reasons are simple; All creatures were put onto Norrath for whatever reason you may prefer to argue, but they were put here together.  They were not put in place for the betterment of one another, but to co-exist.  Because animals are not viewed as "sentient" or thinking we often disregard their well-being, but the practices of our fathers handed down to us have ensured that all of these animals (with the exception of certain pack animals in Butcherblock) still exist today.

So to any who would think that they could increase their worth by using the backs of others to carry their burden, I say to you that a spell of strength goes a long way.  That is how I am getting my burden home.  And no animals were hurt in the making of this article.
