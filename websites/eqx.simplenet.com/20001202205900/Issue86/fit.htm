This editor has been hearing some encouraging news lately.
<br><br>
It seems that the conflict between our brave Norrathian adventures and the bird-like Aviaks of the Karanas may be at an end.  A few of our bravest, most glib heroes made their way into the heart of the city of the Aviaks in order to negotiate peace.  They brought with them many gifts and trinkets in the hope that they would not be attacked on sight, not a unreasonable reaction considering the assaults that the Aviaks have endured at the hands of Humans over the last several months.  The gifts, mostly shiny metallic and jewelry items, seem to have given these heroes an advantage.

<em>Here Magykmyke is seen in a friendly pose while his companion, bard and artist Ridian paints them.</em>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Negotiations went well.  Last report has it that the adventurers have promised that they and their kind will cease attacks on the bird-men if they, in turn promise to open up access to some of the sacred and secret areas that they have been guarding for centuries.
<br><br>

<br>
<em>This time Ridian gets an Aviak to 'hold the canvas' and paint him in the picture as well.</em>
<p style="text-align: justify">
But as a reporter, and a seeker of truth (not the devout kind, just regular ol' truth, with a lower case <b>t</b>), I have to tell you of my suspicions.
<br><br>
As a bard myself, I am somewhat familiar with the songs that we sing, you know, the kinds with magical powers.  Not in the pictures above that the one drawn by the bard Ridian shows no 'effects' of any sort.  In this painting there are no songs being sung...  a nice touch.  Because note in the second painting, the one painted by the Aviak, that there are, indeed, magics in use.  The Aviak was unaware, unlike Ridian, that an astute observer might recognize the energies of a song like that, so he painted them in.
<br><br>
Now Ridian is a fellow Antonican Bard, and it would be wrong for me to speculate further.  Let us just say that the effect that I see in that painting is certainly NOT one created by the swift Selo, and that it seems to be more like the type that the seductive Kelin.
<br><br>
I anticipate that the fighting will be as brisk as ever, once the birds realize what has happened...
