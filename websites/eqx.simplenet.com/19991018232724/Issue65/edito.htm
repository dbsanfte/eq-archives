<b>On beating EverQuest</b>
<br><br>
One of the many goals that people will have when they enter Norrath for the first time is to "beat" the game.  Diablo could be "beaten", Baldur's Gate could be "beaten", but can EQ ever truly be beaten?  How do you "win" an online world?
<br><br>
When I describe role-playing games to people who are unfamiliar with them, that is a common question.  "How can you win in D&D?"  "What's the point?" It is a difficult answer if you try to answer it within the context of a game, but an easy answer if you answer it from the character's point of view.
<br><br>
"Why do you go to work every day?"  I ask.  It's the same thing for your character.  We, in real life, are striving for many goals - power, success, financial security, love, or happiness.  Our characters have many varied goals.   Perhaps they are striving to be the first to level 50.  Perhaps you are trying to be the leader of a powerful guild, or looking for a group of buddies to play with.  Maybe you'll encounter the elf of your dreams, and get married. What is, to a character, the equivalent of a Ferrari?  Perhaps those magic boots, giving them the speed to outrun their enemies?
<br><br>
What is a role-playing game?  I get that question in response to the "how do you win" question.  While there are endless definitions, the one that I use that gives more insight into the process to the uninitiated is this: Role-playing games are shared storytelling with rules.  We are all looking for an experience that makes us look back, and say "wow".  Something we can share with our companions, boast about, or just feel quiet pride about.  EQ does us the favor of dispensing with the Dungeon Master, and lets us bring him along for the adventure.  It also allows us to play with 1500 others at the same time, something my porch wouldn't be able to do.
<br><br>
We all enter Norrath to escape, and to succeed in a world where the rules are perhaps less arbitrary and a bit fairer than our real life challenges.  (Was it a bug when my tire blew out on the interstate last week?) We are often able to succeed, and succeed remarkably, and can take the devotion and dedication to a goal back out to our real life.  In a way, the role-playing games allow us to fail, without the repercussions that real life will give us.  This is our proving ground as individuals.
<br><br>
As a proving ground, it offers some pitfalls, also.  This is easily the most immersive game I have ever played.  Our in-game goals can become too important, and over-shadow our real-life needs or goals.  It also offers us an arena for bad behavior, whose impact is not felt by us but by everyone around us.  Some of life's lessons are not often well taught on-line, and I am cheered to see players banned for abusive behavior as a lesson in some perhaps real-life consequences.  Good bye, and good riddance.  I hope when you gave Norrath your venom, you got rid of it, and don't take it into your real life.
<br><br>
That being said, how can you "beat" something almost as varied and multifaceted as real life?  I don't think you can.  You are surely able to set goals, and achieve them. You are able to then pick other goals, and continue with that character, or start another character with a whole new set of goals.  The game will evolve, so there won't be a time when you just know everything.  Heck, I'll bet there isn't a designer at Verant that knows everything that is in the game now.  This game will truly be Ever Quest.
<br><br>
I took part in last night's events, when Innoruuk was attacked by Mithaniel and Fizzlethorpe, and had a blast.  I understand that there were concurrent events running, a Blackburrow assault on Qeynos, a Crushbone assault on the Greater Faydark and maybe some others with the ogres and Cazic Thule?  I can't wait to see these events become a regular thing, instead of a thing done to celebrate the end of the beta test.  Now that Verant won't be writing the game as hard, we should have more events like this.  I hit Innoruuk for over 300 points of damage! Whooooo!  Then he pasted me. Ouch.  Next time, I'll pick on someone my own size.
<br><br>
I'm sure I'll run across many of you in Norrath.  I hope you had as much fun in beta as I did, and continue to have fun in final.  There are a lot of stories to create.
<br><br>
Here's to your story: may it be written large across the history of Norrath.
