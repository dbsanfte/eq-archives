	Once upon a time...what an odd way to start a story.  Stories happen, sometimes more than once to more than one person or set of persons... and certainly ALL stories happen "upon a time".  Be that as it may, THIS story happened, and it happened not too very long ago as once-upon-a-time's go.  This is a love story, full of intrigue and drama, heartbreak and happiness, and is yet to be resolved.  This is the long awaited, and asked for, story of t'Ceira and Darvinn called "Wrath" and this is how it happened.
<br><br>
<hr color="brown">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	The girl known only as t'Ceira waited just outside the light, blending with the darkness of the shadow.  Her purple eyes slitted to watch closely as her prey crossed the room and settled in the chair.  Her dagger held low and flattened behind her so as not to catch and reflect a trace of the firelight flickering from the hearth.
<br><br>
	"Wha' kin I get fer ya?"  The bored serving wench asked of the darkly brooding man sitting at the table.
<br><br>
	"Ale, stew, and privacy."  His gravely voice sounded irritated and tired  to t'Ceira's experienced ears.
<br><br>
	Softly she slipped up behind him keeping half an eye on the retreating back of the wench and the room in general, leaving most of her concentration on the bulging pouch dangling from the saddlebag sitting on the table.  Her movements were slow and precise as she deftly slit the leather holding the pouch to the bag and smoothly flowing back to become one with the shadows again.  <em>I'm not out of this yet</em>--she thought to herself as she calmed her quickened breathing and racing heart to something a bit more quiet and began the long trek to front door.  She made it just in the nick of time and slipped out behind and entering customer, none the wiser, just before she heard the man bellow "I'VE BEEN ROBBED!!!!"  Breaking out into a run and flying under the docks to slip into the secret passageways of the underground tunnels, not stopping until she'd reached her little hovel in the hidden rooms under shanty-town.
<br><br>
	With a huge self-congratulating smile she upended the bag to count her booty, hoping it would be worth the three hours she'd spent in that Inn waiting for someone worth stealing from to come in.  She knew that if she didn't have to coppers she'd be kicked out this time and there was no where else to go.  <em>One day</em>--she daydreamed--<em>I'll go and live in the Nektulos Forest and find others of my kind</em>.  Her smile widened into awe as the silvery coins slipped out...one, two, no, FIVE platinums!!!  Along with a few silver and a LOT of copper!!!  She held a kings ransom in her hands, well at least to her.  This was more money than she'd ever seen.  She'd be able to rent the rambling little shack for at least a year... and eat, boy would she eat!!  Perhaps even pay her way into the guild.  All these thoughts flew through her head as she counted and recounted the coins, tears of joy fell from her cheeks.  She replaced all but the coins she needed to pay the rent and get some food for herself, feeling a bit giddy.  She hadn't been this happy since she was still living with Momma Kinda.  As she pried the stone from the hidey-hole next to the fireplace to hide her treasure, memories of Kindalya floated in her mind.
<br><br>
	Kindalya the Great, Kindalya the Mother, Kindalya of the Mysteries, and many other names were hers, but to t'Ceira she was simply Momma Kinda.  One night the wailing winds brought the sounds of a baby crying to the ears of a Wizard known as Kindalya.  When she went out to investigate she found a darkling little girl, the tiny ears pointed, the softly curling hair silver as the moon, and the velvety soft skin black as the night.  Kindalya, a darkling herself, took the child back to her tower at the edge of the Commonlands and the Ro Desert and raised the baby as her own.  It was easy enough at first to hide that the child was of the dark blood, but as time passed the child's own natural immunity to magic fought off the glamorie spells.  So Kinda taught the child to hide, to move unseen, silently, and always beware the humans.  Kinda named the little one t'Ceira, meaning Daughter of the Night in the language, and loved her as her very own.  She tried to teach t'Ceira the ways of magic, but it just didn't work.  t'Ceira just wasn't meant for magic, but she was very good at slipping into the nearby town of Freeport and getting the supplies they both needed.  She learned at a very early age, well early for the dark ones, of the tunnels running under the city, so getting in and out and moving around was never a problem.  Then, somehow, a band of human swashbucklers discovered Kinda's existence and broke through the magic of the tower.  They ransacked the tower, stealing all the precious things Kinda kept there, dragging her out and doing vile things to her, in the end killing her and their own Wizards blasted the tower until not one stone stood upon the other.  All that was left of t'Ceira's home was a mound of sand... it was gone, all gone.  t'Ceira, herself, would have had to endure the same fate if Kinda had not covered her escape with magic and then distracted the men, telling her to find the forest of the dark ones and seek help for herself there.  Ah!!  The Nektulos Forest and the dark city hidden there!  If she could just get there, she'd be welcomed with open arms, or so her many imaginings told her.  Momma Kinda had taught her all the languages known there and she spoke them as readily as she did the common language of the land, and with this much money, she'd get there for sure!
  <br><br>
	Quickly dusting herself off and counting out the 7 coppers rent she still owed for last month and this month on the hovel, she darted out the door.  Moving with unconscious feline grace she headed upstairs and through the hidden wall to the Keepers room to find Paggie there behind her ever-present table with the lock box next to it.  t'Ceira knew it was suicide to attempt to steal that lock box, she personally knew of two who had tried and the stinking, blackened bodies that were hauled out and dumped into the Ocean were enough warning to her not to try.  
<br><br>
	"Well, t'Ceira, here to make more excuses? Hmmmm??"  Paggie's ugly human face twisted in a sarcastic smile.
<br><br>
	"Nope!"  t'Ceira was happy to see the surprise cross the woman's face, "I found myself some work!"
<br><br>
	The astonishment on Paggie's face was just too much and t'Ceira had to preen a bit to herself.  <em>That's right, you bitch, and now you CAN'T kick me out!</em>  Quickly t'Ceira guarded her thoughts, she'd heard stories of what some human's could do.  She handed over the 7 coppers and waited impatiently as the spiteful woman carefully counted, then weighed, and then test them for reality.
<br><br>
	"Alright then, you can stay.  ONE more month."  Paggie's squishy fat finger shook at t'Ceira, "But, you'd better not be late on the rent again...or out ya goes!"
<br><br>
	Grinning from ear to ear, "No problem, ma'am"  t'Ceira turned and sashayed out through the blind wall and back into the tunnels, heading this time toward the only person she knew that could, and hopefully would, sponsor her into the guild.  Reaching her destination and approaching the Dark Elf woman sitting, seemingly idle in the moonlight, by the beach she quickly moved her fingers in the only words of Thief Cant she knew.  'Friend, supplicant' the fingers spoke to Giz.  t'Ceira knew that somewhere close was a smugglers entrance into the city, and thought that her acquaintance who seemed so 'idle' was really watching for someone to show up, or perhaps was set there as a look out.  Either way, Giz was the only one she knew who just might get her into the guild.  
<br><br>
	"Nice night, huh?" Giz's blue eyes slid over t'Ceira and then back to scanning the Ocean waves.
<br><br>
	"Yep."  t'Ceira settled in the sand next to her friend, "Nice clear night, I'd say.  'Specially if someone wanted to hone their talents.  Maybe hang around with someone who knew how to hone someone's talents."  Trying to be delicate, cryptic, yet not so much that Giz wouldn't understand she stumbled over her words.
<br><br>
	Soft tinkling laughter fell from the other woman's lips, "OK, ok, little flower, I'll sponsor you, but ya've gotta' have the dues!!  How much ya got?"  Blue eyes gazed steadily into lavender.
<br><br>
	Feeling as if this were a test, t'Ceira thought hard, but not a hint of her uncertainty showed in her eyes, "Enough for you to get me in!"  She countered.
<br><br>
	"Ok, you bring 20 gold to this spot tomorrow night and we'll see what I can do."  A crocked grin etched itself on Giz's face, and t'Ceira answered with her own.  They both knew that at least a third of that would find it's way into Giz's pocket and NOT to the Guild Mistress at all.  But, t'Ceira didn't care, she was finally going to get in!  It was with deep elation that t'Ceira left Giz to her duties and found her there again the next night, two of the platinum in hand... converted to silver and gold, of course.
<br><br>
	Giz took her just around the corner and through another door in the tunnels to a human woman....t'Ceira was to learn the woman's name only years later, but for then she was accepted into the Guild of the Underground Merchants!!  And for the next few years trained to hone her already formidable skills to near perfection.  She worked tirelessly and was finally set free by her Masters to test her newly honed skills on the unwary.  So, she found herself in the same shadows, in the same Inn that had given her the opportunity of a lifetime... watching that big oaf of a <em><b>something</em></b> amble into the common room and order Ogre Swill to drink.
<br><br>
	He certainly looked like an Ogre, he was big and clumsy looking, he smelled like an Ogre...but, he wasn't all that ugly...well, not as ugly as these humans she had to deal with on a daily basis.  She'd never seen an Ogre before, but this one fit all the stories she'd always heard about them.  He was very well spoken though, she always heard that Ogre's were very stupid.  Oh well, none of that mattered, his pouch was swelling and a he was dumb enough to leave it dangling from his hip like an apple for the picking.  She felt that the fact that she hid in the same shadow, in the same Inn, and he sat in the same chair as that other one did so many years ago was a very good omen indeed.   Slipping behind him quietly just as she had done so long ago, watching the retreating back of the serving wench, inching her knife up to slit the leather, and... AHHHHHH!!   She found herself nose to nose with the big Ogre, dangling from her wrist held by his huge hand... stunned silly.
<br><br>
	"What are you doing, little one?"  He boomed at her.
<br><br>
	"Uhhhh..."  Was all she could stammer.  Goddess and all Her daemons, his breath stank!!
<br><br>
	Cocking his head to one side, "Are you hungry?"  He asked her.
<br><br>
	"Yea, I guess."  <em>Damn</em>--she thought--<em>My first time out of the training room and not only do I get caught, but I can't even come up with a better lie!</em>  Her eyes widened suddenly as she saw the bouncer heading in their direction, "Put me down please!!"  She said with sudden fear, to get caught stealing in THIS Inn meant instant death!
<br><br>
	"No, You tell me what you're doing?  I'll feed you too, little woman."  His toothy grin was friendly enough, but the bouncers were inching their way through the common room and getting closer.   She couldn't think of anything to say as they reach the Ogre and the dangling Dark Elf he held up.  
<br><br>
	Suddenly the bouncers made a grab for her, "Git way from the payin' customers dirty creature!" One of them said.  "I'll kill this vermin, and feed 'er to the fishes!"  The other one said.  t'Ceira felt herself tugged this way and that as the bouncers tried to hit her, stab her, and pull her away from the Ogre.  Another person watching from outside would certainly consider the situation funny, but to each of them it was deadly serious, except for the confused Ogre.
<br><br>
	"NOOOOOO!!"  The loud bellow, along with a generous helping of breath that threatened anything t'Ceira had eaten, wafted across her face and served to stop everyone in their tracks.  "MINE!!" another of the breathy bellows blew her hair back and sent her into a coughing fit.  <em>He'll kill me with that breath of his trying to save me</em>--she thought as she felt him slam his other fist on the table breaking it in two and storming out the door and down the docks. Save me? Why?  No one had ever tried to save her from anything since Momma Kinda....her confusion rattled her again.   Dangling from his hamfisted hand she felt the circulation going from her hand and twisted herself to look at his face... clearing her throat a bit.
<br><br>
	"Now that we're out of there, do you mind putting me down?"  She asked reasonably.
<br><br>
	"Oh... sorry"  Very gently he sat her down, but kept a hold on her wrist.  "What were you doing in there?"  He asked again, genuinely curious.
<br><br>
	The fact that he had saved her warmed her heart a bit... <em>This big bungling creature actually tried to save me from certain death</em>--she thought as she looked back at him with wonder,  "Ummm, I'll tell you, but we've got to go somewhere safer...safer for me, if I'm found these humans will kill me."  So, they swam out to a spot down the shore and sat on the beach and talked.  So began the romance between t'Ceira and the Ogre named Darvinn.  
	<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Darvinn, Darvinn Wrathchild, raised by his Ogre mother in Oggok knew he was smarter than the average Ogre.  He never knew who his father was, but secretly suspected that he was human.  That didn't matter, he was strong and a good fighter, a son any Ogre would be proud of, but curious.  Also the center of confusion for others in his village.  No one could understand why Darvinn asked 'why' so much.  A thing was because it was, that was it!!  There was no 'why' to everything.  Well, his thirst for knowing more drove him to other places farther and farther away from home.  
<br><br>
	One night he found himself at the docks in the human village of Freeport.  He was thinking about trying to sneak onto the boat and heading to the far away Islands that he'd only heard of when he stopped at the Seafarer's Roost to eat.  Just as he was sipping at his swill... not very good when he was used to getting the real thing in Oggok but it would do... when he felt a slight tug on his hip.  There, crouched almost behind him, was a little creature with a pin-sticker.  He couldn't see her very well because she was so far down, so he reached gently around her wrist, he had heard that the little elven ones broke easily, and lifted her up to see her better.  When he asked her what she was doing and asked her to join him for dinner the whole Inn broke into pandemonium!  He had to pound the table, tapping it a bit too hard and breaking it, and practically fight his way out of the Inn just to get a word with the little dark elf.  But, when her lavender eyes beheld him with wonder instead of revulsion, his heart fluttered and he knew that he just couldn't live without her company.  He resolved then and there to be her protector, and stay by her side even if she never returned the love he felt.
<br><br>
	t'Ceira dumped the bag on the huge bed they shared, "13 coppers was all I could get." She said with a sigh.  Glancing up at Darvinn, she felt the twisting flutter of her heart and wondered again how she could possibly be in <em>love</em> with the big oaf.  They had talked the night away that first night and she had taken him to her rooms in shanty-town as he had no other place to stay.  A soft smile kissed her lips as she remembered the odd twist her life had taken since then.  She felt she had jumped on a wave that she had no control over, but wouldn't change for the world.  She never considered the Gods much, but thought what a great joke it was that they had put her soul mate in the body of this creature.  It had only taken a few weeks for them to become inseparable.  t'Ceira had always thought it incredible that anyone would think of her for herself and not what they could get from her and it didn't take long for her heart to belong wholly to Darvinn Wrathchild.   
<br><br>
	"That's Ok, love, it'll be enough so we don't have to dip into the savings."  His eyes looked fondly on her as he spoke, "I'll get you to Neriak, if it's the last thing I do."  His odor swept across her as they talked and she crinkles her nose delicately.
<br><br>
	"Did you take your bath today?" She demanded, hands on hips and head tilted slightly to the side,  "I didn't think so!!" She responded to his sheepish look, pointing out the door and in the direction of the baths.  Shaking her head as he lumbered, grumbling, out the door, she laughed softly.	
<br><br>
	t'Ceira had shown Darvinn all the twists and turns of the underground in Freeport.  They took up residence in a suit of rooms under the shanty-town Inn.  But, they loved to take walks in the commonlands on bright moonlit nights.  They sat talking on the little sand dune that t'Ceira thought was the place where once was Mama Kinda's tower, situated very close to the entrance to a cave that was now a hold for the same swashbucklers that had ransacked her home.  It was then that they met the Paladin of Mithaniel Marr, Diane.  
<br><br>
	She sighed deeply as she finished telling her beloved the sad tale, "...anyway, my love, I come here sometimes to think of Momma Kinda and dream of someday getting to the Nektuala forest and the city, Neriak, that is hidden there."   Not realizing the vision of beauty she presented  to Darvinn, t'Ceira turned her lavender eyes, which had been staring at the ground where they sat, upward and gazed at the moon hanging full and luminous in the night sky.   Darvinn caught his breath at the sight of her again feeling the rush of joy that she was actually his, and she truly loved him!  A silly smile slowly spread itself across his face, as those eyes turned again to him.  They were sitting there, gazing with true love at each other, when a voice hailed from the darkness.
<br><br>
	"HO, there!!!  Stand and be known!!"  The deep feminine voice called to them.
<br><br>
	They both jumped up, Darvinn making ready to protect his t'Ceira and she diving behind the mound, trying to blend with the shadows of the night.  The human appeared into the light of the moon.  Blond flowing hair, leather armour, shield, sword, and a blinding torch completed the picture of righteousness.  She seemed to glow with divine protection and the smile twinkling in her dark eyes belied any threatening intent, as she jammed the torch into the sand.
<br><br>
	"Hail." Darvinn rumbled, bowing a bit trying to position himself between the strange woman and his t'Ceira.  He studied her intently, feeling as if he'd seen her somewhere before. "I am Darvinn Wrathchild.  How may I be of service?"
<br><br>
	A bright smile of recognition plastered itself across Diane's face, "Ahh!!  Are you, mayhap, the Ogre who was accosted by a band of humans more than a fortnight agone?"
<br><br>
	Darvinn's eyes widened at Diane as he remembered her suddenly, "YES!!!" He boomed, "You helped me too.  Diane is you're name, I believe."  He smiled and bowed even lower.  
<br><br>
	Diane shook her head, again, in wonderment that this huge lumbering creature was so articulate, she had not remembered that, "I was only doing what was needful of me, in the service of my Lord Mithaniel and the furtherment of the truth and light."
<br><br>
	Still hidden behind the hill, peeking over the edge of the sand, and watching the exchange, t'Ceira wondered if the woman ever said anything simply instead of flowering it with large phrases.  Ducking down again as the woman's eyes traveled in her direction, she inched her way around through the darkness to get a better view yet stay hidden.
<br><br>
	"Please, join us."  t'Ceira groaned inwardly as she heard her lovers invitation.  <em>We don't know <b>ANYTHING</b> about this woman</em>--t'Ceira thought.
<br><br>
	"Us?" Diane asked with a smile as she settled herself into the sand a good distance from the torch.  She knew that someone was hidden in the shadows behind Darvinn, and had the impression that Darvinn knew about it.  She was content to wait until whoever it was felt safe enough to emerge.  She sat her sword next to her and waited.
<br><br>
	"Oh!"  Darvinn finally realizing his mistake, blushed deeply.  Now THAT was a sight, a blushing Ogre!  A slow red glow began oozing down the huge not-so-ugly face to disappear into the edges of his tunic.  Diane almost laughed allowed, but held herself to a cheerful smile instead.  "Well...ummmmmm...." Was his intelligent explanation.
<br><br>
	t'Ceira decided to introduce herself to this woman who Darvinn seemed to trust, also saving him embarrassment in the process.  "Yes, I am t'Ceira."  She spoke from the darkness, stepping out yet staying outside of the light.  She knew that with human site, the woman wouldn't be able to see her clearly.  
<br><br>
	"Well, hello there." Diane's smile was friendly, "Don't worry, I won't bite and it's my mission to bring ALL the races together."  She spoke as she pulled out bread, water, cheese, and what looked like apples from her travel bag.  Diane munched, offering some to Darvinn and then to the elusive (obviously distrusting) t'Ceira.  
<br><br>
	Darvinn took a large chunk of bread and cheese, thanking Diane, and smiled assurances to t'Ceira as his lover edged closer and took a few of the apple slices.  They began to talk and slowly t'Ceira began to relax.  It seemed that Diane was a Paladin of the God Mithaniel Marr, Lord of Truth and Light and on and on and soforth and such.  She felt that it was her personal duty to bring Truth to all the races, to right the wrongs in Norrath and bring peace and enlightenment to everyone.  t'Ceira thought it was lofty goals, something that was good, but didn't seriously think it would ever happen.  By the end of the evening, t'Ceira found that she liked the woman and felt herself warming to her, the beginnings of trust.
<br><br>
	Later that night, as Darvinn snored away on the huge bed, t'Ceira thought deeply.  The points that Diane had brought up were provocative.  Imagine, being able to walk through Freeport without fear, because all races were togather of one mind.  Diane had said things to make her think, thoughts foreign to her raced through her head.  Well--she thought--maybe some humans are all right, even trustworthy.  Maybe there ARE a few I can trust.  Maybe there are even some that will help me get to Neriak.  Her excitement rose inside her, the dream flowing up anew in her breast.  Feeling as if all was well with the world, she curled up next to Darvinn, breathing in his clean scent and feeling the strong arm gently pull her next to him.  Snuggling into the warmth of his love she fell asleep, happy and content.
