<b>Part I</b>
<br><br>
<em>A long time ago in the lands of Norrath…</em>
<br><br>
The sun hurts my eyes as I sit at the hard oaken table.  The torn curtains do little to block out the sun, and the alcohol I had consumed the night before seemed to want to escape my body through my head.  The life of a treasure hunter is never done.  Many people deserve to have their property borrowed, and those whom are particularly daft, taken.  I look around the small inn, my bowl of bread and last nights stew steaming.  The barmaid strolls through the area, filling up mead and water when necessary.  Only two travelers other than myself sit on the benches this morning, more evidence of the lawlessness of the land.  The roads have become even more dangerous then ever.  Not like I care, as long as the economy is good, I'm happy.  The more money being carried around means more money for me to pilfer, which is of course the job of a treasure hunter.
<br><br>
	I mentally go through my plans for the day: pick up my order of lock picks from the tinker… get my new boots from the cobbler, and head out into the city and see what trouble I can find.  Simple, at least if I can survive breakfast.  Last night was a celebration of my latest heist.  I stole the jewels from some dumb wench's house.  She wore them openly, and never gave anything to the beggars who asked for a little assistance now and then.  She deserves the fate she is waking up too.  She slept too soundly, and the stupid cur she calls a dog met a fate I don't care to remember.  The fat bag didn't even stir when I accidently kicked her footboard.  I smile as I remember the incident.  It hurt like hell and I was prepared to jump from her bedroom window, which was open, as I had used that as my point of entry, but she never awoke.  I could have easily killed her that night, but you can shear a sheep many times, though you can eat it only once.  Plus they kill you for murder on the spot, treasure hunting only get you thrown in prison, which any hunter worth his two gold can get out of.  I rubbed my chest where I wore my newly acquired necklace.  I had become so lost in my memories that I didn't notice the door to the inn had been opened and closed twice.
<br><br>
	The first was when the three guards walked in, the second when the two other patrons walked out for fear of the guards.  I return from my daydreaming because I hear someone talking to me.
<br><br>
	"What is your name?" says a gravelly voice.
<br><br>
	"Huh?" I return a question as I finally realize my predicament.
<br><br>
	"I said, you scruffy looking fool, what is your name?"  
<br><br>
	I can't help but notice how rude he is.  "My name…um."  I thought quickly.  "My name is Vladen, and I am traveling to the new town of Qeynos, to see the sites and such.  What is your name good sir?"
<br><br>
	"That matters not to you boy, how did you get here?"
<br><br>
	This is going nowhere, and it is apparent he is looking for someone.  Whether that someone is me or not I don't know.  "I arrived by boat, from Butcherblock."  I added quickly "Just last night in fact."
<br><br>
	He didn't look convinced, but it was evident that he lacked evidence, and one good thing about this land is that there are some rights for the people.  He can't just throw me in jail without evidence can he?  Before my thoughts got any farther he broke the silence.
<br><br>
	"Listen boy, if I find different I am coming for you.  You get me?" He was trying his best to scare me.
<br><br>
	"Yes good sir, oh and could you give me some advice on the whereabouts of a cobbler?"  I fed him my best smile, the one that always works on the ladies.  Of course I already know where the cobbler is, but I want to make him believe that I'm stupid.  I see him stop, turn, and prepare to tell me where.
<br><br>
	"It's down Turnberry, take your second left, you can't miss the sign.  And stop smiling at me like that."
<br><br>
	I watch him go and smile to myself.  Always the best, and still the undisputed greatest.  It almost hurts to be this good.  I finish my meal quickly and head upstairs to gather my things.  New plans I think to myself get the picks and shoes, then head out of town.  I might be better than any guard alive, but they aren't all that dumb when you get them together.  Those other two downstairs must have been rookies.  I grab my bag and head downstairs.  I smile at the innkeeper, toss him a ruby and head out into the bright, hot streets of Freeport.  What a grand city I think to myself, to bad they have the beginnings of what could become a major orc problem out West.  I walk past huge houses, and the fish market here is astounding.  
<br><br>
	I make it to the tinker and the cobbler with no problems and begin to head towards the East gate.  Many people crowd the streets and I get bumped into many times.  I can't help myself and I slide my hand in and out of some plush looking nobleman's pocket as I bump into him from the side, apologizing a hundred times for my own stupidity.  He pushes me aside and continues on his way; not even knowledgeable to the fact I just took his purse.  I cock a grin and move on towards the gate.  I know better than to count my earnings here.  I whistle to myself as a roar goes up behind me.  I turn with the crowd to see the plush nobleman pointing at me.  He is screaming something and when a hand grabs my neck I realize that he was calling the guards.  I curse silently at the nobleman and smile at the guard.  He looks familiar but I can't place him.  They all look the same to me in their armor.  
<br><br>
	"What did I tell you earlier boy?" in that same gravelly voice I heard this morning.
<br><br>
	"Oh, hello again sir.  Look I was lost and I can't seem to find that cobbler shop you told me about. Might you point me in the direction kind sir?"  I count only the same three guards I saw earlier and I hear the nobleman approach behind me.  Funny, I think, that the street is now empty except for us…
<br><br>
	"Let me see what you have in your pockets boy."  Says the guard as he begins to reach into my pocket.
<br><br>
	He pulls out a blue silk purse and raises it up before the nobleman.
<br><br>
	"Yes, that is it.  That damn thief stole my purse." Cries the nobleman as he takes his purse back from the guard.
<br><br>
	"I swear, I found it on the cobblestones.  I was heading your way to turn it in.  I swear."  I plead to the guard as he picks me up by my shoulders.  
<br><br>
	"Not this time dwarf."  He turns his head to issue orders to the rookies.   
<br><br>
	Just then I decide to use my last option.  Because the guard has raised me up to his eye level my foot is about at his waist.  I kick out and land a solid blow to his stomach.  He drops me to the ground and in a split second I grab the purse from the nobleman who is too shocked to even stop me.  I am off and running as the guard recovers and yells at the rookies to get me.  Yup, rookies all right, can't even think for themselves.
<br><br>
	I reach the town wall and begin scampering up the ladder to the top.  The guards, all three of them together I see, are about twenty feet from me.  I fill my lungs with air as I scream to the entire town.
<br><br>
	"Never underestimate the skills of the great one!  I am Chibb!"
<br><br>
	And with that I was over the wall and into the woods.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	I approach the newly constructed bridge and look out to the horizon.  Buildings are being built every day now and all of the populace can be heard complaining.  Both about the noise and the added traffic coming through.  I am here looking for work, good honest work.  I have to laugh at myself with that thought.  I have heard that Qeynos is destined to be the biggest city in the land and new places attract many people.  I cross the bridge and immediately begin watching the people around me.  I look at the way they walk, and the way they sound.  I begin walking towards the building in the central part of town. That is always where they put inns and I am hoping Qeynos is the same.  I smile as I approach the porch of the inn.  It looks modern, affixed with all the latest architectural fashions, and I guess it will have soft beds.  
<br><br>
I rub the jewels in my pouch and remember the time I stole them.   It has been about a month and I have lived off that heist since then.  But my tastes are for the finest things in life so I have begun to run low on gold.  I hope Qeynos is as it says--a grand place of opportunity.  I walk inside through the double doors, with paned windows inset in the wood.  I turn and look at the innkeeper, surprisingly a female.  I give her my best smile and think that I might be able to get a cheap room.  
<br><br>
"Hello my dear.  I am Tomas.   I just arrived in the city and will begin looking for a place of work.  Till then I was wondering if you might have a room available?" I say as I flash my pearly whites.
<br><br>
"No, I am sorry sir, all the rooms will be occupied for at least another week.  I am sorry, but the Stuck Pig down the road has beds available." she replies.
<br><br>
"Surely you must be mistaken my'lady.  I am sure one of the gentlemen who are boarding upstairs will gladly give up his room for me.  Might you check again?" as I say this I slide a few gold coins across the table.  She takes them from the tabletop and slides them in between her breasts.  Then she just smiles at me in a peculiar way.
<br><br>
"Well then sir… I checked and unfortunately they have all said NO.  So I must ask you to leave."  And with that she flashes me her cute smile and I feel too dumbfounded to even question her own thievery.  I just walk right out those beautiful double doors.  
<br><br>
I mumble to myself as I continue down the street in the direction of the Stuck Pig.  I approach the ramshackle building and can only imagine what kind of living conditions this place has.  I sigh and walk into the building.  Behind the counter is a burly, hairy, fat old man who is smoking a pipe.  Farther in the back of the rectangular building is cots lined up in rows, five by five.  I ask him how much a room is and he just answers in a surprisingly high voice.
<br><br>
"Rooms?  Hah!  What do you think this is? The Sleepy Dream?  Cots are 3 gold a week.  Food is not served, EVER.  Want a cot?"
<br><br>
I am shocked to find myself in an establishment like this as for the last mouth I have been living like a prince.  I wonder what I am getting myself into by staying in the dump but I hand him a three gold piece coin and pick out my cot.   I flop down onto my cot and begin to plan my next heist.  First I must find a target.  Then I must discover what kind of security the target has, and what equipment I will need.  I decide to go for a walk and see what is around.   Certainly some rich person has to be funding the building of stores and the like.
<br><br>
I enter the humid outdoors and I feel happy with being away from the smelly room of the Stuck Pig.  I look to the North and then to the South and decide to head North.  I begin to whistle and actually start feeling better about myself when I notice a big house painted red on a small hill just up the road.  I pretend to be looking at the stores in the immediate area but I am actually watching how often people enter and exit the house.  I decide that it is definitely a person's house rather than a store as the door hasn't opened in the last thirty minutes.  Plus there is a small metal fence bordering the outside which were serve to only keep customers out.  I turn around and run face first into a man wearing a suit and a top hat.  I look at him and begin to apologize when he speaks.
<br><br>
"No worries Chibb, I was looking for you." He says as he flashes a smile far better than my own.  I know right away, besides the fact that he knows my name, that this man is definitely a force to be careful of.  "Won't you walk with me?  I have an offer for you."  
<br><br>
I nod, and wave him to the East but he shakes his head and points to the West.  Without completely understanding why, or controlling my legs I begin to walk to the West.  He begins to talk as we walk on.
<br><br>
"I have been waiting for you to show up here my Dwarven friend.  I am in need of your services." He says to me.
<br><br>
"My services sir?  I have no skills that you might find desirable." I say to test him.  I do not trust him and hope to keep my profession hidden from him.  If he knows my name then who knows for sure what else he knows.
<br><br>
"I need you to steal something for me Chibb, and I need it done quickly.  Tomorrow night to be exact." He says, as if he expects not to be told no.  If I don't know better, I would say this guy is a nobleman of some sort.  I hate noblemen.
<br><br>
"Tomorrow night?  You must be joking?  That is impossible." Is the only thing I can think of saying.
<br><br>
"No it's not Chibb, especially for the thief who stole Madam Claire's jewels right from under her nose." He says while jabbing me with his elbow and grinning big at me.
<br><br>
"Ok, I'll do it.  But I need a layout of the house and a description of what it is I will be hunting for.  Also, I prefer the term Treasure Hunter."
<br><br>
He waves away my comment and begins to speak.  "I can't get you the plans but I can tell you what it is you are 'hunting' for.  I can also give you a picture."  With that he handed me a piece of paper with a written description and what looks like a page from a book that had been torn out.  "I will be in that alley over there" he points "tomorrow night.  When you get the item, bring it to me there.  Good Luck Chibb."  Before I can say anything he turns and walks away from me, his tailcoat flapping in the wind.
<br><br>
Immediately I turn and head back to the Stuck Pig.  I lay on my cot and begin to read the description and study the picture.  My guess is this house is large, so this thing can be anywhere.  I study the picture till I memorize it and then read the description.  The item appears to be a magical tomb of some kind but what I can't seem to figure out is what in the hell would the person living in that house be doing with something like that?  Plus, what the hell would this weird guy want with it?  It was then that I realized I hadn't settled on my end of the deal.  I had been hoodwinked!
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
It was dark.  Pitch black.  I couldn't have wished up a better night than this for a heist.  The only problem will be finding my way around the house in the darkness.  With no moonlight coming in through the windows this could get a little complicated.  I approach the house from behind, and hop over the metal fence with ease.  I picked out an entry point this morning and I had decided that I could get out any way I choose.  I reach the window with relative ease and slide my dagger point all around the seal of the window.  The point of the dagger catches on the latch and with a twist of my wrist I pop the window open.  It hurts to be this good.  It really does.  I slide in quietly and land on the wooden floor without a sound.  My fur-lined shoes don't make any noise when I walk and I decide that I should go left.  If the owner of this house does in fact have this tomb, then my guess is that it would be in the basement somewhere.  If I were a mage, I wouldn't practice my magic in my bedroom.  I smile and mentally pat myself on my back as I enter a giant library.  The walls are of solid oak and small sconces light the room.  Weird I think to myself, that you would leave candles burning in a room full of books without someone keeping and eye on things.  
<br><br>
I run my finger over the bindings of the books lining the wall and try and feel which one is slightly ajar, or one that is too light to be a real book.  Halfway around the room I find it.  The book is titled <u>Simulacrum</u> and it sits out a little farther than the rest.  I slide the book out and await the result.  I frown to myself as nothing happens.  I push the book back in angrily and feel something pop.  To my satisfaction a section of the wall slides open.   I knew that would happen I think to myself as I grab a wall torch and head down the stairs.  These mages are so predictable, always putting their laboratories in the hidden chamber that can be found by moving a book.  When will these guys wise up?  I mean aren't mages supposed to be intelligent?  With all my day dreaming I didn't notice the shadow following me down the steps.
<br><br>
I enter a room of moderate size with two tables in the middle, some books lying in a pile, and one book in particular sitting atop a metal stand.  I stop at the bottom of the stairs and let my eyes adjust to the darkness of the room.  Odd I think, the light from the torch only goes out so far.  Everything beyond that is dark gray, yet not quite black.  I approach the tomb and run my hand over the cover.  Weird symbols adorn the black leather and a language fills the pages inside which I do not understand.  I reach to pick up the book when something across the room catches my eye.  What is that I think to myself? That's weird, what is a wooden box, ornately decorated, doing in the basement of a mage's house?  I put the box out of my mind and pick up the book.  Wait?  Did I hear something?  Almost like the wind rustling through a tree.  I wait for a second but don't hear anything else.  I turn around and begin to walk towards the stairs.  My god what is that!?  From out of nowhere a black form floats across the room.  It enters the light of my torch and I behold a man.  Dressed in all black with a long cape, billowing on a wind I don't feel. He is pale as death, and he smiles at me.  I freeze with terror.  This is no man I think. I don't know what it is.  I reach for my dagger but he speaks. His voice is soft, so soft I have to listen carefully so as not to miss anything he says.  I feel trapped by his gaze; my feet are as heavy as stone.  
<br><br>
"You have no need for that little Chibb.  I won't hurt you." He whispers.
<br><br>
"What… what… what do you want then?" I blurt out.
<br><br>
"Just my book, give me my book and you can leave this place." He says in a matter-of-fact tone, as if everyone caught stealing just gets to walk away unharmed without any punishment.  
<br><br>
But his eyes, oh his eyes.  They hold me hostage, they seem to be made from the fog coming off a river early in the morning.  Swirling in his eyes.   "In that case, here, I don't want it anymore.   I can't even read it."  I extend my hand, the book held tightly in my grasp.
<br><br>
"I knew you were a smart man Chibb."  With that he grabs my wrist and swirls me into his chest.  I feel a sharp prick in my neck and something begins to run down the side of my neck.  All I can think of are his eyes.  Those gray eyes.  I feel weak and my legs collapse and I fall to the cold stone floor.  My torch goes out as it rolls across the stones.  That dark gray still exists, yet I see no source of light in the room.  I begin to feel dizzy and all that remains in my memory are those gray eyes.  Those gray eyes.  Those damn gray eyes.  I hear a soft whisper in my ear and feel the pale man's hot breath on my neck.  As he speaks I feel small droplets of spit, or water or something land on my neck.  
<br><br>
"By <br>the way Chibb, you can leave now.  Let all those other men I have sent to hell know that Galen Wilding says hello.  They will know who I am."
<br>
And with that my world went truly black…
