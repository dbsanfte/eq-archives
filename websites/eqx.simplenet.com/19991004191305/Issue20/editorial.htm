<p align="center">Welcome to Issue 20!</font></p>

All right, so what is there for me to talk about this week?  Good question.
<br><br>
Socialization.  That’s the topic this week.
<br><br>
It occurred to me just moments ago that most gamers would consider themselves, well,
geeks.  And we associate certain traits to geeks.  One of the most common ones is
that we lack social skills.  I am going to have an easy time disputing this concept.
It is obvious to me, and hopefully to most of you, that role playing is a social
event.  Certainly the rules of these social events is somewhat different than others,
but it is a social event nonetheless.  Players interact with each other on several
levels.  They interact as their characters with the other characters.  They interact
with each other as a social entity, with the game master at its head.  And they,
hopefully, interact as friends.
<br><br>
But hang on, I’m only talking about pen and paper role players here, not all gamers.
And there are many other types.  There are board gamers, computer gamers, card
players (you know, them types), and probably many others that I can’t think of right
now.  Board gamers are nearly as social as role players, as the nature of the game is
similar.  Card players are also similar.  Obviously I am planning on talking about
computer gamers.
<br><br>
Computers require little or no social skills to game with.  In fact, it is easy to
assume that they tend to reduce the amount of social skills.  At least television
pretends to teach social values.  A computer could care less.  Gamers that have only
experienced computer games have never had the chance to learn the joy of interactive
gaming.  I can’t really even say that playing multiplayer games can really be counted
as a social experience, with the exception of MUDs.
<br><br>
And a lack of social skills, a lack of social understanding, can tear apart a gaming
community.  And a gaming community is what I want out of EQ.
<br><br>
People that have not had the chance to play some of the more social games really
should give it a try.  There are lots of game store around.  Find one and get into
a game of Magic, D&D or Axis and Allies with people that you have never met.  Play
and have fun.  And learn.
