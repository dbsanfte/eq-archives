<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a player with Issued Scout armor. Where can that armor be found or bought?
 - Thornock
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Issued Scout Armor is part of one of the reimbursal kits that is given to a player by a GM when he or she loses their body and equipment due to a verifiable bug.  What is in these kits depends on the player's lvl, race and class.  Scout Armor I believe is rather like leather in AC and weight.  As reimbursal items are non-trade, non-drop type items, you won't be able to get any unless you lose your body to a bug.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a wood elf Ranger and was wondering about the penalties of killing natural creatures.  I heard that I can be thrown out of my guild if this is done.  I am currently bound to Freeport and adventure with a group that gets frequently attacked by lions, bears, etc.  Though I don't hunt them myself, I do help defend my comrades.  Will my guild punish me for this?
 - Zacyth
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, the only animals that affect your guild standings are the bears in Surefall Glade, near Qeynos.  The only sure way to tell, though, is to kill one and see what (if any) faction messages come up.  No message, no faction change.  Don't let Holly or Cros catch you at it though. =)
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in BB at the moment, if I am camping in a place where gnolls spawn, When I come back to play will I be dead or will I be ok and ready to fight?
 - Voozhum
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you camped safely, you will come back alive.  No guarantees on how long you will stay that way, though.  That BB is a nasty place...
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your last issue mentioned that items summoned by magicians will disappear after you log out. Is this a bug, that a magician summons (say a magical spear) and gives it to someone. That person then has noticed that if you put the summoned item in a chest, within the bank, when he logs back in, the item is still there.  So my question , is if this is a bug, and therefore a bug exploit?  Or is this aloud
 - Annonomous
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure if this was intended by the game designers, but as far as I know, it is not considered an exploit.  I've used it too.  
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they ever plan on fixing mobs incredible abilities to walk through buildings to attack you, or to climb vertical objects in their attempt to flee from your overpowering might?
 - Aarorn
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these things are bugs, however unlikely they would seem in a "real" situation.  To make mobs unable to get through walls would make houses "safe zones"  and incredibly exploitable.  As for the racing up sheer cliffs... there's only so much you can do with AI.  The mob runs straight away from you, and if there happens to be mountains in the way... well they just keep going.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What do AE and PB stand for?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Area Effect and Point Blank.  Refers to the type of damage that a spell does.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a Barbarian warrior who travels from Halas to Erudin to Qeynos regularly. As you well know, as a warrior, I am exempt from learning any magic, and as a result, cannot get any type of gate spells. Therefore running and taking the boat are my main means of travel. When taking the boat from one continent to another I've had the game crash on me. I normally log back in as fast as I can, and find myself in the same spot on the boat as when I crashed. But I have a concern. Every time I crashed, it was right after entering a zone, or when my character is saved. What would happen if I crashed and then didn't log back in? Would I be an endless traveler on the boat or would I find myself somewhere in the ocean swimming in God only knows which direction? Possibly a shark treat?
 - Faman
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shark treat it would be.  Luckily, at this time, crashing and finding oneself in the drink are considered sufficient reasons for a Guide/GM to transport you safely to shore.  Just /petition and they will help you out.  
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that the limit of people you can have on your /friend list is 20. Is this true? Is there a way to print the list of friends (all those in the list, not just those who are currently on-line)?
 - Grizben
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, 20 is the limit.  To view all the names on your "friend" list, simply type /friend, and it will show you them all, online or not.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to play the game of chance called KINGS COURT that is found at HighHold?  I have tried everything I know to try and keep getting the same rhetoric that I should give it a try.
 - Abtaka
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to play the game yet.  I don't know if they have plans on implementing it anytime soon, either.  It would be fun, though, eh? 
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if anyone knew why Verant decided to make all info available for items by right-clicking on them?  This makes certain abilities, such as sense magic and Lyssa's Cataloging Libretto, rather worthless.  If this is fixed, will Verant hide some of the item info?  Or will they change the spells so they do something useful?
 - Nexroth
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, the info that right clicking provides was to be much less detailed.  Verant changed their minds about this, and it did make the "sense magic" type spells somewhat outdated.  I don't know what they intend to do with these spells now.  I don't know if they know. =)
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Lil' Archys race?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;He's whatever you want him to be.  And for a copper he'll dance on your table, too.  Ow, Archy, it was a joke!  Jeez...
