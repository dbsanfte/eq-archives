This past summer I played on a large and popular MUD.  During the summer 
months it is noticeably less populated than during the fall and spring.  This 
is, of course, because many MUD players are college students who connect to 
the game through their university network.  The summer months were a blast, 
playing and feeling camaraderie with a smaller group of dedicated players.  
Then the droves returned from vacation and the game went into the tanker.
<br><br>
Many times I would be in a room fighting a monster, honing my battle skills 
and earning well-needed cash for a weapon upgrade.  Here is a typical scenario 
that I encountered all too often.
<br><br>
Suddenly, in walked an over-eager player and started attacking the monster
I was fighting.  Since the killing blow earned the experience in this game,
this was a direct attempt to steal experience and loot from me.
<br><br>
"I got this one, thanks."  I tried to politely inform him that his presence 
was not wanted, and was, in fact, rather disturbing.  Of course there was no 
response.  
<br><br>
"Hello?"  Still nothing.  The battle quickly ended.  Luckily I got the killing 
blow, so I earned the exp.  I had to quickly loot the corpse before he stole 
that too.
<br><br>
"Why did you do that?" I asked.
<br><br>
As he ran off he responded, "You didn't look like you were doing too good. I 
was just helping."
<br><br>
Now that got my blood boiling!  Why would he presume that I wanted any help?  
Especially if he had the potential of taking everything from the battle while 
I was the one at risk of being killed.  If I had wanted help, I would have 
asked for it.  I told him off, but I doubt he listened.
<br><br>
On another occasion, I met a level 1 cleric who was dressed in an unusual 
amount of armor and weaponry for a beginner.  I carefully inspected him, 
curious as to how he could have achieved such riches at a young age.  Noticing 
this, he grew very defensive. 
<br><br>
"Do you have a problem?"
<br><br>
"No problems here," I replied and went on my way.
<br><br>
Shortly thereafter I joined a party with a friend of mine and we proceeded to 
start fighting a monster that would normally pose only a minor threat.  And as 
luck would have it, in walked the level 1 cleric.  This time, the invading 
player did not attack the monster... he healed it!  Multiple times.  Obviously 
in some sort of vendetta to prove his power and establish his superiority, he 
was trying to indirectly kill me.  
<br><br>
"Cut it out," my companion stated, as we moved to quickly end the fight with 
a couple of well-placed spells.  Afterwards, the level 1 cleric became even 
more defensive, and actually quite obnoxious, spouting such ridiculous drivel 
as "You need to learn manners by not inspecting other people!" 
<br><br>
Hmm, funny that looking at another person can be considered bad manners, but 
blatantly trying to kill them is considered proper social behavior?  This guy 
was seriously lacking something upstairs.  After pointing out this hypocritical
fact, the dreaded reply came.
<br><br>
"You need to learn how to role play!"  
<br><br>
"Well then you are role playing an idiot quite nicely.  My apologies,"  my 
friend retorted.
<br><br>
Unfortunately this is a common excuse used by troublemakers in online games.  
Whether they think that is how to role play evil, or they are just being 
themselves, it does not give anyone a right to harass another player or do 
things that directly or indirectly ruin the game for others.  It is one thing 
to fight a duel to the death.  It is entirely another to follow around someone 
you don't like and interfere with their gameplay.  
<br><br>
Finally, he said "I hate newbies," and walked off in a huff.
<br><br>
My friend and I decided it was not worth our while to bother with this guy any 
more.  It was obvious he felt he was a long-standing, powerful player at level 
1, and nothing we could do would change that.  Neither of us were newbies, but 
he assumed that his ego and his power gave him a particular insight into our 
pasts.
<br><br>
Other problems surfaced as well.  When the game was full with over 100 players,
the chat lines were flooded with arguments, obscenities, out of character 
discussions, and other mindless chatter.  I could ignore most of these, but I 
did not want to shut out those who really needed help and had real questions 
to ask.  I am more than willing to help other players, but it is difficult 
when you can't filter out the useful text from the useless.
<br><br>
These problems are common to many online multiplayer RPGs, including MUDs and 
Ultima Online.  I can only imagine that the same issues will surface in 
EverQuest, Asheron's Call, and the rest.  It is my hope that we can avoid the 
foolishness and immaturity that so often overwhelms the fun and friendship we 
can experience.  I offer some words of advice to all who will heed them, and 
hopefully this will reduce the problems EverQuest has as they continue to add 
more testers.  
<br><br>
<OL>
<LI> Use proper channels.  If there is a sales channel, use it to sell your 
   equipment to others.  Don't shout it.  If there is a questions channel, use 
   that.  If there is a GM channel, use that.  If there is an OOC channel, use 
   that.  This will help everyone pay attention to what they want to hear, and 
   ignore what they don't.  Also, don't shout to the entire game when you are 
   addressing a single individual.  Shouting "Hey Wynn, where are you?" is 
   much less effective than a single tell directly to me.<br><br>

<LI> Ask before jumping into an existing combat.  Unless someone is screaming 
   for help, don't assume that you should blaze in and try to save them from 
   their opponents.  Ask the character, "Do you need any help?"  If they say 
   no, go look for monsters somewhere else.  This is even more true when you 
   have skills that increase with use.  The player may not even be planning
   to kill the monster, but instead using it to practice their combat skills 
   so that they may be more likely to kill the next one.  Asking will also 
   portray a more friendly and helpful attitude, rather than a thieving, 
   selfish attitude.  If a player does need help, they will be even more 
   grateful for your assistance if you ask first.<br><br>

<LI> Be civil.  Don't use vulgar language even if you are role playing.  As 
   real as we all want our games to be, someone may have children watching 
   them and we want them to be good parents.  Besides, you sound like a high 
   schooler.<br><br>

<LI> Share.  Don't sit around where you know your favorite monster spawns,
   so that you can instantly ambush it and take its loot before anyone else
   notices that it's there.  Wander around and look for other things to
   fight or quests to solve.  This will be especially true in EverQuest, where
   a lot of emphasis will be put on questing, exploration, and learning about 
   the history of Norrath.<br><br>

<LI> Respect others.  Sure some people get a kick out of role playing evil
   characters, but maintain some form of respect for the person behind the
   character as well.  There was an incident on a MUD a couple of years ago 
   where someone disabled a female character and proceeded to publically 
   "rape" her in the game through various rude emotes.  This can be a powerful 
   and dangerous thing to anyone who feels any sort of attachment to their 
   character.  Things like this should never be joked about.  Most of us
   could never go to that extent, but the concept is the same for other
   emotes and messages that may reveal your immaturity.  Emoting things like
   "Wynn drops trou and unleashes a thunderous cloud of rancid gas" will not 
   garnish you any respect.<br><br>

<LI> Behave in character.  Even if someone pisses you off in the game, make
   sure you respond in an in-character fashion.  A good rule of thumb is if 
   the despised character were not there, would it still make sense for you 
   to do what you are doing?  In the case of healing a monster, I doubt the 
   cleric's god would approve of such behavior, and as such this action is 
   merely being a prick.<br><br>

<LI> Loot only your own kills.  In a MUD I used to play on, I ran into people
   who would have their client send a "get all from corpse" command every time
   they received a "<Monster> dies" message.  This resulted in several 
   occasions where a player merely passing through looted the corpse of a 
   monster the instant I killed it.  Whether intentional or not, looting 
   others' corpses is taking items that do not belong to you.  If you are 
   role playing a thief, then you need to subject yourself to the penalties 
   that go with it, without exploiting methods like this while hiding behind
   safeties like a PK Switch.  And, if you are merely scrounging up loot to 
   bolster your own wallet, then this is way out of bounds.  If you want the 
   loot, earn it yourself.
</OL>

In general, online manners are only about two things: common sense and respect.
Think about what you are doing and try to understand what effect your actions
may have.  If a GM were standing behind you or secretly snooping you, would
you still do it?  I know that when I get into the game, I will try to be 
civilized, and I would hope everyone else will too.  Unfortunately, the 
people who really need to read this are probably too busy playing Quake and 
Ultima Online.
