I'd like to hear your opinions how to make a rogue into something more than 
an annoying little pickpocket. How would you play a rogue in such a way as 
to gain respect from those around you?
</em><br>
<br><br>
The stereotypical rogue is a thief who robs everyone blind in order to 
amass wealth, without regard for laws or the effects imposed upon the
victims.  In fact, when a character meets a thief in an online game
such as EverQuest, his first instinct is to be very cautious and to 
continuously check his inventory during the conversation and after they part.  
This presents an inherent difficulty in appearing to be more than a simple 
thief to the public eye.
<br><br>
First, we must understand why rogues have such a bad reputation.  The main
thing is their primary skill is often seen to be pick pocketing.  In all
online games I have witnessed, this is only ever useful against other players.
The game creators did not generate a huge two-headed giant with a magical
hammer and resistances to all forms of magic just for a thief to sneak in
undetected and take it away with no time commitment, effort, or risk of 
death.  The idea in online RPGs is to gain equipment and money through
combat and bloodshed.  
<br><br>
Against players, however, it is often used as a form of balance.  Because
thieves often tend to horde powerful equipment, there will be less of it
in the game.  And if sold, the recipient may think twice about using the
equipment if they may have it stolen out from under them.  Obviously this
is a poor method of balancing anything, but the point is the game masters
have little incentive to prevent player vs player stealing.
<br><br>
The end result is a lack of trust.  Unless someone is very familiar with a 
particular character (and sometimes not even then), they will tend to avoid
rogues at all cost.  So what can be done?  The first step is to counter the 
marks against all rogues.  Ignore that pick pocket skill in your choice of 
training.  As I will mention later, there are plenty of other things to 
train.  This way you wont be robbing from other players and wont have a 
reputation of being a thief.  Earn people's trust with your personality and 
actions.  Of course, being a rogue offers a fun change of pace in role 
playing a darker personality, but if you are approachable or silently 
confident, it is better than being shifty-eyed and quick-fingered.  
<br><br>
All is not against the rogue, however.  There are several popular fictional
characters who were thieves and were looked up to by the general populace.
Robin Hood and Ali Baba come to mind.  If you want to be a hero, you can try
to emulate these examples.  If you do use the pick pocket skill, target the
evil players or neutral monsters that no one cares about.  Be sure to give 
away money and small items to beginners.  While they are still new, they 
will be telling others what a great rogue you are.  When they grow to be
a strong player, they may be a powerful ally or friend who will support you
when you are in need, and can be a character reference if questions arise.
<br><br>
These suggestions are not specific to rogues, though.  Any character can
build their reputation like this.  So what can rogues do differently?  
A respected rogue will be a useful rogue.  Their true power does not come 
from robbing trinkets from the local population, but rather in their ability 
to sneak undetected through dark areas and do great amounts of damage through 
surprise attacks from the rear.  Their agility and speed can make them a
formidable ally in the battle field.  Rogues can also be extremely 
advantageous for disarming traps that could otherwise injure the party and 
picking locks that can lead to new and exciting adventures.
<br><br>
To give you an example, let me share a story in which I was able to play a
character with some very rogue-like qualities.
<br><br>
Several years ago, I was introduced to a game that my friend made up when
he was a kid.  It is so fun that he continued playing with a regular group
up through college, until everyone moved to different states.  It is an RPG, 
but not played with pen and paper.  The game is called Vampire and is 
played at night, outside, on a golf course or park area with trimmed grass 
and lots of nice pathways through wooded areas.  Naturally these places are
usually closed at night and are probably illegal to play in, but that 
merely enhances the spooky atmosphere.  One person is chosen to be the 
Vampire.  Another person is chosen to be the good Healer, leader of the
villagers.  The Vampire speaks to each of the rest of the players (villagers) 
one by one, and selects a secret Minion who will masquerade as a normal 
villager.  
<br><br>
Play begins with the Vampire running off into the woods to hide or plan an 
attack.  Everyone else splits up into smaller groups and heads off in 
different directions to hunt the Vampire.  As they travel, they will 
inevitably be very cautious about when the Vampire may jump out of a 
dark shadow, and very paranoid about which of their companions may turn on 
them when they least expect it.
<br><br>
The game is played with Wiffle Ball bats as weapons (swords) and striking
a body part rends it unusable.  Thus, if you get hit in your sword arm then 
you must switch hands, and if you get hit in both legs then you better be 
good at fighting on your knees.  Anyone who is killed becomes a ghost, and 
can be converted to a minion or villager by the respective leader.  If the 
Vampire dies, or all villagers are dead, the game is over.
<br><br>
I remember being chosen to be the secret Minion in one particular game.  I 
needed to begin the game by acting calm and traveling with a smaller group, 
which just happened to include two veteran players, including the creator of 
the game.  Stalking through the darkness caused me no fear, as I knew there 
were no secret minions or vampires waiting to jump me.  In fact, I enjoyed 
the knowledge that I was the one in control and could strike at any moment.  
<br><br>
Eventually the time came to make my move, and as my group began running 
toward the distant sound of clacking yellow bats, I quietly ran a little 
slower than the rest, which allowed me to lag behind and follow from the rear 
of the pack.  I cautiously moved in closer, and with two swift motions I 
tapped the veterans on their backs with my sword and whispered, "You're 
dead."  I grabbed them, now ghosts, each by the arm and, so the others ahead 
would not grow suspicious, told them to keep running.  A short distance ahead, 
I veered off and brought them to the lair of my leader, the Vampire.  The look 
on his face as his jaw hit the floor was enough to make me proud of my 
accomplishment.  But, after he converted the fresh recruits, the veterans' 
words of awe and surprise instantly placed me in as one of the elite players, 
and went down in history as one of the best moves in the game.
<br><br>
This, to me, exemplifies the ideal positive rogue.  Using skills such as
stealth and backstabbing, being one with the darkness, and using finesse
above strength to manipulate your foes will make a powerful rogue.  And 
using these skills for the benefit of others, such as your party, will ensure
a reputation of popularity and above all, respect.
