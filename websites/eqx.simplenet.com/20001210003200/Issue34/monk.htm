Many role-playing games offer the choice to be a monk.  They are typically
great fighters with no equipment.  But historically, I had always pictured
monks as quiet holy men who spend much of their time meditating and the rest
of their time transcribing books with beautiful penmanship and artwork.
So, how did the monk come to be the elite martial artist of RPGs?
<br><br>
It turns out to be based upon Chinese historical facts.  Originally, Buddhist
monks were very much like my preconceived notion.  They were peaceful folk
who did not believe in violence.  They spent the majority of their time
meditating and expanding their minds and awareness of themselves as well as
the world around them.  
<br><br>
According to history, there was an Indian Buddhist priest named Bodhidharma,
(or Tamo in Chinese) who came to a Shaolin temple in China around 540 A.D.  
There he found that the hours the monks spent working in the monestary 
libraries hunched over books resulted in degraded physical condition.  In fact, 
their physical and mental stamina was so bad, they could not perform 
many of the most basic Buddhist meditation practices.  To address this problem, 
Tamo started them on a regimen of moving exercises which would build their 
strength and enhance their inner life force, or "chi".  These exercise were 
probably similar to what we know today as Tai Chi.  
<br><br>
At this point, it was certainly not a combat skill, and could not be called
a martial art.  How and why this transformation took place is not entirely
known.  Some guess that the bandits and wild animals in the remote locations
that typically house their temples forced them into learning a form of 
self-defense.  I can also tell you from my own personal experiences visiting
tourist sites in South Korea that the temples are often seen as targets by 
invading armies with spoils to loot and buildings to destroy.  I heard several 
stories about how various temples needed to be rebuilt multiple times.  In 
fact, this is also one reason why many monk tomes were carved into stone;  
They could survive fires set by invading forces.  Keep in mind that Asian 
history includes lots of dynasties, wars, and invasions.  I personally believe 
that this also contributed to the move towards a more combat oriented art.  As 
time progressed, the Shaolin monks became legendary for their fighting style, 
and were used as part of the Chinese army.
<br><br>
However, all monks generally adhere to a nonviolent way of life.  Because
they spend most of their time exercising their minds, they try to resolve 
conflicts through their intellect before all else.  The study of martial arts 
gave the monks a better understand of conflict, and thus gave them better 
knowledge at how to avoid violence.  Their rationality for using physical 
combat is to prevent injury to themselves.  If an attacker provokes them, 
they first try to parry and dodge the attack.  However, someone intent on 
inflicting harm will not be deterred.  The monks then use their art to turn 
the attack on their opponent.  The stronger the attack, the more force is 
used to return the favor to their foe.  In this way, it can be said that 
they are not hurting anybody, but merely redirecting the attack back to those 
who initiate it.  Think self defense.
<br><br>
In an RPG setting, the notions of piety, self-control, and meditation are 
often ignored in order to provide players the fun of utilizing killer body
attacks.  It remains to be seen what EverQuest will do with monks, but it
is more important how players will role-play them.
<br><br>
Webster defines a monk as "A man who retires from the ordinary temporal 
concerns of the world, and devotes himself to religion; one of a religious 
community of men inhabiting a monastery, and bound by vows to a life of 
chastity, obedience, and poverty."  The strict definition of a monk may not 
be so fun to play, so how should they be implemented?  
<br><br>
Monks should not be allowed to be agnostic.  They are religious men by 
definition, and should be devoted to a god.
<br><br>
As far as I'm concerned, the chastity aspect is optional.
<br><br>
Obedience can be shown to a player's guild, but above all, obedience to his
chosen god is a priority.  If there is an in-game quest that is called 
upon by the monk class or his chosen deity, that should be completed to the
best of the monk's ability.
<br><br>
Poverty can be shown by requiring a tithe to the church, or limiting the 
equipment they can own.  Traditionally in RPGs, monks will not use weapons, 
and have strict limitations on the types of armor they can use.  There is
not usually a restriction on amassing wealth, as that is a standard goal
in online games.  There isn't really a problem with this, as long as monks
have something useful to spend money on (such as healing for the party, or 
higher monetary cost skills).
<br><br>
Traditional monks are nonviolent if possible.  I would hate to see any
mindless PKers play a monk, as that goes against everything they believe
in.
<br><br>
Beyond that, it is important to remember that a monk seeks to find power
from within himself.  Although modern monks have merged the use of technology
with their natural abilities, their bodies are their primary weapons of 
choice.  A monk should prefer to use hands and feet to inflict damage, or
a weapon that fits with the theme, such as a quarterstaff or throwing stars.
A club or mace would probably not be used, even though they may be the
same type of weapon (blunt).
<br><br>
He also seeks to expand his knowledge and his mind, and become one with the 
world around him.  It would benefit a player to explore the world of Norrath 
and learn all there is to know about its history, its deities, and its 
inhabitants.  To contrast, bards typically learn of history through word of
mouth and passing of stories.  A monk would typically learn of history and
tales by visiting libraries and researching volumes.  Hopefully Norrath
will contain some libraries.
<br><br>
Because EverQuest is an online multiplayer game, the focus is on partying.
A warrior is used to take the brunt of attacks.  A wizard is used to dish 
out damage.  A cleric is used to heal the party.  So, where is a monk's 
place?  A monk is what some people refer to as an "option character".  No 
party needs one, but they would be helpful to have along.  For one, they 
should be able to dish out quite a bit of physical damage.  They should be 
very agile and thus able to dodge or parry quite a bit of physical attacks.  
Thus, they will be very useful against standard creatures that parties will 
fight most often.  And, it may be nice to have a monk in your party just so 
you can watch him fight with style.
<br><br>
The monk's lack of equipment could leave him vulnerable to magical damage,
and if such a battle is expected, an enchanter or other magic user should
put some resistances on the monk.  Or the monk could flank the sides, keeping
the generic monsters away from the main battle, which could be fought by a
warrior wearing magical fire-resistant armor and a magical Sword of Wyrm 
Slaying.
<br><br>
Although the historical monk is probably quite unlike any monk you'll find
in an online RPG, if you incorporate some of these historical aspects into 
your character, it will make for a much more rewarding game.  Hopefully 989 
Studios will provide some unique opportunities for a monk to utilize these 
aspects, and discover some wonderful things about the world in which we will 
live.  I hope we will find that EverQuest's monks are not the invincible 
fighters we saw in Bard's Tale, but are still essential for standard combat 
and their secondary skills.
