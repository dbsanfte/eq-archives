'Ello!  My name is Skeve Burden.  We've come 'ere today to SoW...  I mean show ya some of the greatest snakes of the west.  I've been 'andlin' snakes for decades now.  I thought it was about time ta show alla you what <b>beauties</b> these are!
<br><br>
Today we have permission from the authorities in BlackBurrow to head into the depths of the caves so that we can show you the beautiful snake known as a_Giant_Snake.  It's a rare thing to be in these caves where the snakes live...  I only hope that we find a few of them before our host decide they've had enough of us.
<br><br>
Today, because of the restrictions of the locals, I've 'ad to leave my lovely wife behind, but they've allowed me to bring my dog, Sui'cide and, of course, my translator and artist.
<br><br>
The snakes we seek today are some of the deadliest snakes in Norrath, and they sure are gorgeous!  The trick will be finding them.  Sometimes we have to swim a bit to find their lair.  They like to lair at the top of waterways so that they can take advantage of the cooler air.  In this place, the snake has many predators, so they tend to be quite defensive, we'll have to be careful as we climb this...
<br><br>
<em>a_Artist_Translator falls for 120 points of damage.</em><br>
<em>a_Artist_Translator dies.</em>
<br><br>
A well, that's shame, really.  Sui!  Come 'ere girl!  Leave the corpse alone, ya silly dog.
<br><br>
Good girl.
<br><br>
Now that we've reached the top of the waterfall, let's see what we can find!
<br><br>
<em>/em Skeve looks overly excited.</em>
<br><br>
This is great!  Here in the heart of BlackBurrow in search of a deadly snake so that I can disturb it, make it angry, and see how close I can come to getting bitten!  Ain't life grand!
<br><br>
Hold on!  I hear hissing!  That sounds like...
<br><br>
<em>/em Skeve runs madly over several rocks, nearly tripping to his death over the falls no less than three times.</em>
<br><br>
<em>/em Sui shakes her head, and follows along at a distance, refraining from barking at this time.</em>
<br><br>
Lookit 'ere!  A den of a_Giant_Snakes!  Beautiful!  Let me crawl in there and drag one out by its tail, so we can all have a look at it.
<br><br>
<em>/em Sui' glances at Skeve, shakes her head, and quietly runs out of the scene to join her distant cousin Gnolls in their pursuit of a wounded adventurer.</em>
<br><br>
<em>/em Skeve drags a hissing snake longer than his entire body by its tail out of a very small hole.</em>
<br><br>
Ain't she <b>gorgeous</b>!  I'm gonna see if I can get my face way too close to this beautiful girl and talk very loudly...
<br><br>
