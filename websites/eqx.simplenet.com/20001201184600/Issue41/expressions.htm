<I> A Column over the importance of 989 Studios role-playing with the other 
    gamers.</I>
<br><br>
Simply stated, and yet a very good subject to discuss.  Thank you for your
submission!
<br><br>
When speaking about 989 Studios role-playing with other gamers, there are
two ways to think about it.  The first is having the designers play as
regular characters, without anyone knowing they are actually GMs.  I was
a developer of a MUD in which this practice was suggested.  One reason is,
it keeps the developer up to speed on what everyone else has been creating,
and how their piece of the pie fits in with the rest of the game as a whole.
The benefit here is obvious, and can go a long way toward providing an 
in depth consistency throughout.
<br><br>
As a player, the GMs can also see the tactics people use, and problems they
encounter.  This can give them direct, first-hand feedback about whether or not
their intentions have become reality.  Imagine if a developer created a
nasty trap that an unsuspecting player would have to skillfully avoid,
and only if they had a high enough dexterity to do it.  But players discovered 
that if you scoot along the wall, you can avoid the trap completely.  Perhaps
this was intended, and perhaps not.  Unless the developer goes out and
sees what players are doing, and how they are doing it, they will not know
if they were successful.
<br><br>
There is also the whole market research aspect to this.  If you put yourself
in with the players, you can discover what they like, what they don't like,
and what they wish they could do but can't.  This way, the GMs can learn
what to do differently in the next area, or what to fix in the next patch.
<br><br>
Some of this can be done merely by invisibly watching (snooping, in MUD
terms) a player as he goes about his or her adventures.  However, I believe
actually doing it yourself with other players gives you a better perspective
on the reality of the situation the players are in.
<br><br>
The second, and perhaps more interesting way of role-playing is for GMs 
to jump into the role of an NPC and create dynamic events and quests for
players.  Examples of this have been given by Brad in the past.  Perhaps
your favorite shop keeper will "come alive" and start talking to you and
responding to your actions.  Imagine finishing selling your freshly gathered
loot, and as you turn to leave the shop keeper stops you. 
<br><br>
"Wynn!".  
<br><br>
You pause for a moment and wonder what is going on.  
<br><br>
"Yeah you.. the short one with the pointy ears."  
<br><br>
"Umm, yeah?"  
<br><br>
"You have been one of my best suppliers.  I was wondering if you could get
me one of those flaming longswords.  I've had a few... inquiries.  I'll
pay you double!"
<br><br>
Wow, that would be great.  Interacting with NPCs as if they were PCs.  It
generally adds a sense of realism and makes the environment of Norrath more
believable.  It provides a greater sense of immersion and general game 
enjoyment.  Next time you approach a NPC, you will ever be wondering if 
you should stop and talk to them for a moment before moving on.  Perhaps
there is something special behind those eyes.
<br><br>
Quests like that are good to a point.  But they can be severely limited
by the time GMs have to interact with only a select few individuals who
stop to chat and choose to accept the challenge.  Another nice aspect the
GMs can take on is to visit the world as a special character that one would
not normally see.  And I don't mean Aradune.  Instead, an in character 
power, such as one of the Norrath gods.  Imagine if the evil dark elf lord
appeared outside the gates of Qeynos, shooting lighting from his fingertips
to blast the guards.  He shouts to all that they will be destroyed unless
they worship him.  Suddenly in a bright glow, the paladin god appears and 
summons his loyal followers to gather for battle.  
<br><br>
Through their GM powers, they could physically move players from anywhere
in the game into this area, and it would be completely believable.  The
two player groups could then engage in a massive holy war, with the winners
being granted some special boon by their god.  Even if the gods merely clashed 
with each other in a flashy display of magical effects, as the mere mortals 
watched on in awe, I'm certain it would change our impressions of the game.
<br><br>
In general, having the GMs role-play is every bit as important as adding
new features to the game.  By injecting a new character into the game, 
that is, in essence, a new feature as well.  If nothing else, it can
provide a temporary break from the typical monotony of repeatedly killing
the same things that is so often seen in CRPGs.  It has been stated in 
previous chats that things like this will be done, and the effect it has is 
bound to be spectacular.

I would also like to tack on a special invitation for our readers to 
submit more topics to be used in the EXPRESSions feature.  We are starting
to run low on fresh topics, so if you submit, the chances are good you
can see your name in lights!  Just like Syrneus!
