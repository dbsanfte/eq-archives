    "Ye gods!" said Katha irritably as they topped another rise and saw more trees before them.  The forest had thinned out slightly in the past hour, and they had all begun to hope that it meant an end to their cold wet trek cross-country.  But now, looking out across the land laid out in front of them, Kinory realized that the forest went on for leagues yet.  She scrubbed a hand through lank, dirty hair, and turned to Daryth.
<br><br>
   "I don't think that 'west' is good enough anymore, Daryth."  She gestured at the green below.  "We should have stayed with the road."
<br><br>
   "If we had stayed with the road we would be dead.  Have you forgotten the Long Man already? I have not."  He spurred his horse down the hill.  Katha followed, shaking her head.
<br><br>
   The Long Man had been an inn, two nights after the first.  There, too, they had found their enemies waiting, somehow ahead of them again.  Not a lone Militia man, either, but a group of at least ten men, some certainly Rogue-trained.  Galern's cronies, mixed with crack Militia troops, had been a bit harder than one city guard, armed with only a crossbow.  The three of them had fled the inn, barely eluding the trap laid for them, and had shaken off pursuit only by taking to the woods.  Since then, Daryth had driven them west.  They were heading for Rivervale, where he had contacts who could help them get to Qeynos.
<br><br>
   It was slow going off the road, even with the relative sparseness of the forest in this part of the world.  The three of them were moving at less than half the speed they could have on the road.  The fact that they had no choice did not seem to make it wear any less on Daryth.  Day by day, Kinory could see him grow more impatient with their progress.  Kinory knew the reasons for his anxiety, but couldn't feel it herself.  Even the knowledge of the sure and deadly pursuit from Freeport could not diminish her joy at being in the woods again, different as they were from her home.  Huge trees stretched up to the heavens, blocking most of the light, smaller plants struggling to survive in the shadows of their huge cousins.  Everywhere were the tracks of woodland animals.  Owls watched them from the trees, and crickets made the nights noisy with their song.
<br><br>
      "Time to be thinking of camping," Kinory said, coming up beside Daryth.  He grimaced, but nodded.  The sun had dipped below the trees, and the horses could easily damage themselves in the uncertain light, especially among the trees.  
<br><br>
    They had barely two weeks of decent weather left, Kinory judged that night, savoring a bare handful of berries from a late-bearing bush.  A little ways off, Katha huddled in her cloak.  The night breezes had turned bitter this evening.  Each time the sun set, it took a little more of the heat of the day with it.  A rustling behind her announced Daryth's return.  He held a rabbit in one hand, grinning.
<br><br>
  "A lucky toss of a knife," he said.  Katha smiled back and began setting up their spit across the small fire.  Usually they had to wait until morning for Kinory's snares to yield anything.  Kinory drew a knife, and laid the rabbit across a flat rock.  Within half an hour, it was sizzling over the flames.  They had just drawn knives, and portioned out bread and cheese, when Kinory motioned suddenly for silence.  Daryth and Katha snatched at weapons, but before they had half rose, snarled roots burst out of the ground at their feet, entangling them.  Katha, unbalanced, sat again with an oath.  In a trice, the roots had captured her wrists as well.  Daryth hacked at the flailing vegetation.  
<br><br>
   "Stop!"  cried Kinory to the shadowed darkness between the trees.  "We mean no harm!"  Roots clasped her feet, too, but she held her hands out to each side, and they were left free.
<br><br>
   A slim figure dressed in brown and green stepped out from the trees behind Daryth.
<br><br>
   "No harm?" she repeated scornfully.  She glanced at the rabbit dripping on the spit, at the stacked firewood beside it.  
<br><br>
   "Deadwood only, Druid," answered Kinory, firm yet respectful.  "And the rabbit violates no natural law."  The other's lips thinned, but she gave a grudging nod.  She did not release them, however.
<br><br>
   "Druid?" said Katha, from her prone position.
<br><br>
   "Druid," said Daryth, and dropped his rapier.  The roots that had sought his hands wavered in the air and then withdrew.  The woman cast a look at him, hearing the respect in his tone.  She was of middle height, with a shock of brilliantly red hair.  It glowed like autumn leaves in the firelight.  She looked almost like a creature made of wood herself, her skin tanned and creased like bark.  
<br><br>
   "What do you here?" she asked abruptly.  "This is land consecrated to the Mother.  I have not seen travelers here in over a decade."
<br><br>
   Kinory understood her caution, now.  The Druid was dedicated to the land, much like the First of Tunare was in Kelethin, and the First in Qeynos to the Great Tree there.  Ever since the attack on the Great Tree, five years back, the followers of the Mother had become wary and suspicious.  Innoruuk, though beaten, had not left Tunare unscarred.   She had ever been a generous and loving Goddess.
<br><br>
   "Druid," Kinory answered.  "We apologize for bringing the troubles of men to your sanctuary.  We are on our way to Rivervale and have gone astray, obviously."  
<br><br>
   "Rivervale?" said the Druid, and then laughed.  "You have come far astray, indeed.  Go on as you have been, and you would have come not to the Kithikor Pass, but to the mountain home of a particularly nasty orc tribe."  She gestured, and the roots unwound, sliding back into the ground with a snake-like rustling.  "What troubles of men drive you from the road that leads very clearly to your destination?"
<br><br>
  Katha gingerly felt at her abraded wrists.  Daryth gave no sign that the roots had made any impression at all.  Kinory relaxed slightly as the magicked plants released her and opened her mouth to answer.
<br><br>
   "Treachery and murder, Druid," said Daryth, taking charge.  "We fled Freeport some two weeks or so ago.  Bayle was murdered there, and we blamed for his death."
   <br><br>
   The Druid's green eyes narrowed, searching his face.  
<br><br>
   "You are not telling all, cityman," she said at last.  Daryth kept his eyes steady on hers.  "Nor do you say your names."  Her gaze went from Daryth to Katha to Kinory.  She stepped forward, her eyes widening, and the fire leapt up at a small gesture.  "Though perhaps you do not have to give names," she murmured.  "Do you have a brother, Woodelf girl?  A half-blood elf by the name of Gwyn?"
<br><br>
   "How can you know that?" gasped Kinory.
<br><br>
   "Three years back, a group of my brothers came to me with a half-dead half-blood, released by the dervishes at the midsummer festival.  One of their rituals," she explained.  "He was nearly mad, abandoned of his wits and his memory.  We restored him, here, because of the Woodelf traces in his face.  When he was well, he promptly left for the city."  The Druid's mouth twisted slightly.  "Well, we all have our paths to walk.  You have much the look of him in your face, young one."  She leaned forward and brushed a lock of fair, reddish hair from Kinory's face.  "Much the same bitterness, too.  You have come far from your forest home, child of the woods.  When will you return, I wonder?"
<br><br>
  Kinory drew sharply away, her heart hurting.
<br><br>
  "Will you guide us to the Pass, Druid?" asked Daryth.  She turned from Kinory, who took a deep, calming breath and flashed a thankful glance at Daryth.  
<br><br>
   "Perhaps," said the Druid.  "If you give me your names, and your vow to do no harm while you are in these woods."
<br><br>
   "I am Katha."  She rose and bowed formally to the Druid.
<br><br>
   "Daryth, m'lady of the wood."
<br><br>
   "I am…"
<br><br>
   "Kinory, of Kelethin, on Faydwer," finished the Druid for her.  "I am Lyrwen Woodward.  Come with me, if you wish to rest in greater comfort tonight."  She cast a disparaging glance at their rough camp and then set off through the trees.  Brush and scrub gave way before her.  Kinory led the other two in her wake.
