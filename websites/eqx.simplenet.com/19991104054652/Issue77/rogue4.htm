<b>Part Four</b>


<br><br>
   Daryth moved fast, and Kinory tested her limits as she struggled to keep up.  She never once saw him again after that one glimpse by Kelethin, but she didn't give up.  She tracked him through the forest, through the mountain pass that led into the Dwarven lands, and past the great city of the Dwarven folk.   She gaped up at the mighty gates of Kaladin, and wished she could go in, but Daryth's trail never wavered.  She followed him for two weeks, and barely avoided death any number of times.  The plants were different, the animals were different.  The trees themselves were unfamiliar and sparse.  Once she passed the corpse of a lion, and recognized the subtle signs of poison.  Daryth had surely killed it.  
<br><br>
   At last, weary and footsore, she came to the Dwarven docks that bordered on the Ocean of Tears.   And there, on the dock, stood her quarry.  A huge ship was pulling slowly up to the dock, and Daryth stood with three other travelers, waiting.   Kinory stood in the stone arch of the entrance, trying to summon up the nerve to go forward.  She had enough for the fare, she was sure, but going up to pay it meant discovery by Daryth.  He would probably try to send her home.  She squared her shoulders, and boldly stepped forward.  He was just going to have to learn that she was an adult now, and he had no right to send her anywhere.
<br><br>
   She came up behind him, as he haggled with the captain, moving as silently as she could.  There was no reason to hurry a confrontation.
<br><br>
   "Five platinum, then and no less!"  said the captain, a hulking barbarian in greasy stained leather.  
<br><br>
   "As you say," said Daryth, as courteous as a paladin.  He dug into his satchel and came up with 10 shining coins.
<br><br>
   "I have no problem with ye paying more, friend," said the captain, and let out a raucous laugh.  "Can ye not count?"
<br><br>
   "The other fare is for her," said Daryth, jerking a thumb over his shoulder.  The barbarian transferred his gaze to Kinory.  She gaped at Daryth's back as he walked casually up the ramp to the deck of the ship.  He never looked back once. 
<br><br>
   She followed him wordlessly down below to a tiny cabin that boasted two bunks and a porthole, and stood uncertainly in the doorway as he slung his pack beneath one cot, and then stretched out on the bed. It was only then that he at last settled his eyes on her.   She tore her own gaze away, and thrust her pack under the remaining bed.  She sat down, legs folded beneath her, and looked out the porthole.  An endless expanse of water greeted her eyes, and she wrenched them quickly away, her stomach lurching.  The largest body of water that she had seen was the small river that ran through Felwithe.  The only thing left to look at was him, and so she finally met his gaze.
<br><br>
   "You knew," she said accusingly.
<br><br>
   "Yes," replied the Rogue.   
<br><br>
   "Why?  Why did you let me follow you?  I thought you didn't want me here."  She looked down and picked at the stitching in one boot.
<br><br>
   "Well, if you're going to argue for me sending you home, there's still time to toss you over the side."  She glared at him, and he grinned.
<br><br>
   "Why?"  she demanded.
<br><br>
   "When have I ever explained myself to you?" he said annoyingly.  "Perhaps I was bored."
<br><br>
   "So glad to be a diversion," she muttered, and flung herself back onto the cot.
<br><br>
   "Well, divert me then," he said, and sat up.  "Tell me the thiefsign for noisy dogs in the house."
<br><br>
   "What?" she exclaimed, startled.
<br><br>
   "I'm curious how much of that training you managed to retain."
<br><br>
   "You have got to be..."
<br><br>
   "Noisy dogs.  What's the sign?"
<br><br>
    The entire voyage was like that.  By the time the boat reached Freeport, Kinory was heartily sick of Daryth's company.  He didn't let up once, grilling her on every aspect of the guild to which he belonged.  She felt like a prize horse being put though its paces.  And, true to form, never once in that long month and a half did he express the slightest sign of approval or pride.  She nearly ran onto the Freeport docks.
<br><br>
    Kinory was highly unimpressed by Freeport.  Daryth led her into the city proper, past two guards that curled their lips at Daryth and smirked at her, running their eyes up and down her body.  She found herself desiring a bath.  Daryth glanced down at her.
<br><br>
   "Pleasant fellows, aren't they?"  he remarked.
<br><br>
   "I can't imagine what Gwyn was doing with... them." 
<br><br>
   "The border patrols are much different," Daryth told her.  "Much more the noble ideal of the warrior.  These fellows are the bottom dregs, put on sentry duty to keep the peace and police the city.  Fools and ruffians, mostly."
<br><br>
   The city was grey and dirty.  Occasionally they passed by beautiful temples and palaces, but they were always surrounded by high walls or fences, set back from the street, and guarded by sentries.  Kinory covered her nose and mouth with a hand as they went by an alley.  Inside, a tattered figure raised its head groggily and stretched out a wavering hand.
<br><br>
   "Spare a copper, miss?" the beggar pleaded.   She pressed up against Daryth, eyes wide.  He took her arm and pulled her forward.
<br><br>
   "Not much like Kelethin, is it?" he said, mouth twisting in a wry grin.  "The world isn't particularly pretty, my dear."
<br><br>
   Kinory said nothing.  The sexless pile of rags subsided into the corner, muttering.
<br><br>
   Somewhere further on, Daryth turned into another alley.  He tapped twice in passing on a door, and led her further in.  The alley dead ended just ahead, and as they approached the wall, it swung open on concealed hinges to admit them into a dim, low-ceilinged corridor.   Kinory silently followed Daryth into the gloom.
