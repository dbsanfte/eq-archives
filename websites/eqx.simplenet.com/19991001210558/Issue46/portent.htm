Paladriel of Fay restrung his precious oaken bow as he lay pressed against the green grasses of the rolling Rathian bluffs. Testing the horsehairs with a harmonic pluck, he was satisfied with his weapon and lay it carefully beside him as he glanced to the east across the barren breast of southern Antonica. The ranger pleated his brows in his usual halcyon expression. Bright blue eyes slowly observed their surroundings; a long, thin nose was flared and pinkish in the cold night air. Paladriel waited, motionless for a time, and nature gave no note of his tarrying on the hillsides. The mountains behind him rimmed the tranquil Rujarkian in a dim gray under the night sky. Silver moon, shining through gulfs in the spacious clouds, illuminated portions of 
the range where moonbeams hit, setting the distance rock faces alive 
with a silver glow. The bright flush of light from the mounts failed to 
reveal the ranger, clad in a dark green mantle and brown greaves. 
Garnished head to toe in leaves and shrubbery, Paladriel lay sprawled 
covertly on the crest of a steep knoll, overlooking a sloping precipice. 
The land sunk into a modest vale as it met the clutter of the deep 
timberlands and vanished under the shadows. 
<br><br>
	The ranger absently munched on a grainy stick of licorice as he 
listened to the night sounds. Crickets chirped, filling the night air 
with a million shrill cries in the distance. The echoing howl of wolves 
sounded from the southwestern mountains, and from the jungles far south 
the faint bawls of some unidentifiable creature could be heard. From 
Paladriel's vantage point in the shallow banks leading to the mountain 
ranges, he could just make out a faint glow of light far to the east. 
That was distant Qeynos, resting on the other side of the wide plains 
that formed the middle western portion of the Antonica mainland. 
A faint rustling caught the ranger's ear, the light pat of footfalls on 
the grass bed. They approached with the rhythm of a feline. Paladriel 
grunted slightly, he had been waiting for his scoutmate to return to 
their surveying position for nearly an hour. He didn't look back to 
identify the sound, but calmy welcomed the interloper, "What was the 
holdup Jorvin?" he asked.
<br><br>
The other ranger skittered silently beside Paladriel, a confused smirk 
on his face. Jorvin knelt low, his body much more lithe then Paladriels. His youth was apparent in his stimulated surveys of the valley and 
forests, and while Paladriel sported a gristly mustache and beard, 
Jorvin's face was smooth and fuzzless. He straightened his beret before 
quietly answering, "Tis very stange Pal. There are definitely signs of a 
march toward the east, but the trail leads right into the thick of 
forest and disappears totally. Then, wherever the woods open into a 
clearing, the trail appears again. It's as if the army were going over 
miles of dense woodland in a single step."
<br><br>
Paladriel squinted his eyes as he mused, "What would motivate orcs to 
even attempt a pass through Jaggedpine? What do you make of it?"
<br><br>
	Jorvin clicked his teeth habitually as he thought, "I'm not certain yet 
Pal. But we do know that they turned north. They are definitely heading 
this way."
<br><br>
	"And the trails suggest five thousand." Paladriel added.
<br><br>
	"Five thousand is unprecedented. This would make the Grobb siege seem 
like a camp out."
<br><br>
Paladriel smirked, "They are in our element now. An Orc army has no 
place in Karana."
<br><br>
	Jove nodded, Paladriel scanned the horizon, "When will they arrive at 
the bluffs?" 
<br><br>
	"I'd say about an hour or two before dawn."
Paladriel nodded. He settled in the grassy knoll crowning the top of the 
foothills rimming the Karana. Out in the vast forest before him, silent 
and unmoving, were his six-hundred and forty-three comrades, hiding in 
wait for the battle to come.
<br><br>

	"SAA-NENN, SANENN, SAA-NENN..."
<br><br>
	The rhythmic orcish battle hym stirred the two rangers from their 
trance. They had first heard the orcish drums only half an hour before 
as they echoed across miles of mountainside. It was still dark, and the 
earth below the bluffs was pitch black. The moons were cloaked by a deep 
overcast that had settled over the area several hours before. In the 
dark, the two rangers listened intently as the alien chant grew closer. 
Neither Paladriel nor Jorvin spoke a word since hearing the war drums, 
and now they peered below into the forest, trying to penetrate the wall 
of blackness that lingered over their eyes. The echoing of hundreds of 
footfalls in cadence danced in Paladriels ears. The bellows of the 
marching orcs filled the night air, dwarfing the incessant nocturnal 
sounds of nature. The ground below the two rangers shook slightly, the 
beating march of the army stirring the very earth. 
<br><br>
	"How can they see where they are going?" Jorvin asked, his voice barely 
audible above the clashing and chanting.
<br><br>
	Paladriel shook his head, "They are about a hundred yards south of us."
<br><br>
	Jorvin nodded, "You'll have to risk it."
<br><br>
	Paladriel snorted and readied his bow, pointing it at where he thought 
his target was. He inhaled deeply as he drew the bow and held the arrow 
pointing down at his goal. Everything was lightless, Paladriel frowned 
in hesitation. Jorvin opened his kindle box and ignited a small torch. 
Carefully, he applied the flame to the tip of Paladriel's arrow, and it 
flared. 
<br><br>
	Just as Paladriel released, a thin spire of moonlight spilled through a 
break in the clouds. The sliver cascaded into the shallow valley, and 
the two rangers caught glimpse of the orcish army. At first it seemed as 
though the ground itself were crawling, but then the individual brigades 
could be distinquished. The army filled the narrow knoll between the 
foothills and the forest, and it extended south beyond the reach of the 
eye. This sight only lasted a bare moment, and the clouds reclaimed the 
rogue moonbeam. The whistling of Paladriels flaming arrow was a bare 
whisper in the darkness, then it halted abruptly. A deafening roar 
echoed and a blinding flare illuminated the country side. Far below, a 
prepared trench ignited in flames and lit the entire valley. Paladriel's 
aim was true. The rangers smiled in exultation, awaiting the subsequent 
showering of arrows and magery on the visible and immobile army by their 
fellow rangers below. But something was wrong, smiles faded, and 
expressions of disbelief  coalesced.
<br><br>
	In the dim orange of the firelight, the orcish army was gone...
<br><br>
	No chants, no drums, no marching. Only the sounds of the crickets and 
the howling of the wolves could be heard. Where the army had been only 
moments before in the moonlight, there now lay only grass and shrubbery. 
<br><br>
	Jorvin gasped in astonishment, Paladriel's eyes widened in a similiar 
expression.
<br><br>
	"Sorcery? What is this?" Jorvin asked. Down below, a few rangers crept 
from their concealment to scout the area for traps. Paladriel shook his 
head, confused, "Perhaps we'll know more in the morn..."
<br><br>
	Silence...
<br><br>
	Paladriel halted his sentence as soon as it happened. The crickets 
stopped chirping, the wind stopped blowing. Silence fell upon the land 
as if it were tangible. Deathlike silence, a quiet alien to the nature 
that the two rangers were accustomed to. As this happened, the trench 
fires in the valley below extinguished suddenly. Paladriel heard Jorvin 
swear in the darkness. His sightless eyes bulged and dilated. He seemed 
hesitant even to breathe, and he sensed a new presence. Nature bated her 
breath soundlessly, and Paladriel sensed terror rising in his throat. A 
quiet voice whispered in the back of his mind, but it didn't speak with 
words. It was then that the ranger knew his death was near.
Paladriel sighed.
<br><br>
A sharp scream echoed from the forest, followed by a loud commotion. In 
the dark, Paladriel and Jorvin could hear the twanging of arrows being 
fired, and the shouts of rangers below. Framing the noise was the 
intense fluttering of leaves and branches, as if huge masses were 
crashing through them. Moments later, the cloud layer broke and silver 
twilight spilled in from the sky. Another shriek, suddenly stilled, 
echoed over the bluffs. 
<br><br>
"What is going on Pal?" Jorvin's voice was near panic, "I mean...what 
the hell---,"
<br><br>
Paladriel interjected, "We have go down and see." Jorvin nodded, his 
eyes bulging from fear and confusion. The two rangers ran down the bluff 
and onto the narrow knoll in a matter of moments. Before them, the 
forest was a maelstrom of panicked noise and shaking foliage. Paladriel 
faltered for a moment, stopping suddenly about a hundred yards from the 
thicket wall. Between the foliation the rangers thought they saw 
glimpses of manlike shadows--silhouettes whipping across the moonlighted 
gulfs in the bosks and copses of the forest. Though the brief images 
were man shaped, they seemed strangely inhuman and it was clear those 
shadows did not belong to the rangers. The speeds at which they moved 
were fantastic.
<br><br>
	Then, as suddenly as it arrived, all tumult stopped. The shaking and 
rustling of branches and leaves halted. Paladriel and Jorvin warily 
approached the forest edge. Only their breathing and careful footfalls 
could be heard. Paladriel readied his bow, Jorvin did the same. The fire 
trench smoldered twenty yards to their left, leaving a heavy scent of 
tar and pitch in the air. The two men still couldn't discern what had 
extinguished it.
<br><br>
Then the sound of running footfalls and exhausted panting was heard from 
the forest. The rangers stopped, ready to let loose their arrows if the 
approaching sounds yielded some harmful apparition. But they did not, a 
ranger appeared from the dark embrace of the forest. His hair was matted 
and bloodied against his forehead, his eyes were wild with terror and 
amazement. The ranger's cuiribolli vest and trousers were ripped in 
tatters, no doubt from running crazed through the forest. He looked at 
Paladriel and Jorvin with only a bare hint of recognition
<br><br>
"Kane?" Jorvin asked as he recognized the bewildered man standing at the 
forest break, "Kane, what happened?"
<br><br>
The ranger limped quickly toward him, motioning them away, "Go back! Go 
back!" the voice was gurgly and hoarse. Paladriel hesitated, peering 
amazed at Kane as he gated awkardly toward them. Jorvin continued to 
shout questions at the ranger about the condition of the rest of the 
men. He was about to go to Kane and help him, but Paladriel grabbed him 
by the shoulder, his eyes fixed and glassy on the shadowy thickets 
behind the distraught ranger.
<br><br>
"I saw something." he said apprehensively.
<br><br>
Jorvin glanced at Paladriel, then back at Kane, who seemed to know what 
Paladriel had glimpsed and scrambled wildly. The two rangers stepped 
warily back, giving gestures of encouragement to the panicked ranger. 
<br><br>
Then Kane was gone...
<br><br>
It had happened too quickly. The ranger was snatched back into the 
shadows of the wood like a rag doll being swept up by a rambunctious 
child. Kane gave a brief shriek, then nothing.
<br><br>
He was gone.
<br><br>
Paladriel and Jorvin blinked in amazement. Another scream was heard at 
the frontiers of the wood, then a rustling. A moment later a low moan 
could be discerned farther away.
<br><br>
"He's being dragged." Paladriel remarked grimly, "But he's still alive." 
<br><br>
Jorvin was pale and clammy.
<br><br>
"Where are the rest? What are we going to do?" Jorvin's voice was on the 
verge of breaking and Paladriel was reminded of the rangers youth. He 
looked around, to the east and west, north and south. Finally, Paladriel 
conceded the course of action reluctantly to himself.
<br><br>
"We have to make a break for it." Paladriel said, "Through the forest, 
now."
<br><br>
Jorvin started, "Are you crazy? What was that thing that got Kane?"
"I don't know, but it's probably busy with him, giving us a chance to 
escape."
<br><br>
"The foothills Paladriel, lets go back up." Jorvin entreated 
desperately.
<br><br>
Paladriel dropped his bow and fletching on the ground. With a resilute 
stare toward the north he muttered, "What makes you think the foothills 
are any safer then where we are now? Come on Jorvin." With that, 
Paladriel prowled swiftly to the forest periphery. Jorvin followed. When 
they reached the thickening, Paladriel spoke in intense whispers, "We 
run northeast, toward the shrine. Don't stop. With luck we can reach the 
river inside two hours."
<br><br>
With that, Paladriel patted Jorvin on the shoulder and nodded 
assuringly. Jorvin nodded and the two leaped into a desperate run. Both 
fear and determination carried them swiftly over the foliage. Whatever 
got Kane had both strength and speed, and would no doubt run them down 
if they were spotted. Through the misty forest awning, thin shafts of 
moonlight reached down to the earthbed. Both rangers looked around as 
they fled, but they saw no sign of their fellow rangers. Paladriel was 
steadily outdistancing Jorvin. The lead runner looked over his shoulder 
from time to time to check on his younger comrade. He motioned for 
Jorvin to keep up, Jorvin in a burst of trepidated adrenaline did so. 
Neither could shake the feeling that something was watching them.
They fled through the forest, leaping over fallen trunks and ducking low 
branches. High above, the sky began to lighten into a deep blue, 
somewhere to the east the sun was beginning to peek from its firmament 
on the horizon. Jorvin began to silently rejoice, as this forested 
nightmare was about to be left behind him.
<br><br>
Then it took Paladriel.
<br><br>
The ranger was snatched up in a blur of motion. He was carried upward so 
suddenly, Jorvin didn't realize he was gone at first. No sound, no cry, 
just gone.
<br><br>
Jorvin spun around. The ranger shot panicked glances above and behind. 
The thin branches swayed gently above, hinting that Paladriel had been 
taken up through the canopy. The peculiar scent of brimstone hung in the 
air. Jorvin was alone now, his eyes wild in confusion and terror. 
Realizing his friend was gone, he did not tarry for long. He ran north 
by east, toward the Shrine of Karana, knowing nothing else but the need 
to escape.
<br><br>
He did not see, far above him, the bodies of his fellow rangers dangling 
from the treetops. Nor did he notice, far above that, a dark shadow cast 
upon the forest. Slowly it glided, toward the West, toward the Great 
Gulf.
<br><br>
Toward Erudin...
