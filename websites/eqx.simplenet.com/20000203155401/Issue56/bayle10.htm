The small, clumsy ship scudded along before the breeze, travelling along the sandy shore of the Desert of Ro.  The stars above reflected in the waters of the Ocean of Tears, giving the illusion of endless sky and making the Orcs in the ship very uncomfortable.
<br><br>
Gromf paced back and forth along the deck restlessly, watching the shoreline for any movements or light, his large hands squeezing the hilt of the sword at his belt tightly in his nervousness.  The loud clump of heavily booted feet on the deck behind him caused him to turn to see his commander walking up to him.  He quickly bowed his head in respect as Krot, sub-Warlord of the Crushbone Clan, stopped before him, nodding his bald head in response.
<br><br>
Krot's voice was low and gravelly as he spoke.  "What Gromf see?"
<br><br>
"No lights, no moving, nobody."  Gromf turned his eyes back to the shoreline, straining his night vision to see the dangers he felt were there but could not see.
<br><br>
The Warlord grunted.  "Orcs finish mission good."
<br><br>
Gromf turned and regarded his commander, whispering.  "What orcs' mission?"
<br><br>
"When land, orcs find big temple.  Orcs find Deathfist Clan shaman.  Orcs give message.  Orcs leave."  Krot nodded his head, agreeing with himself and dismissing further discussion on the topic.
<br><br>
Gromf nodded his head confidently and continued his watch.
<br><br>
An hour later, Krot gave a signal and the Orcs manned the oars and turned the ship inland.  Running it aground awkwardly (Orcs not being the best of sailors), the centurions donned their armour and equipment.  The Warlord motioned for them to follow, then he hopped clumsily over the side of the boat into the water and quickly made his way to the shore.  Like ants, the others followed, swarming over the side and splashing noisily into the water.
<br><br>
The group fanned out with Gromf and Krot in the lead and proceeded over the dunes that lined the shore.  As they crested the first dune, Krot glanced down and saw a campfire burning brightly with a single figure seated before it.  Krot grinned toothily, then made a motion with his hand, circling the dune, and two groups of orcs separated, one going right and the other left, moving to surround the camp.
<br><br>
When his night vision detected that his soldiers were in place, he motioned for those still with him to follow and he slid down the sandy incline and approached the campfire.
<br><br>
The figure sitting near the fire was facing the approaching orcs, but showed no indication that he noticed or cared.  He was clad in mismatched leather clothing and a dirty robe, sipping from a bottle that bore no label.  When the Warlord stepped into the fire light and growled, the human lifted his head and tried to focus his bleary eyes on the massive orc.
<br><br>
"Wha'--?  An orc!  An' a green one too!" The man's speech was slurred and he swayed a bit as he gazed up at the Warlord.  "What're you doing here, baldy? *hic*"
<br><br>
Krot chuckled, thinking his soldiers would enjoy a bit of sport before continuing on.  He gestured with one hand and one of his centurions started walking around the fire towards the dervish. 
<br><br>
The dervish smiled lazily, took a long swig of his wine, appeared to stagger a bit, then spun and spit the wine out at the approaching orc, over the flickering flames of the fire.  The fluid ignited and covered the centurion in flame, screaming and howling as he caught fire.  He fell to the ground, rolling in the sand and franticly slapping out the flames.
<br><br>
The orcs growled in anger and turned to face the human, hands going to weapons.  The human stood before them, no longer appearing bleary eyed, and smiled ferally.  "You've no idea what you're facing, beast.  You are on MY land now."
<br><br>
"You die, little human."  The Warlord's voice was low and threatening as he stepped around the fire to crush the life from this little bug.
<br><br>
The dervish just smiled bigger and snapped his fingers.  From all over the camp, the hissing of falling sand was heard as a score dervish warriors slid from hiding to stand circling the orcs.  Clad in robes and cloaks, all the colour of the sand itself, they wielded wicked, curved blades that gleamed in the firelight.
<br><br>
Krot glanced about him, rage boiling up from his stomach.  Drawing his sword, he threw his head back and roared, "Now!"
<br><br>
There was the sound of a wet thump as something was thrown over the edge of the dune from the darkness and rolled into the firelight.  It was the severed head of an orc centurion.  Then another.  One by one, the heads of the centurions that had flanked the camp rolled into the firelight.
<br><br>
"Your men seem to have lost their way in the night.  Easy to do in the desert.  In fact," the dervish pulled a long, curvy blade from his clothing, "entire armies have been known to vanish here without a trace."
<br><br>
The screams could be heard across the desert for most of the night, though only the spiders and asps were there to hear.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Maclir crept through the forests of Lesser Faydark, his magical camouflage pulled about him tightly, his steps careful and deliberate to not generate a sound.  The Teir'dals' chanting was loud in his ears as he circled the clearing, peering about and listening intently.
<br><br>
More information was needed, that much was obvious.  He had told no one of his plans, not wanting to have to deal with people following him.  Now he regretted that decision and cursed to himself.
<br><br>
The Teir'dal were speaking to each other in their own language, one that he did not understand.  This made it impossible to determine what they were doing or how they got here.  The only other creature there was the Troll, and he spoke not at all.  He just sat there and grumbled.
<br><br>
As he was moving to a new location, the scene before him changed.  A female Teir'dal entered the clearing, though unlike any he had ever seen.  She was slender, almost frail, and had the most beautiful and delicate features he had ever seen, though her beauty was an evil one.  She made no noise when she moved and she walked with the grace of a cat.
<br><br>
She stepped into the clearing alone and waited.  The reaction of the others was immediate.  The priests instantly stopped chanting and regarded her, almost fearfully.  The head priest tentatively got up and walked over to her, stopping a few feet away, as if afraid to come any closer.  The Troll, Prince Kral, simply regarded her dully from where he sat.
<br><br>
"M'lady Tisnya Darvie," the head priest seemed surprised to see her and spoke in heavily accented Common.  "To what do we owe this pleasure?"
<br><br>
When she spoke, her voice was quiet, like the rustling of leaves on a forest floor.  "I hunt tonight, and thought to satisfy my curiosity as to your progress."  She took a slight step forward, smiling faintly as the priest flinched back a bit.
<br><br>
Then she paused and lifted her head, as if smelling the air.  She turned her head to the side, gazing about, and her eyes rested upon Maclir.  Seeing her eyes for the first time, Maclir felt a cold chill in his heart… they were red as blood.  She smiled again, showing fanged teeth, and said, "and it appears prey is close at hand."
<br><br>
He did not see her move, but suddenly she had covered half the distance between them and was almost upon him.  Forsaking stealth for speed, he exploded from his cover like a startled pheasant and took off.
<br><br>
His mind raced with his feet, trying to think of a way out of this sudden mess.  He knew she was faster, but believed he could outsmart her as he was wood-born and she was obviously not.  Darting under fallen trunks, through bushes that would tear at her, he made his way towards safety.  Far behind, he heard the thundering sound that must be the Troll plowing through the woods, but he heard no other sound.
<br><br>
About the time he believed he had eluded the pursuit and was turning his head to see, something hit him hard in the back, sending him tumbling to the ground.  He rolled to his knees, gasping for breath and looked around for his assailant.  He found nothing.
<br><br>
Not needing two chances, he rose to his feet and took off again.  After a few steps, however, he stopped.  Something was wrong.  He glanced around and realized… he was lost.  Never in his life had he been lost in these woods, but he had no idea where he was.  His brain felt fuzzy, like he was drunk or drugged, though he knew he had imbibed nothing for a long time, being the sober fellow he was.
<br><br>
Out of the corner of his eye he spotted something and turned just in time to see the vampire lunging at him.  He ducked and took off again, going the opposite direction of her lunge, leaving her laughing behind him.
<br><br>
He ran like an elf possessed, trying desperately to clear his head of the webs that cluttered it.  He heard nothing behind him so he turned to glance back…and slammed full tilt into the mailed gut of a Troll.  He rebounded from the plate and chainmail, dizzy and stunned, and slammed into the ground.  As he was shaking his head and trying to get up, he felt the vice-like grip of a huge hand grab him around the throat and lift him from the ground.
<br><br>
Prince Kral held Maclir at arm's length and regarded him evenly, reaching up with two fingers to pull the elf's sword from his belt before he could reach for it.  The Ranger tried in vain to dislodge the Troll's fingers from around his throat, and felt consciousness leaving him as he heard a voice.
<br><br>
"Release him, Troll," hissed the vampire.
<br><br>
Kral looked at the undead Teir'dal and frowned.  "Priest say we need him.  Kral catch him.  He is ours.  You lose, dead inkie."
<br><br>
Tisnya snarled, showing long fangs and longer claws and stepped towards the Troll.  Unconcerned, Kral reached over his shoulder and drew his sword, a massive piece of edged Combine steel easily 10' long, and wielded it one handed, the other hand holding Maclir dangling and twitching.
<br><br>
Just before hostility broke out, the head priest stumbled into the clearing, panting and gasping for breath.  He stepped between them and faced Tisnya.  "M'lady, please, we need him.  He is important to the Favoured One, as he has information we need before he is killed."
<br><br>
Tisnya glared at the Teir'dal and, for a moment, the priest feared for his life.  Then she nodded, turned, and left the clearing.
<br><br>
"Good thing she leave," rumbled Kral.  "Me hate to have to chop inkie.  Bad for alliance."
<br><br>
The priest turned and stared at the Troll incredulously.  The Troll returned the gaze with an unreadable expression on his huge, warty face.  Sighing, the priest turned and walked off into the woods.  Kral shook the elf one last time to make sure he was knocked out, then tossed him over his shoulder and followed.
