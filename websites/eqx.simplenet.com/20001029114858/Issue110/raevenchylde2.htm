	Months had passed since my brother and I had first set foot into the Toxxulia Forest and began our adventures. We still tended to our schooling between ventures, showing up long enough to breeze through exams and dazzle our classmates with our above average grasp of the arts. Any time I did not spend in that forest I spent in the library poring over all the tomes I could read. As I absorbed the formulae for new and more powerful spells, I quickly realized that I did not have some of the intellectual components necessary to read some of the more advanced texts. Some of the books were written in archaic tongues. Long forgotten languages, which seemed highly guarded by the elders of the isle. I decided that expanding my ground was my only option. Surely there would be someone beyond the crossing who could assist me in my endeavors.
<br><br>
	I went to the palace to seek the guidance of the wizard's guild. 
<br><br>
"You seem a bit young to be venturing off the Island," said Josper Kenshed, one of the learned trainers of the Crimson Hand, "but I see you have learned much in your exploits here. I do have an errand that needs to be run, and you may find some enlightenment along the path. In the peaks of Everfrost there is a clan of goblins who carry beads made of an interesting substance. Ice that does not melt when exposed to warmer climates. Bring me some of these beads, and I will reward you for your efforts." 
<br><br>
	He then handed me a fairly good-sized backpack and instructed me to fill it with the beads. 
<br><br>
"May you find what you seek." He said and tuned to his studies once more.
<br><br>
	I took the pack home with me and prepared a travel pack of my own. I used the money I had obtained from my past dealings with the kobolds of the forest, purchased enough food and water to last me several days, and headed for the port. I passed through town and stepped onto the azure gem that transported me to the closed chamber that served as a staging area for visitors to Erudin. This corridor was flanked on either side by smoothed marble walls and had pools of the clear water that permeated the island's plentiful water table. I stepped down from the receiver gem and proceeded across the chamber to the exit at the other end. An odd man was approaching from the other direction, and I became a bit unsettled as I felt his penetrating gaze turn to me. 
<br><br>
"Shed the restraints of Order," he bellowed. "The powers of Chaos beckon! Turn away from the hobbling restraints that shackle you to be forever powerless against your fellows and embrace Discord!"
<br><br>
	This odd pale man then reached for me and grasped my arm tightly with his powerful hand. He then stared straight into my eyes as if he were reading my very soul.
<br><br>
	"A seeker of power. You shall come to me," he said and then abruptly loosed his grip.
<br><br>
	I stared at this odd man stunned at his audacity, but at the same time fearful of the raw power I felt coursing through the hands that had so tightly subdued me. With his words echoing through my head, I resumed my course to the harbor. The sun shone brightly on the rocks, which surrounded the port. There were street vendors and bakers peddling their wares strewn sparsely about the port. The Port Authority building stood directly in front of me, and to the right lay the loading docks. The salty air washed over me in rhythm with the waves that crashed upon the shoreline. The sights and sounds of the port were scintillating and intoxicating. It meant I was truly beginning my quest for knowledge. The tranquility of the ocean was to be my fate for now, and I would drink it in with body and soul.
<br><br>
The Sea King was pulling into the harbor just as I boarded the skiff that ferries passengers back and forth between the docks and the waiting ships. It was an impressive vessel, with sails that reached for the heavens and billowed with the clouds. As I boarded, I realized that I was a bit unstable on that rocking and swaying transport and decided to sit down. We set sail soon enough, and my eyes were met with the vast expanse of ocean that was Erud's Crossing. My elders had once sailed these very waters to escape the world that I so desperately longed to experience. It seemed that nothing would stand in my way now.
<br><br>
There were a few other souls aboard the Sea King for that voyage, but they all seemed to be members of the crew.  I was too enticed by the light of the sun dancing upon the waves to be overly concerned with making conversation, so the ride was relatively silent. 
<br><br>
After a day's travel, we finally reached the port of my first new town.
<br><br>
"Boat to port!" shouted one of the ship hands. 
<br><br>
	There were various shouts in response. People getting ready to board and others getting cargo ready to load. The setting sun cast a dingy shadow across the face of this city cast in stone. The walls were gray and sullen, and the place looked like a once seized castle. Humans milled around the docks shouting and yelling over each other. Rats fled the wharf as the boat pulled in to dock.  I walked down the gangplank and set foot on dry land again.  The bustle here was horribly confusing. People everywhere selling exotic and mundane wares alike. 
<br><br>
I stepped through the gates of the city and was met with an astonishing sight. A towering construct loomed above me. "The Grounds of Fate" read the sign above a cavernous archway. I could here cheering and roaring from inside. I stepped through the archway far enough to see inside. I stood agape at the sights inside. Two large men clad in full armor were bearing down heavily upon each other.  In a flash of blades and armor, the men collided. The larger of the two brought a large mallet crashing into the shoulder of the other with a thunderous clang. The smaller man recovered surprisingly quickly from the blow and retaliated with a single thrust of his sword, striking the larger man solidly in the neck. Blood gushed from beneath the heavy plate and the behemoth fell to his knees. The crowd of onlookers roared as the victor removed his helmet to reveal pointed ears and hair of spun gold. Silvery eyes glinted in satisfaction as the remaining combatant basked in the glory of his victory.
<br><br>
I turned my eyes from this display thinking that this was a strange world indeed.  With night falling upon the city, I grew tired and headed to the inn across the way from the grounds of fate. I rented a room and lay down to rest for the night.
<br><br>
Early the next morning I woke to the sounds of the bustling market. The sounds there never ceased, they just reached varying degrees of volume and clamor. The morning sun shone through the dingy window that served as my view upon the Qeynos Square bestowing a rather brownish caste to the room.  I gathered my things and wandered down stairs.
<br><br>
The sounds intensified as I walked into the square. The roar of the crowd was almost unbearable, so I made my way towards the North side of the city. The bustle of the square subsided as I walked deeper into the city. Humans and half elves were the main stock here. Their fair skin was a welcome change to my eyes. All of them seemed indifferent to the fact that I was unlike them, and the merchants called to me just as they would any other passer by.  The city's appearance much improved the farther north I went. I passed through a quaint residential area and came eventually to a towering clock covered in runic writings. The clock ticked loudly as its inner workings labored away at the hours. 
<br><br>
I mused over this mechanical magic. Even the endless enchantments of Erudin paled in my imagination to what might be going on inside that towering box of gears and dials.  I would love nothing more than to meet the gnomes who put this together. All I knew of their culture came from the tales of my parents and the books that I had read. Erudite authors wrote those books, and as I knew too well, racial imbalances tend to color history in the favor of the authors. 
<br><br>
I proceeded through the city until finally I came to the north gate. There were many people coming and going. I had to step lightly for fear of knocking someone over or stepping on unprotected toes. I walked north along the road. It was a bright and sunny morning. The sun shone down on the hills of Qeynos and warmed me to the core. I wandered along the well-trodden path until I came to a guard tower. I asked one of the guards if he could instruct me on how to get to Everfrost. 
<br><br>
The guard glared at me and said, "Head straight north from here. The cave has a dog-shaped entrance. You can't miss it."
<br><br>
"Thank you very much," I said as I turned to head north. I heard the guard snickering behind me as though there were something he wasn't telling me. I paid him no mind and proceeded as his directions dictated. Sure enough, there was the cave entrance. The portal was definitely canine in form. Large teeth were carved into a ledge that protruded over a gaping cavern in the side of the mountain. I could see that there was a grim light emanating from inside this terrible visage. I mentally prepared some of the more potent spells that I had learned from the library back home and stepped carefully into the cave. There was a long and winding corridor leading me into the mountain. The deeper I went in the more trepidation washed over me. I heard howling coming from within that cave. The howling was quite similar to that of the kobolds I was used to dealing with in Toxxulia forest, so my fear subsided slightly. I eventually came to an open area with a large chasm carved into the center of the ground. I could hear water rushing somewhere near the bottom of that crevasse. There were bones and droppings lining the floor of this place, and a canine odor permeated the air. 
<br><br>
"This doesn't seem right," I thought as I approached the chasm. 	
<br><br>
I looked over the edge of this expansive void to see that there was a bridge spanning the width of an underground lake that was being fed from a waterfall somewhere off in the distance. The water, although obviously not still, smelled stagnant and tainted. A thick mineral smell mixed with the already canine scent of this place. I felt the rot and disease of this place clawing at me, and knew that I should not tarry too long here.
<br><br>
I saw one of the canine inhabitants of these labyrinthine caves traversing this bridge. It seemed roughly man sized, and was covered in matted bluish black fur. Its face was extended into a snout resembling that of a wild dog. Its mottled nose wrinkled as it sniffed the air and stopped dead in its tracks. It sniffed a bit more then whipped around to face my direction. When it caught sight of me, it raised a resounding howl that echoed out of the crevasse and bounced of the walls of the caverns. I could hear howls of response coming from all directions and tuned to run. As I turned, I was met with an enormous jackal like face. There was wild intelligence in that face, and hatred. 
<br><br>
The beast was right on top of me, and there was no way I could cast in time to fend for myself. The beast bashed me with its burly forearm and knocked me backward into the crevasse.  I fell for what seemed like an eternity and landed with an enormous thud. My leg twisted under me as I landed with a disheartening snap. The pain was more than excruciating and my mind blurred with the realization that I may soon die, devoured by the hellish mob that was rapidly approaching. I heard the howling of the beasts surround me and smelled the stench of this place fill my nostrils. My thoughts were leaving me, but I swore I saw a glint of steel flash before me. Suddenly the hunting cries turned to battle cries, and the world faded away from me.
