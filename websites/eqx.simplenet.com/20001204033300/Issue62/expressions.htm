<em>I would like to suggest that you do a topic on the fun that can be had interacting with other players on a RPG.  Your first article had a bad impression of group interactions,  mabey you could write a good story, and article about conquering a dragon with the help of several player types and personalities,  and show what the real fun RPG'er would do.

I'm not sure which article you are referring to, but I know there has been some pessimism when it comes to some people finding a real lack of role-players out there.  I have had a wide variety of experiences with both good and bad players, but there is always a very good chance of randomly finding a good role-player.  A case in point is this example.
<br><br>
I have a female gnome wizard that I started not too long ago, and I wanted to travel from steamfont to butcherblock, but didn't want to go alone.  As luck would have it, a gnome mage shouted in steamfont that he was heading out to butcherblock, and did anyone want to come with him?  I replied to him yes, and we decided to meet ant the pass between the Lesser Faydark and Steamfont.
<br><br>
When I arrived, two other gnomes had joined us.  We were all about 5th level, and we had a mage, and enchanter, and two necromancers.  We grouped up and headed out.
<br><br>
We crossed the Lesser Faydark, entered the Greater Faydark and ran all the way across to the butcherblock pass.  One of our party got lost, so we waited at the pass for him to find us, since he was pretty familiar with the Greater Faydark, but he had just gotten a little turned around.
<br><br>
While we were waiting we chatted, in character, with some of the gnomes sort of hitting on my female wizard.  A dwarf came in, and then we got an idea… we decided to threaten all who came to the pass to pay a toll or suffer our gnomish wit! I can't remember all the names, but I'll give these as an example:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Posy: gnome wizard female<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Lyldread: gnome necromancer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Wazoo: gnome mage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Laefer: gnome necromancer<br>
<br><br>	
It started like this:
<br><br>
Posy: your eyebrows look like caterpillars! How do you train them to stay on your face?
<br><br>
Lyldread:  is that beard real?
<br><br>
Wazoo: It looks like Kobold fur!
<br><br>
Posy: Kobold fur is more tan! It can't be!
<br><br>
Laefer: Yeah but there are dark brown spots! Maybe he collected them!
<br><br>
Posy: That would explain that curly appearance… it's patchwork!
<br><br>
Wazoo: Why are you carrying a dinner plate?  (the dwarf bore a shield and mace, I believe)
<br><br>
Laefer: Maybe he's a cook!
<br><br>
(another dwarf runs by, he too with a mace)
<br><br>
Lyldread: Yeah, that one had an eggbeater too!  They all must be cooks!
<br><br>
Laefer: There must be a kitchen in Butcherblock!
<br><br>
Posy: Are you serving dinner?  Can we have some?
<br><br>

At this point I was laughing so hard I could barely type!  I had just found these players off the cuff, and I was having a blast! The poor dwarf was blustering and threatening, but he was having a /tell conversation with me and laughing his ass off too.
<br><br>
Role-playing is one of those things that I think just happen.  Sometimes you can get the ball rolling by acting in character a little bit, and folks jump right in.  I have never really tried to "force' an RP situation - some folks just aren't interested.  I try to stay away from players that I don't think will, or sound idiotic "d00d can u give m some food?", or just concentrate on playing the game and not role-playing with people who aren't into it.
<br><br>
Lyldread and I have become fast friends, too, and he's a good guy to play with, so it IS possible to find good players out there... they are the gems in the sometimes rough crowd that you can encounter.  It makes them all the more special.
