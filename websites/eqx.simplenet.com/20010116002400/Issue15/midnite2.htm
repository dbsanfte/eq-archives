CHAPTER TWO
<br><br>
"Hurry...  Ana!"<br>
"...Ana!   Where IS that kid..."
<br><br>
Ana was rather content, dozing off;
all the exitement of watching her apple pies cool down wearing thin, after
the first min; more or less...
<br><br>
"ANA...  ana..    oh NoO...   here they come..."
<br><br>
"huh?,   mom?"
<br><br>
Somethin’ scurrying around the corner catches Ana’s eyes.
Rubbing her bleary eyes, she squints to see through the midmorning sun, into
the darker corner of the storage hut;  where she and the freshly baked apple
pies had taken refuge...

A company, numbering some two score Holy Warriors,  had marched into her
village, early this morning.
They claimed a war party of barbarians was last seen in the vicinity;  so,
the Garrison marched down from their Outpost nearby that they liked to call
SevenorEight, to guard the village.
<br><br>
Of course, Ana knew THAT was just an Excuse;  she was rather convinced they
came for her Apple Pies, that won her Red Ribbons every SpringFest for the
last three years.   How they knew she baked some, she had no o idea...  But
nothing could be beyond those Holy Guys...
<br><br>
There it is...again..  This time, feeling less sleepy,  Ana got up, or
somewhat.      And crawls to that corner...  and sees a small dog
crouching...
<br><br>
"hi.. Small Dog...  wat ‘tcha doin’ back there?"

<td valign="top" width="34%" style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-align: justify">
or rather, a large rat...
<br><br>
"aahhhHHHH!"
<br><br>
With quickness that would have surprised many a seasoned veterans of war,
she launched herself towards the only door... "I HATE RAATS!"
<br><br>
And runs smack into a Big Steel Wall... and it’s moving...
<br><br>
What now!  A Small Dog Rat, and now a Big Steel Wall where the door should
be....
<br><br>
"hello milady... you called?"
<br><br>
and it’s talking too.... a Movin’ and Talkin’ Big Steel Wall?
Would such, be offended if I don’t say nuthin’?
