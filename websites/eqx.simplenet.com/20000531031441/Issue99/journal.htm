	In some lands tis the day of the dead...
<br><br>
	So, the darkness descends upon us. The calm world we love and have come to know turns upside down and shows us all how insignificant we truly are. I look out from my tower in Tunare's temple and smirk at all of those people who would call themselves soldiers, adventurers...heroes. I cannot help but laugh at almost all of them. I turn from the sun's light and with ink and quill set out to put my thoughts down once again. The world has felt pain this day...pain through Hate.
	<br><br>
The priests are now starting the Ceremony of Mourning. I can hear the bells sounding from the guard outpost. It is mostly for show. I am far enough in the ranks to know that much. The ceremonies will continue till dawn at least. All the while the true powers of my temple will be behind closed doors trying to figure out what has truly happened. They will call forth wizards and mages. They will ask historians and sages. And sooner or later I shall be called forth also to do whatever augury the priesthood can. They will ask Tunare for any bit of information she can provide. Any small morsel to make their lives static again. Something to let them know that have not been forsaken.
	<br><br>
I hear the complaints and bickering already. They echo in the halls under the chanting. "Why so much death?! The terror! How unfair! Why was there no warning of such atrocities?" I laugh some more at their ignorance. The signs were all there. I saw them myself...even from the sanctuary of my room within Tunare's temple. The white walls, the wards surrounding the structures of Felwithe, the promises of all the well-trained guards, I saw it through all the lies and all the hubris. I may have turned my back on traveling as much as others but I have not closed my eyes to the world.
	<br><br>
I left most of my friends and have even left my own guild, one that I aided in the founding of, so I can pursue Tunare's work. So her word would not be compromised, and it seems I was one of the only ones to not be blinded by power.
	<br><br>
You see, there are some truths to Norrath. Truths that no one can deny...they are absolute, they are unforgiving. And those truths are forgotten by normal mortals. They are blocked out by our own egocentric selves. 
	<br><br>
I recall sitting with my mentor, a powerful priest in the service of my goddess, and he was telling me of the past atrocities of the evil gods. I remember one thing he told me specifically: He said, "Telel, you are only one woman. No matter how strong your faith, no matter how desperate the need, some things shall come to be. The world will change, it must change. And there is nothing you can do about it. You shall become comfortable one day, and when that day comes your world shall be torn asunder."
	<br><br>
I reflect on those words this day because they are more true then ever. You see what many of the people of Norrath fail to realize is that they are not always the heroes they dream to be. They walk through the forests and deserts with mock respect, passing off a nearby skeleton or orc with not so much as a gaze. 
<br><br>
"Why would I waste my time on such pathetic creatures?" They ask themselves. "It offers me no reward, no challenge. I will not be made more powerful by slaying it...I shall deem it worthy to go on for some pathetic beginning traveler to find." 
<br><br>
Well, now it seems things have changed. The travelers have now found that their cities can be compromised. They are not as powerful as they once thought. They too can die like so much fodder for the masses. They came around familiar corners and the darkness swallowed them. I cannot help but wonder if the same feeling comes over a Froglok in Guk when a band of hungry adventurers come upon it. Does it even have time to think let alone defend itself? I suppose I will leave that to philosophers.
<br><br>
We invade the homes of every creature on Norrath looking for a fight. Looking for the next greatest weapon. Looking for power. Too often have I seen my own kin and other races travel to the Plane of Fear and challenge a God as though they belonged there. <b>YOU</b> invade Cazic Thule's own lands and expect no kind of retribution?! He is a GOD! Do not misunderstand me. He is evil and I believe he deserves whatever pain a mortal can inflict upon him. But you have come to his world. Why would he tolerate such acts...would you?
<br><br>
In return the fight finally comes to Norrath. Evil comes to us...invades our safe areas. And I am sure like all Black Burrow's inhabitants wished they could do, we cry. Not a crying for the death of companions, or the loss of loved ones, but crying for our own selfish means. 
<br><br>
I hear it around me now by the people in the Temple. They cry to the servants of the gods for retribution. "I do not deserve to die! I am great! Grant me your power!" I shake my head in embarrassment. Do we not travel our own path? Who forced you to bind yourself on a simple dock in the desert? Were you unaware that Sand Giants roam free there? 
<br><br>
Which brings me to one of our first rules of Norrath:
<br><br>
<blockquote><em>In a long enough time line all travelers of Norrath can become great and powerful.</em></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
It does not matter how long it takes, but you will reach that point. That is true for all. There is no one great man or woman in Norrath. Some are chosen to get there faster. Some find great items of power on the way, but all can reach the same height. It will just take some of us longer than others.
<br><br>
Do not cry when you are struck down. It happens to us all. We all bleed and rise to fight again. But that is what makes me different from so many. I do not fight evil so I can hold high a trophy when the night is through. I fight against evil so I can look Tunare in the face with pride. I battle the dead so I too can know the same feeling the barbarian next to me brags about in some lost tavern with an ale in hand. 
<br><br>
When you have become too focused on <b>you</b> the world suffers like it has this day. When you rush again and again into battle for your own glory then you have lost the cause. You will not take that sword from the fallen enemy, that sword shall find its way into your hands if the Gods deem you are worthy. The signs were there that this day was coming...but you were all too caught up in your own light to see it. 
<br><br>
Hate has touched Norrath. It caressed us all like a brutal murder. No one was spared and no one was favored, not the meek, not the powerful. Times are changing it seems every day on our beautiful world. It is the good folk that will be needed to defend it, not those who are selfish and lack grace. 
<br><br>
Recognize that the world of Norrath is a dynamic, living, breathing, entity with the forces of good and evil at battle. You are not safe in Freeport. You are not safe in Rivervale. You are not safe. If you do not like this fact then leave Norrath. Yours is the type we do not need anyway. I need heroes to fight beside me.
