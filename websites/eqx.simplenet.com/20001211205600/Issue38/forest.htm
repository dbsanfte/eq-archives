	"Yes, my pet. Yes, you'll be all right, just calm down." Brendelson whispered, "It will all right." He reached down and touched the wounded animal, rubbing gently while he evoked a spell of healing. He looked around furiously for any signs of the party. "When I find them…" 
	<br><br>
"Brendelson?" 
	<br><br>
"What do you want, Leif?" Brendelson said, barely containing his fury.
	<br><br>
"Its just….. I don't know Bren. I mean that party had a reason for hurting that bear. Brown bears are known to be very vicious and can attack without warning."
	<br><br>
"That does not justify what they did!"
<br><br>	
"Why?" Leif said clearly confused.
<br><br>
"A druid's duty is to protect the forces of nature. When that force is disrupted it MUST be justified. If you are to replace me you must remember your training!" 
<br><br>
With that last remark, Brendelson turned violently and was off, weaving through the forest he knew so well, with Leif desperately trying to keep up. After several minutes of traveling, Brendelson suddenly stopped.
<br><br>
"Look Leif, do you see that foot print down there to the right?"
<br><br>
"Yes."
<br><br>
"Can you tell me what kind of footprint it is?"
<br><br>
"It looks like a large animal's foot print, although it does have something odd about it," Leif explained, "But what's your point?"
<br><br>
"It was made by an "animal", but not the kind of animal your thinking of," Brendelson said, "Let me show you what kind of "beast" it really was!"
<br><br>
As Brendelson said that he turned his hands palms up. As Leif watched, he saw the air begin to shimmer where the foot print was. Suddenly, out of the earth itself, a huge ogre appeared. It smiled viciously at Leif. The young man quickly reached for his quarterstaff, even though he knew it would be useless against the thick skinned ogre.
<br><br>
"Leif stop!" shouted Bren.
<br><br>
Leif hesitated and realized the ogre was not moving. 
<br><br>
"What in the…."
<br><br>
"It is the essence of the ogre that walked through this area just a little while ago," explained Bren, "If I performed the spell right, it will lead us to the group that raped nature itself!"
<br><br>
As Bren stopped talking, the ogre began to walk. It was not hard to keep up with the ogre, although the ogre had moved very quickly through the forest. It seemed that the party had been heading in the direction of Qeynos, and had gotten lost. Then, unexpectedly, Bren disappeared. 
<br><br>
"Bre.." a hand over Leif's mouth cut him short.
<br><br>
"Look in the clearing," Bren's voice whispered.
<br><br>
Leif's eyes shot over to the clearing obediently. As he watched, several large ogres passed directly where he had been, if he had kept walking. The ogres were bruised and beaten, apparently from their trek through the forest. 
<br><br>
"Bren, how will we defeat this party?" Leif said, obviously very worried, "I can count at least ten ogres surrounding the camp and more are probably in the tents."
<br><br>
Several minutes passed, as Bren, deep in thought, considered their chances.
<br><br>
"That's it!"
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Leif, huddled next to a tree, cursed at his recklessness. Just one year before he had been living happily with his family. Since he had been the oldest in his family, he had decided to follow his own path. He was to take an apprentice ship with a blacksmith in Qeynos. He had run late and had decided to go through the forest instead of taking the road. It had gotten late, and he needed to rest. Then a sharp sound awoke him from his sleep. He looked around and noticed five pairs of eyes looking at him. 
<br><br>
"Wh-who's there?" Leif mumbled, trying to remain calm.
<br><br>
Before anyone could answer, there was a loud roar from the trees. One by one Leif saw the eyes vanish and then he was the only one there. Then with abrupt suddeness a huge bear emerged from the trees. The bear was over 10 feet tall at the shoulder. Leif was paralyzed with fear. The bear walked over to him and sniffed him. Then as abruptly as it appeared the bear rumbled back into the forest. 
<br><br>
For several days afterward, Leif walked, not knowing where he was or in which direction he was going. Some power, unknown to him, was forcing him to walk and was also providing him with food and water. Then, he collapsed, ready for death to take him from this torture. He slipped into unconsciuosness. 
<br><br>
"Wake up my young friend."
<br><br>
Leif opened his eyes and looked into the wisest face he had ever seen.
<br><br>
"Where am I," Leif whispered.
<br><br>
"You are in my home, young Leif. I will answer your next question before you ask: I am Brendelson, disciple of nature," the man whispered, still not sure about Leif's health, "Oh, and don't worry that I know your name, you were talking in your sleep."
<br><br>
"You said a disciple of nature… then you are a Druid?" Leif questioned.
<br><br>
"Yes, I am. Now it is my turn to question you, just how did you find my home? It is not in the same place long,"  Brendelson asked.
<br><br>
"I don't quite know myself. I got lost in the forest and was attacked. I became lost and I was starved and dehydrated. It was like some power was leading me in this direction," Leif explained.
<br><br>
"It seems the forces of nature have endowed you with great amounts of power, my young friend. With the proper training you could become the next guardian of nature," preached Brendelson.
<br><br>
"You mean.."
<br><br>
"Yes, you could become a Druid, and one day take my place," Brendelson said.
<br><br>
After several minutes of deep thought Leif replied.
<br><br>
"I accept."
<br><br>
During the next several months, Brendelson trained Leif in the forces of nature. He was also trained in the arts of archery and hand to hand combat. Only now, though, did Brendelson actually take him on an adventure.  
<br><br>
Now he regretted all of it. He was about to ambush a camp full of ogres that were starved and angry. Leif prayed to nature itself and then tensed for Bren's signal.
<br><br>
Suddenly, he heard that deep rumbling growl, he knew to be a brown bear's mating call. He took out his large ash bow and readied one long arrow one the string. Leif breathed in, held the breath, pulled back on the string and…
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*Twang*</b>
<br><br>
Went the string as he released the arrow. Before the string had stopped humming, Leif had shot another arrow. Then another, then another. Three ogres went down in a pool of blood. Many of the ogres inside the tents came out and looked around. Leif readied another arrow. But before he could shoot, the rumble came again.
<br><br>
	Leif readied his body for the onslaught that was about to begin. He took a rope out of his bag and tied himself to a tree. He looked around and listened. He recognized the quiet that always came before death and destruction. He looked up and saw the sky blacken, not with clouds however but with something else. Leif tried and tried but could not recognize the shapes he saw. Abruptly, it dawned on him. He focused on the ogre camp and saw that they had still not seen the sky. 
<br><br>
	The sky was filled with birds. The birds were in all shapes and sizes, all races and breeds. Leif saw out of the corner of his eye Brendelson with his hands raised, brow furrowed in concentration. He held his hands up a second longer, then they dropped.  The birds dropped and dropped, as they got closer he could make out the sounds of flapping wings. After more time he could feel the wind from their wings. He looked over at Brendelson, who still had his hands down. He slowly looked up. 
<br><br>
	Leif was hurled against the tree by tornado like winds. With as much strength as he could muster, Leif turned his head to look at the ogre camp. It was the most gruesome site he had seen, yet almost  beautiful. As he watched the whole area was stripped clean. Birds upon birds rained down upon the ogres, and the area around them. The few ogres he could see were being picked apart. The birds attacked so fast no blood was shed. After just a few seconds, the birds stopped, and flew away as if nothing happened. 
<br><br>
	Leif saw Brendelson, praying in the middle of the clearing where the ogre camp had been. As Leif walked towards Brendelson he observed that only the bones and wooden beams of the camp were left. Leif also saw a large sword but decided not to investigate. As Leif approached, Brendelson stood and smiled. He patted Leif on the back.
<br><br>
"Thanks for the help, Leif."
<br><br>
"No thank you, Brendelson"
<br><br>
As they left the clearing, a rustle scared a raccoon out of his hiding spot.
