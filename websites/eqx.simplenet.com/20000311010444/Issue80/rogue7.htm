It was a very nervous and subdued Kinory who climbed the steep and narrow steps to the roof of the Guildhouse the next night.  The air was hot and still, heavy with moisture.  She emerged onto the rooftop and walked to the edge.  Five stories down, the hard-packed dirt of the street was dark and shadowed.  No sound broke the night at all.
<br><br>
   "So."  She schooled herself to stillness, and turned to see Galern glowering at her from the doorway.  "Early, eh?"  He made a mark on his notepad, and then came over to her.  "Well, we'll just get right to it, then.  Lord Agen has had a gold and platinum bracelet made for his wife.  Set with emeralds and jade.  It was delivered today, and rests in his study on the third floor of his manor, in South Freeport.  Go get it."
<br><br>
   Kinory stared for a moment at him, remembering Daryth and Katha's warnings, and then took a deep breath.  Whether he was false or not, she had no choice.  She either came back with the bracelet, or she forfeited the test, and…
<br><br>
   She nodded jerkily, and swung herself over the side of the building.
<br><br>
   Her favorite part of the training had always been the rooftop running.  Stealthy Movement was taught by an old human by the name of Faren, who had spent most of his long and nefarious career above the streets.  He boasted that he hadn't set foot on the ground since he came to Freeport.   Kinory, watching and learning from him, could well believe it.  She had been an apt pupil, and one of Feron's favorites.   Her natural dexterity and flexibility had made her a quick study at the acrobatically demanding skill.
<br><br>
   She traveled easily now, using her favorite route, one that took her to the highest points in Freeport, and back down again.  She arrived at Lord Agen's manor in a short time, dropping to the ground inside his walls silently, and slipping up to the side of the house like a stray shadow.   She went to the ground behind a bush and waited patiently for the guards to make their rounds.  Soon footsteps passed her, and she waited again, counting silently.  When she had the guard's route timed, she slid her climbing gloves from her belt and clipped their matching soles to her soft boots.  Thus equipped, she rose and swarmed up the wall.  The tiny hooks on gloves and soles embedded themselves in the wall, and propelled her quickly upwards.  She paused as she reached a window.
<br><br>
   Out came the diamond-bladed glass cutters, and a small round wooden knob, cut flat on one side.  She painted the flat side with a quick-drying adhesive, placed it on the window, and drew a careful circle around it with the glass cutters.  A small tug, and the glass came cleanly away.  She reached inside with her small oilcan and dripped two careful drops onto the latch.  It moved silently under her careful fingers, and a little more oil on the hinges ensured that the opening of the window was as noiseless.  
<br><br>
   Kinory slid over the windowsill and dropped, cat-like, to the floor.  
<br><br>
   The manor was dark and still.  The moonlight streaming through the windows revealed a long, high-ceilinged hallway, the walls hung with velvet drapes.  Every ten paces, a black marble plinth held a graceful vase or a small statue.  The floor was the same stone, and a thick, soft carpet ran down the center.  She paused, two different lessons springing to the forefront of her mind.
<br><br>
    <em>Always walk on carpet, if it is there.  As quietly and lightly as you can move, you cannot move as quietly on stone or wood as you can on a soft carpet. If there are no eyes to see, carpet is a thief's ally.  If they are foolish enough to provide us with allies in their homes, why,</em> Pedder had grinned at them.  <em>Who are we to argue?
<br><br>
   Stay in the shadows.  The dark is safety, is life.  Move into the light, and you are a dead thief.</em>  The first thing that Daryth had taught her, long ago, in Kelethin.   She stared at the strip of soft piled wool, frozen with indecision.
<br><br>
   A soft barely-there sound behind her, made her spin swiftly, dagger springing to her hand.  There was no one there, but she could almost feel Galern's eyes on her.   She drew a deep, silent breath, and set off down the hall, keeping to the shadows and hugging the wall.
<br><br>
   Her nightvision was more than adequate, but her eyes were wide as they could go, and her ears pricked at each soft breath of air.  She came to the end of that hallway and looked up a wide flight of stairs.  A banister ran up one side.  The walls were decorated with paintings and tapestries.  The stairs themselves were bare marble.  She paused again.  If anyone came down those stairs while she was going up... she looked up.  
<br><br>
   A few moments, and a handy, sturdily fastened tapestry sufficed to get Kinory from the floor to the curled and creviced moldings that ran around the top of the walls.  She clung there like a spider, moving upside down, at times hanging from one hand.  She spent an extremely long and terrifying moment as a servant came down the stairs, carrying a pile of linen.  Kinory pressed her face against her arm, craning her neck to watch as the woman disappeared into the shadows at the foot of the stairs.  Once she was gone, Kinory relaxed each muscle carefully.
<br><br>
   <em>A tense rogue is a dead rogue.  See this cat?  It fits itself into whatever space it finds itself in.  So must we. </em>
<br><br>
   Kinory let herself drop to the carpet at the top of the stairs, and rolled, coming to her feet in the shadows at the base of the wall.  Three doors down was the Lord's study.  As she drew her lockpicks form her belt pouch, she heard footsteps.  She froze, panic flooding her mind.  No cover.  There was no cover anywhere, and the shadows she crouched in would not have hid a mouse.  She fled to the nearest door in a scurrying crouch, slipped a lockpick out of the roll, and slid it delicately into the lock.  Her fingers were greasy with sweat, and the lock resisted her stubbornly.  The footsteps came closer.  She bit her tongue and closed her eyes, feeling for the tumblers, trying to see the innards of the lock as Daryth had taught her...
<br><br>
  The lock clicked open, the door swung inward, and Kinory did a swift forward roll, and then pressed the door shut.   She waited, back to the wood, eyes wide, breath coming in short pants that she struggled to keep silent.  A hand jiggled the knob, and then the guard moved off down the hall, whistling to himself.
<br><br>
   A trickle of sweat ran down the side of her face, and she palmed it away, getting to her feet.  She glanced around, and barely suppressed a sound of surprise.  She was in the study; she recognized it from the map that Galern had given her... but the map had said it was two doors down from this one.  She set her teeth.  Daryth had been right.  She wondered what else of the information had been wrong.
<br><br>
   In the center of the room was a massive desk, and all around the walls, glass display cases stood, filled with jewelry and rare artifacts.  She stood and slipped over to one.  Inside, a set of obsidian rings linked with platinum chains shared a shelf with a crumbling mud totem.  And under them, a drake's skull set with rubies where the eyes had been glared out at her.  She made the circuit of the room, and found no bracelet.  She made the search twice, and stood in the center of the room, chewing her lip.  What if there was no bracelet at all?  How much of this test was rigged?
<br><br>
   She closed her eyes, and relaxed herself deliberately.  There had to be a bracelet.  The conditions of the test required the tester to return with the item, to prove that the student <em>could</em> have accomplished the task.  So.  Where was it?
<br><br>
   She opened her eyes and turned to the desk.
<br><br>
   A moment with a pick yielded the contents of the drawers to her.  No bracelet.  She thought for a second, and then ran her hands along the underside of the desk.  A small notch, pressed lightly, clicked softly, and depressed into the surrounding wood.  A panel slid aside and she saw within the revealed compartment, a small blue velvet box.  She pulled it out, and there, on the satin, lay the bracelet, gleaming coldly in the moonlight.  She lifted it out, and slipped it into her pouch.  She closed the box, returned it to its place, and restored everything to its original state.  
<br><br>
  She had taken but one step toward the door when the first shout echoed through the manor.
