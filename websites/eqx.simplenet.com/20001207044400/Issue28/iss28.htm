<center><big><b>EverQuest Express Changes Format, Again</b></big></center>
<br>
<font size="-1">
Yes, we have changed our format slightly.  Sparked by a letter from a reader, one representative of several others, we have decided to change the look of this publication in order to make it a bit more readable.  Thanks for the letter, Ubrel SilverBow.  Please also take a look at the 'About Us' section.  It is now an index of everything on EQX.

<font size="-1">
David often visited Electronics Boutique when his mom took him to the mall with her.  He loved checking out the new titles.  Today David noticed that a new game had been released for the PC.  He grabbed the box from the shelf.  "EverQuest" was the name of the new title...

"Hail Sir, and well met stranger." The red headed fighter said.  "I'm a role player and I'm playing a role." He smiles.

<center><big><b>A Look into the Power Gaming vs. Role Playing Argument</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
I have spent many an hour reading message boards debating this very old argument.  One side declaring flame wars on the other, without either side allowing the other to win.  I feel it is time to put my two cents in edgewise and hopefully clear up some foggy areas of the debate.

"I'm hot, Uncle," mumbled Janell, stripping off her bear skin cloak.
<br><br>
"Shhhh!  We're hunting here, and your whining'll draw attention t'us…and dinnae call me Uncle." Angaram's harsh whisper barely audible over the sound of the tall grasses blowing in the winds.  The dwarf turned back to his vigil, crouched on the back side of a hill, gazing out over the broad expanse of the plains of Karanas.

pick one, and write a column about it.  As for the contest, each reader
that sends in a topic from the

you in est.) will be eligible to win the poster.  We will choose one of those
folks randomly.  For the sake of this contest you must provide a valid e-mail

<center><big><b>The Invasion of Grobb</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Kul'Taron stood by the city gates, waiting for admittance into the small town of Grobb. He was the basic stereotype of a Dark Elf, blue skin, white hair, sharp features, and he usually carried an evil grin. He was sweating horribly, and fidgeting with his fingers, but luckily no one noticed...

Balin raised his shield to parry the attack of the skeleton's battleaxe.  The blade penetrated his shield at least four inches, missing Balin's hand by a hair.  Balin raised his longsword high in the air, and swung the sword downward, severing the skeletons shoulder...

Yvette sipped quietly from the hot Elven tea while she waited for the Cardinal to arrive. Bastion sat nearby, admiring the almost pruned forest, yet still it was everything that wilderness was. Even in the twilight the forest was well lit, as if by its own light. An Elven scout stood not too far away, sipping at his own tea and watching over the group while waiting for the Cardinal...

A long, long time ago, before The Enlightenment had descended upon the Dwarves, in a warm pleasant cave a girl child was born. Her parents were old and her birth was a happy surprise for they had resigned themselves to childlessness many years before...
