<em>"When you come home to father, what shall ye report? That ye have been hired as a farm hand for the fae folk, or that you have conquered him an island?"
<br><br>
The Way of the Hammers</em>
<br><br>
	In my second installment of role-playing <a href="../Issue64/politics.htm">articles</a> following Oghma's Religion series, we visit Halas. Here dwell the North Men, followers of the Tribunal and seekers of Justice. The main religious factions in Halas all share a love of Conquest, and a strong sense of Honor. Barbarians follow a very old culture of religion and myth, blaming everything on the Gods, or their current standing in the Gods' eyes. It is for this reason the position of leadership often, but not always, falls upon those closest to the Gods - the Shaman. In this rich culture ritual and tradition are much like laws, shaping the society's day to day life. 
<br><br>
With only one exception, which will be noted, all Barbarians are devoted to the Tribunal or no God at all. Despite this fact, even loyal followers of the Six Hammers still war with each other, for reasons ranging from family disputes, theft, to insulted pride. This is important to keep in mind when starting to build a believable Barbarian Character's role.
	<br><br>
Role playing a Barbarian could be a challenge for some play-styles, as building a rich role as a Barbarian could take a little more than a casual effort. Life is more than tough for Barbarians, and from their youth each member of a Barbarian family or tribe would be required to do their duties or people could starve, or die. This upbringing is symbolic of the unbending honor the Barbarians possess, as there is no place for deviants inside the family structure, nor in the greater hierarchy of the Tribe. 
<br><br>
	Once you have made yourself familiar with the different inner-Halas personalities, factions and quests, you should take a step back and think of the ways that your role as a Barbarian can be rewarding and believable. One serious consideration to keep in mind is that since Barbarians are the strongest good warriors and the only option for a good shaman many players who do not role play at all will be attracted to Barbarians for their stats and abilities. This gives the Barbarians a bad image in some ways, which in character could translate to others not understanding your way of life, or being disgusted by your lack of social graces. Beware, if you do not role-play the part you will fail to deliver that image as intended. However, we can learn from the powergamer possible places for us in society and our profession of choice.
<br><br>
	The Warriors of the Tribunal are some of the best point guards in the game, moving in first to take and deal the greatest amount of damage. Statistically speaking we are the best friends a spell-caster may have. In-character this fits in with the Tribunals' mercenary-like trade described in the religion overview, as we offer our services as strongmen, bodyguards and bounty hunters in the name of Justice wherever it can be found. However this introduces possibly the greatest hex to role-playing a Barbarian, as in this role there is the invitation to lose your character's identity.
<br><br>
	Historically Barbarians' love of Conquest has earned fear and loathing from the peace-loving religions and races. All Barbarians are born with part of this negative faction, which most players erase through noble deeds. I am not suggesting that there is an easy mechanical alternative to this Path of Valor, at least not within easy reach. All of man's enemies are placed within easy reach of the Barbarians waiting to be killed. It is no wonder that most high-level Barbarians seem more like Nobles who would look fitting in a room full of Gentlemen drinking fine wine. If this is your goal, to be the Hero of the Day and title winner, then there will not be much to stand in your way. But what of the rest of the Barbarians who still wear kilts and never bathe?
<br><br>
	If you have ever visited the Surefall Glade in JaggedPine forest, you may have heard of these Barbarians that populate the furthest reaches of the Karana Plains. They would definitely seem out of place at the gentlemen's drinking club, as guards would probably be called. The War-like factions that seem natural to Barbarians are not there simply to be erased, and the action faction of Rallos Zek's Barbarian warriors are probably the best example of an alternative to nobility. This path of the "war bringer" may not be a desirable path to follow for some players, but it is there to be taken.
<br><br>
	No matter if you follow the path of Valor, the Path of War or a tight balance of both, building your role from here on out will help you stand out in contrast to powergamers. Consider your natural enemies and friends, your allies and challenges. Think about the primary trades of the north man, ask yourself why we need that bear fur, and realize how the darker faction was born. The way you execute your chosen role would never be one of grace, but one of necessity and action. Do a little research concerning the factions among the Barbarians, see if one of them appeals to you and make yourself a part of that cause. Whether you choose to raise farms or raze them, make sure you set out to have fun, and never underestimate the power of good friends.
