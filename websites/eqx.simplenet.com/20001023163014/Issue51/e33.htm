<p style="text-align: justify">

Many of you will recall that in Issues 24 and 25, I offered a detailed
report of EverQuest as I saw it at E3.  Due to the gracious release of
the NDA for our humble paper, I can give you the run down of what has
and has not changed between now and then.
<br><br>
Let me start off the same way I did in <a href="../Issue24/e3.htm">EverQuest E3 Report - part 1.</a>
The beta is in full swing now, well into Phase 3.  Secondly, yes, the
game <b>still</b> lives up to the hype.  Now that you feel a little
better, let's move on to the details.
<br><br>
Let me also mention the same thing I did in <a href="../Issue25/e32.htm">EverQuest E3 Report - part 2.</a>
EverQuest is still in a beta phase.  They continue to add new features,
new spells, new quests, new items, new commands, and more while also fixing
bugs, cleaning up the interface, tuning the balance, revamping entire 
zones, and keeping the current testers happy.  It is a huge project that
is surprisingly well managed.  What this means is that everything could
change tomorrow, so this is by no means the bible set in stone.

<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Because I see comments and questions popping up every now and then, I 
would like to clarify yet again that the original race/class chart had
an error.  There was, there is, and there always will be a Halfing Rogue 
combination.  There have either been some changes to the combinations, or 
I discovered more errors in the original chart, so here is an updated chart 
showing all the combinations currently available:

<h3>As a Newbie</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
Things have been made slightly easier for the newbie.  At E3 I could
easily die to the starting monsters unless I was a barbarian warrior.
Now, any race or class should be able to handle the wimpiest monsters
on their own.  In fact, at the lower levels (1-5), spell casters can
typically kill monsters the easiest.  The balance of power changes 
as levels increase, however.
<br><br>
As a newbie, it is usually quicker to increase levels by fighting solo.
Since experience is shared amongst your party members, with the higher
level players taking more than the lower, while you can handle monsters
of equal of similar level to you, you will want to take advantage of 
grabbing the exp.  
<br><br>
Depending on your race and class, it may take between 10 and 20 kills to
finally reach level 2.  An experienced player can handle this in about
an hour of play.  That will be the quickest level you will ever earn.
As your levels get higher, so does the experience needed to gain a new
one, and you could spend well over a week trying to gain the next plateau.
<br><br>
Back to being a newbie.  Some races, such as elves, have infravision 
which help them see at night, and some races, such as humans, do not.  If
you choose to play a human or other sightless race, your first nightfall
will be VERY dark.  The lighting effects and graphics are quite incredible,
and when it is night, you will know it.  I recall fighting in the newbie
area outside of Qeynos, using a human monk.  It was very difficult to see
anything, except when in contrast to the brighter sky.  This meant I could
pick out bats from a distance, but even if a snake crawled over my toes,
I wouldn't not have seen it beneath me.  Meanwhile, in the distance, a
player carrying a torch would dash by, emitting a soft glow.  The torch
left a slowly dissolving trail of smoke behind him.  Often I would be 
trying to fight in the darkness, and a source of light would illuminate
the area in front of me, before quickly vanishing, as if someone were 
aiming a lantern in my direction to see what the noise was.  
<br><br>
This experience brings up two points.  One, everyone who starts this game
is going to be floored by the graphics and amazed at the real feelings 
that it can inspire within you.  Two, you really should invest in that
torch.  This becomes more true when you are in a group and attempting to
travel together in the darkness.  It is much easier to follow a light
source than it is to chase a fleeting shadow.

<h3>Magic</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
The starting spells have been modified a bit since E3.  For example, the
bard no longer starts with a song at all.  Meanwhile, many more spells
have been added to the game, most of which I have never seen or used.
<br><br>
After E3, I reported that you may forget a spell in the middle of combat,
which would require you to memorize it again.  I have not seen this happen
at all since, and so it is safe to say that you can rely on that memorized
spell to be there until you manually remove it from your listing.  Of 
course, you can still be interrupted or fizzle the spell.
<br><br>
I have also since learned that there are many variations of the spell system,
all within the game.  The basic spells are purchased at a vendor, and cast
purely with mana.  Some spells require a reagent which vanishes upon use.
Other spells require a reagent that can be used an infinite number of times.
Rare and powerful spells can only be acquired after a long and risky quest.  
Variations like these provide many ways of maintaining balance, and also adds 
another level of richness to the world.  This is merely another example of the
complexity that exists, all of which is very promising and welcome in an RPG.

<h3>Quests</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
I am amazed at the quantity and depth of quests available, at least around
the original city of Qeynos.  Nearly every NPC you can find has some little
task they want you to do.  The reward is not always useful or worth anything,
but someone put in a lot of time writing up plots and interactions amongst
the various characters.  While there are still a lot of barren cities as
far as quests go, the developers are continually adding more through the 
beta program.

<h3>Factions</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
Quests are a good way to learn information about the world of Norrath, but
they also have another effect.  They modify how NPCs will react to you via
a faction system.  Killing monsters, or doing quests for NPCs modifies how
other NPCs of the same faction think of you.  It also adjusts related
NPCs' reactions to a lesser degree.
<br><br>
For example, if I travel to BlackBurrow and slay a dozen gnolls, they regard
me as an infamous villain in their lands and despise the sight of me.  
Meanwhile, the gnolls that live in Paw are also hearing of my deeds and, 
at a slower rate, are learning to hate me.  However, as I rid the lands of 
gnolls and prove my actions, the citizens of Qeynos call me a hero and look 
upon me favorably.  Of course, the secret evil collective inside of Qeynos 
does not like that I am becoming a local hero, so they refuse to talk to me.
<br><br>
While the details of my example may not be accurate, that is precisely
what happens when you complete a quest or kill a monster.  This is a complex
system that provides tremendous depth and ability to generate realistic
quests and storylines.

<h3>Guides</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
As hundreds of players were added to the lands of Norrath, it became apparent
that some system needed to be created for helping those afflicted with bugs 
or problems with the interface.  Thus, the Guide system was born.  Guides
are non-989 players endowed with a special character who has very limited 
powers.  Their sole responsibility is to give up their normal play time in
order to respond to the pleas for help from all the other players.  I have
had a few opportunities to call for help, and the Guides have been very
useful in answering my questions and helping me.  Although the guide system
itself is also under development, it is definitely a step in the right
direction for customer service.
<br><br>
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank those players who are
giving up time to play and enjoy the richness of the game in order to sit
as a Guide and listen to all the problems of the rest of us.  It is through 
these selfless volunteers that you and I will get 989-approved answers
and assistance.

<h3>The Bad Things Still Bad</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
Since the E3 report, some of the problems I identified have been long since
fixed.  Others have not been changed, and have been accepted as the way
things are going to be.  First, I will mention the things that did not get
better.
<br><br>
First, 989 did not send me an apology for not inviting me to their exlusive
E3 party complete with open bar and live band.  Although I looked like just
some kid who sneaked in off the street, I figured my demeanor and wily charm 
would have gotten me in the door.  Just kidding on this one, of course.
<br><br>
Zone transitions still take time.  With over a hundred people in a zone, it 
can take even longer.  Although typically on the order of 10-20 seconds, the
server usually places you in the game and active before your client has
loaded up completely.  This means you can log in or change zones, and be
attacked and killed before you get the message that have now entered
a new zone, and well before you have control over your character.  Granted 
this is an extreme case, but if someone has fled from a Hill Giant and led 
him to the entrance of the zone, you are in some trouble.  Some solutions 
have been identified and if this becomes a problem, they will certainly put 
in a fix.
<br><br>
The inventory and skill listings are still quite large.  I have come to 
accept the inventory will be large to accommodate displaying all the item
graphics and inventory slots.  However, the skill listing allocates an
entire square block for each skill and its text readout of its level.
I have no idea why it is not a simple list with numbers just like the
stats.  It would make it much easier to see what skills you do and don't
have, and what their levels are, without having to scroll up and down
a lengthy list.  With the inclusion of utility skills such as sewing,
fletching, tinkering, and the rest, the skill list has the potential of
being quite long.

<h3>The Bad Things Turned Good</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
Luckily the real important things I mentioned have been addressed.  The
following items are the fixes and improvements to the problems I reported
after E3.
<br><br>
Your food and water will last much longer now, allowing you plenty
of time to explore your starting city and find the exit before you run out.
<br><br>
External camera angles will no longer be blocked by walls and buildings and
other objects.  The camera nicely moves up in front of the obstacle, 
maintaining the view of your character at all times.
<br><br>
It is easier to target creatures.  Although you still must click on it, it
seems a little more lenient about where you can click.  There is also a 
key to target the nearest creature in front of you.  As if that wasn't
enough, there is a command that allows you to target whatever another player
currently has targeted.  This allows you to select your party leader, 
enter this command, and be assured that you are both beating on the same
thing.

<h3>Summary</h3><p style="text-align: justify">
Six months ago I said this game will make addicts out of us all, and
that this was the best online RPG yet.  Today, I am patting myself on the
back for being 100% correct in my assessment.  The more things I see in
this game, the more I realize the incredible potential it has.  As 989
continues to add more functionality throughout the beta, I become more 
impressed with EverQuest and the development team that makes it happen.
