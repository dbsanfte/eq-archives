Well, we've done our best.  We've cajoled, poked and prodded.  We've pushed, shoved and cried out.  And Verant has done their best.  They've listened and decided, coded and programmed.  And in a few days all their work will come to you in a small plastic case, inscribed onto a small disk barely larger than the bottom side of you coffee mug.
<br><br>
Will this be the game that you were all hoping it would be?
<br><br>
Well, I'll admit that I expected a lot.  Like GM controlled NPCs...
<br><br>
What, they did that last night?  Crud, I missed that.
<br><br>
I also want to see a lot of events.  Actually, I don't like to call them events.  Events are  more like one time spectaculars.  I want to see a living world.  I want Norrath to be a place where leaving the Kaladim could just mean running smack dab into a horde of invading Orcs, or maybe running into a wounded NPC who tells you that HE just ran smack dab into a horde of invading Orcs...
<br><br>
Oh, they did stuff like that too last night...
<br><br>
Alright, now I'm pissed.  You see, I promised my brother and our friends that I would play poker on Friday.  I promised this well before I knew that the last day of beta was going to be on that same night.  I guess I just expected to play on the weekend.  So I didn't get to see ANY of this!  And to top it all off, I lost, and lost big.  I'm not tellin' how big.  I wasn't concentrating on poker.  I was wondering if we'd ever see the gods of EverQuest walk Norrath...
<br><br>
Nooooo!
<br><br>
Drats.
<br><br>
However, I love that they did this.  Now all they have to do is do that sort of thing (gods should stay home most of the time, wherever home happens to be).  But we should see GMs and Guides wandering about starting trouble, or stopping it, all the time in the guise of NPCs.  They should have the freedom to make each server a living world.  They should be given the power, the time and the resources they need to breathe life into Norrath.
<br><br>
And hopefully they will.  Most of the pressure should be off in a few weeks (hell, there's always <em>something</em> that goes wrong after you think you've got everything right).  And then hopefully we'll see more roleplaying from Verant.
<br><br>
Oh, and Brad recently did an interview on TalkSpot (.com).  I only heard about half of it, and unfortunately most of the questions were ones that have been asked before, ones that about half the community could have answered, and the other half could have looked up someplace with little effort.  But Brad did answer one of my questions, at least in part.  He told us that some of the other planes of existence are already in!  The plains of Air, Hate and Fear are already in Norrath!  Er, well, not IN Norrath, 'cause they are separate planes...  But he didn't give any more detail than to say that it would take some extremely unusual tricks to get to these places.  I'll tell you now that one of my biggest goals in Norrath will be to see Gainam, Tier'dal priest to Innoruuk get to the plane of hate.  And he'll want to bring a few guests as well.
<br><br>
Once again, I've had the advantage of reading Oghma's editorial before writing mine.  And he's inspired me.  I really do feel that Gainam's goal would be to confront his god and, well, arrogantly make demands of him.  This might be real fun!
<br><br>
I'm not going to ramble on.  This is our last issue before EverQuest is released.  The release really won't change what we do here.  We'll still be providing interesting stories and articles to entertain you.  We'll still try to amuse you with Lil' Archy and Fit to Print.  But, really, my secret desire is that our readership will drop to zero.  I want you all to be playing EverQuest in your free time, not reading about it.
<br><br>
But then, maybe you could read us while you're at work...  hmmm...  :p
