<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just bought the Wizard's Canon in Erudin and I can't read it, it's all gibberish.  Do I need to learn a different language or am I not a high enough level (10)? 
<br>
- Redheart
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Canon is likely in another language.  Research is one of the skills that require the learning of another tongue.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;This isnt so much a question, but an answer to one somebody posted regarding Pending Lore Items. As we all know, we can only hold 1 Lore Item at any time, be it on our person or in the bank. Pending Lore are items that will soon switch to Lore. At that time any duplicates will be deleted, leaving the player with 1 of that particular item.
<br>
- Krovaxius
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, indeed, and thank you for that clarification.  I would like to add that it is possible to carry more than one Lore item if they are not duplicates.  So you could dual wield a Bloodclaw and a Dragoon's Dirk, but not two Bloodclaws.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way for tailors to sew Cloth items rather than leather ones?  Being a mage, I took up tailoring assuming that I would get Cloth armor for myself, but all I get is leather.  What can I do? 
<br>
- Falx
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to tailor cloth armor, no.  You can still make leather armor, and sell it to other players, however, so the purchase is not quite as useless as you may have thought.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to know more about the lady on the presentation screen when loading the game which is the same one on the cover of the box and manual?  Does the artist was inspire by someone real? if so, is it possible to know her name and if a portfolio of her reel picture is available somewhere?  Thank you.  
<br>
- Damiens
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Umm, not that I know of… Moog, any ideas?
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a question really more of a thing I've seen...In regards to seeing the shield on the Barbian Shaman or Rogue, this also happens with many mobs in the game, the only way currently to see shields on most mobs and players is to have your resolution 800x600 or 1024x780 or whatever, at 640x480 many shields are not shown. 
<br>
- Kakek
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, thanks for the additional information.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I play several characters in EQ, switching off frequently. I play each differently, but except for the one I play the most, I'm embarrassed to say that in all the character switching, I've forgotten my selected deities for my other characters! Is there any way to find out what they are now? 
<br>
- Aunor
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure many of us have that same dilemma.  As far as I now, there is no way to tell what God you follow once you have created the character and entered the game.  Anyone out there know of a way?
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I begin I chose not to worship a God, because I did not like any in my list.  Is there a way for me to become a follower of a God that was not on my list? 
<br>
- Shandra
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No.  There is a limit to how much you can customize your character during creation.  It is certainly possible to roleplay it any way you'd like.  While it may be quite the task to get Norrath to respond appropriately to you as a woodelf ranger who follows Innoruuk, the world is set up so that actions carry consequences, in terms of faction.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep hearing tales of the corruption within the Freeport Militia and countless paladins and clerics of Marr are now barred from that port for their good deeds.  My question is this:  Do the gods ever intend to allow good to overthrow this tyrany or are all who choose to oppose the militia destined to forever move in hiding, knowing that "The evil militia is just part of the game"? 
<br>
- Jenizel
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Norrath is relatively unchanging, yes.  I am afraid that the Militia will always be a fact of life.
