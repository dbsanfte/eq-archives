Life is painfully short, and she did not really blame the students at the academy for taking the easy road to power. They would graduate and sail overseas to participate in adventures and wars, as of yet untold. Yvette fancied them as great warriors, brutal students of a manly art, the art of destruction. "Men," she mused. Men are destructive, and even the Erudites could not keep a city safe from the very blood in their veins. Only if the fathers of the schools had known that men could never escape the designs of the Gods.

Yvette looked at the piles she had made and knew she needed more tables. Soon she would have to go back for more supplies to set up a more permanent place to study. She was just stepping through a pile of boards when she noted a particular book. Not so much it's title or its color that got her attention, but that she had seen the style of writing before. The same skins made up the binding, the same archaic style of flowing script. However, the authors name was not familiar, seeming rather dull and simple a name for the writings of this time period. She sat down and began to read, and the similarities became more distinct. Was this a lost work of Miragul, possibly rescribed?

Here was a man who saw into the future, Yvette pondered. Miragul defied the schools of thought and went against the teachings of the greatest Sorcerers in all of history. Yvette spoke aloud "What were you looking for, what was your truth Miragul?" She fancied the man who broke away from his peers and the teachings of his fathers a man who knew what was coming to the world. He was seen as an anarchist, and as a demon to some people. History describes him more evil than one could fathom, but what is evil but a learned expression? Yvette insisted that this illusion had been cast over the visage of the actual Miragul long after he died, like some folk lore. Miragul was quite possibly very sane, and not evil at all. She wanted to know what he knew, what he had seen that drove him apart from his peers. Yvette read to find a man who knew what no one else knew. Was he not just another great thinker, a genius born in the wrong time? Was he any different than the man who discovered the arcane formulas for the spell of fire explosions? Probably not, just that he lived in a different time, a time when minds grew closed again.
<br><br>
Closed minds was a silent motto at the Academy these days, being scorned from creativity and all that is unique. While in the Universities learning about the great thinkers of the past a new truth is born, a truth that all these great thinkers are dead. Yvette suddenly burst out laughing.
