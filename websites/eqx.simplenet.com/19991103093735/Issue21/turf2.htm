Now I assume that any group worth the invasion into Ogre lands would have a common
return point and plan ahead with backup gear in good places, which would be a welcome
addition to larger group combat tactics. Of course we don’t know just how big of an
effect bank boxes might have on the game, since they might be coins only and in
limited cities, all has yet to be determined since it will be tested in beta.

The Ogre turf example might be a very simple view of "home turf" as any fan of a game
that has troops and a map knows, since once lines are drawn as to who "owns" what
things get very complicated. I imagine that it would be next to impossible to defeat
the Wood Elves in their own forest, and probably equally impossible to beat the elves
even near an allied city. The game of alignment matching and questioning motives is
as complex as the gamers themselves. It doesn’t have to be a war game to see any of
this come to be at all.

I imagine it is a goal of many players who plan to play evil to sack a city, or to
commit some equally dastardly deed. In previous games the territory card fell
dramatically short of what it could have been and I see a few reasons for that. No
matter what happened in those games, one thing is different about EverQuest than all
the others: the races. I am sure we will see repeats of some of the problems in past
games like Ultima Online, but the different races adds a whole new element to the
classic battle, the most basic of human needs, the war for territory.
