My Ambition has long been dead.
<br><br>
Who hath slain it, I could not tell.  It's not as if I was born with one hand curled around a bottle and the other fondling the breast of some ripe barfly.  I recall the deeds of my early youth involving great travails of distance and ideas I'd now think seemingly impossible to achieve.
<br><br>
It is a gift of youth that you know no limitations.
<br><br>
Orwin is an excellent example of this.  He is one of the latest additions to our band of hate.  He came to us inspired by the preachings of Gainam, who stalks the dark timbers of Nektulos sewing the seeds of hate with only his voice as a weapon (But with a cudgel of some type at his ready just in case).  Orwin came into the group and was fairly respectful, if somewhat brooding, but as time has gone on he has become somewhat volatile.  In other words he has found his niche in the group.  When first he joined I would have bested him in a combat with little effort.  Now, however, I believe him to be twice the combatant that I am.
<br><br>
There's something to be said for the boundless hatred of a misspent youth.
<br><br>
I have grown in reverse, it seems.  My ambition was all spent as a child, in ways that would cause one to tremble as I spoke them.  Now I have just those memories.  I have not grown so old that I can no longer function; It's just that I have spent my ambition.  These days I still hate, but in a less active way.
<br><br>
I suppose I write this to put some kind of perspective on a life come to an early stumbling block.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
There are things that even Tier'dal society finds a bit odd or unseemly, though admittedly these things are hard to find.  One such thing is forbidden love.
<br><br>
The one time in my life I felt love was in my fifteenth year, shortly after the demise of my father at the hands of… brigands?  Yes, I think that was the story I told.  Yes, brigands attacked us and I alone crawled away to safety.  It still amuses me the way he called out to me as he bled to death.  If there was ever a person who deserved to be consecrated to Innoruuk, it was he.
<br><br>
But enough about my father's oh so timely demise.  We were discussing Aljeela, my cousin.
<br><br>
She was two years older than I was and perhaps six inches taller.  She was an amazon among our kind.  It had been said that her mother had coupled with a human in order to have such a tall child, but this was plainly a lie.  She was just one of those rare flowers who grew strong and tall.
<br><br>
She shown the right stuff to become a stout warrior, but nonetheless her parents ignored her stature and gave her away to the clergy to raise.  I am not prone to depression.  There was just that one night where I felt the melancholy pains of one who had lost something as valuable as a soul.
<br><br>
But my hatred grew from this.  On the eve of the Feast of Innoruuk, I went to the temple and sat in a pew and looked to Innoruuk to govern my anger.  It was there, burning me from the inside out, and I knew that the next person who looked at me crossways or who jostled me as we passed on the street was going to die.  Subsequently I would die too, as the guards came and cut me down in retaliation for the murder.
<br><br>
"Are you in pain, my son?"
<br><br>
The voice was earthly, and that too made me angry.  I had wanted Innoruuk himself to appear before me and tell me what I must do.  I put my hand on my blade and turned my head to look at the speaker, and found a withered old man.  His eyes were pale white where they should have dark iris's; A sign of his advanced age and deteriorating sight. I surmised he was a priest from the holy symbol and the book tucked under his arm.
<br><br>
"Would that give you pleasure?"
<br><br>
"Yes, it would," He smiled.
<br><br>
I smiled and stood.  I took my hand off of my dagger and offered it for a handshake.  He took my hand and I gripped it as hard as a I could.
<br><br>
"I have plenty of pain," I said, pulling my dagger with my off hand and plunging it into his gut, "Here, have some!"
<br><br>
I continued shaking his hand as the old man fell to his knees and expired there on the floor in the temple, whereupon I finally let go of his hand.  He made no noises and the guards remained outside the doors.  I just sat again in the pew, beside the corpse.
<br><br>
Another priest entered shortly, and I wondered for a moment if I should pull my blade and defend myself.  He walked up to the body and knelt beside it.  For a moment I thought I heard crying, but as it got a bit louder I realized it was laughter emanating from beneath that hood.  The priest pulled the cloak back to reveal his face.  That was the first time I met Gainam.
<br><br>
"Are you going to yell for the guards?" I said defiantly.  Not that I wanted the guards here.  I was no match for them.
<br><br>
"When a fool dies, a part of the world rejoices," he said and then again laughed.  It occurs to me now that Gainam does not laugh that heartily very often.
<br><br>
I shrugged and said, "Well, at least he died in agony".
<br><br>
We both laughed and he dragged the body away into another chamber.  The shriveled old prune actually left quite a bit of blood; Who'd have thought he'd have so much.  Fortunately, blood in a church of Innoruuk was like paint in most others.  We simply poured some water on it and soon the floor was all a pale red, rather than having one dark red spot in the aisle.
<br><br>

There is this custom in places where the sun touches ground.  They call it "wishing well".
<br><br>
"Good day to you, sir." Some idiots will say.
<br><br>
"I hope she gets well soon.  Send her my love!" comes the call of another idiot.
<br><br>
"May her intestines buckle and tear like the girdle of the fattest Ogre," might have been my reply.  Or maybe, "May your cold lifeless testicles jangle in the wind-chimes of some necromancer's back porch."
<br><br>
Or at least I might have said that once.  These days my phrases are all toasts.  The come quite easily to my lips; almost as easily as the drink they portent.  It's a sign of my ambivalence.
<br><br>
It's not that I hate less than I have in the past.  In fact there are times when I could kill anyone and anything.  But I lack the means.  And I lack the means because I lack the ambition.  It will be difficult for me to reconcile my anger with my ambition, when once it used to be so easy.  I'm mad, so I attack.
<br><br>
I suppose all of this came up because I saw Aljeela just a few days ago.  She was in a procession of priests and nuns who crossed town during some festival or other.  She was still taller than those around her, and still had that "lost" look that I recall her carrying all her childhood.
<br><br>
And I watched the procession.  And I went to Third-Gate to the Maiden's Fancy and had a drink.  Callora, my companion that evening says I called out to Aljeela once during our coupling.  Come to think of it, Callora has the same tinge of red in her black tresses when she is face down on the mattress. 
 <br><br>
I went to church later that day.  I'm not a frequent church-goer.  In fact I hadn't been in a church but for the time I killed the priest and this time.  Again Gainam approached.
<br><br>
"What have you been up to?" he said as he burnt an offering to Innoruuk.
<br><br>
"I had some drinks and bedded a girl at the Maiden's Fancy," I said, and knowing how much he hates that place because it employs non-Tier'dal, I quickly added, "Don't worry, she didn't enjoy it.  Well, I couldn't see her face really, but she was calling me plenty of names."
<br><br>
He only looked at me from the periphery of his vision as he laid out the Neriak jellyfish on the altar to dry out, suffer and die.  He stuck his hand in it's tentacles once and let it sting him.  He barely winced.  Then he cast a spell to protect himself from the poison, though he did nothing to heal the wound.
<br><br>
"See this," he asked as he turned to face me and held up his wounded hand, "Pleasures of the flesh."
<br><br>
I prepared myself for a lecture.  What I was going to get was the exact reason that I never attended church.  So I had to wonder why I came here of all places.
<br><br>
"Do you know the crimson truths?"
<br><br>
I had heard the phrase before, but I had no idea what it meant.  My father used to use that phrase sometimes in association with anything that he felt self-righteous about.  '… Then the fool fell on his own sword and died.  He deserved it, and that's the crimson truth.'
<br><br>
"Yes, well that has become the modern use of it.  The crimson truths used to be a set of commandments by which Tier'dal were judged.  But the phrase has an even older meaning."
<br><br>
He sat in the pew behind me.  I guess he wanted me to concentrate on what he was saying, not on him.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
There were six truths.  They were knights of a sort.  Six Tier'dal who wore crimson adornments to their armor.  And each knight had an ideal that he stood for.  There was a knight who stood for brotherhood.  
<br><br>
One day they discussed what they stood for, and "brotherhood" stood and said, "I am for the unity of all Tier'dal.  Together we must stand and let none live beyond our sufferage."
<br><br>
The five male knights looked at the woman, and one said, "A woman cannot be a brother.  You are a contradiction and a false idol."
<br><br>
The five then drew their weapons and fought "brotherhood" until she died.
<br><br>
The other five continued.  The next was the knight who stood for, of all things, "love".  Love said, "I am for that thing which drives all men and all women.  I epitomize the yearning of all people to bond with one another.  Alas, you have taken my beloved."  He looked down at the body and then fell on his sword, his heart too overwrought to allow him to continue.
<br><br>
The third knight spoke, "I am the shining example of honor, or at least I was.  For now I am saddened by this display.  The knight of love slain his beloved to be true to us, then slain himself to be true to his calling of love.  And I have been shamed."
<br><br>
Whereupon that knight too fell upon his blade in order to be true to his calling of honor.
<br><br>
The fourth knight was the crimson truth called conquest.  He claimed, "I take all that I see and keep it for the good of my people.  I would keep the world enslaved to our kind and its minions in chains."
<br><br>
The fifth said, "I am purity.  And I would have them all slain.  Let there be no prisoners, for their capture will only taint us."
<br><br>
And the two fought.  The sixth knight stood back and watched and could not decide which was more right.  After a time, conquest's bloodlust got the better of purity and he fell to the ground in a heap.  Conquest looked around and there was only he and the last knight.
<br><br>
"And who are you," he asked.
<br><br>
"I defend truth.  For being false with oneself builds a house of lies which ultimately must collapse on its maker."
<br><br>
Conquest nodded and said, "You stand for something just and correct.  I am honored that you will be at my side as I conquer everything."
<br><br>
"The truth is a slave to no man," said Truth.
<br><br>
Already wounded from his other battle with purity, conquest died there on that hill and Truth walked away.
<br><br>
They had all been just to their callings.  Each had done what he felt in his bones was right.  Among those things was their duty to enforce the rules of truth.  None could stand among the others and not defend his selected sphere to his utmost without calling upon the wrath of the others.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
"What was that to teach me?" I asked, "That the truth alone survives?"
<br><br>
"I suppose it is," said Gainam, "Though I suppose I've heard many version of the tale.  In one Brotherhood and Love are the last two and Love must slay himself after killing his beloved… then there are no truths.  I suppose that one is to mean that no truth can stand without the others and that when the first one falls, so do they all inevitably."
<br><br>
"What I meant to convey," he continued, "Is that these truths are the cornerstones of what Tier'dal are.  Some do have honor, though it is their own twisted kind of honor.  Some do feel love, though hate is our calling.  What I mean to say is that you can select your truth and make a stand for it, but inflexibility is the  reason that the Truths collapsed upon one another.  Look to all the truths.  Is your honor satisfied that you are who you are?  Is your purity in question when you look in a mirror?  Do your conquests satisfy you, and should you indeed be satisfied with just what you have taken so far?  When you've decided which truth has caused the most trouble then perhaps you have a goal."
<br><br>
I nodded and stood.  I got as far as the door before I mumbled sarcastically, "That was really helpful."
<br><br>
"If I've caused you further pain then perhaps it was worth the effort."
<br><br>
Out in the commons of Neriak I felt the cold of evening, though its always the same darkness in here.  Which was the Crimson Truth which most disturbed me.  Honor was never my cup of fishwine, so I discarded that.  Purity?  Well, pure is something you are, not something you become.  Best you can do is prevent your dilution in the sea of non-Tier'dal influences.  I think I had done that well enough. Brotherhood was satisfied with my guildmates, the F'leurs DuMal.
<br><br>
Conquest did indeed bother me.  I had not the goods to carry me indefinitely nor the desire to do much more than spend what I had.  And that left the other two.  Love was a distraction.  It was something I had experienced before I had even read words to describe the emotion.  But I suspect the reason that Gainam told the particular version of the story that he told, was because he sensed that Truth was my problem.  And if he had known that Love was also in the running then perhaps he'd have turned the story that way as well.  And there was the path before me.  I just had to acknowledge that it was the right path and then walk down it.
<br><br>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Aljeela died last night.  It turns out that someone slipped into her room in the convent during the evening's rest, and the two coupled.  Some time after that, before the culprit left, he killed Aljeela with a simple and loving slice across the throat.  Perhaps her god might have wanted a more violent death for one of his subjects, but I suspect there was plenty of pain involved on the part of the victim and the attacker.
<br><br>
Today I feel angry.  It's funny how now that this Crimson Truth called "Truth" was satisfied the others have slipped into alignment.
<br><br>
Did I mention I feel angry?  I suppose I did.  There's a world out there that is going to suffer.  And let "Conquest" be satiated this day.
<br><br>
The parable of the Crimson Truths, I think, is meant to provoke thought.  Ironically, from it's misleading restructuring and retelling for each person who needs the tale come the thoughts needed to arrive at a logical conclusion.  For while my life did not really mirror the tale, I did sacrifice one truth to breath life into the other two which were suffering.
<br><br>
The moral is that sometimes there is no moral.  There is only a juncture of problems from which the truth must inevitably be extracted.
<br><br>
Perhaps there was a moral after all…
