Tiger's Heart<font size="-2">*</font> was tired.  She had been tired enough her entire life.  However, at the end of this day she was tired enough for two of her own lifetimes.  But she had not gained her honorific by quitting when she was tired.  She pushed on still further into the night.  The others had died because they couldn't keep running.  She would join them some day, but not until she was unable to run one step further.  The snakes always grew tired quickly.  It was her endurance that kept her alive.  And her stubborn unwillingness to die.
<br><br>
Until a few hours ago her people had been herself and four refugees of her shattered village.  Three years ago their small village had stood on the fork of a quiet river only ten miles from the Field of Bone.  They had been among the first attacked.  The snakes had continued to destroy and burn the little villages of the High Elves all along the Field of Bones.  Hundreds, maybe even thousands of Elves had become instant historians, seeking out the ancient cities as hiding places.  But Tiger's Heart and her nation of five had decided that the snakes knew history too, and they would eventually find the cities.  Besides, her village wanted revenge, not shelter.
<br><br>
Over the course of those three years she had managed to keep her people alive while at the same time killing a few of the snakes here and a few of them there.  That amounted to a fair bit of revenge over those years.
<br><br>
She paused to rest under one of the broad-boled trees.  She tucked her tall lithe form into a very small ball.  Standing she looked almost like one of the forest saplings, tall and narrow.  Balled up she could disappear in the shadow of a small rock.  The snakes did not travel well in the cold evenings, and she knew that she was far enough from them now to sleep the rest of the night.  She closed her eyes for the first time in four days.  Sleep came immediately.
<br><br>
She dreamed of her friends and family as she did every time she slept.  Her father, tall, strong and brave.  She relived his death as he tried to save his dear, sweet little brother, only five at the time.  Once again she saw her mother die among the limbs of a burning tree as it was dropped on the village by the snakes.  She watched their leader cut through the tree with a single swing of the largest sword she had ever seen, pure metal and glowing with magic.  The dream was pieced together from things she had experienced and from things that she had learned only later.  She never saw the tree fall on her mother, she had been told about it later by one of the survivors.  She had only seen that great sword later as well, during one of her attacks on the snake camps.  Her dream shifted to one of those attacks.  It was difficult to sneak up on the snakes, their eyesight was as good as her own, perhaps better.  But on any cold night they were as slow as the lizards that they resembled.  It mattered little if they were seen sneaking into a camp.  They would still be able to kill three or four snakes before they had to flee.  And the snakes never caught them.
<br><br>
Until last night.  Again her dream shifted.  She again smelled the foulness of the snake camp as they crouched nearby.  Again she saw the snake guards with their backs turned, far too slow to turn in time.  She felt her spear stop a moment as it pierced the creatures lungs and came up against the ribs on the other side.  She pulled it out quickly and the snake fell to the ground.  With nearly the same efficiency and stealth four other snakes collapsed around their fire.  She saw again how the remaining seven snakes rose from their resting crouches, and she watched as they were easily slain.
<br><br>
And in her dream she once again saw the shadows rise from all around them.  Over a dozen snakes ran at them from the underbrush.  And these snakes were moving <em>fast</em>.  They tore into the Elves, each snake a match for the veteran Elves.  But they were still only snakes, and she had fought them for years now.  She knew their strengths and weaknesses, even when they moved like lightning.  She was able to kill two of them quickly as they rushed her.  She simply braced her spear for the first.  The snake was obviously new to this, it landed squarely where she hoped it would.  She was able to pull the spear all the way through and use it on the second snake.  But the others weren't so lucky.  Each of them faced three or more of the snakes, and the speed of the beasts was enough for them to land blow after blow on them with their clubs.  She saw a snake land a crushing blow to one skull after another.  She ran to help, but she moved as if in a foot of water.  And even as she ran the water seemed to rise.  She closed the distance to her people by half, and found herself moving more slowly.  Soon it was as if the water had risen over her head, and yet she could only run, never swim.  Snakes loomed over the bodies of her only family, and she couldn't move to avenge them.
<br><br>
But when she turned to flee, she could run as swiftly as ever.
<br><br>
She awoke saddened.  She would grieve for friends for the rest of her life.  For now, though, she needed to find another way to exact her revenge.  She rose and stretched to her full, if narrow, height.  All of her muscles ached.  Her heart ached.  She knew that the aches would go away in time, for eventually the snakes would get her too.  But until then, she would end as much of their pain as possible.
