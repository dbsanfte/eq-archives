<center><big><b>The Romance of Role-playing</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="-1">
What is it about role-playing that grabs our attention? Why are we all salivating for a game which essentially is no different than a MUD or a good session with a paper and pencil RPG? What is it about this experience which drives us to buy $500 worth of upgrades to our PCs with just the promise of a new online experience?
<br><br>
My first experience with fantasy literature was reading Tolkien's The Hobbit. In it, a small, unassuming homebody finds himself thrown into experiences which would reduce most individuals to quivering heaps. By sheer luck, stamina, and desire, he wins his way to a dragon hoard and witnesses a battle of five separate armies, then finds his way home with his share of the dragon's riches<b>...</b>

I could hear the slimed slippery sound of my pursuer's webbed feet whapping against the rock floor of the cave.   Then, as I slid across the narrow plank, the noise was closer, now a thwacking on the wooden span high over the murky stream below.  My hands pounded my drum harder and faster as if they could speed my feet along faster than the magic of the song was already doing.  I could almost feel the sticky tongue glomming onto my sweatsoaked hair  streaming behind me.  Would I make it?  Where was the gate?  It had to be there . . .

Okay, boys and girls, let’s discuss the most neglected, most misunderstood, least discussed part of role-playing online.  Boys role-playing girls and girls role-playing boys.

The following are pulled from a variety of sources I've flipped through while dealing with this issue on a MUD several years back.  So if you get déjà vu during this, you've been forewarned, and I apologize to those individual authors whom I have taken from here and unfortunately could not remember how to attribute.

"Oh where oh where has the role-playing gone?"  This is a common heard Lament of the role-player in EverQuest.  To answer the question, I do not know.  Many say it's the lack of others role-playing.  Fair enough.  However if that is the case, why haven't I seen it?

If you read EverQuest Express regularly then you've probably read a few articles about roleplaying certain classes, like Paladins and Bards, and certain races, like Dwarves and Tier'dal.  We've covered nearly all the bases.  And officially EverQuest doesn't have alignments, but many of us view the world of fantasy with the ideas of 'good', 'evil' and 'neutral' in our minds.  Now many of our articles have hit on the ideals of good and evil pretty squarely<b>...</b>

Well, an era ends.  Wynn has come to a point in his personal life that has caused him to leave EQX.  All I want to say in this week's editorial is that we will miss him.  He has helped to make this project into the thing that it is today.  Thanks, Wynn.

You can never FORCE someone to behave a certain way in a freeform 
environment; you can only affect your own behavior.  But if your behavior 
and lack of response to THEIR behavior can nudge them - that is the best.
