Jythri walked along the lanes of Freeport, surrounded by his adoring fans.  He smiled down at them as they walked alongside him, waving their coppers and clamoring for a story.  This was the part of his vocation he enjoyed the most.
<br><br>
He waved them off, claiming he had pressing business with royalty or such as they begged and pleaded with him.  Finally, with feigned reluctance and a hearty sigh, he stopped and surrendered to them.
<br><br>
Settling to the ground, with his back to the wall, he opened his lute case, took out his lute and nestled it across his lap.  Leaving the case open on the ground was an old habit, though he had long since moved past the point of playing for coppers.  His works were in demand all over Norrath so money was no longer a problem.
<br><br>
But he never forgot his origins, nor his primary role: to tell stories.  To educate.  And to keep the history of Norrath alive in the hearts of its people.
<br><br>
"So, what story will it be today?"  Jythri smiled brightly, knowing what mayhem that simple question would bring.
<br><br>
The haggling commenced immediately, as each child waved his copper and demanded a story and telling the others how poor their choice was.
<br><br>
"I want to hear the tale of Cein the Rogue!"  shouted one.
<br><br>
"Bah, EVERYONE'S heard that one.  I want to hear about the great snowy giants of Everfrost!"
<br><br>
"Bleah, big fat snowmen!  I want to hear about the Sea Kingdom!"
<br><br>
For several moments this went on, Jythri making note of all the tales they wanted to hear, trying to decide which one would entertain them the most, when a figure stepped up to the group, his massive shadow falling across all of them.  He flicked a finger and a silvery coin arced through the air to land in the lute case.  A large platinum coin, bearing the face of Mathaniel Marr upon it.
<br><br>
"I would like to hear the tale of The Tower of Night, please."  With a voice that rumbled like distant thunder, Baldaan, Paladin Lord of Marr and defender of Freeport, stood over the group.
<br><br>
Jythri smiled up at the Paladin as the kids turned and stared at him, mouths agape in awe but for a moment.  Then, all reverence forgotten, they turned on Jythri.
<br><br>
"The Tower of Night?!  What is that?"
<br><br>
"Wow!  I've never heard that story!  Tell us Jythri!"
<br><br>
The young bard nodded his head in submission as all of the children agreed and threw their coins into the lute case.  One of the children reached to touch the platinum coin but a glance and arched brow from Jythri cause him to quickly pull his hand back.
<br><br>
Baldaan walked around the circle and leaned against the wall, his plate mail scraping the stone as he made himself comfortable for the coming tale.
<br><br>
Jythri strummed a couple of chords on his lute, tuning it and clearing his throat, bringing to mind the Tale of the Tower of Night.  More a story than a song, still he used the music of the lute, plus his limited magics, to set the mood and tone of his audience, luring them in and enrapturing them with his voice and music.
<br><br>
"Hearken unto me, for I spin a tale of hope and despair, pleasure and pain, happiness and misery, for all to hear.
<br><br>
The Tower of Night, as all here know, stands alone upon a hill in the Oasis of Marr.  Surrounded by water, and there again by the Oasis itself, and lastly by the desert wastes of Ro.
<br><br>
By day, Spectres walk that isolated knoll, killing all who come near and encroach upon that which is theirs.
<br><br>
By night, the eerie glowing light of the final spells of its owner can be seen, and his wails can be heard from the swamps of Innothule to the walls of Freeport.  Such pain and suffering are in that voice that the bravest of men quail in fear.
<br><br>
But how did this come about?  From whence did the horrors come?
<br><br>
To know this, we must look back.  Many millennia ago, when the wastes of Ro were instead a lush forest.  Within this forest, before humans walked this land, stood the spires of Takish Hiz.
<br><br>
The most beautiful city to ever grace the world upon which we walk, Takish Hiz was of the Highest Elves.  Tall, slender, beautiful peoples that built a city that matched their will.  Tall, beautiful illuminated spires.  Wide, lush parks.  And Magic.  Everywhere was there Magic.  Every rock, every tree, every building was shaped by the will of the Elves that lived there.
<br><br>
This was an age of gods and legends.  Tunare herself was rumored to walk the halls of this fair city at one time, until the time when the gods pulled themselves from our world.
<br><br>
The Elves of Takish Hiz were, at one time, the most devout of all races, being the direct descendants of the gods themselves.  But when Innoruuk was allowed to steal their king and queen, their heart and soul, and torture them for his own twisted purposes, the Elves began to turn cold.  That the gods would allow this to happen and take no vengeance upon Innoruuk distanced the elves from their faith.
<br><br>
Over time, after the loss of their king and queen, the wizards of Takish Hiz devoted their time and energy to further hone their magical arts.  Centuries passed and their power grew until they began to feel like unto gods themselves with the power they wielded.  In particular the Council of Fire, a group of the most powerful elven wizards that primarily used Fire magics, felt that they had learned all the secrets of Fire and were, in truth, its master.
 <br><br>
These wizards, all mighty Archmages in their own right, cast huge rituals, calling forth the hidden secrets of fire, using it to forge great magics and artifacts, melting even the steel forged by the Combine of old.  Items of untold power came from the forges of this Council, pulling the fiery bones of the earth to the surface to do their bidding.
<br><br>
About this time, there lived two brothers, Takyra Dey and Celdin Dey, twins in every respect on the outside.  But within, as different as night and day.
<br><br>
Takyra was a magician, working upon the great summoning spells, opening gateways to other planes and dealing with the great powers without.  Great of mind and greater of temper, his passions frequently caused him difficulties with his peers, which is why he built a tower in the middle of town in which to craft his incantations in relative isolation.
<br><br>
Within his tower, Takyra lived with his wife, Kalirana.  Fiery of nature and spirit, a perfect mate for Takyra, and one of the members of the Council of Fire.  Her magics were as powerful as any wizard on the Council, and her will more so, such that she had great influence in the governing of the city.
<br><br>
Celdin, was an Enchanter of great power.  Frequently called upon by the other spell casters, his magics bound the spells of others into objects and beings.  The creator of golems and artifacts, his quiet and steady nature was loved by all.  However, he was totally devoted to his brother and, as such, built an identical tower next to his brother's so that he would always be near him.
<br><br>
While most other Elves had strayed in their beliefs in the gods, Celdin remained a devout worshipper of Mathaniel Marr, the god of light, honor, and truth.  Though not public in his worship, he paused each day to give time to his patron, and thank him for every gift he received.
<br><br>
This devotion was why Celdin was rewarded with a vision.  At night, while he slept, Marr sent a dream to him, a warning of things to come.
<br><br>
It seemed that, though the elves had strayed from the gods, the gods had not forgotten them.  Deities, on the whole, do not meddle in the affairs of mortals, as they have more pressing concerns upon them.  But some of the gods, especially those of great passion or temper, do not take slights lightly.
<br><br>
And no god is of greater passion or temper than Solusek Ro, the Lord of Fire.  Ro gazed down upon the elves of Takish Hiz in anger and rage, having contempt for their arrogance and audacity in thinking they were the rulers of fire.
<br><br>
In Celdin's dream, Ro stepped forth onto Norrath and tore Takish Hiz asunder, burning it to the ground and leaving no two stones standing together.  Celdin awoke with a start, screaming and covered in a cold sweat.
<br><br>
He rushed from his bed, threw on a robe, and ran to his brother's tower, awakening him and his wife from their bed.  Takyra tried to calm his brother to no avail as Celdin revealed his dream, his words spilling over each other in his fear.
<br><br>
Kalirana laughed at the threat, and suggested that Solusek Ro could certainly come and TRY to take the city, but the Council of Fire would put him in his place.  At this confirmation of the arrogance of his people, the blood fled from Celdin's face.  He knew the dream would come true, and he knew his people were lost.
<br><br>
The next week, Celdin never left Takyra's side, trying desperately to persuade him to believe him.  Though totally devoted to his Kalirana, his brother was a part of him and eventually Takyra began to believe him.  He too could see the hubris with which his people carried themselves, content in their invulnerability.  Though he did not pay much heed to the gods, he knew they existed and knew of their power.
<br><br>
Now that he had his brother's support, Celdin returned to his tower and began formulating a plan.  Perhaps he could create an Enchantment that could protect the entire city.  It was larger than any he had ever tried, but he felt confident that Marr would guide him.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Takyra went to the Council of Wizards.  The rulers of Takish Hiz, these great magic users controlled the fate of the city and surrounding areas.  Takyra stood before them and explained Celdin's dream, urging them to make some amends or change their ways to save the people they claimed to protect.
<br><br>
The Council dismissed him with the same derision that his wife had dismissed Celdin.  Kalirana sat on the Council, her face awash with humiliation at what her husband had done.
<br><br>
That evening, they fought.  From within his tower, a hundred feet away, Celdin could hear the shouts as Kalirana berated Takyra for disgracing her to her peers, making her look the fool for marrying such a deluded lunatic.  She packed her belongings and left the tower, leaving her husband standing in the doorway weeping.
<br><br>
Celdin continued his research, both in trying to find out more about how Solusek Ro would exact his vengeance, and how to stop it.  After weeks of research, he stumbled upon both.
<br><br>
Every year, at the coming of Winter Festival, the Council of Fire gathered and lit The Great Brazier.  This huge conflagration was both a celebration of the end of the year and a manifestation of the power of the Council.  It was a great ceremony where the entire population of Takish Hiz came forth to give thanks to the Council for another year of their protection.
<br><br>
From what Celdin could see, the lighting of the Brazier was going to go terribly wrong.  He gave this information to Takyra, who tried again to go before the Council, but was not even allowed to plead his case.  Tired, downtrodden, and broken hearted, Takyra spent his time in his tower, helping Celdin work out the protection rituals.
<br><br>
The idea was simple, if a bit grander than Celdin was used to.  Taking the basic concept of a "Protective Skin" spell, Celdin was going to protect the entire city.  He was not positive he could accomplish this, even with the help of his brother, but he saw no other choice but to try.
<br><br>
When the day of the Festival arrived, Takyra went forth into town and sought out his wife.  He found her in her chambers, preparing for the ritual.  When he entered, she stood and glared at him, demanding he leave immediately before she called the guards.  He walked up to her, told her he loved her, then silenced her with the simple expediency of slapping her to the ground.
<br><br>
Picking her up and setting her over his shoulder, he pulled a cloak of invisibility around them and crept from the Council Hall.  Once in his tower, he set her in a chair and bound her to it, then positioned the chair near a window so she could gaze out upon the city.
<br><br>
He then ascended his tower, took his place in the center of his circle of power, and faced his brother's tower.  Across the distance, Celdin sat in his circle, his eyes closed, his will extending to encompass the entire city.  Takyra felt the draw upon his own power as Celdin's spell fed off of him.  Closing his own eyes, he slipped into a meditation, becoming a source of mana to his brother.
<br><br>
In the center of the city, the Brazier was being readied.  The bronze was polished, coals put in place, and the Council of Fire were taking their places.  Some note was taken of Kalirana's absence, and the guards were dispatched to try to find her, but the ritual must proceed apace so her chair remained empty.
<br><br>
People gathered around the town center, keeping a respectful distance, but longing to be closer to see the great magics at work.  For centuries, the Council had lit this brazier and each year the fireworks were more magnificent than the last.
<br><br>
The Council began the ceremony, linking hands and casting the incantation that would ignite the coals.  Delving deep into their knowledge of the power of fire, they sought the Heart of the Flame, wanting the purest manifestation of fire possible.  The droning of their chant grew in intensity as they moved deeper within themselves, finding the fire in their souls to feed this spell.  And when they found it, they each grasped it from within and began to draw it out.
<br><br>
Only it would not move.<br>
And it would not let them go.<br>
And it started to burn.  
<br><br>
Deep within their trance, the wizards began to panic.  Their minds locked in meditation, their souls afire from within, the wizards heard the roar of an all consuming flame… Then they exploded.
<br><br>
The people around the brazier sat waiting for the celebration to begin when the wizards, every last one of them, burst into a white-hot flame.  The flames linked together and joined, making a ring of fire that moved towards the brazier, walking along the stone though there was nothing to burn, no fuel for the flames.  Once the ring reached the brazier, a column of fire shot into the sky, parting the clouds and lighting the night.
<br><br>
Back at the twins' towers, the shield that Celdin had been building was shattered like a child's plaything, causing him physical pain as it tore asunder.  Quickly gathering his wits about him, he rebuilt the shield smaller, including as much of the town and people as he could, but not including the square or the Brazier.
<br><br>
The column of fire took shape…it became the shape of a man, hundreds of feet tall, composed of flame.  "So, mortals!" his voice boomed across the heavens.  "You think you know fire?  The time to pay for your insolence is at hand!"
<br><br>
Solusek Ro reached out with his mighty hand, and miles to the west of the city the land buckled.  He wrenched his hand up, and a wall of stone jutted up from the ground, forming what we now call the Serpent's Spine Mountains.  The ground, angered by this violation, buckled and like a wave on the ocean, it heaved and tossed elf and building alike, sending both crashing to the ground.
<br><br>
"Now you will know fire!" Solusek roared, and the column of fire that he was began widening.  Elves ran in all directions, screaming as they burned or were crushed by falling buildings, as the wall of fire advanced.
<br><br>
As it touched the edge of Celdin's shield, he flinched back as if struck.  After all, what was the will of one Enchanter against the rage of a god?
<br><br>
Each time the shield started to crumple, Celdin would pull it back and try to reinforce it.  The wall would advance, reach the shield, and begin to crush it again.  Finally, it had reached the grove upon which the towers were built, and Celdin was giving up hope.  Resigned to his fate, he said one last prayer to his patron Marr and put the rest of his soul into the shield...desperately trying to save his brother with the last vestiges of his life.
<br><br>
And Marr heard.  
<br><br>
From deep inside of Celdin, a light shone.  And this light bled out of him and into the shield, shoring it up as the wall of flames fell upon it.  The flames crashed against it over and over, but the shield held.  Finally, in a fit of rage, the flames pushed up and over the shield, encompassing the entire dome in flame as it advanced about the remains of the city, laying all to waste.
<br><br>
Yet still the shield held.
<br><br>
When the land was rent asunder and the mountains were raised, Kalirana awoke and looked out of the window.  As her people died, she watched in horror.  As the flames advanced, she struggled to be free, feeling terror at the flames that were coming to consume her.  When the fire covered the dome, she fainted dead away.
<br><br>
The wrath of Solusek Ro destroyed every living thing from the Ocean of Tears to the newly formed Serpent Spine mountains, leaving nothing but a smoking wasteland devoid of life, but for one small circle.
<br><br>
Celdin awoke slowly, not remembering passing out, the sunlight baking down upon him finally rousing him from his unconsciousness.  He stood upon the roof of his tower and gazed about in horror.  With the exception of a ring of grass and trees directly around the tower, protected by the will of Marr, his city was gone.  Naught remained but the broken bones of buildings, the ashes of trees and people, and sand.
<br><br>
The weather, still recovering from the shock it had received, began whipping wildly with winds at the wasteland, stirring up clouds of sand and ash, forcing Celdin to seek cover within his tower.  Remembering his brother, he then ran from his tower to his brother's and up the stairs.  He spotted the collapsed form of his brother's wife, then continued up to the top.  His brother lay unconscious upon the roof, his breathing shallow and weak.
<br><br>
Celdin picked up his brother and brought him inside.  Putting him on his bed, he began caring for him.  He untied Kalirana and placed her on the bed beside her husband, and fetched food and water for both.
<br><br>
Kalirana was the first to waken.  She roused from bed, lazily, then sat up quickly and rushed to the window.  The wasteland before her caused her to collapse to the stone floor in tears, exhaustion and disbelief once again claiming her.
<br><br>
Celdin returned with foodstuffs, and returned Kalirana to the bed.  Using a cold rag, he managed to rouse Takyra slowly, though he was very weak.  Takyra turned and gazed at his brother, a worried question in his eyes.  Celdin nodded sadly, then turned and indicated the window.  Celdin helped his brother to his feet and they both walked to the window.  They stood, for awhile, gazing at the barren land that was once full of their people.
<br><br>
Time passed for the three, though not well.  Celdin continued his work, even more devoted to Marr than ever.  Takyra spent all of his time caring for his wife.  And Kalirana simply faded away.  Guilt, Shame, and Loss ate away at her, making her sicker and sicker.  Her friends, her family, her peers… all dead… all destroyed.  At the hands of her own arrogance.
<br><br>
His love for her never wavering, Takyra stayed at her side night and day, trying with all his might to coax her back to life.  Celdin did everything within his power to help his brother, but it is impossible to save a soul that does not wish to live.
<br><br>
When Kalirana died, Takyra wept for a week.  He wept for everyone that had died, but when his beloved Kalirana passed away, she took his soul with her.  She was buried in a tomb beneath his tower, so she would never be far from him.
<br><br>
After that, Takyra became a different man.  He would leave for many weeks at a time, travelling the world, and returning with books and tomes of archaic knowledge, then cloistering himself into his tower for weeks more, never coming out.
<br><br>
Celdin became concerned and approached his brother about his strange behavior, asking him if there was anything he could do to help.  Initially, Takyra's reactions were somewhat hostile, but he eventually confided in his brother that he wanted to find a way to bring his wife back.  He had spoken to many priests and clerics but all said the same thing… a woman with no god is beyond their reach.
<br><br>
He could not accept such an answer, so started delving deeper, seeking another avenue.  Celdin became concerned, as this was not like his brother.  Wandering about his brother's tower, he would find books on Necromancy and worse arts lying about, open to sections of appalling rituals.  The thought of his brother's soul becoming so corrupted frightened him greatly.
<br><br>
Then, one evening, he walked into Takyra's tower to ask him a question and did not find him.  Ascending the tower, he found his brother upon the roof, inscribing an intricate circle of power upon the stone.  Within the circle was the mummified body of his wife, wrapping in ornately runed cloth.  Celdin called his brother's name, and the face that turned to meet him was not that of his brother, but of a madman.
<br><br>
"What are you doing?"  Celdin asked.
<br><br>
"I've found a way.  I'm going to bargain with Nualt."  Takyra turned and continued his work hurriedly, as if it needed to be completed by a certain time.
<br><br>
Celdin moved closer to the circle, causing Takyra to stop his work and rush to stand in front of him.  "Who is Nualt?" Celdin asked.
<br><br>
"He is the god of the Dead.  The keeper of souls.  The judge the godless face upon death."  Takyra spoke with such fervor that Celdin took a step back.
<br><br>
"There is no such being.  All know that the godless die a soulless death."  Celdin spoke the words that had been taught to him since he could understand them.
<br><br>
"No!" screamed Takyra, and he slapped Celdin down, striking his brother who he had never laid a hand upon before in his life.
<br><br>
Celdin gazed up at what was once his brother and nodded, then turned to leave.  Takyra resumed his work, paying close attention to make sure everything was perfect.  While Takyra was so focused, Celdin reached over and erased a rune, essentially breaking the circle and making any ritual that might be performed in it useless.  Then he got up and left the roof of the tower, crossing the distance to his own and ascending to the roof.
<br><br>
He sat there, watching his brother from the roof of his own tower, meditating.  As his brother completed his circle, he stood in the center of it and began to chant his incantations.   Hours went by and nothing changed, but Takyra continued to chant.  Just when Celdin had decided he should go tell his brother what he had done, something changed.
<br><br>
Though not cloudless, the desert was fairly calm that evening.  All of a sudden, it was dead calm.  Not a grain of sand moved, not a palm leaf rustled.  All had stopped.  Celdin glanced over to his brother's tower and saw a mass of darkness gathering over the body of Kalirana, which slowly took the shape of a cloaked, legless figure bearing a scythe.
<br><br>
Takyra spoke to the figure, though Celdin could not hear the words, and the figure seemed to listen.  Then it started advancing upon Takyra.  Takyra took a step back and held out his hand, gesturing to the circle upon the roof of the tower, but the figure continued to advance.
<br><br>
Celdin, realizing what he had done, quickly pulled together a spell and launched it at the figure, hoping to distract it.  The spell struck the figure, causing it to reel back slightly, and it turned its baleful gaze upon Celdin.  The Enchanter stood fast, awaiting the return attack and prayed that his defensive spells would hold.
<br><br>
A huge claw, composed of darkness, shot forth from the being's scythe and slammed into an invisible shield surrounding Celdin.  It grabbed around it and began to squeeze, lifting Celdin from the ground slightly and causing sparks and lightning to arc about his body.  Celdin focused his attention on maintaining the shield, but was amazed at the amount of force being exerted.
<br><br>
Takyra, seeing this change, cast his own spell upon the spectre, his sanity returning in the light of his brother in danger.  The spectre reached out with one cold arm and latched it around Takyra's throat, lifting him from the ground as if he weighed nothing.
<br><br>
Turning his bony face to meet Takyra's, the spectre gestured to Celdin's tower with his scythe.  Takyra watched as the spectre made an upward motion with his dark weapon.  The ground began to shake and Celdin's tower begin to sway as the ground beneath Takyra's tower rose.  The flat ground around the towers buckled and heaved, pushing Takyra's tower skyward on a pinnacle of rock while Celdin's sank into a deep indentation that surrounded Takyra's.  Far above, Takyra watched as Celdin's tower and the ground around it sank deeper and deeper into a recession.  Then the spectre made another gesture and deep beneath the sand an underground river pushed through.  With an explosion of stone and water, the recession began to fill.
<br><br>
Celdin attempted to break free but was unable to move.  As he struggled, the water rose up his tower and over it, submerging him completely.  Takyra watched his brother disappear and the water continue to rise helplessly, unable to break free of the spectre's grip.  Eventually, all that remained was the pinnacle of rock with Takyra's tower and a moat around it.
<br><br>
Then the spectre turned to Takyra, released his scythe which hovered in place, and plunged a hand into Takyra's chest.  The hand did not break the skin, but instead passed through him.  The spectre pulled his hand out, bringing with it Takyra's soul, tearing it free.  Takyra howled and screamed in torment as his soul was torn free, then fell limp, his body empty and lifeless.
<br><br>
Desperately trying to break free, his shield protecting him from the crushing magic but not the water, Celdin began to drown.  The last thing that Celdin heard, before the water claimed his life, was the wailing of his brother, then he too was gone.
<br><br>
The spectre cast aside Takyra's body like a broken rag doll and it plummeted into the water.  Turning to the body of Kalirana, the spectre reached into it and pulled out the loose strands of her soul as well.  Taking the two souls to the center of the roof, it mystically bound them together in a bright glow that could be seen for miles around.  This glow stands there today as a warning to those that would bargain with the Lord of the Dead."
 <br><br>
When Jythri finished his tale, there was silence.  He glanced up and around and realized that a good number of people had gathered, many of which had dropped coins into his case.  The children had a myriad of different expressions on their faces; horror, sadness, and confusion.
<br><br>
Baldaan just nodded his head, turned, and walked away.  Jythri nodded enigmatically at the Paladin's back, then turned and spun into another tale, knowing that no song he sung would shake loose the things these people had heard today.
