As Leif ran towards Orag, he was gripped by a sudden moment of hesitation. Druids never enjoyed fighting and only fought if necessary. Leif was completely destroying the morals he had set for himself. He pushed the hesitation out of his mind. When he was about 50 yards away from Orag, he stopped.

"Orag!"

<em>But is was on the surface of Norrath that Tunare's creation of the Elves, creatures whose limitless grace and beauty was only exceeded by their mastery of magic, drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he rules, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret this disrespect<b>...</b></em>

	The warm wind blew lightly across the waters' glistening surface causing ripples to spread throughout the path it flew.  The gust hastened across the opening of the massive lake and quickly found itself filtering through the tall mushrooms trees just beyond the water.

I came to, more than a little off the plank, the world about as cohesive to me as Ogre Poetry.

Before I could comprehend who was asking I babbled something incoherent... something to the effect of, "Hold the cow still, Ma, how else am I gonna milk it?"

A small dark figure sat at his desk scribbling sentences on an old piece of parchment.

<em>"Followers of Innoruuk, The Prince of Hate, include nearly the entire Dark Elven race that regard him as their "Father." They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather "THE" creative forces in the universe. Creativity born of destruction. Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it<b>...</b>"</em>

This past summer I played on a large and popular MUD.  During the summer 
months it is noticeably less populated than during the fall and spring.  This 
is, of course, because many MUD players are college students who connect to 
the game through their university network.  The summer months were a blast, 
playing and feeling camaraderie with a smaller group of dedicated players.  
Then the droves returned from vacation and the game went into the tanker.

I was recently reminded of a challenge that I was issued.  I was never forced to resolve this challenge because the opportunity never came up.  But soon I will have to respond.  You see, several months ago I went off on a rant at a game session.  I don't remember exactly what set it off.  I'm certain that I was justified in my rant, though<b>...</b>

A few years ago, after I had become a builder on a mud I was playing, one of my fellow builders offered me a chance to play on another MUD that he had designed.  With it, he included access to much of the code he had written, so I perused it carefully<b>...</b>

I just read the editorial on your opinions pertaining to non-combative
classes and while normally I agree with your opinions absor I feel I had to
respond.  You make a strong case to include them but in the end I felt your
logic was faltering.
