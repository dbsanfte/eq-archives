	The man slowly opened his eyes feeling a sharp pain on the back of his head.  He moved his hand up to feel what he thought was a wound and found that they stopped abruptly by the shackles that held them.  He moved his arm very near his face to view what was holding him in place and at that moment was aware of the darkness that surrounded him.  He could only see the outline of his hand and a black brace that fit tightly to his wrist.
<br><br>
	The man suddenly remembered what danger he was in and why.  Fear shot adrenaline through his body as he jumped to free himself, but quickly crashed down to the ground as some silent force held him fast.  He scanned the room to try to make out anything that might help him in an escape but only saw a very feint light under the crack of a door across the room.  
<br><br>
	The man called on his inner power to shine some light in the room so he could calmly assess the situation.  The familiar words appeared in his mind for the simple spell but as he chanted them he was stunned to discover no sound came forth from his lips.  He cried out but his lips moved in silence as he tried yet another more powerful spell to disarm the magic that held him.  He opened his eyes and moved his limbs only to find that he was still mysteriously bound.  The man sank in defeat and prayed to Quellious, the God of Tranquility.
<br><br>
	As if his prayers were answered the light from across the room brightened and the door opened wide.  His pupils shrank from the brilliance of the light and he had to close his eyes to ease the pain.  When he finally focused on the stranger before him he realized that Quellious could not help him.
<br><br>
	What he saw was a stunningly beautiful woman adorned in a long deep purple cape.  She wore tight, black bottoms and a matching top that fit her figure perfectly.  Her hair was dark red and pulled back in one of the latest fashions.  Enticingly pale skin contrasted beautifully to her dark clothing.  He looked up her enticing body to a face which held beauty that he had never before seen the likes of.  He held his breath as he stared into the most alluring eyes.  They were unlike anything he had ever witnessed, darker than her hair with a rich scarlet hue, reminding him of the color of blood.
<br><br>
	With that thought the man felt a fear begin to overwhelm him.  As if sensing his fear, the alluring woman smiled broadly revealing to him her four sharp pointed teeth.  The man screamed but his mouth silently opened as he realized that the woman before him was not alive.  She was one of the many dead walking on Norrath, for she was a vampire and servant of Cazic-Thule, The Faceless.

Allure glided swiftly down the dark corridor with a confident and evil smirk.  Her purple cape flowing back as the breeze swept past her.  At the end of the long hallway a huge black marble door blocked anyone from entering.  Allure floated to a halt and released the magic from her mind, slowly descending to the stone floor.  She took a step forward and whispered a few words, before rasping lightly on the massive door.
<br><br>
	A few seconds passed as Allure patiently waited for the passage to open.  Without a sound the large black door moved inward allowing Allure to enter.  As the door quietly shut behind her Allure again chanted softly, putting the magical ward back in place.  She stepped lightly in the large chamber but the noise resounded off the unseen walls.
<br><br>
	The room was enormous.  Decorated pillars reached up into the darkness that loomed high overhead.  The only light in the room was a dim globe that sat atop a hand shaped pedestal in the middle of the gigantic chamber.  Large marble fingers, the size of an average man's arm, wrapped around the sphere.  
<br><br>
	Still fifty yards away, Allure slowly approached the globe.  Each footstep sounded like thunder in this silent chamber.  Allure walked between the first of two pillars which had statues of wolfmen carved into them.  She knew the statues were no longer living, but as she passed by she felt as if they were watching her.  She continued forward between many nightmare images carved in the black marble.  A snarling ghoul, a moaning mummy, a shadow knight, and an evil grinning vampire, all of them the masterpiece of a demented and starving artist -- starving, not for work or gold, but for blood.
<br><br>
	Allure came to a halt in front of the globe and placed her hands on to the smooth glass surface.  She chanted for many minutes as the light flickered sending the shadows of the statues into frantic movement.  With a final and powerful word, Allure released her grasp from the globe and the light slowly faded away only to be replaced by a dreadful face.
<br><br>
	"What have you learned from the mortal?"  the image bellowed.  The last word he spoke echoing throughout the chamber.
<br><br>
	"That all is not as tragic as it seems, master." Allure replied in a soft steady tone.  "As we speak, the paladin is weak with terror."
<br><br>
	"Do not underestimate the power of that one my dear Allure.  For he is one of the reasons I cannot rule with you on the material plane".  The words brought a spiteful sneer to the conjured face.  
<br><br>
	Allure stared into the image, lost in the black orbs that looked upon her.  A woman of her beauty rarely found attraction in others, and though most people would find him repulsive, Allure was hypnotically drawn to his power.  How she longed to taste him and be in his mighty arms.  She shook off the overwhelming desire and quickly replied.  "Have no fear Cazic-Thule, for with the generous information I received from him you will soon feel the damp night under your wings." Allure spoke melodramatically.  "While I was feeding on his sweet blood his mind revealed much to me."
<br><br>
	"Do go on my dear Allure." the grinning deity stated. 
<br><br>
	"There are two other travel companions that he recently departed from," the vampire said in a mocking tone.  "When we have them in our grasps you will be free from this imprisonment!"
<br><br>
	"Find them at once!" the impatient god exclaimed.  "And remember do everything in your power to keep them alive until I return." he warned.  With that the image disappeared and Allure was once again facing the dim light of the sphere.
<br><br>
	Allure's confident grin diminished as she turned to leave the chamber.  No one ever spoke to her in such a tone!  She let her anger subside as she exited the large room reminding herself that Cazic-Thule wasn't just anyone, he is The Faceless god of terror.
