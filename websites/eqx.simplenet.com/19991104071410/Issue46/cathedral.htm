<p style="text-align: justify">

	The darkness was intruding, cold, in the fog. Tricks of the light and fog sent images of creatures stalking his forebrain, which in turn sent ripples up his spine. With a wry shake of the head and a lopsided grin, Jared shrugged it off and continued to walk towards the cathedral. Tonight was a good night, a night of joy - why was he then thinking of monsters and ghouls right out of childhood nightmare? He didn't know, and with another grin that quickly turned into a soft chuckle, he picked up the pace. 
<br><br>
	Beautifully colored lights emanated through the stained glass of the cathedral's main windows soon came into view. Despite himself, Jared snatched a quick look behind to assure his imagination that nothing followed. To be sure that nothing was waiting to tear flesh from bone and devour his soul, as his mind was ever sure was about to happen. Again came the chuckle, this time slightly strained as his quick walk turned into a stuttered jog, his mind again dominating his emotions and bringing fear to the fore. 
<br><br>
	A step? Surely it could have been nothing but. Jared's suddenly unsmiling eyes flicked about in the gloom, searching for the owner of the sound that had drifted to his ears through the gradually thickening mists. 
	<br><br>
	"Who goes there?" he demanded of the darkness, hand resting uneasily upon the pommel of his sheathed long sword, "Speak your name and business!" His voice took on the true tremor of fear as he continued to scrutinize the darkness before and beside him. "Now your ears play tricks on you, Jared. Get a hold of yourself!" he mumbled, dropping his sword arm to his side and taking up a true jog.
<br><br>
	As he neared the wide steps leading to the ornate double doors of the cathedral, he again heard the sound of boot on gravel. With a curse, he spun to face the inky blackness behind him, his hand flying to the pommel of his trusty weapon.
<br><br>
	"Step into the light, whoever you are! Now, or know that my blade will taste the blood of your life!" His unsteady voice echoed back from the surrounding wood with hollow mimicry. 
	<br><br>
	Shaking, sweat slicked palms grasped for the handle behind him, though he kept his eyes on the path. With a jolt of sickening adrenaline, he found the door bared from the inside and immovable despite mighty tugs and cries of frustration. His eyes snapped back to the path once more, his heart racing. The ring of steel, clear and sweet, filled the night when his blade found the air. 
<br><br>
	"Show yourself!" Jared bellowed, using anger to mask his growing fear, "Show yourself at once, creature of the night!" Again came the scratching of something hard against stone. With budding trepidation, realization struck. The sound was not that of boot, as had been his initial thought, but that of talon or tooth upon bone.
<br><br>
	Before he knew what was happening, Jared's powerful legs were propelling him back the way he had come, back towards the town, 20 minutes away. As he ran, he drew nearer to the sound of scraping, a sound that drew sickening imagery to his now free-reigning imagination. Scenes of hideous creatures dining upon some innocent maiden flooded his thoughts, bringing cold beads of sweat to his brow and tremors to his fingers.
<br><br>
	As he ran, he drew nearer and nearer to the sound until it began to fade. His fear slowly ebbed as many moments passed without the sound returning. After still more minutes, he slowed and stopped on the trail. He wondered what it was he had heard, could it be some creature? Some  hideous spawn of the Underworld? Or was it a simple woodland creature, eating it's caught quarry? 
<br><br>
With a burst of laughter, Jared began to believe that he was, indeed, spooked by a simple woodland beast. He braced his hands upon bent knees to draw much needed breath for a few seconds then started off once more, only to find himself confronted with the sound of shattering bone and the scraping of -he now realized- fingernails upon rock.
<br><br>
Frenzied eyes darted about, seeking the origins of the sounds, but once more he saw nothing. He began to run, he ran as if the Faceless One himself were chasing. He ran and ran, for many minutes. Slowly he came to realize that he should have reached town by this time. As he began to panic, confusion struck. The cathedral. 
<br><br>
He stood before the doors of the cathedral once more. "What is happening here?" he whispered with dread. More of the gruesome sounds came to his ears. He screamed in rage and terror, his sword coming once more from it's sheath. He screamed for the creatures to come to him so that he might face the bringer of his fear. And then he saw it, hunched in the gloom.
<br><br>
Glowing eyes of the darkest crimson watched him from the foliage to the side. So close, so very close. With drawn out calm, the creature began to rise from it's crouch. Slowly, oh so agonizingly slowly, it rose. Six feet, then seven then eight feet tall it stretched until it stood glaring down at him from a height nearly double his 6 foot height. 
<br><br>
Jared's knees buckled beneath him, his now weak hand released the hilt of his weapon and it tumbled to the earth beside his limp form. The cool earth beneath him felt comforting in his heated fear. For many seconds, he stared, uncomprehending, into the eyes of evil. When the beast did nothing for what seemed an eternity, Jared's hand began to seek his dropped blade. Upon closing upon the hilt, his strength began to return and he found he could stand. 
<br><br>
As he rose, a low, menacing growl filled the air. He felt, more then heard, the threat in that rumbling growl. Again his knees nearly buckled, but through sheer will he remained upon his feet. The creature took a long stride towards him, coming into the dim light from the cathedral at his back. Long arms nearly touched the ground, their fingers were tipped with curved and viciously jagged black claws. The sinewy, well muscled arms were covered in sharp protrusions, as was the rest of the creature's body. But of all the fear-inspiring protrusions, the worst was the hideously deformed head. Shaped like that of a bull, it was broad with curling horns and a long muzzle. Long teeth curled up over the top lip and steam drifted slowly from it's large nostrils to curl into the night. 
<br><br>
As Jared stood in mute terror at the evil creature before him, it slowly took another step towards him. It's arms lifted before it, grasping for him though he was still a few feet from the UnderSpawn. Jared stood stiff, unable to move, until the creature reared it's head and let loose an unearthly howl, renting the crisp night with the sounds of the Underworld. Again Jared took to heal, this time gibbering in terror.
<br><br>
He ran, he stumbled and he cried. He ran for eons, and finally worked up the courage to snatch a glance behind him. The UnderSpawn was nowhere to be seen. He slowed, whipping tears from his cheeks as he watched his rear. With a jarring thud, he ran head on into something solid. 
<br><br>
Jared tried to shake the stars and confusion form his mind. When he turned to see what he had ran into, he let out a scream of terror so profound, he startled even himself.
<br><br>
The Cathedral.
