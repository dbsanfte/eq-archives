The next few years were, for Amgho, a time of great change.  He grew to love the people and even the swinging bridges of Kelethin, grew softer of heart and kinder of spirit.  He trained diligently, and although his skill with instruments beyond the drum never became that of a master, the sheer potential of his voice was more than realized.  After the first Summer Concert that he sang in, he became quickly famous.  He was hailed as the next great Bard, and the fact that he was a Dwarf seemed to only add to his fascination.  The city of Wood Elves, so foreign to him at first, became home.
<br><br>
    He graduated five years after he arrived, to Journeyman, along with Kien.  Elnore was surprised but pleased that her daughter had finally found something she was willing to stick with, and they celebrated that night with half of Kelethin (or so it seemed) at the local tavern.  Amgho was hauled up onto the bar again and again to sing.  And sing he did, and drink he did.  He had a Dwarf's capacity for alcohol, but bards are bards, and he found himself hard pressed to keep up with the slight Elnore.  As for Sylia, she drank the entire place under the table, and was the one helping <em>him</em> home to bed.   
<br><br>
   Listening to the wind at his window, feeling the room tip and sway, Amgho knew he had let go, at last, of Kaladim.  No letters, no visits, no response at all from his family after he had written them telling them of his decision.  Not that he had expected any, but still.  That pain, too, was fading. He had the Guild, and Elnore and Kien.  He had his classmates.  He had a family here. 
    <br><br>
   As a Journeyman he was expected to travel, to see Norrath, to learn the different people and languages and lore of the land.  The sister Guild in Freeport welcomed travelers from Kelethin and Qeynos, and so he and Kien made that their first destination.
<br><br>
   It was inevitable that they would travel together.  Elnore encouraged it, saying that a bard needed all the friends they could find, and if that meant bringing a few with them, then she was all for the idea.  Still, it was a teary-eyed Elnore that bid them farewell at the foot of Kelethin's main lift.  Kien was impatient, eager to be off, but Amgho spent a long minute embracing the older woman.
<br><br>
"I will write," he assured her, letting go of her slender shoulders at last.  She nodded, wiping her eyes.  "And I will make her write, too," he added with a grin, jerking his head at Kien, who rolled her eyes toward the treetops.  She glanced at her mother, and softened.
<br><br>
   "Fare thee well, Mother," she said, and came forward to hug Elnore.  Elnore gave her a fierce squeeze, and then let go.
<br><br>
   "Take care of one another.  Watch for aqua goblins while at sea.  'Ware sirens!"   Her stream of advice followed them as they set off down the path.
<br><br>
    They covered the distance to the mountain pass into Butcherblock swiftly.  Amgho was unequalled in his mastery of the drum, except by old Haroth, the Drummaster, and their feet flew along the path.  They passed like a wind into Butcherblock, and ran out into the rolling rocky hills of the Dwarven homeland.
<br><br>
   He was possessed my mixed feelings as he saw again, for the first time in five years, the land of his birth.  Kien glanced sideways at him, but maintained the song, and refrained from asking him anything, even when they stopped for meals.  When twilight began to creep across the sky, however, her looks became more pointed.  Amgho grimaced to himself, and began looking for a waystation.  
<br><br>
   They had passed several during the day, but had seen no Dwarven Guards outside, watching the road and the country.  Now, as they approached another and slowed to a stop before it, Amgho became truly aware of the strangeness of it.  He rapped on the wood of the low door, brow creased.  A panel slid back and a pair of suspicious eyes peered forth.
<br><br>
   "Yes?"  snapped the other.
<br><br>
   "We are travelers, weary and seeking shelter for the night.  May we enter?" asked Amgho, wondering at the change from the gruff but welcoming people he remembered.
   <br><br>
   The other muttered briefly, but the sound of bolts being drawn preceded the opening of the door.  Amgho entered, brushing past the glowering Dwarf, but as Kien came forward, the other barred her way.
<br><br>
   "An Elf!" he exclaimed.  "You did not say your companion was an Elf."  He glared at Kien, who looked, startled, at Amgho.
<br><br>
   "I did not know it mattered," said Amgho, confused and beginning to grow angry.
<br><br>
   "Mattered!"  said the Dwarf, beginning to close the door on Kien.  
<br><br>
   "What are you doing?  We are travelers we claim way-right, and you would lock her out into the night?  What has become of the waystations?  I see abandoned ones left and right and now this?"  Amgho advanced on the Dwarf, burning with indignation.
<br><br>
   The other backed away, avoiding his gaze.
<br><br>
   "No!" Amgho barked.  "I will be answered."
<br><br>
   There was a long pause and then the Dwarf stood aside.   "She may stay," he muttered, and closed the door behind her swiftly.
<br><br>
   "Amgho, what..." she began, but he shook his head, watching the Dwarf.  There was something very odd at work here.
<br><br>
    They slept poorly and rose with the dawn.  Eating a cold breakfast of the rations they had brought with them, they were back on the road before the time the sun had touched the tops of the mountains.  Before them was a long run to Kaladim, and Amgho was not sure what he would do once he saw the city.  It would be foolhardy not to stop and reprovision, but too many memories waited there.  He could almost feel his father's presence.
<br><br>
In the end, they came to the city in the late afternoon, and as Amgho judged they could make the docks by nightfall, they ran right by the city.  It fell behind them swiftly, although the towering shadow of the Dwarven warrior above the gates darkened the path before them for a long time.  When they were at last free from its shade, Amgho breathed a little easier.
<br><br>
   They stayed at a small inn by the docks that night, run by a pair of smiling Dwarven sisters who tugged at his beard and called him dearie.  They eyed Kien with some small suspicion, but when they found he was with her, welcomed her as well.  He was comforted by the fact that some of his people were as he remembered them.  Small liking for strangers, but hospitable and warm when their trust was won.
<br><br>
   He was glad, suddenly, that they had not gone into the city.  He wasn't sure he would have liked what he might have found there.  
<br><br>
   "Tis not my problem!"  he told his ceiling that night.  "Tis my home no longer."  He almost believed himself.
