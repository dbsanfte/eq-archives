<TR><TD align="left" WIDTH=264><P style="text-align: justify"><BIG><BIG>W</BIG></BIG>ell, Sony has finally given us our first real taste of what EverQuest will be like.&nbsp; All the comments about Sony's EverQuest Movie have been raves!&nbsp; Finally, &nbsp;&nbsp;after&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp; the discussions, and comments from the EverQuest development team, we have something we can sink our teeth into. 
<BR>
<BR>
The movie is really a grouping of short clips; basically, showing the same character (except in the case of the dark elf thrown in) moving through various terrains, a couple of spells cast, with a few monsters also included to give us a glimpse as to what we will have to face.&nbsp; The movie finally ends with a battle between this same character and a Red Dragon!<BR>
<BR>
I must say that the movement was superb!&nbsp; Smooth, steady, with some nice,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rounded,&nbsp;&nbsp; character 
</TD><TD align="left" WIDTH=264><P style="text-align: justify">limb<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT>movement as well.&nbsp; In addition, I found the monsters to have nice definition, and movement also. 
<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the Red Dragon at the end was superb!&nbsp; This is what a dragon should look like...&nbsp; Roughly 4 times the height of the player character (<EM>Ed: I think it was more like 20 times the height</EM>), and I would guess at 10-15 times the mass!&nbsp; Now, I have heard some complaints that the dragon was too easy to kill, only taking 1 sword strike, and a couple of fireball blows, however, as was also pointed out, what was displayed in the movie was actually only the opening blow, and then the death strike. &nbsp; This sequence was edited down to keep the movie size as small as possible.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, I would have to say that the EQ &nbsp;&nbsp;development&nbsp;&nbsp; team &nbsp;&nbsp;did&nbsp; a phenomenol &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job&nbsp;&nbsp; with &nbsp;&nbsp;this &nbsp;movie, 
</TD><TD align="left" WIDTH=216><P style="text-align: justify">and<FONT SIZE=5> </FONT>the timing couldn't have been better, only a day or so after the projected release date of the closed beta applications.&nbsp; These clips went a long way to keep the large following that EQ has already developed happy, and content, at least for a little while longer. 
<BR>
<BR>
Some of the things that I think we can look forward to in the next movie are much more detail on spell casting, and a larger variety; more depth, and variety on the monsters to be encountered; and possibily some PC and NPC interaction.&nbsp; These are the issues that will keep the EQ fans appeased until the open beta release.<BR>
