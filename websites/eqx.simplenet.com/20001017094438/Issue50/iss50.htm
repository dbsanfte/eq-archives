"Winter!" the shout rang through the forests, shaking leaves from the trees and startling birds from all over.  After pausing to hear an answer, the barbarian cupped his hands to his mouth and took a deep breath for another holler.
<br><br>
"Ahem," came a quiet voice from behind him.  Jalen let his breath out noisily and turned around.  A hulking figure close to seven feet tall, he towered over the smaller woman that stood before him.  She was clad in light robes over ornate leather armor, her hair the red of autumn leaves, her eyes the green of new spring grass.

Inariis fumed. Her eyes burned a blood red as she stormed from the council chamber. As soon as she felt she was far enough away from the chamber she spit out the necessary arcane syllables and disappeared in a small explosion of eldritch energy to appear again in her inner sanctum in a rush of displaced air. The residual energy sparkled and crawled over the cold, stone floor, seemingly with a life of its own. She was so furious that she didn't even do the small ritual to check for intrusions. Rage filled her mind almost to the brink of making her loose control. 'How dare they!  How could they even presume to order her? To defy her will regarding her sons?'  She howled in the confines of her mind, but only a low, predatory growl escaped her lips. She walked over to where the great, black, snake-adorned mirror hung on the wall, carefully pressing her forehead to its cool, inky surface. As she felt the familiar strands of magic within the otherworldly material respond to her touch, the turmoil inside her slowly began to calm.

Even though they were alone in the room and Lozanth was wide awake, Argossa's scream was enough to cause him to pull his sword and leap up.
<br><br>
The scream was unearthly, torturous; A scream of mortal terror.
<br><br>
He lit the candle and could see that she was bolt upright in bed, her eyes swimming with a remembered dream.  She was looking at him, but seeing something else.

<center><big><b>Musings on Characters</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
Sometimes when I'm thinking about characters that I have created or want to create, I try to write something that tells me something about them.  I have no idea if these will hold any interest to any of our readers.  They are not really stories, they are just little blurbs that came to mind one day when I was trying to flesh out a few character ideas.  As the release of EverQuest nears I guess it is my desire to show you one of the ways that I develop a character.  Take them any way you want.

<center><big><b>The Major Factor in Making EQ a Success</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<font size="-1">
When you hear most people speak of EQ it pretty much boils down to game play and graphics. Most forget why UO was such a terrible game to participate in. The community or the lack thereof. Sure great graphics and game play are needed, but if everyone playing is rude and impertinent, the fun quickly fades.
<br><br>
A game of this size is going to incorporate thousands of people, all of varying backgrounds and demeanors. This is going to cause conflicts here and there. No way of getting around it. Even if you try hard to maintain a peaceful disposition at all times, there are some people out there that will ruffle your feathers.

<font size="-1">
Last week I was trying to explain to you how the characters in our local campaign were growing powerful more rapidly than they were growing mature.  Oddly enough this came to a head the very next day (I waited until the last minute last Friday to write my editorial, and I think it showed, sorry 'bout that).  To explain what happened I'm going to have to go over a bit of background that I may or may not have covered before.

I love the newsletter format and the interesting stories within! I had
one suggestion although it might not be true to your newspaper style
setting. Would you consider putting a small 'Back to the front-page'
type link at the bottom of articles? Its easy to use the 'back' button
but once you are done with an article, you are already at the bottom of
the page...just a friendly suggestion! Keep up the great work.

<em>	I just finish reading Oghmas article in issue 47 "<a href="../Issue47/edito.htm">What to do when the love is gone</a>" and it prompted another topic for conversation.  It is simple foran online game to obtain and audience, but nearly impossible for them to keep it.  I'm forced to dmit that my argument is a tad one-sided since the only fully online role-playing experience I've had is with Ultima Online.  When I first heard about it, I was overwhelmed.  So many diferent skills, custoizable chracters, adventure, monsters, it had everything. <b>...</b>
