OGGOK -
<br><br>
<em>"Dey scart me.  Not like run scart, surprised scart.  Why you laugh!"</em>
<br><br>
Out of breath, I am writing this report.  I didn't know that Ogres could run so fast, as fat as they are.
<br><br>
What started out as a kid's game turned into a dangerous challenge.  The game is to see how many young Halflings can stand on each other's shoulders.  Teams of up to ten youngsters are required just to stack the record four, as it takes a lot of help to climb up to the top.  These teams seem to have turned into gangs, challenging each other to more and more dangerous versions of the game.  Chasm-spanning is where the gangs use their own bodies to create a bridge that the rivals cross.  Rival gangs have taken to wearing spiked boots during these challenges.
<br><br>
But the latest dare has taken a terrifying turn, terrifying for several Ogres, that is.
<br><br>
One gang of mischievous Halflings snuck into Oggok in a clever disguise.  Stacked four high they stole a long coat from a passing Troll shadowknight and snuck into Oggok.  In an interview from the RiverVale jail, one of the Halflings involved said:
<br><br>
<em>"It was a blast!  The big dopes didn't even notice how small our head was!  We only got caught when [name removed] tripped over his own furry feet.  But even that was funny!  Ogres went running everywhere!  They were afraid of us at first.  Gave us more then enough time to run."</em>
<br><br>
We are not allowed to give you the names of the youngsters, but they claim to be part of a gang that calls itself Lollipop.  This reporter isn't sure what that refers to.
