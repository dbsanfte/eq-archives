I sat in the trees twenty feet in the air.  Below me lay a scene of hatred and carnage.  Dark Elf guards lay slain by the hands of the lesser races.   They enter my home and kill my kind, then expect me not to hate them?  Pathetic beings.  Don't get me wrong, not all the members of the so-called lesser races are bad people.  Some of them pay rather well.  And who could argue that there exists anything more beautiful then a wood elf?  It's the arrogant self-proclaimed do-gooders that enter my land and kill my people.  It is those people who will die for their crimes.
<br><br>
One back flip and a safe fall later and I am in a crouch looking at tracks on the ground.  Three of them, moderate size, maybe humans, and maybe half elves.  No Barbarians… that makes me happy.  They're too tall for me to slit their throats from behind.  Them you just have to stab to death.  Bloody, ugly, uncivilized.  Not my style.  I also go into guilt trips after killing barbarians.  A good friend of mine is a barbarian, my only friend actually.  But enough of those thoughts, I have a task to accomplish.
<br><br>
I was back into the trees within seconds and off through the branches.  Every so often I would fall back through the leaves and realign myself with the tracks.  It was going to be a wonderful night, one where I get to see my enemies fall at my hands.  The skill necessary for the hunt and the thrill of the kill is what drives me.  This raw energy flowing through my veins, and my skill turning that energy into power.  That is what this is all about.  I approach a campfire silently.  I sit fifteen to twenty feet in the branches of the trees.   This should be what I am looking for.  Down below me is three men.  Two humans, one half elf.  
<br><br>
All three carried the look of warriors even in their sleep.  This shouldn't be too difficult.  I can kill them one at a time in their sleep.  I jump silently to the ground, my soft boots making not a sound.  I approached the half elf from behind.  He would have to go first, as he is the most deadly of the three.  His elven blood makes him more my foe and I almost feel a twang of guilt as I slide my dirk across his throat, his blood staining his bedroll.  I move silently to my left and position myself behind the bigger of the two humans.  I smile to myself as I begin to draw the dirk across his neck.
<br><br>
All of a sudden I hear a crashing noise as a fourth human charges through the trees.  God I hate my job.   The moment of recognition flashes in the human's eyes as I end his life, drawing my dirk across his throat.  The human charging through the trees was stupid.  Too stupid to live and I ended his life with a shuriken thrown into his chest.  I was up and on top of him within moments.  My dirk sliding into his chest with that wicked squish sound.  I look up and around trying to track the last living human.  He was quick.  I misjudged him.  He was up and into his combat stance with his two handed long sword pointed at me. 
<br><br>
"I will kill you darkie, just as I killed your guards.  I will get my revenge." He spat at me.
<br><br>
I just grin wickedly at him and reply "Sure thing Human.  As long as I get my revenge first."
	<br><br>
He came at me with a shout, swinging back and over in what was meant to be a blow to split me from forehead to toe.  Unfortunately for him I wasn't there anymore.  I dodged around and to the right of him, too far out of position for a counterstrike.  I fell back into a defensive position and he spun around quickly, facing me again.  
<br><br>
	"I will enjoy gutting you darkie.  You ever heard a dark elf cry out in pain?  Some say it doesn't exist, that it doesn't happen.   I found out the truth this last afternoon.  Prepare to meet your maker."
<br><br>
	I grinned with pure hatred.  This bastard will die slow.  Even if I don't pray to Innorruk, I know hatred and it makes me strong.  He comes at me again and I spin around his blade, driving my dirk into his groin.  My free hand grabs his wrist so that he doesn't get in a lucky slash.  I knock his sword up into the air and leave my dirk in his crotch as I grab the sword from the air.
<br><br>
	"You first human.  Now die and meet your maker."  I said in a cold dark voice.
<br><br>
	And with that I spin around swinging the heavy weapon through the air.  His head fell from his shoulders and his body fell to the ground.  I drop his sword and I pull my dirk from his groin.  I take a quick survey of the camp and grab all I could in terms of gold and food.  Their equipment would only slow me down, so I left that for the others who would follow.  Be them human, it's a warning.  Be them Dark Elf, an early Innoruuk Day.  And with one final look of pleasure I leave the camp to head off to train in the fields of East Commons.  
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	I enter the open fields of the commons and smile as the sun hits my skin.  The cool climate of the forest gives way to desert.  In between lie the commons.  A grassy plain mixed with a few trees and some hills.  Orcs call this their home and a few camps dot the landscape.  Lions, snakes, spiders, and scarabs all roam the hills making this one of the most fertile hunting grounds around.  I had cleaned my dirk off in the river running through Nektulos, and it shone brightly on my belt.
<br><br>
	I was off and running into the hills of East Commons before any others could even speak to me.  I found my first prey quickly and I dispatched it in short order.  I moved on from one target to the next.  My skill growing slowly.  My body becoming one with the dirk.  Time holds little meaning when I am training.  Heart, body and mind all mix to become one thing.  A weapon, killing for a reason.  I use all my skills.  I have a mission.  And not one creature dies without honor.  I thank each one silently after each battle for the ultimate sacrifice.  Even I understand life and death.  Even I understand honor and sacrifice.  
<br><br>
	I am crouched over the corpse of a lion, peeling away his unmarred pelt when I hear a cry go up.  Not just any cry, but the cry of a woman.  I quickly wipe my dirk on my leather pants as I stand.  I listen intently for the scream one more time.   I hear it and I am off through the hills.  I approach a group of trees and I slow.  I circle around and I stare within.  Two Dark Elves stand around one tree.  Tied to the tree is a woman, a wood elf woman.  I curse to myself as I watch the two Dark Elves torment the woman.  One talks quietly in her ear as the other grins with malicious delight, in his hand a dagger.  My mind races as I consider my options.  These two have the looks of ruffians, incapable of wielding even the dagger.  It would be nothing to separate them from their meager lives.  But the consequences of killing my own kind are too horrible to even imagine.  I would be killed the moment I entered the woods of Nektulos.  But I couldn't just sit here while these two idiots killed this woman.  I made my choice in a second and I was off into the trees.  Loyalty to ones race is important after all.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	The first Dark Elf grinned with horrid delight as the second one ran the dagger across the soft pale skin of the Wood Elf.  They had her naked, and tied with her arms backwards around the tree.  She was bruised all over.  Her legs were tied at the ankles and back around the tree.  Her wrists and ankles bled freely from the ropes.  One of the two Dark Elves had a black eye.   This female had apparently put up a fight.  Her torn clothes lie at her feet.  
<br><br>
	"Your kind are a plague on the land, little one.  You are to be the first we kill.  The Tier'dal will rule Norrath, and shortly after destroy it in the name of our Father." Hissed the first Dark Elf. 
<br><br>
	The smaller of the two held the dagger close, mumbling to himself as he drew one cut across her shin, then another.  He cackled to himself as the blood ran down her leg.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	I sat in the trees above the two fools and smiled to myself.  These two were everything Dark Elves were supposed to be.  A shame I will have to kill them.  I drop from the trees behind the two Dark Elves and they turn in surprise.
<br><br>
	The bigger one speaks first. "Ah, brother, good of you to join us.  We were just about to dispatch this horrid Wood Elf.  Care to join in the fun?"
<br><br>
	The smaller one cuts him off "Yeah, you wanna help?  I will let you cut her some."  He smiles and displays his crooked rows of teeth.  
<br><br>
	I stand there, thinking.  Torn by my two choices.  I could kill her and destroy everything I have worked for.  Everything I stood for.  Or I could save her.  And destroy everything I have been.  Separate myself from the others.  Become a loner, not welcome anywhere.  Lost.  Desperate.  Alone.  I made my decision.
<br><br>
	I looked at the smaller one then turned to the bigger. "Sure I help with the killing."  As I say this I move up to the wood elf and whisper in her ear.  "I am here to help.  Rest easy.  It will all be over soon."
<br><br>
	One quick movement and the bigger of the two Dark Elves is bent over in pain.  My foot shattering his knee cap.  The small one's mouth hangs agape at my attack and my dirk is out of my belt and into his mouth before he can even say a word.  The bigger one howls from the ground as his friend falls to the ground, my dirk buried in the back of his throat.  He grabs helplessly at his throat as he chokes on his own blood.
<br><br>
	"You fool!   The indigo brotherhood will never let you live.  They will hunt you down like the dog you are."
<br><br>
	I smile weakly at him.  "I doubt it.  They will never know this even occurred."
<br><br>
	With that my boot comes down on his neck, crushing his windpipe.  His eyes grow wide as he realizes he can no longer breath.  I move quickly to the smaller Dark Elf and wrench my dirk from his neck, his eyes frozen open in the fear of death.  I walk around behind the tree and begin cutting the knots that bind the Wood Elf in place.  I speak a word of apology as she crumbles to the forest floor.  I remove my cloak and wrap her in it as I pick her up off the ground.  
<br><br>
	I am off out of the woods and over the hills towards the inn.  I am glad it is night as even being seen saving a Wood Elf is reason for banishment from Nerriak.  I approach the inn quietly and I head to one of the rooms set off from the main building.  I knock quietly on the door and when there is no answer I set to work picking the locks.  I open the door with ease and carry her inside. I lay her softly on the bed and make sure she is still breathing.  I look at her wrists and ankles and see that the bleeding is not bad.   She will carry scares though.  I speak to her quietly in her ear. 
<br><br>
	"I will return.  Be strong."
<br><br>
	With that I am out the door and back to the woods.  I come up to the scene of horror that I created and I feel sick to my stomach.  After one moment of questioning my actions I put all thoughts out of my mind.  If I am to survive I cannot panic. I cannot know fear. There is only action.  Rule one of the Silent Hand.  I pick up the bodies and drag them to the edge of the forest.  I pick up all the ropes and stuff them quickly into my bag.  I pick up the rags that remain of the Wood Elf's clothes and stuff them in the bag with the ropes.  I return to the commons and quickly find and kill a lion.  I carry it back to the scene of horror and I lay him on the ground.  I cut open his stomach and lay his innards wherever the blood of the Dark Elves had fallen.  I kneel and thank him quietly for saving me.  I wipe away all footprints with a branch and I remove any signs of struggle.  On my way out I pick up the two bodies and throw them over my shoulder.  Extremely unbalanced and overweight I begin the trek to the river in Nektulos forest.  
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
	I arrive at the river two hours later, having barely escaped detection many times.  I slide the smaller of the two into water and await the coming of the piranhas.  Within minutes his bones sink to the bottom of the river.  I grin with delight as I push the bigger Dark Elf into the water and he soon follows the fate of his comrade.  Covered in blood and sweat I return to the inn. I sneak up behind the innkeeper and quietly ask to see her wares.  Not knowing who or what I am she reveals what she has to offer.  I grab some food, water, and some bandages.  I sit my coins on the ground behind her and I am off to the room.
<br><br>
	I quietly enter the room and close and lock the door.  I sit by the Wood Elf's side and make sure she is still alive.  She is breathing, but barely.  While I know very little of healing, I do know how to place bandages on a wound.  I gently wrap each of her ankles and wrists in the bandages.  I put some water on some of the cloth and clean the dirt from her body.  I also clean the wounds inflicted upon her by the beating and the smaller of the two Elves.  I finish cleaning and bandaging her so I fold the covers up and over her.  She is breathing softly now, with almost a look of peace on her.  I uncork the bottle of water and I put it to her lips.  She swallows involuntarily and I in turn take a drink.  Tired I fall a sleep sitting on the floor, my head propped against the bed.  
<br><br>
	I awake and immediately grab for my dirk.  I jump to my feet and look around quickly.  When I see no danger I wonder what it is that awoke me.  The sun shines through the windows and falls across the floor.  That is when I realize the Wood Elf is awake.
<br><br>
	I try to look every bit the mean Dark Elf assassin when I speak to her.  "Are you ok?"
<br><br>
	She looks innocently at me  "I think so.  Thank you."
<br><br>
	I soften a bit at her words "It was nothing.  A lion got you is all.  Sleep, you need your rest."
<br><br>
	With that she falls back to sleep and I sit, looking out the window, awaiting my fate.  My death.
