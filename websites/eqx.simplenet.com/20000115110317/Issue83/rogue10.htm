<b>Part Ten</b>

   One month later, Kinory sat at a long table with Katha and surveyed the map spread before her.  It showed the layout of the rooms in which Lord Bayle would be staying, several suggested exits and entrances, and details of the guards, both those from the Freeport Militia and the Qeynos Guard.  A picture of the target lay nearby, depicting a stern-faced man of early middle age, white wings in his hair, a few wrinkles at the corner of his eyes.  Even allowing for the artist's flattery, a good looking man.
<br><br>
    "The Militia are useless, trash.  You can almost disregard them.  The Qeynos, on the other hand, are Bayle's picked troops.  Not the soft corrupt types that patrol the outskirts of the land, but the elite that he keeps close by him.  He's a cautious man, if not one overly concerned with the welfare of his people."
<br><br>
   Kinory listened carefully, trying to still the pangs in her belly, the ones that screamed against doing this, against taking another human life.  She knew that Katha did this on a regular basis, that she was an assassin, and a skilled one.  But somehow, as she listened to her friend detail how she was to do this, to enter a man's bedchamber and slay him as he lay sleeping, she realized it for the first time.  Katha was a killer. This was not a game, and there was no way out.  Tonight, she would kill, or she would die.
<br><br>
   "Are you listening?" Katha's voice, impatient and filled with frustrated fear, jerked her out of her revere.  "Kin, my love, this is your <em>life</em> here."  She stabbed a finger down onto the parchment.  "Learn or die, those are the only choices left to you."
<br><br>
   "Yes, Katha," she said, and was surprised at the strength of her voice.  She bent over the map again, focusing on the writing, on what Katha was saying.  And when her mind threatened to drift, to fall back into the small voice of the ranger she had almost been, she squelched it fiercely.  This choice had not been made by Galern, or anyone else.  It had been made by her, when she had followed Daryth out of her safe world and into this one.  She had not looked back that night as she tracked the thief into the forest, and she would not do so now.

   Kinory left the Guild in her regular manner, from the roof.  As she leapt to the next roof over, she sensed rather than heard the person behind her, and rolled as she landed, the left, and heavier of her new thul'ka set flicking up into her hand from the spring-loaded wrist sheath.  She came to her feet in the shadow of the chimney, and whipped her arm back for a throw.  On the Guild roof she just made out the figure of Galern.  His eyes gleamed in the darkness.  He lifted an arm in a casual wave, and her anger and fear rose up in her throat like bile.  Her arm quivered.  One swift movement, and he would be dead...
<br><br>
  And she would be hunted by all his cronies and supporters until the day she died.  She lowered her arm. She stood, bowed to the squat, dark figure, and turned away.  Trembling, tears choking her, she ran off, nearly blind, and flung herself across the gap to the next roof.  She landed badly, her ankles stinging, and cursed herself furiously.  She paused, gasping, and wiped her eyes with fingers that shook.  She was going to do his work for him if she could not pull herself together.  She closed her eyes, took three deep, calming breaths, and then opened them again.  
<br><br>
<em>To be an assassin is to be the greatest thief there is.  How can you steal something more precious than a life?  And so we do so with the greatest of care and the greatest of respect.  We are artists.  We are not murderers.</em>
<br><br>
  Kinory repeated Katha's words to herself, trying to believe in them, trying to make herself into what Katha was, what she had to be on this night.  No morals but those of the night, of the blade.  All skill, no heart.  That was what Katha had said over and over.  <em>You leave your heart behind.  All you take with you is your skill, and your determination.  You must be of one mind, one desire.</em>
<br><br>
   All too soon, Kinory found herself staring at the tall white-streaked walls of the Great Keep.  The guards on the parapets and in the gardens below kept to their usual rounds, their even paces measuring the seconds as accurately as a clock.  She slipped through the shadows, scaled the outer walls, and stole through the ornamental gardens like a cat.  Fifteen minutes later, a small dark shadow passed through the heavy curtains of Antonius Bayle's balcony window without stirring a fold.
<br><br>
    Inside, Kinory crouched on the floor and waited for her eyes to adjust fully.  The door to the anteroom was slightly ajar, and through them she saw the shoulder of a guard.  It slumped to one side slightly and her sharp ears detected the man's heavy slumberous breathing.  Her lip curled slightly.  Crack troops indeed.  The rumors and stories of the Qeynos Guard were true, then.  No better than Freeport's own pathetic and corrupt Milita.
<br><br>
   She rose, and surveyed the room.  Dark, ponderous furniture filled it, in the typical style of the wealthy and none-too-aesthetically inclined Freeport citizen.  Tapestries on the walls depicted battles long ago and mostly forgotten.  She scanned quickly, found no other living thing than herself and the dim shape in the massive canopied bed.  She slid the slim dagger from its sheath in her sleeve, and stole toward the bed.  
<br><br>
   Her breath steepened, and she wet her lips slightly.  <em>Don't think of him as a man.  Think of it like target practice.</em>  Katha's words didn't seem to help much.  She could see the rise and fall of the covers as he breathed.  She could see a tuft of hair under the blankets, smell the faint odor of his perfumed clothes, the tang of male sweat beneath it.  He snorted softly in his sleep, and she started, her hand jerking slightly.
<br><br>
She paused, striving to quiet her breathing, glancing nervously at the door.  The guard hadn't moved.  She swallowed, set her teeth, and stepped to the edge of the bed.  Her hand rose, gripping the dagger.  A breath of air disturbed the curtains behind her, letting the moonlight into the room.  As her arm began its descent, she saw her shadow clearly outlined on the wall opposite her.
<br><br>
   The man on the bed threw back the covers, gripped her wrist, and heaved her over to pin her beneath him.  
<br><br>
   "Got the little bastard!"  he shouted.  She writhed frantically, and he increased the pressure on her arm.  She cried out and released the dagger.  The doors burst open, and the room was filled with light and men in clashing armor, all with swords drawn.  Behind them came an older man in silken nightrobes, white wings in his hair.  She recognized Bayle from the portrait she had been shown.  The light from a lantern fell directly on her face, and she winced away from it, her nightvision blinded.  Her captor gave a choked gasp.
<br><br>
   She was hauled off the bed, her wrists bound behind her back, and forced to her knees before Bayle.
<br><br>
   "Who hired you?"  he asked grimly.  She stared at a spot to the left and above his head, and pressed her lips together.  "No matter," sighed Bayle.  "I can deal with this tomorrow. Take her down to the holding cells.  And no games!"  he added sharply as one of the men grinned unpleasantly.  "If I find her damaged in any way, I will be most displeased.  Do I make myself clear?"  
<br><br>
   "Yes, sir," said the guard sullenly.  
<br><br>
   "Good.  Away with her, now."   Bayle turned from her, and directed his gaze to the man on the bed.  "Excellent work, Gwyn.  I would never have believed it, but your methods, it seems, do bear fruit."
<br><br>
   Kinory wrenched her head around and met the stunned and horror-struck eyes of her half brother.  Her lips formed his name soundlessly.
<br><br>
   "You're dead," she whispered.  The guards pulled her to her feet, and shoved her ahead of them, through the doorway.  Gwyn got off the bed, in slow motion, and took a step after her.  The door swung shut, cutting off her view, but she hung in the guard's hands, ignoring his curses, and stared at it until they rounded the corner.
<br><br>
  "He's dead," she said, in a small voice.
<br><br>
   "You are in no position to be making threats, my pretty little murderer," the guard said with a nasty smile.
