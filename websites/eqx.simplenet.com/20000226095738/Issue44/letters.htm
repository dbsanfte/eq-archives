<em>
Hail EverQuest Express Team,
<br><br>
    I would just like to tell you what a damn good job your doing with your newspaper! You notlike all the rest of the EQ sites, well, most of the rest. But you are the only one of your kind. For example, when there is some new EQ news, all the EQ news sites have the same new. Its the same thing everywhere. But you guys, you take that news and expand on it, make stories, articles discussing different issues, new ideas, and funny comics. I hope you keep up the good work, you provide an alternative to all the EQ news sites.
