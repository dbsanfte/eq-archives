<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Something confuses me, it seems that melee skills will not improve by fighting something you don't get xp for. What are the rules for increasing magic skills? Can i just keep casting a low cost spell to increase skill even at higher levels or will I have to use the higher level spell?
 - Aranoc
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, low cost spells will increase your skill.  As a druid, I got summon food at level 14, a low level, low cost spell, and I cast it almost continuously to increase my skill in Conjuration.
<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to know how in the heck do people use that /loc thing?  I have been in no way able to use it because there are too many danged numbers.
 - Kasan
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hardly an expert, but the first two numbers are the only ones that matter.  Each zone is laid out on a grid, and the first two tell you where you are on that grid.  The third one refers to height and doesn't matter.
Basically, you get a /location for where you want to go, then do a /loc on yourself to get your location.  Then take a few steps in any direction and watch the numbers.  Do this a few times, in various direction, until the numbers start getting nearer to the ones you want, head out in that direction!  The numbers are in both positive and negative, so that's one thing to think about when you get a /loc of something or somewhere from someone.
<br><br>
Whew!  

<br><br>
<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In <a href="../Issue75/qanda.htm">Issue 75</a>, you said that a GM would transport you to shore if you got crashed off the boat. However, the few times I /petitioned it took the GMs hours, if they ever, responded. There's only so long you can swim without a shark eating you! What do you do about this?
 - Zuberi
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas!  For our hard working and understaffed Guides and GMs!  Yes it is true that, often, there are no Guides online.  There simply aren't enough of them right now to give full 24 hour coverage to a server.  What I have done... although I don't recommend it... is just /quit.  Your char should log out of the game before you drown... and you can contact a GM with another char to get the matter resolved before you log back in as your other char.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is "Sense Magic" and how do you use it? I tried finding the use for this spell for an hour and couldn't find anything. Please help!
 - Kelil
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, originally, it was to give further info about an item than could not be told by simply right clicking, but now that Verant changed the right clicking to include ALL info about the item, the spell is pretty much useless.
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I play a bard. I have spoken to many a bard and so far nobody knows.  Answer this great question. Charisma is a primary requisite for bard-dom, yet it does not seem to have any known effect on performance.  Why?
 - Deneren
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh! A fellow songsmith...well, I think that Charisma was made a big deal for bards basically because of the history of the class in other RPGs and in the fantasy genre in general.  It is true that the char boost has little apparent effect on gameplay, but just wait 'til you are buying plate and you pay 50 plat less than that scruffy stinky dwarven warrior.  Yeah!  Ok, maybe that's an exaggeration...
<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm a halfling rogue.  I'm very interested in roleplaying, but I can't seem to get in character.  I'm not sure how I should speak (old english, stupid like, etc) or how I should act... I can't find much information on halflings, or rogues... just their strong points, not personalities.  Can you help me out somehow?
 - Datyl
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Old English is certainly not a prerequisite for RP.  To get a good overview of RP and tips on how to start getting into it, take a look at <../Issue75/iss75.htm">Issue 75</a> of the EQX.  Also, there are several good articles in other back issues... one that springs to mind is Oghma's... well pretty much anything of Oghma's. <a href="../credits/oghma.htm">Catch his large and impressive credits here</a>.
