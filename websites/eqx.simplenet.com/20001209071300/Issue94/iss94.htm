The night was young and I was about, enhancing my physical training. For hours before I stayed within the Church, reading old tomes and studying them intensely. But mostly, my mind was upon recent events.  It appears as if my mother Mahlyce has returned to the land of the living.  Her former master… but I would label him more her tormenter, made a deal with the Mistmoor Vampires to have her returned.  I fear his only bargaining chip, though, was his own soul.  From what I hear, he no longer serves the Father.

When the PvP teams servers were first opened, there was a lot of excitement, and nobody, including Verant, was prepared for the rush of excited players.  Now, the rush is over, and the servers have been up for a few weeks.
<br><br>
When Tallon Zek originally opened, I was one of the first 300 people to log onto the server.  Pretty soon, my Cleric was in a zone with 300 people.  I was amazed.  Lag was so bad, people couldn't open doors.  I even have screenshots of the player numbers in the Third Gate of Neriak.  Later, to the disappointment of a lot of players, the server was closed.

<b>Lesser Faydark - Gilerrin</b>
<br><br>
	He heard something, but he ignored it.  Probably the wind.  Or an animal passing.  He reflected on his life again, thinking of his adventures and journeys.  All the battles.  All the wars.  All his youth.  All his life.
<br><br>
	He heard an unnatural rustle and immediately opened his eyes.  A young Elf gleamed at him with pride.  Only then did Gilerrin see his own sword's point at his throat.  He smiled fondly at the boy, concealing his surprise.

Last week I asked people to tell me about upcoming games not based on a fantasy setting.  Thanks to the folks that responded.  Thanks much!  The most commonly mentioned game was <a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com">Anarchy Online</a>.  They've got some interesting concepts.  Player killing - safe cities and dangerous outlands.  Death - pay for insurance and be ressed from a bio scan, like a save feature.  Sides - good and bad, distinct lines between the two<b>...</b>

Your reply to Leexa regarding the her post of the difficulties encountered with her Straylight Saga surprises me. Though not involved in the saga myself, I was impressed with the initiative and effort that I have seen go on around it. In a game that is mostly devoted to Hack-n-Slash gaming, ala early adolescent AD&D dungeon bashing sessions, it is very difficult to have a story line take place without this limitation imposing itself.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering as to the special names for the various races of elves.  I know they each have a name to themselves and others, but does anyone have a list of what they each are?
