What have I done?
<br><br>
- High School (hell yes I graduated) [4 Years]<br>
- Army (Medic) [4 years]<br>
- Nursing (hated it and never finished the program) [3 years]<br>
- Law Enforcement (no money) [1 year]<br>
- Help Desk Coordinator (other than playing games, and constantly trashing my own system, I had no previous experience)  [1 year]<br>
- Network Services [1 year]<br>
- As of July 1st of this year.   WAN Manager $65,000 annual.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-and that's a cheap manager.  Most guys I know are making 75k and up doing the same job, but I'm not complaining… &nbsp;&nbsp;(yet)<br>

That's about it.  I wish each of you all the success in the world at getting
