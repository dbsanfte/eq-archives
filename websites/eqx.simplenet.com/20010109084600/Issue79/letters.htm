I was sitting here enjoying the EQX issue 78 when I came across <a href="../Issue78/letters.htm">Ariel's reply</a> to Ahtenret's posting in the "Letters to the editors".  I'm stunned to read her (his?) take on role-playing. I had to read it all over again to make sure I had not misinterpreted the whole thing, but no. I'm truly amazed by the fact that someone thinks that role-playing is "inappropriate" or a waste of scroll space, and this in a role-playing game!  That's right, it's a role-playing game, this is not my statement, but the Verant's, and since they made the game I assume they know what they wanted it to be. I'm not saying that everyone should role-play, I'm not a die hard role-player myself, but I think at least there should be no criticism directed to people who choose to do so. After all, the game was designed with role-playing in mind. The suggestion about a channel for role-playing is absolutely absurd. If anything and that idea isn't a good one either, there should be a channel for people who like to talk about stats of the different weapons, spoilers for quests etc. Personally I think you should take all of those discussions into /tell if you so desperately need to know if you really have to best armor money can buy.
<br><br>
I would also like to address another thing; the role-play switch.  Hot topic indeed it seems, and I get the feeling this new feature is not appreciated at all.  Well, my short take on the whole thing is that in a game where most people can't tell the difference between a role-played troll and a genuine psycho, this might be semi-good solution. The fact that I can now maybe (I say maybe because I've found that many people have it turned on, even though they don't role-play) find someone to adventure with that can appreciate role-playing.  It's in indeed a sad day when people feel that there is a need for such a feature in an RPG-game, but I think with the current situation, having the switch might better than not having it.
<br><br>
Some of you might think I am "true" role-player, but I am but an apprentice in the area. I try to role-play when the opportunity is given, but you can catch me from time to time asking someone what level they are in /say. (I try to minimize this, but it slips from time to time =) The few role-playing situations I have been involved in have been great fun, and every time I log on it's with the hope of meeting interesting characters.  To all of you that haven't tried role-playing I strongly suggest you try it, not because I say so, but because you might find a new, fun dimension of Everquest.

Reading through the letters I need to make a comment.  I play a bit on
weekends, and in the evenings I get to play about 2 hours.  It has taken
me well over a month just to make it up to lvl 11.  I have learned a
roleplaying trade skill, in brewing.  I plan on learning pottery and
baking at least too.  However the time it takes to go up levels for me
is painful.  All the people I like to group with are going up levels at
the rate of about 3 a week.  This means when I group with them in 2-3
weeks I will be so far behind them they won't want me in their party as
I can't contribute too much and won't get much in the way of exp.  I
like to roleplay my druid, but find that I can't because I'm too afraid
to venture anywhere or if I dedicate a week to learning another trade
I'll fall way too far behind.  I just wish verant had allowed those of
us who are casual gamers a way to get a sense of accomplishment in
leveling instead of making those of us who only get to play maybe 20-30
hours in a week have to spend a year or more getting up just to lvl 20
something, and let us be able to roleplay.  I mean sure I'd like to have
to level, but I wish there was some sort of timer or something that
would allow those of us who play less a week to be able to have fun by
getting more exp for a kill.  then when we start playing more in a week
we must revert to normal growth patterns.  I like Diablo and games like
baldur's gate where I can "cheat" and get up to a medium to high level
and then just sit back and have fun playing the character.  Just
something, I mean on MUD's I use triggers to run in circles killing easy
things so there is no chance of dying and let it run all night.  When I
check in the morning I can then roleplay the char in a couple of weeks
of doing this. Just a personal opinion, but I wish I could get up a
number of levels easily and then be able to have fun in my own way.  I
mean I'm not a PK, and even destroyed my tome of discord so I never
could be.

Ah well just my 2 copper.

<em>[Ed. - I sympathize, I really do.  Absor is only 8th level.  My highest level character since release is 9th.  But my lack of time to play has never reduced my ability to role-play when I do.  Hehe, you shoulda seen me just an hour ago, running all over Norrath doing my bardic trade.  Sure, levels give you more access to neater places, but they aren't needed for role-playing.  Don't count out the rest of the low-level world.  A lot of us are role-players too.]</em>

I don't have Everquest yet, but reading EQX has made me crave the game even 
more than before.  I don't think that you have portraid Everquest in a bad 
light.  I want to thank you for the articles and tales that have made me 
think of how I wish to play my character when I finally do get the game.
<br><br>  
Thanks.

I have to agree with you..well in a way.  I haven't played EQ yet, and I
have been readin all about it, trying to decide if it is worth my
money.  But for what it is worth, I understand that people don't role
play, I have played a female char (I am male) twice (not a lot I know)
and at first it was hard, but then you get into it, and I was playing
AD&D around the table..and one of my good friends(male too) was hitting
on me(my character) because we were "role-playing"
<br><br>
Is EQ all it's cracked up to be, or is it like diablo..everyone PKs when
there is no reason too, and they cheat constanlty.  I think PKing is
okay in the right "role-playing" circumstances...like your race hates
another race, and that guy pissed you off...good enough reason to smack
him around...maybe not kill them, but a good ass-whoopin never hurt
anyone.  But as far as just trying to get a higher frag count like in
Quake, and killing anything and everything that moves, that isn't role
playing (unless I guess you are role playing a Quake Player...)
<br><br>
So what is EQ like..
<br><br>
Thanks<br>

Good question.  I think Everquest is an outstanding game.  It's well worth
looking into.  What you have here at EQX, are a group of people who are
dedicated to pushing for an even better game.  We come across as malcontents
sometimes, but we have the interest of furthing Roleplaying at cost of
possibly losing the PK crowd, if it comes to that.
<br><br>
The biggest detriment of the game currently is that you'll find folks
hunting down something of comparable level to themselves and killing it for
no reason.  No "Let the damned beasts be slain for defiling our lands".
More like "Gnoll.  Get 'em before someone else does."
<br><br>
That's not to say that the environment is bereft of Roleplaying.  I've had a
great time with many of the folks I've met.  And unless you turn on your PK
switch, the PKers can't hurt you.  I encourage you, and any others who are
curious but who have not played, to give the game a try.
