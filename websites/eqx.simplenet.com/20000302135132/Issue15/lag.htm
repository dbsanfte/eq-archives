"Man this game is too lagged"
<br><br>
How many times have you said this while playing a game online?  The dreaded screen freeze - as you watch your character killed and then looted in slow motion.
<br><br>
I am a network engineer.  I have spent the last 11 years designing, implementing, and supporting networks. I don’t have a cure for network lag, but I can explain some of the causes for it.
<br><br>
I’ve been playing multi-player games since the 1980’s.  I got my first taste of network gaming playing Mud’s (Multi User Dungeons). I haven’t played a single player game since!

"What the hell is a MUD?"
<br><br>
Mud is a software program, running on a server, that accepts connections from multiple users. Each user functions independently.  He or she can interact with other users, killing creatures, socializing, or even falling in love and getting married?  Well some did.  I’m a fighter, not a lover (evil grin).  The game is entirely TEXT.  You have to be able to read (and in some cases read fast) to play. Each area is a square, which contains a room description, creatures, and objects.  Soon after Mud’s came Moos, Mucks, Mush’s, Mugs to name a few.

"Were you lagged while playing Mud’s?"
<br><br>
Razor is standing here.  [LINK DEAD]. 
<br><br>
Yes. The lag monster was around in the old days as well, although the cause, for the most part, was for a different reason.  Lag from over utilized servers was more of the cause then.
