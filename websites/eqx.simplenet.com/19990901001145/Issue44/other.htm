This was the last place he wanted to be, on the last day he could possibly match it with. He could not be late.  On pain of death, he could not be late. Rain fell about him and on him as Rath hurried through the dark forest. All the past two days he had been moving through this cursed wood of gnarled trees with the smell of death and decay hammering his senses. It would never end, he told himself repeatedly, though he continued to place one weary, heavily sodden boot in front of the other. He looked up, trying to see any sweet sign of the golden orb. None was visible; the sky was thick with iron-black clouds and streaking lightning. 
<br><br>
Long, rolling and too-loud thunder sounded as if were tearing huge rents in the air. The Gods were angry and their titanic battle had lasted his entire journey. Four days of torrential rain to accompany him to another two days in this fear inspiring wood.
<br><br>
Aye, to say that this was the last place he wanted to be was an understatement.
<br><br>
With gritted teeth and a sigh, Rath took hold of his sword's hilt with his left hand as he continued on through the rain. The trees seemed to grab at him as he passed. He knew it was simply his imagination, but it seemed so much as if the knots in the trees were eyes watching, watching the human toil through their world. It brought a shiver to his skin that ran the length of his back. As the shiver subsided, he flinched at a blood-curdling scream. His sword was out in a blink as he turned about, seeking the screamer. 
<br><br>
Cautious steps brought him closer to his destination, though his sword remained free to the air and his eyes flicked about. Just as his senses were dulling and his muscles began to relax, the scream came again. Much closer this time, from somewhere ahead. Shaking fingers raked his sodden hair from his eyes as he peered deeper into the mists and gloom before him. He could see nothing, save the many eyes of the trees staring back at him as if in silent appraisal. Again he shook his head, banishing thoughts of trees that watch travelers and took to heel once more. 
<br><br>
Rath's progress was slow. The scream came three more times in the next hour. Each time his muscles began to relax, it would put him on edge once more. The physical and emotional strain were beginning to weigh heavy on his soul. He consoled himself that it would not be much longer before he reached the pre-planned meeting place. Then he would have more on his mind than simple screaming. Perhaps his own, unless things did not work out according to plan.  That was something he hoped he would not have to face.
<br><br>
When he came upon a shallow, though wide, stream, he sighed in relief and plopped down on a smooth rock a few feet from the bank. His sword's tip dipped to the moss at his feet as he breathed a silent prayer of thanks to whatever Gods might still be paying attention. This was the place. This was the meeting place he had been racing to find for the last week. He had finally made it, and seemed to be early no less. He slid further down the rock until his weary legs were flat on the ground and the hard rock was at his back. He had never felt so comfortable. His eyelids, heavy from lack of sleep, slowly drooped to cover his gray orbs. 
	<br><br>
Just as he was about to nod off, the scream came once more, no more then a few hundred paces to his left. His head snapped up, as did the tip of his sword. Through the fog of bone deep weariness, Rath scanned for the source of the scream. In his periphery, he could see movement. But as he turned his head to get a better view, the movement moved as well, staying in his peripheral vision. It was frustrating; no matter which way he turned his head, no matter how fast, it remained always just out of sight. So close, yet out of grasp.
<br><br>
After a few minutes of fruitless searching, Rath dropped his head back to the stone, wondering where the other was. In seconds, he was nodding off again.
<br><br>
He woke slowly, staring up at the sky. The first thing that came to mind, as he stared up at the clear blue sky, was that the rain had stopped. He then realized that he must have slept for ages because he felt wonderful, well rested. He hoped the woman who had been screaming was all right, there had not been a scream in a while.  He remembered the last one before he had fallen asleep; it had sounded full of terror and rage. But in his previous state of near-delirium, it had meant next to nothing. Now, he felt the bitter taste of guilt. With a groan, he sat up and looking for his sword. Panic raced through him when he couldn't find it. He searched franticly, to no avail. When he heard the pop and crackle of a fire, his head snapped around to the side.
<br><br>
No more then fifteen paces away sat a large throne, black marble blocks piled three high in a tiered fashion. It took up a good eight or nine paces across and went up to near five paces before the throne occupied the topmost tier. The black, red-veined marble glistened in the morning sun as if wet. When he looked farther up, the golden throne nearly blinded him. Huge rubies sat at the ends of the lushly padded arms. They were larger then any stone he had ever seen. They must be the size of a clenched fist and worth a fortune. Pale hands with long, blackened nails rested calmly upon the gems, as if guarding them. Rath's wide eyes followed up the heavily robed arm to the chest where lay a king's ransom in jewels and farther up to the hooded head. As Rath slowly stood, the hood turned slightly to take him in. From inside the hood he could see dimly glowing green orbs. He wondered how they could be glowing, even in the sunlight. Even if they were...
<br><br>
"I am pleased to see you made it in one piece, my pet." Came a silky voice from the darkness under the hood, cutting off his thoughts. Rath nodded dumbly, not knowing what to say. Slight movement at the foot of the throne caught his attention. His eyes flicked down to see a half-naked woman huddled beside the other's leg. She was bruised and bloody, but looked healthy none-the-less. His sword lay at her feet; blood covered the hilt from where she must have grasped it.
<br><br>
"It… It took me less time then I had thought." Rath said, after gaining courage at the silence from the other. "I'm sorry that I did not tell you accurately how long it would take me. I meant no disrespect." He added after a moment, his hands raised before him in a sign of submissiveness. 
<br><br>
The other considered him at length. Rath squirmed despite his inner voice screaming at him in rage for being such a coward. As the silence grew uncomfortably long, Rath was about to say something but was cut off.
<br><br>
"It is of no consequence," the other said with a wave of his pale hand, "as long as you have what you were told to bring." He said with more menace, though his voice remained silky smooth.
<br><br>
"I have it, as you commanded." He said, reaching into his waist pouch.
<br><br>
"Very well, leave it be for now and sit down before you fall down." The other said, waving his hand towards a small stool sitting at the other side of the small fire, "I took the liberty of having food prepared for you." The other nodded as Rath sat. He looked about for the food, but found none. With a frown of confusion he turned back to the other, to see food floating before his face. 
<br><br>
"I thank you, Great One." He said in a small voice as he reached for the platter with shaking fingers. As he was about to grasp some luscious looking fruit, the platter disappeared, as he thought it might. A cackle of amusement drifted towards him.
<br><br>
"Please," Rath begged, looking up to the hooded figure, "I haven't eaten in days." 
<br><br>
"That is one of the last things that occupies my mind, my pet. Give me what you have brought." He demanded, lifting a hand. Rath, slowly reached into his waist pouch and produced a small leather bag, tied at the top with hair. It was not happening as he had planed. The other leaned forward expectantly, his hooded face coming closer to Rath as he held out the bag. 
<br><br>
"Bring it here!" The other commanded. Rath had planed on bargaining his freedom for this pouch and had no intention of giving it to him, but his legs carried him towards the other and for the life of him. He could not stop. Rage bloomed in his blood, every fiber of his being fighting against the spell that compelled him towards the evil other. He could do nothing and before he knew it, the pouch lay in the other's pale hand. Hysterical laughter cracked the air for many moments as Rath knelt trying to regain his breath. 
<br><br>
"Please," he begged once more, "remove it from my neck, I have done as you have commanded!" Rath grabbed at the thick black robes around the other's feet, suddenly feeling like the woman must. He looked over at her. Her brown eyes were devoid of emotion or thought, she simply stared at him with a blank expression. She too, wore one around her neck.
<br><br>
Rath found himself staring at the sky. He couldn't figure out how he had gotten onto his back. He tried to lift his head but could not. Nor could he feel his arms, he rolled his head to the side and vomited at the sight. His arms lay off to the side, covered in blood but he felt no pain. He felt himself floating into the air; he was nearly ten paces from where he had been kneeling. 
<br><br>
"You would dare to touch me!" The other screamed in fury, his hands clawed in rage.
<br><br>
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Rath whispered, near tears with terror.
<br><br>
"You will learn respect for me, you will learn!" Came to other's cry. Rath looked down when a heated pain shot through his legs. He saw them lying upon the ground a few feet below him. A whimper fought its way into his throat. The other stood atop his throne shaking in rage. As more pain shot through him, the other sat down once more reveling in his pet's screams of torment. He slowly drew the bag open. Years, the other thought, years I have been searching for this talisman. Now I shall rule all of Norrath, it is mine to do with as I please. He drew the bag open and stared wide-eyed into it. With a cry of despair, he turned it upside down to empty the contents into his palm. A rock lay there, mocking him. With a bellow of fury his head snapped up to where Rath hung in the air. He was smiling, even in death. He had known. The other sent magical energies into his corpse, fighting to bring him back. The bastard had set him up, knowing he would be killed as soon as he had handed over the pouch. He had chosen the freedom of death over the torture of eternity under the other's rule.
<br><br>
"No!" The other whispered to the floating corpse, "NO!" He jumped form his throne, throwing the useless rock to the side as he quickly rushed towards Rath's dead form. Again, magical energies rushed into the corpse. But he knew; there was no way to bring him back. The only one who had known, the last guardian, was dead. The talisman of Cazic-Thule was lost forever. 
<br><br>
The other dropped to his knees in frustrated rage, pounding the earth with clenched fists. Rath's corpse exploded into a shower of blood and bone. A drawn out scream filled the air as the other stared up at the sky, fists clenched. He had lost.
