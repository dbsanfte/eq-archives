The ground rumbled below Elaanilus' feet as he raced toward the oncoming dark elves.  Earth shot from below and formed huge craters beneath the shower of rock pelting a group of villagers.  As Elaan engaged the first one, the other two rolled to either side with swords raised in defense.  With the first parry he saw three more approaching from the left and another group from the right.  This time they seemed to be using tactics more suited to their race's stereotype, and the explosions of earth all around hinted that a mage was nearby, or two.  On his second parry he turned to see his group of companions rushing to his aide, and with that he fell back a few paces wondering how to survive this overwhelming and superior attack force.  
<br><br>
"Those dark elf friends of Oghma's don't seem to be present now, that seems to be the case in every battle thus far", Elaanilus thought out loud.  It took all of his concentration just to best this one opponent, looking into his eyes he could see a crimson glow of calmness that seemed more suiting of his enemy than those that had attacked before.  A clink of his armor told him the dark one struck for a death blow, and almost as soon as Elaan had realized his enemy's mistake he had taken its life, lopping of his blue head with a sideways slash and a battle cry that echoed the ringing of his blade.  With a roll he turned to face the, now sure to be on top of him, enemy.  What he saw was Oghma's bearded face followed by the rest of his companions. 
<br><br>
"The rest of the attackers passed us by completely, except for the occasional rock blast to keep us out of their path", Oghma said with a start back from the still battle-frenzied Elaan.  "They don't seem interested in us at all.  Actually with the direction they were going they seemed more interested-", 
<br><br>
"In us," Zasstryn interrupted walking from the shadows of the treeline.  "Beldro and I, they have been tracking us for weeks now, and this unwanted stop in this village brought them right on us.  I've been trying to put all the pieces together."
<br><br>
"Where are they now then?" Mundas inquired.
<br><br>
"To our rear and flanks I suppose, they just scanned to try and snag one of us, they wouldn't commit to attack this close to dawn."  The dew soaked grass below Zasstryn's feet gave him a sick reminder that morning was near.  "I'm gonna hate having to walk through another day in the sun, this cursed li-".  A horrible growl and sounds of ripping flesh interrupted his sentence and the screams that followed echoed a cold wariness in his heart.
<br><br>
"That's just Banner finishing a few stray dark elves off."  Oghma said in reassurance.
<br><br>
"It's not Banner, not cat at all."  Amlaith worriedly adds in his usual quick sentence.
<br><br>
"I should know that sound well by now" Zasstryn sighs.  "Its Beldro's new toy, our whole reason for being on the surface at first."
<br><br>
Just as Zass finishes his sentence the trees near by begin to quiver and shake with the ferocity of a gale sweeping through the forest.  Several thumping sounds usher forth a beastly figure, lupine in its facial features but standing slightly erect like a person would.  The form spanned a good six foot crouched and the glowing yellow eyes hinted at intelligence.  The party echoed a simultaneous readying of weapons, all but Amlaith who studied the figure silently and without motion.  A roar bellowed from the mouth of the beast and it cringed on the ground, thrashing and clawing at its face.  The sound didn't seem threatening at all, rather it seemed to be screams of pain.  A cloud of dust begin to rise higher and higher with every convulsion the lupine form made until all fell silent in the sightless fog in front of the party.  Zasstryn walked forward and disappeared in the cloud of slowly fading dust.  When Mundas managed to see through the haze he gasped as Zasstryn helped pull Beldro to his feet.
<br><br>
"I'll be...  if that isn't th...."  Mundas couldn't find the words.  
<br><br>
"A truly evil being"  Elaanilus grimaced, his sword still drawn and no look on his face of wanting to put it away.  
<br><br>
"I am what I was born to be."  Beldro seemed to be talking to the entire crowd.  "What my people have been forced to be.  If that is evil, then that is me."
<br><br>
"You are pure hatred, and you should get what you deserve."  Elaan seemed unconcerned with what was going on around him, to him there was only him and Beldro.
<br><br>
Beldro snickered.  "Is that hate I feel in you Elaan... I think it is indee-"
<br><br>
"No."  Elaanilus cut him off quickly.  "It is my love for the innocent people you hurt, my love for the ones you don't think twice about before ending their lives."
<br><br>
Beldro frowns at the Paladin's comeback, and even though he manages a satisfied look on his face, he is speechless, and the grin given to him by the holy knight told him all he wanted to know about his defeat in this battle of wits.  
<br><br>
"We shall see...gutterblood, we shall see who you really are."  Beldro's tone was teasing, knowing that all of his race hates to be insulted about it.
<br><br>
Elaanilus sheathed his sword , not allowing the Dark Elf the satisfaction of a facial expression.
<br><br>
"Enough of this."  Oghma interrupted the two in a low and commanding voice.  "I think both of you owe us an explanation."
<br><br>
"Not all of what we do is of any concern to you, and none of this is."  Said Beldro.
<br><br>
"These beasts you call brother have attacked us twice now, it's our business.  I demand to know what's going on."  Oghma thought for a second.  "Maybe it could better benefit us both if we were to get involved."
<br><br>
Beldro's eyes widened at the idea of profit.  "Perhaps I do owe an explanation, and the attackers won't let you escape alive now that they have engaged you.  Prepare yourselves, lesser beings, I'll try and make this simple."
<br><br>
Beldro told the party all they wanted to know, or rather all he wanted them to know.  He told of his search for this fabled book of necromantic spells long forgotten, and, proudly, the traitorous actions he had taken to get it.  How the house that guarded the book, being disgraced by the theft, was now hunting them down to redeem whatever positioning they had lost by allowing the ancient literature to be taken.  He told of his troubles when interpreting the spells, of the side effects, of the limited spells he yet had the capacity to learn.  Zasstryn had been his only source of knowledge on how to pull off such a theft, but the two seemed to have much more of a plan then just stealing a book.  They would have to.  Beldro was getting a life times worth of research, what was Zass getting?  Something, that's for sure.  They were hiding a great deal of what was going on, and it was clear by the looks on their faces that the party knew it.
