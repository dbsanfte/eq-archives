<b>The Interview</b>
<br><br>
Hopefully based on how you write your resume, and how well you do your
homework, you'll get a few interviews.   Before you meet for your interview
it's important that you prepare for it.   It's worthwhile to know a little
about a company before you visit them. I was usually asked,  "Why do you wish
to work for us?" or "Do you know what we do here?"
<br><br>
So before your interview call the company's main number, and ask the operator
if their company has a web site.  Web sites are a great place to gain
knowledge about a particular business.  If there is no web site, ask the
operator a few questions about the company.    The only dumb question is the
one that never got asked.

An interview is not all about what you have done, or what you can do.  This
is a misconception and I'm living proof of it!  When you're sitting in front
of that interviewer you're selling a product.  You're selling yourself.  It
is important that you present yourself as a "you just got to have" commodity.
This is not something you can learn over night.  You need to practice.  If
you can find strangers to practice this on, do it!
<br><br>
Let me list a few things I look for in an interview.
<br><br>
1. You're personal appearance.  What you're wearing, posture, how you present
yourself.  Sit up straight.  Look and feel important, but don't act cocky.
Feel relaxed!  Trust me, they are just as nervous as you are.  It might show
as impatience or some other form of body language, but I can assure you its
pure nervousness.

2. When given the opportunity to describe yourself do it!  Talk about
yourself until he/she shuts you up.  My last interview I actually talked
about my hobbies and myself for over twenty minutes.  I had all three of
them on the edge of their seats.  They were my audience and I was achieving
my best performance ever, and all this time not having anything to do with
qualifications of the job.  They are more interested in you as a person.  
<br><br>
3. If asked a situational question like "What is the most difficult situation
you have ever been faced with, and what steps did you take to solve it?"
answer in detail.  These are questions targeted at finding out how well you
solve problems.  They don need to have anything to do with the trade you are
applying for.  It could be how you solved a particular task or assignment in
school.  They want to see how you solve problems.  This is very important for
a help desk position.
