You've all seen the shouts … "So-and-so is killing newbies at the leveling area!" … "So-and-so is a pkiller!"  You, bored and filled with righteous indignation, race o'er hill and dale to said newbie area to see that yes, in fact, one or two people are going around killing newbies, and no, given the infinite genius [sic] of the PK system, you can't do anything about it.
<br><br>
I've stood on that hill quite a bit in EQ, staring down in powerful impotence as a few bad seeds ruin the fun for people just trying to get started.  And as I've stood there, watching the little forms streaking around the hills in terror and anger, a few things have occurred to me about why it just doesn't make sense.
<br><br>
First of all, let's look at what you get out of it.  Equipment?  Well, you can't loot anything but coins off a character under level 5 since they generally just have training gear, so that can't be it.  Experience?  You don't get experience for pkilling, so ixnay on that one as well.
<br><br>
How about the oft-touted pkiller's "thrill of the hunt?"
<br><br>
Hmm.  I actually do pkill (not necessarily on EQ unless provoked, but in other places and times), and whether through a text MUD or EQ, I'll be the first to admit that the thrill of the hunt is a powerful lure.  It's a heightened challenge, tantamount to Quake and other first-person shooter games where you are matching your skill versus an opponent.  And btw, if you flipped the PVP switch or created your character on Rallos you asked for this, so let's not bitch about the morality of it (sorry, had to throw that in there).
<br><br>
However, if you get that thrill from tearing after some level 1-2 guy with no equipment, no spells, no cash and virtually no way to defend themselves, well, I'm not sure your heart could take a real hunt.  When you go fishing do you do so with a net in a barrel?  I actually hunt big game animals in real life, and while it's not exactly a fair match, it does have its moments … but killing defenseless newbies is tantamount to standing over an anthill and stepping on ants … if that's thrilling to you, think about therapy.
<br><br>
If you have a suit of banded mail and the +20 Sword of Kerrang wielded and someone kills you, you can justify why - they wanted what you had, and you weren't strong enough to defend yourself.  If you want it back, then go get it back (actually this is not true, because the downside of the 1-item, no container rule is that you effectively can't get your stuff back when you take out the perpetrator).  
<br><br>
I won't even get into how badly the different classes are balanced for PVP; that's fodder for another rant, but here's a hint … "Ahh, I have Tiger Punch, 18 attacks per round and the infamous Touch of DOOM skill trained so high that when I enter CB, Emperor Crush tries to zone … err hey, who rooted me?  Where are my hitpoints going?  ARGGH!!"
<br><br>
Tangential balance rants aside, now let's look at the last thing you get out of slaughtering newbies … a bad reputation.  I'm not talking factions here either, I'm talking about real-time, well publicized bad reputations.  KOS ("kill-on-site") reputations.  Because invariably if you kill enough people, and those shouts ring off the trees often enough, you will eventually raise the hackles of someone who doesn't like what you're doing. And as opposed to your prey, they can probably do something about it (especially since a few quick cons give away your level).  
<br><br>
This happens enough times, and all of a sudden a posse forms every time those shouts ring out.  And then, bada-bing, your character is pretty much done.  You've gotten up to level 6, is it?  That's as high as you get to go, because every time you log into the zone now the shouts go up that you are around.
<br><br>
Players whack out players for different reasons, and I admit I partake of a bit o' the ultraviolence myself on occasion.  Personally I like the freedom aspect of PVP, and the interesting position it puts you in to have the tools at your disposal, whether you use them to dispense your own form of justice or just to go on a murder spree.  Nothing's better (PVP-wise) than the closure hunting down that guy that whacked you back when you were level 5 and standing over their corpse in silent commiseration.  
<br><br>
Actually there is one thing better, and that's doing it again, but then I've always been a big personal fan of the multiplier effect - if you are going to make a point, make a point.
<br><br>
But newbie "farming" (because effectively that's how little difficulty is involved) brings out the true jackasses of PVP, and taints the ability to do it for everyone else.  It seemingly serves no real purpose, there is no lasting long-term gain except your own death countless times at the hands of your victims, and it really does actually ruin the fun for people.  Call it what you want, but in my book it falls under the "jackass" definition.  It crosses a line.
<br><br>
Unfortunately Verant, in their infinite wisdom, set up a system where you can't police newbie slaughter very well.  So until they add in something to the effect that limits PVP to level 4 and above (my personal favorite) or another, better solution, I urge you to take some time and be willing to throw in against the horde of mindless scum that use the newbie areas for hunting grounds.  If you are a caster, buff up the victims or heal them if you can't directly assist.  If you have some spare money, toss a recently deceased player a few gp and buy 'em some new items (and make sure they bank the remainder afterwards).  Toss them a cheap pouch to pouch their goods if they get attacked.  If they are in a listening mood, make sure they know about /loc when dying, about the guards and the guard's limitations (ie. pet attacks, etc.), and the basics of survival (pouching gear, when to run, when to bank).
<br><br>
And if you are of a like level as the scum doing the deed, put them out of their misery … there is only one form of justice for those who prey on the defenseless.
