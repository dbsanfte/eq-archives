Well, this week we certainly did get to see a lot of new screen shots.  It seems that all of the bigger fan sites were included in the frenzy.  We've now seen shots of what look like lizard men, bee-Halflings, views of the Elven tree city...  All sorts of stuff to whet our appetites.  Many of us are looking forward to the chance to start a new adventure in Norrath.  And as the frenzy heightens for new adventure in EverQuest, I notice that a lot of the fan sites that I visited have gone away.  Plat dropped his a while ago, at least until later.  EverQuest Extreme has ceased to update.  Valderen stopped updating a aver a year ago.  I haven't even looked at my own page, Tales of Rose and Blade, in several months...
<br><br>
I'm not pleased to see all of these sites fade away.  But I can certainly understand why.  It is nearly impossible to run an EverQuest news page when there is no news around.  You'll notice that even EverQuest Express has run very few articles (our idea of news) lately.  We have a slight advantage over other sites because we also run a lot of tales, and that helps to keep this sight fresh.  That, and we have such a cool staff  :P.
<br><br>
But where will we all go from here?  Soon enough there will come a time when the testers of EverQuest are no longer under an NDA.  There will be so much information blasting it's way across the Internet that we will have a completely different problem.  There will be too many EverQuest site.  Where will we all go for news?  Which of the probably hundreds of news, fan, and guild pages will we spend our time reading?  And how will any one site manage to stand out from the rest?
<br><br>
Well, I don't know that I have that answer, yet.  If I did, I don't suppose it would be too bright for me to spell it out here.  But it's something that all the fan sites should think about.  It's also something that those that supply the hits to our sites should think about as well.  It's important that you support those sites that you enjoy.  Make suggestions to the folks that run them.  Keep them vital.  I suppose this includes EQX as well.  But I don't mean that as a push for you to visit our site more often.  I just want you to be aware that it is the readers that ultimately decide which sites survive.  Especially for sites like ours, ones that don't have a sponsor or a hit counter, your support is all that keeps us going.
<br><br>
It also occurred to me that many of the guild sites have disappeared or stopped
updating as well.  I'm a bit less upset about this.  There are far too many
guilds ready to join a world that they have never seen.  I think you all know
how I feel about guilds.  If you don't, and you actually care about my opinion,
read <a href="../Issue38/expressions.htm">this</a>.  But the same thing would apply to the guild sites that you are a member of.  You'll need to make certain that you are not just another guild.  Find a way to make your guild better appreciated by the community.  This does not mean make your page flashier than the rest.  It may mean exactly the opposite.  A clean, simple page may be more interesting to folks than one that takes tem minutes to load.  No, the best thing you can do to keep your guild alive is to help the game.  Participate in it with though toward the whole.  Personal or guild goals can be met with a sense of the world, and it's inhabitants.
<br><br>
Regardless of how the community exist outside the game, we are all getting geared up to exist inside the game.  And personally I have to prepare myself for another game challenge.  Our new campaign starts next week.  I wrote my character background several months ago.  Since then I bought a new machine.  So of course that biography was one of the things that I forgot to copy to the new computer.  It should be interesting rewriting it.  There's no way that it will be the same.  I would be interested to compare the old one to the new one.  The new game starts next Saturday.  Wish me luck.
