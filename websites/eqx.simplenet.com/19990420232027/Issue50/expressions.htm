<em>	I just finish reading Oghmas article in issue 47 "<a href="../Issue47/edito.htm">What to do when the love is gone</a>" and it prompted another topic for conversation.  It is simple foran online game to obtain and audience, but nearly impossible for them to keep it.  I'm forced to dmit that my argument is a tad one-sided since the only fully online role-playing experience I've had is with Ultima Online.  When I first heard about it, I was overwhelmed.  So many diferent skills, custoizable chracters, adventure, monsters, it had everything.  On entering the world for the first time, I was eve more overwhelmed!  Traveling from city to city, seekin gout items and exploring caverns, it was a dream come true.  Then reality hit. Well, anti reality, really.  I atated figuring out what skills were needed for the world, and which ones were useless.  I got into a routine.  Ug, I hate that word.  But I had to submit in order to survive.  About six months after the initial purpose, my character had no meaning anymore. So how is an olind game supposed to keep an audience?  When is variety replaced with routine?

	Thank you for your questions, they are really very good ones.  Those of us anticipating playing EverQuest want to know if their investment of time, money, and energy will be rewarded with an unparalleled game experience.  There are two questions in your response, please pardon me for paraphrasing you, but I hope to get at the main thrust of your query with them:
<br><br>
	What I think you are really saying is:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we avoid allowing game knowledge steal our sense of wonder?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will EverQuest itself address the issue of staleness?

<br><br>
	I also played Ultima Online, and I assiduously read all the spoiler sites.  I read them partly out of interest in the gaming environment, and partly to make my characters better.  I remember reading about what weapons were best and why, but then I hit a big stumbling block: I could not create a character concept for a character who used a halberd.  I think that was what saved me from boredom and the GM archer/mage vicious circle.
<br><br>
	When you play a character, you of course want them to succeed and become more powerful.  This is true whether you are a power-gaming type or a role-playing type.  There is a line, however, that you can cross which will either make your character stale and one-sided, or keep them vibrant or alive.  That line is the character concept you have for that individual.  
<br><br>
	If your character concept includes changing his/her weapon to the most powerful weapon in the game, then you can make that decision and keep the character fresh.  If the concept does not include that, you should not do it - unless there is a viable, in-character reason why you would.  To keep wonder alive, you must continue to make in-character decisions.  If you enter a town you have never entered with that character, try to see it through the eyes of that character.
<br><br>
	Game knowledge is something we all strive to attain, and then reject once we have succeeded in acquiring it.  Somehow all that knowledge and effort kills our ability to be surprised, excited, or enraptured by the gaming experience.  We look at a monster and say, "Oh, ok, it's a goblin, level 4-5 and carries X treasure and doing X points of damage when it hits, and suddenly we have taken all the accomplishment out of defeating it.  It is no longer Bork the goblin, of the Runnyeye tribe, threatening our homelands - it is a level x monster, with X reward for it's defeat.  For this kind of staleness, we have no one to blame but ourselves.
<br><br>
	There is another kind of staleness, and I touched on it above a little bit: it is the staleness achieved by the game design itself.  Ultima Online's one race, skill based system unfortunately lent itself to the maxing out of one character "class" - the GM Archer/mage or warrior-mage, or whatever iteration you were working on when it became stale to you.
<br><br>
	I think that EverQuest, if it succeeds in not becoming stale, will do it because it has multiple races and multiple classes, and an extremely high level curve.  If it takes 12 months to reach the highest level in a class, it means that a player who plays all the classes and all the races has some 10-20 years of gameplay until they have exhausted all possibilities.  There are between 500-600 different spells available, some of which are not found in shops.  If the classes are balanced, as 989 says, there will be no "best" class or "best" race - merely a best class/race for certain situations but not all.  Having a class based system means that there are things that a character will NEVER be able to do because of their choice of class.  I can't see anyone saying EverQuest is boring unless they have no imagination or curiosity.
<br><br>
	There is more to staleness than your character's profession or race, however.  It can result from the gaming environment becoming stale or boring.  All I can think of in EverQuest's case when I think of staleness is the recent screenshot of the entrance to Kaladim and the entrance to Felwithe.  They are different in so many ways!  If each race's home city has different architecture, and each dungeon is different depending on the races that inhabit it, there will be an awful lot of variety. Things will be new to each character as they encounter it
<br><br>
	The biggest and most important thing that 989 can do right, however, is to have many quests and game events.  Make things different every once in a while, for a change of pace.  Put gnolls en masse outside the Qeynos city gates, as if they had suddenly decided to assault the town. Even better, weave it into a story line where the players' actions have consequences in the world, where a player or guild can have renown for being the one responsible for saving a city.  Give Norrath a history with meaning.
<br><br>
	I have played RPG's for about 20 years, and I know many rules and game mechanics to create role-playing environments.  When playing becomes stale, I usually track it down to a lack of investment in a character.  I need to sit in that character's head for a while, determine their hopes and fears, and then play them accordingly.  Thank you Erdrick, for reminding me that a game is more than rules, dice, charts and tables.  A game is the really the story that is told by the character living it, and game mechanics are merely the vehicle, not the wonder and enchantment, of the gaming experience.
