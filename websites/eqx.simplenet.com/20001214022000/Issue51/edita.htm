This is going to be a tough subject for some of us for a while, but it's something that I want to talk about.
<br><br>
First, I want to thank Severian for sending in a <a href="letters.htm">letter</a> that expresses exactly the sentiments that are driving me on this issue.  Please read it before you continue on with this editorial...
<br><br>
By now most of you are aware that several of the larger fan sites have been given PR privileges that allow us to use information from the EverQuest beta on our sites.  Now this is probably a very exciting thing for those of you waiting so desperately to play this game. You've already seen more real information about the game this week than you have in all the months of waiting prior.  And having been in the beta, and having seen the game, you may feel that I am not in the best position to tell you how you should feel about this new flood of information.
<br><br>
But Severian is right.  He knows what will make the game great for him.  I doubt that I would be able to restrain myself as well as he does.  But I do know that if I could, I would enjoy the game far more than if I had sponged up all of the official, secondary and leaked information out there.  And I feel very strongly about that.  From talking with the rest of the folks here at EverQuest Express I think they agree with me.
<br><br>
So I want to use this space to talk to the other sites out there, the ones that were also graced with the PR privilege.  In doing so I also hope to explain to our readers our stance on giving out information and give you some idea what to expect from us in the near future.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open letter to the EverQuest fan site community:
<br><br>
With the lifting of the NDA from several of the larger fan sites, our role (if I may be so bold as to include EverQuest Express among your ranks) in the immediate future of EverQuest has grown.  The 'established' EverQuest fan sites should realize that they are very much responsible for the tone of the game for those that come across it from the outside. I suspect that the sites that were just given editorial release on the NDA will account (and have accounted) for the majority of the site hits and most of the information and ideas available about EverQuest in the community.  This gives us a great deal of responsibility and perhaps a bit of strength.  We are all aware that there is nothing we can do to prevent the spoiler sites from appearing. All we can do is try to encourage folks to see the overwhelming significance of mystery in a game like this.  First encounters with something new in EverQuest are the greatest moments in the game.  The first time I cast Minor Illusion... the first time I saw a Hill Giant up close... all those things are too cool to steal from a new player by posting spoilers.
<br><br>
For example, while I might not have included the descriptions of what the spells do (btw, you guys forgot to include a description for Mesmerize :P ), I can't fault EQVault them for putting it up. EQX will probably end up spilling information that some of you would wish we hadn't. It can't be helped.  But we will be making a conscious effort to avoid letting that happen.
<br><br>
I feel like we've been put under a spotlight.  It is our turn to show how much we can help the game.
<br><br>
My plea to you is that you keep in mind how you present your information as much as what information you publish. Try to get your audience to understand that discovery is fun. Teach them that figuring stuff out on their own is a hell of a lot more interesting than reading about it and following someone's else's steps. Teach them this before the spoiler sites get established. I would love to see the mystery still exist at release. That gives us all a better chance to teach the new players in the game rather than on our sites. If we can earn their loyalty maybe we can keep them after the spoilers come up. Together we can lessen the "UO" effect.  I think you know what I mean.
<br><br>
As for EverQuest Express, it has been our plan at EQX not to change much of anything as of December 1st.  We do have plans for in game stories based on our characters, with pictures!  We may do a few commentaries about the game itself, and there are a few issues that I personally think need clearing up (all the while reminding our readers that EverQuest is still in beta and things may change...).  But nothing that is too far from what we already do.
<br><br>
We have no intention of entering any sort of information war with any of you (of course we're weekly and not in a position to win that war anyhow  :P).  And we don't have a hit counter, so I suppose even if we did win, it would be hard to tell.  And we will never be a spoiler site.
<br><br>
So far the fan sites have been great about supporting the game instead of 'beating' it.  And I for one understand how the 989 developers feel.  I've been involved in this game for a long time as a fan, and was lucky enough to be in the beta from fairly early on.  I kinda feel like it's part mine too.  I guess it's my hope that we can all make the rest of the community feel that way too.
