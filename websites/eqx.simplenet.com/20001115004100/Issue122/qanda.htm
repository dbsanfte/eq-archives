  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I am a level 13 enchanter, and I wonder if equipping my 
  pet with a weapon at this point will do anything. If I equip it with a sword, 
  the normal axe is not replaced with a sword, and I cannot give it a second weapon 
  until 24.<br>

  <b>A:</b> From what the Pillar of Wisdom, Kirbol, tells me, your pet is actually 
  quite fussy about those cheap weapons you might be foisting off on him. Let’s 
  say the sword you give him is worth less in coins than what he comes with. Well, 
  then, he’s going to turn up his nose at your offer and totally ignore it. Now, 
  however, let’s say you offer him something more valuable than what he has, and 
  all of a sudden he’ll take your weapon advice and use your gift. Hmmm, sort 
  of like when you go to an elven hall for dinner. If your wine is better, they 
  open it and drink it and if it’s worse than what they have, they hide it away. 
  Since you do have to wait for a second weapon until level 24, you might want 
  to experiment with some 2h weapons to see if the damage is higher and if your 
  pet appreciates them more. (I think someone is going to have to open a pet obedience 
  school -- pets being picky over a weapon is simply out of line!)</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I have a question for you. I've played this game for some 
  time now, and written countless stories detailing my characters adventurers, 
  et al. So tell me, is it Teir'Dal, or Tier'Dal? I seen Tier'Dal in a lot of 
  places, but in the game itself I see Teir'Dal often as well. The same applies 
  for Feir'Dal. Also, while on the topic, any idea what Vie means? As in, Koada'Vie, 
  or Firiona Vie.<br>
  Thank you,<br>
  Whyte Tyger</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> From everything I can tell, Teir`Dal is the correct spelling, the 
  same going for Feir`Dal. I really don’t know the linguistic derivation of Vie 
  -- the King of Felwithe was named Vie (Firiona’s father), so the only thing 
  I can surmise is that at some point the elves visited France in another realm 
  and liked the sound of the French word for “life” so much, that they took it 
  on as a unique surname among elves. Of course, it’s possible I’m wrong on this, 
  but doesn’t it make sense?</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Greetings, I started playing EQ a few months ago and have 
  loved every minute of it. But I have become stumped. I was told by a NPC that 
  if I were to tithe 70 gold to Innoruuk that a woman in the blind fish might 
  break her vow of silence. The NPC told me this after I gave him a bottle of 
  red wine and asked him about the vow the lady was keeping. The NPC was in the 
  library, in 3rd Gate, behind a door. I have yet to find anyone who knows how 
  to tithe. Since you seem to have answered many questions I was hoping that you 
  might have some idea how to do this .<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Luckily, since Neriak is not on my usual travel itinerary as my return 
  from there would be in grave doubt (pun intended), I was able to toss out the 
  question to Kirbol, the tiny Pillar of Wisdom, as he raced past me on his speedy 
  gnomish feet. He suggests that you might need to bypass the assistants loitering 
  about the cleric’s guild in Neriak and talk to the head guy about tithing. Hopefully 
  he will be both talkative and honest enough to not request a kickback if you 
  ask him about this tithe.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Hello from Germany! Just a quick note about the Question 
  that EQnut asked in issue 120. He got things mixed up a lot =) Not Brad aka 
  Aradune left Verant, Richard Garriot aka Lord British left Origin Systems.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Hi, I was wondering something about the language skill. 
  This popped into my head last night for some reason. People have gotten gnoll 
  up to like master, does that mean that at least ONE person HAD to have put 100+ 
  skill points into the specific language? For you can not teach above your language 
  skill?<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> 
  I went to my Pillars of Wisdom in disbelief that there would be no other way 
  to learn a language up to mastery without investing many practices and even 
  more platinum. However, they say your reasoning is correct. In order to get 
  to mastery in a language without a player teacher, it is necessary to put both 
  your practices and your fortune into it.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> To clarify: You do NOT need to learn the basics of a language 
  at your guildmaster to learn it from others. And from what I have noticed, the 
  spam either has to be in group speak or tell. I can't verify this, but I think 
  it works in guild speak, also. But I am not sure, and don't blame me if you 
  get kicked out of your guild for spamming everyone. lol.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Thanks for writing. I’ll just go ahead and believe you that /say won’t 
  work for spamming languages until someone else writes in to correct us both. 
  Oh, and thank goodness my guild is so patient with me -- I spam them with questions, 
  not languages, and they even (sometimes) are agreeable enough to answer me!

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> Since I am an ARROGANT and SNOTTY high elf I'll bless you 
  with a few answers. First of all bard songs can effect pets in PvP. Unfortunately 
  the pets cannot receive any positive benefits and tend to get angry about the 
  negative ones. Many times have I scolded a foolish half-elven bard as my pet 
  beat him/her to a pulp. I just don't understand why bards must try to mesmerize 
  everything when there is an enchantress nearby. Secondly, the fall of the Combine 
  Empire was not caused by a tailoring mishap (half-elves in dresses?!? really!) 
  but by the foolish actions of the humans. Had High Elves run the empire it would 
  still be around and functioning today. I'd also like to add that I am currently 
  working on tailoring a drake-hide dress for myself. I'll be sure to show it 
  to you when I'm finished. (Disclaimer: I don't want you to be upset by any of 
  this... I'm just sticking my nose up in the air for all the high elves everywhere.)<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> My goodness, I would have thought the schools in Felwithe would have 
  taught more proper use of capitalization, but perhaps that is a minor subject 
  better left to half-elves and humans? Oh, never mind my attempt at humor, and 
  thanks for writing. I think bards attempt to mesmerize everything because there 
  is a secret bet going on with a huge pot for the bard who manages to actually 
  mesmerize the most critters. Now whether that bet is actually worth the deaths 
  meted out, is an entirely different subject for debate. Yes, and while we are 
  on the subject of debates, I do want you to know my sources are impeccable and 
  that it was indeed a high elven tailor who caused the fashion debacle leading 
  to the ruin of the Combine empire and the lack of dresses for half elves. While 
  your explanation is used as a cover-up story in the history books, you have 
  only to look around you and you will see no half-elven lass or lady wearing 
  a dress. Ergo, my proof. Sigh, finally as much I would enjoy seeing a drake-hide 
  dress on you, what I would love to see is a deep blue dress, embroidered and 
  trimmed in deep rose, green, and a subtle yellow on me. It would look soooooo 
  nice. (Grin, woe be to the elf who forgets to keep her nose pointed upward correctly!)</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> This isn't a question, I just wanted to mention a couple 
  of things that were brought up in the last Q&A. First, you seemed to refer to 
  Nillipus as a halfling. Nillipus is a brownie that runs around Rivervale (the 
  halfling town) and steals jumjum from them. Second, someone mentioned using 
  the mouse to look and move around as opposed to the keyboard. I had assumed 
  the vast majority of people do this, but perhaps I was wrong? In my opinion, 
  this is by FAR the easiest way to move around in EverQuest, and allows an easy 
  way to strafe (just use the left/right arrows while holding down the right mouse 
  button), which is important for snatching glimpses of what lies around the corner 
  in that nasty dungeon, or more importantly, seeing where you're going when you're 
  running through a dungeon (as in, away from big nasties). Also, using the mouse 
  to look around gives you much more control than pressing separate keys for up, 
  down, left, and right, plus you control at what SPEED you look around. Great 
  if you run into something nasty and need to turn around in a hurry to run. While 
  I don't want to encourage a Quake mentality in playing, those who play it will 
  recognize the importance of being able to maneuver quickly and accurately in 
  a tight situation.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> You are right, I was quite unobservant -- a miserable failing in one 
  so highly paid as a source of information. Thanks for writing and thanks also 
  for talking about the use of the mouse while playing. It sounds like it can 
  be a great way to go. </font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Q:</i></b><i> 
  In response to a question in Issue 121... "Why did the bard cross the road?" 
  was submitted by Nillipus. I understand your deep trauma over the entire dress 
  issue, but might I add it is not the HALFLINGS who ridicule you as you claimed. 
  Nillipus is a brownie who is, quite frankly, an annoyance in Rivervale. I just 
  want to clear that up before some more touchy halflings get offended by being 
  confused with the brownie twit. May luck favor your music, <br>

  to forgive me this slip of attention.</font></p>
