	<big><big>W</big></big>elcome to Norrath, a planned community. Sign below this says player population one thousand. Quickly lets provide some math for those not bored enough to have done it already. 1000 players/12 races=83.33. Now I divide the 14 classes in half assuming that not all races can be all classes. 83.33 player's of race "a"/7 classes=11.9 or roughly 12 players of race "a" class "2" or 12 Dwarven fighters. We can modify that number for popularity plenty, assuming there will be at least three times the number of high elf wizards as halfling bards.
<br><br>
OK lets say there is 48 High Elf Wizards in Norrath. Lets also assume that this means "at any given time". 48 came from multiplying 12 by 4 for popularity. High Elves, being innately better at magic and Wizards being by far the best at offensive magic would make for a rather common sight. Think back to Ultima Online and imagine that there was only 48 blacksmiths in the world at any given time. Think of all the places the blacksmiths could be in the world at any one given time, assuming that the blacksmiths were everyone's primary character. Don't calculate into my formula the "utility man secondary character" factor YET cause I am referring to primary characters right now.. ie tank mages. Given 6 popular cities to lurk in and 6 most common dungeons to explore, 6 favorite overworld spawn sites and an extra 6 places they might happen to be and you have almost as many total separate places as blacksmiths in the world. Of course my math is totally right wing, we know there were more cities an dungeons, but less actual popular cities and dungeons.. so my math is for example only. Lastly figure that we know that the world of Norrath is larger, and player zones are spread across multiple main continents instead of on one.
<br><br>
All this makes it seem that I might only cross paths with one High Elf Wizard for every landmark I visit. No matter how many I cross paths with, I would never see so many of every race class combination in so many different places, because the math doesn't support it in a 1000 player world. End result is a lot of room to breath, not very many crowds and smaller crowds where they gather, and a sense of individuality.

When you factor in the "second slot utility man" abuse, we see a few of the usual evils, but also envision with me a world without a skilled blacksmith in every town at every anvil. Sad and unnecessary to stop the evils if you ask me. I would prefer to have one less High Elf Wizard deep in the dungeon while his master plays the alchemist at the shop who so kindly charges my life savings for the last remaining greater heal potion, than having no crooked alchemist player outside the shop at all and one more High Elf Wizard in line for the NPC. Food for thought.
<br><br>
Getting back to individuality, think of what it takes to make someone stand out in a crowd. Or lets change "crowd" to "list", and think of who we know that we would recognize by name only besides friends. In the small town mentality of the sub-sections of Norrath you would know it if one of the 48 other Dwarf Warriors killed the unique dragon "smaug". Not saying you would notice what happened to every other Erudite Necromancer and who was animating what dead rock star, but if you were a dwarf warrior you just might notice when on of them did something note-worthy, or died.
<br><br>
If your glass is half empty you might think this means "more chances to be unique" leading to a "another human paladin hero who hath slain tiamat named Huma" situation that might occur if there were a lack of unique quests of a lack of actual uniqueness to unique items. "Oh wow another +5,+10,+30 Bastard Sword. This one happens to be named "Pain" after the guy I killed instead of "Lust" like my other +5+10+30 War mace that is purple." While the possibility for everyone to be a hero (thus making everyone normal again) is there, I have a feeling that the player base will segregate the common hero by unique playing styles.

Enter Xavori and Magical Bubba, SoB and LeGion, The Red Capes of Justice and IC.
<br><br>
In a world of human tank mages IC stood out by actions alone. With 12 races to play and multiple classes to balance the PKilling fields I foresee a much more unique IC and a greater variety in "signature" groups/kills/tactics. Also I see less impersonators in a world of so many choices. I will be glad to not run into multiple thumpers in EQ when seeking a good smithy. <g> As well I foresee the same variety in heroes, which adds in yet another factor to divide the player base in my math.
<br><br>
If all 48 High Elf Wizards were "Lawful good", "based in Qeynos", "members of guild A" and "hated guild B" there would be just that: 48 of the same thing. We know this will not be the case with the personalities out there and the different player "clicks" that have formed for EverQuest. Going back over my math I just might claim that you could be the only player like yourself on several shards if you add just a touch of personality to your character. Heaven forbid you take the advice of Ayrent or the like and form a really in depth personality to play; you might be unique persistent to all shards. 
<br><br>
In closing I would like to say that my glass in not always half full, and that I do not dismiss the arguments brought up by those opposed. If your glass seems more than half empty, ask for a refill. Brad? <g>
