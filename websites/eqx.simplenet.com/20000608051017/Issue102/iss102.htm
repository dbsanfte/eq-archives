In a few weeks EverQuest Express will be two.  Yup, our lil' baby will be two years old.  And we thought that for Issue 104 we should do a <em>best of</em> issue.  This serves a few purposes, really.  First, it gives new readers a chance to see what we've done that people think is worth reading, without forcing them to plow through a hundred issues to find it<b>...</b>

Well, it seems that a week wasn't long enough for you all to write any stories about those screen shots from <a href="../Issue101/kun3.htm">last week</a>.  And this week we have two more for you!  These are the last two, unfortunately.  We still want to read your stories based on these screen shots.

Is there a god of complication?  If there were, he would be my deity.  There are some days where he would do nothing but follow me around adding layer upon layer of complexity to my life until the absurdity of it all caused the rest of his brethren on the pantheon of cruelty (the gods of Spite, Nausea, Impotence, Tight-fitting-shorts) to burst into hysterics.

Another week, another blank page to fill…

First, let me assure you that my character is no longer the magic item vat that he was last week.  I obviously jinxed myself by telling you all about my neato stuff.  A few puffs of fire from a hellhound and a few poorly rolled saving throws and the poor guy is just your average character again.  Heck, he's even worse off than that, having lost his spell books in the process.

    Oghma is the god of Bards and the Celtic god of knowledge.  Why then do you play as a dwarf.  you should be a elven bard or a erudite according to the mental image i have.  ofcourse im not trying to tell you what to do.  But thats just how i see it.  and ive been using the name Oghma in RPG's for some time now.
