I could hear the slimed slippery sound of my pursuer's webbed feet whapping against the rock floor of the cave.   Then, as I slid across the narrow plank, the noise was closer, now a thwacking on the wooden span high over the murky stream below.  My hands pounded my drum harder and faster as if they could speed my feet along faster than the magic of the song was already doing.  I could almost feel the sticky tongue glomming onto my sweatsoaked hair  streaming behind me.  Would I make it?  Where was the gate?  It had to be there . . .

"A froglok?"  she said  "What is a froglok?"   Raising her eyebrow with what was now the very familiar "she's certainly getting eccentric" expression my family and friends have been using on me recently, she patiently listened as I continued my tale of the adventures of Nepenthia in Everquest.   Then, my completely bemused sister said, "I don't want to be judgmental, but it looks like you are wasting your time.  What good do you get out of inventing characters and playing them?"   Her question raised echoes of my first grade teacher who kept asking if I was done daydreaming so I might learn something.  Both my sister and that long ago teacher seemed focused on whether I had a product to show for my efforts.  The underlying assumption that playing Nepenthia wastes my time since I have nothing to show for my hours online except stories of people I have met or ghouls I have killed was unstated but present.  (By then, I didn't have the heart to add to her bewilderment by describing the glee of putting on a ruggedly itchy troll skin.)  Why, she wondered, would I put all these dreams and thoughts and imaginal features into a roleplaying character that could be wiped out with a rapid fingerjab at the delete button?
<br><br>
It's true that Nep and my other characters have a chimerical quality, and yet the imaginal world I inhabit through them has its own solid reality ---- one in which the voices and actions of the personalities I roleplay actually affect and sometimes even help create the nature of my "real life".   I believe that, unlike in fantasy where the scenery and action flow by merely to be watched, roleplay provides a place where the "me" I am aware of and know (the conscious) and the "me" I haven't yet met or seen (the unconscious) meet and act.  In roleplay, like in active imagination (a Jungian technique in which someone actually invites figures of the psyche into an imaginal place and interacts with them), the forces of imagination and creativity have an actual container in which to work.   The psychologist, Carl Jung, described this as a kind of psychological alchemy.    Since fantasy is largely an act of observation, most fantasies don't include interaction and dialogue to resolve inner issues or allow for an evolution in self perception.  Roleplay and active imagination, however, are active engagements.  Both allow us to connect to personalities and images arising from our psyche.  Additionally, roleplay often works to build relationships with others outside the personal sphere.  Rp and active imagination encourage taking time to reflect on what is occurring in the events we share with others, online or in the mind, and what happens to us.  Independent ethical decisions on what characters will or will not do and how they will interact with others must be made.   The imagination at work in roleplay and active imagination draws from a "marvelous universe of unseen energies, forces, forms of intelligence and personalities" within us and by doing so seems to have the possibility of providing a benefit to each person that can be observed as a kind of growth for the person engaged with a character.
<br><br>
Dreaming, active imagination and roleplay all allow for the contents of the unconscious to arise to consciousness in images and metaphors.  Dreams, however, happen while we sleep and the content and effect of the dream is subject to what we can retrieve after waking. In dreaming, it is possible to be with the figures of our dreams, reacting to them and responding to them without thinking things out first and having our ego decide what we are going to do.   Active imagination, on the other hand, is a waking free-flowing mode of dialogue with different parts of the unconscious on a common field of imagination where both the unknown self and the known self can meet. In active imagination, Jung encouraged a further step beyond dreaming;  that of engaging with these inner beings of the psyche while we are awake and can choose how we will listen to or answer them.   Active imagination functions while waking, but, like dreaming, it draws material from the unconscious, forms it into images and then transmits it to the conscious mind.  Roleplay does the same but then adds another dimension.  When we create a character and introduce him or her (or possibly an enormous green roaring "it")  into a roleplay world like Norrath, we move beyond interacting with the elements of our own minds.  We place those figures on the stage of the EverQuest, and we directly involve ourselves with other people doing the same thing.
<br><br>
Even though roleplay steps us out of the personal world of active imagination into one shared by others, there are still shared similarities between the environments.  First, they both allow the possibility of experiencing feelings and emotions as if what was happening was actually taking place in the real world.  Who hasn't, when faced with the imminent death of a character from a squeaking triumphant rat, felt a rush of adrenaline urging flight, followed by an explosion of disappointment or pissed-offedness or sometimes even outright laughter when the "Please Wait.  Loading" text appears.  Active imagination works similarly within the psyche:  a raging demon blasting away the lives of the courageous adventurers -- the battle is lost and tears drop onto the soft arms of a comfortable real-life chair.
<br><br>
Next, both active imagination and roleplay can work toward enlarging awareness of ourselves personally.  Whether the people we interact with are living within our imagination or are actual real-life humans joining us in roleplay, the messages they send need to be listened to as they will contain perspectives that our normal waking consciousness may have ignored or been unaware of.  With a willingness to listen and a readiness to respond, our perceptions of ourselves and our tolerance of the worlds we inhabit, both imaginal and real, can grow.   Imagination has been called an authentic representation of the contents of the unconscious.  Despite comments from people that "It's just a game" or "It isn't real", there is much to learn from the often helpful, frequently irritating, and always intriguing characters we meet in these non-tangible worlds.
<br><br>
Self-knowledge can also grow through bringing the archetypal themes hidden inside of us alive for expression and experience.  In Jungian thinking an archetype is a pattern in psychology or an energy system that is usually expressed in image and metaphor and often experienced with strong emotion.  Common archetypes would be the hero, the mother, the injured animal, the eternal child, the old man; but each individual exploring the psyche will find both common and unique archetypal energies arising.  Roleplay and active imagination let us play with the archetypes.  Interestingly, the word "play" has at least two different derivations.  One is from the root "plegan" which includes Old English, Old German and Old Latin meanings of "to pledge for, stake, risk or exercise oneself.  The other is from the Middle English word "pleya" which means "to leap for joy, dance, rejoice". In real life, I certainly haven't seen a dragon wandering down my street whapping its tail against parked cars much less have I been able to wield a six foot sword to attack the dragon.  My fingers wouldn't have the foggiest idea what to do with the strings of a mandolin and a flirtatious wink would probably be greeted with stunned disbelief.  But in roleplay, as in active imagination, the heroine in my soul can slay dragons and celebrate rituals of courage and bravery.  The artist in my heart can sing magical songs of healing.  And the umm adventurous flirt hiding in the unconscious can play and flutter her eyelashes madly.  A way of looking at the benefit derived from this play with the archetypes is that each one of these archetypes we meet and talk to and enact in imagination can give  its energy and understanding to our personality, altering the contours of our essential character and moving us a step closer to being more of the whole person we were born to be.  In Jungian parlance, this is "individuation".
<br><br>
Whether we choose to stay within our own imagination or to share an imaginal world with others, the steps we move through are similar in both active imagination and roleplay.   First we must find a character.  In active imagination, sitting quietly and simply being open to what images and personalities arise starts the process.  In roleplay, unless laziness pokes up its sleepy head to suggest that we simply take a known character created by someone else or use a common stereotype, the process also calls for taking some time thinking about characters and the choices we have and waiting to see who or what pops up.  The activity in both revolves around imagined places often with an entire panoply of gods and beings in place, where we can converse and listen, where we feel strongly, and where our characters do what they must do.  In the best sense, we don't manipulate these actors, we allow them to live and be who they are within the container we have provided.    The characters often must choose to act out a set of ethics or values.  Often we visit and play the same character week after week as it evolves its own existence.   Finally, in both active imagination and roleplay, we can live parts of ourselves that have been unlived and, often, cannot be lived out in the space of the years we are given.
<br><br>
Dreaming, active imagination and roleplaying show us that we are not simple one-dimensional figures.   But more than just teasing us with images and metaphors and psychological riddles about who we are or who we might be, they allow us access to creative energy and time to go deeper in our understanding of and wisdom about ourselves and those we encounter along the roleplaying paths.   Somehow, this doesn't conform to the idea of a "product" in that spending time in roleplay or active imagination is not guaranteed to bring riches and fame, but "She owned 15 houses and 983 cars" is not what I want on my tombstone.  For me, the benefit of this time spent in roleplay with Nepenthia and my other characters could be written as an epitaph that says, "Her time was measured in tears and laughter, love and growth, and overflowed with experiences that offered her wisdom and understanding."
<br><br>
Nah, I don't think roleplay is a waste of time at all.
