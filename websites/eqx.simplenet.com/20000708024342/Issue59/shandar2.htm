"Keep it.  I've got more important things to worry about," said Shandar.
<br><br>
Little did he know just how true that statement would prove in just a little while.  He stumbled out of the tavern and into the streets.  The liquor had worn off some, but only a little.  Then he began to sing a sad song, if you could truly call it singing.  It was a song that Shandar had learned from an old dwarf, and Shandar's voice simply didn't do the song justice.  It just wasn't deep enough, and Shandar's inebriated state didn't help matters any.  Nonetheless, the song did always make Shandar feel better, and by the gods, Shandar needed to feel better tonight if any night.
<br><br>
So, Shandar wandered the streets butchering a beautiful dwarven song and searching for a place to sleep for the night.  Finally, he made his way to a back alley where he felt that he wouldn't be disturbed.  He lay down and quickly drifted off into the world of dreams.
	<br><br>
Shandar dreamt that he was at a beautiful oasis.  The water formed a crystal clear pool where Shandar bathed, and all the best wines and ales were easily within his reach.  Beautiful women who thought only of him surrounded him, and they were approaching him.  They came up to him and then...
<br><br>
"Hey, Mista!  Wake up!  Please Mista, wake up!"  His dream interrupted, Shandar jumped.  He awoke to a young child tugging as hard as she could at the sleeve of his shirt.
<br><br>
She was a small human child dressed in rags.  She was young and obviously in need of help.  There was an innocence that danced on her face and a twinkle in her eye that Shandar felt was greater than that of any gem.
<br><br>
"What is it, child?" asked Shandar.  The liquor had worn off, and with the exception of a splitting headache Shandar was once again himself.
<br><br>
"It's my mommy, Mista.  The bad mens came and said that she ain't paid 'em their money.  So they said they was gonna make a 'zample of her.  Mommy tole me to run, but you was the only help I could find.  Please help!" said the young girl.
<br><br>
Shandar was moved by the little one's pleas, and there was no way that he could say no.  "All right little one.  Take me to your mother and I will help her."
<br><br>
The child took off into a run and Shandar sprinted alongside her.  They made their way to a seclude corner of the city, and the child pointed her finger in a general direction, "There dey is.  Over dere."
	<br><br>
"All right, you stay here, and don't come out until either me or your mother comes to get you.  Understand?" said Shandar.
<br><br>
"Yessir," replied the little girl.
<br><br>
Shandar pulled a dagger from within the folds of  his shirt and then hid it inside one of his boots.  Then he quietly peeked around the corner.
<br><br>
There they were, four men.  Two of them held the woman by her arms, rendering her defenseless.  Another one, much bigger than the other three, rummaged through the woman's tattered bag.  He casually threw a loaf of bread onto the ground.  To the woman, it was invaluable, but to this big oaf, it was worthless.  He cared only about money and "valuable" items.  Finally, there was the fourth, their leader.  He stood watch, supervising and acting as a lookout.
<br><br>
They were all rogues... No, not rogues.  These men were petty thieves.  Shandar had known many honorable and even admirable rogues, but these men were simply thieves, interested only in how much they could steal.  Shandar had been like them once; he knew how they thought.  They cared only about themselves and would do anything to advance their own desires, even if it means hurting others.  They always picked the easiest targets and despised a fair fight.  The burly one messing with the bag looked dangerous.  He was strong and looked like a brawler.  The other three were smaller but there were three of them.  They didn't really scare Shandar.  Judging from their target, they were most likely cowards.  No matter what Shandar wanted to think, however.  He knew that he couldn't take all four of these men in a head-to-head fight.  He would have to use his head.
	<br><br>
Calmly, Shandar walked straight around the corner right into plain view of the thieves.  The look out spotted him almost immediately and spoke up, "'Ey there friend.  I don't think it's safe to be walking this late at night.  Maybe it'd be better if you just turned back the way you came."
	<br><br>
"No, I think not," replied Shandar.  "I am out taking a nice stroll and I come across you boys.  What a coincidence.  Five men out walking at night, and we just happen to end up in the same place.  Now, perhaps you could let the poor woman go."
	<br><br>
Please, please sir help me!" pleaded the woman.
	<br><br>
One of the thieves, the big one, quit rummaging through her bag and began to approach Shandar.  He was nearly as large as a barbarian, and ugly enough to make the ugliest trolls wince in fear.  Now, Shandar thought <em>if only he is as stupid as he looks</em>.
<br><br>
"Surely you jest!" scoffed Shandar.  "You dare to insult me by sicking this big oaf on me!?  Have you never heard of Shandar the Great, the mighty warrior whose very name lays low the likes of you!?"  Shandar's lie sounded as sincere as any truth he had ever told.
	<br><br>
But, the thieves were not that stupid.  "Who!?" asked the big one, followed shortly after by the leader's "Yeah right, whatever.  Get him Derago!"
	<br><br>
<em>Oh well</em>, thought Shandar.  And then out loud, "Ah, I see your ogre friend there, is just as ugly as anyone of his race," goaded Shandar.  The large human was now growing very angry, and he walked with a purpose, but Shandar continued on, "Unfortunately, his stench reaches me all the way over here."
	<br><br>
That was it.  Enraged, ready to beat the little man to a bloody pulp with his bare hands, the largest of the thieves charged Shandar as fast as he could.  He got closer, and then he launched himself into the air, lunging at Shandar.
	<br><br>
Then, in a split second, Shandar dropped to the ground kicking one foot out straight towards the lunging behemoth, and then right afterwards, the other foot kicked the inside of his own leg pushing his hidden knife straight through the soft leather sole of Shandar's favorite boots.  The big one was already in the air though. He couldn't move in time, and he landed squarely on the blade.  He gave a single grunt as the blade pierced his sternum, and he then slumped over dead.
	<br><br>
Shandar quickly reached for his boot and pulled the dagger loose.  He kicked the behemoth off and quickly sprang to his feet.  "Well boys," said Shandar, "it looks like your short one lumbering oaf.  Which one of you shall I dispose of next?"
	<br><br>
The other three were just as angry as their large companion now, and at the leaders say so all of them started in on Shandar.  They let the woman go, and she hurriedly grabbed her belongings and ran.  Shandar's plan was working perfectly now.  He only had to take care of these guys.
	<br><br>
"Follow you me if you dare!" he yelled.  Shandar turned and began to run.
	<br><br>
"Get him!!" yelled their leader, and soon they were in hot pursuit.
	<br><br>
Shandar began singing a song, and his legs became as light as feathers.  He moved like the wind; there was no chance of the thieves actually catching him.  Still, he always stayed just within their sight.  He led them this way and that, and after a few minutes, the thieves began to tire.  <em>Now</em>, thought Shandar <em>it is time to teach these fools a lesson</em>.  He ran as fast as he could down one last alley, and like lambs to the slaughter, the thieves followed shortly after him.  They reached the end of the alley, and there was Shandar standing side by side in front of the tavern with two barbarian warriors and a human ranger.
	<br><br>
"Hi my good fellows," said Shandar.  "My friends here have heard of your plot and wish to have words with you.  Now if you'll excuse me, I really must be leaving."  He began humming gleefully as he turned to walk away.
	<br><br>
His friends pulled their weapons, and the bard could see the look of fear in the thieves' eyes.  The thieves knew they didn't stand a chance.  They were tired from chasing Shandar, and these three men were real warriors.  <em>Now they know how that poor woman felt</em>, thought Shandar.
	<br><br>
Shandar turned the corner, and as the thieves' cries got louder, he began to sing to himself energy reviving his tired bones with every note.  He wandered the streets searching for the little girl and her mother, until finally, he found them.
	<br><br>
"Oh! It's you kind sir.  Thank you so much!  You are not harmed are you?  I don't know what I would've done without you," said the slightly startled woman.  She was thin, frail, and covered in dirt.  It looked like she had aged far beyond her years living on the streets.
	<br><br>
"Yeah, thank ya Mista," said the little girl.
	<br><br>
"It was no problem.  I made a promise long ago that I would do what I could to stop people like those."  He reached into his shirt and pulled out his purse.  "Here, take this," he said.  "It is not much I'm afraid; I spent much of it earlier today, but maybe it will help, and perhaps I can speak to the tavernkeeper and get you a job."
	<br><br>
"Oh thank you kind sir! You are far too kind!  I don't know how to repay you!  I would love to work again..." exclaimed the woman before Shandar interrupted her.
	<br><br>
"No," he said.  "Think nothing of it.  I will speak with the barkeep in the morning."
	<br><br>
Shandar walked away and found another alley.  He lay down and prepared to watch the sunrise.  It was then that Shandar realized he was broke again.  Between the tavern and the woman, his purse was totally empty.  Somehow, it didn't seem to matter any more though.  He felt better than he had in a longtime.  For so long, he felt that his past deeds would haunt him forever.  However, the sun was coming up now, and for the first time in a long time, Shandar, the wandering bard, felt that he might actually succeed in his quest for redemption.
