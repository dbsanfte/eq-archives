<em>Classes that don't live up to the potential in eq.
<br><br>
After cruising the net i have come to one conclusion. The enchanter class has sparked little to no interest. From what I read of the FAQ they are the only class that can ever make magic items. Seems to me that is a power every one would want. But taking a look at the player totals 1 enchanter.  This confuses me as one would think they would appeal to both power hungry and the die-hard roleplayer. The power gamers drooling over the make magic item potential. For the role player its one of the new classes that other games have not done to death. As much as i look forward to EverQuest most classes seam the same old cut and dry classes.
<br><br>
Rogue what the hell happened here we are looking at 5 fighters, 7 mages, bards,1 one stinking rogue class. Bards seam to be pulled out the rouge variant they fall in to so often and that is good. However now we have a open area with the rouge. I like rouges but they should be kind of split in to more classes. Assassin, thief, ninja (yes I know it don't quite fit the game world maybe one day an oriental land will make it self known), bandit. Yes any one can kill and be called an assassin or mug people and be a bandit. But lets face it those are all faces of the rouge. 
<br><br>
Clerics lord all might is there is one thing I hate its the ad&d said that a cleric can't use a blade so it is the law. If I'm a cleric is not necessarily a I don't want to shed blood character. Weapon choice should completely depend on what god you pray to. If I worship a god of war and he grants me power does that mean I should only use a hammer? Heck no give the man a blade. The reason I say war god is this a sword blade it the basic fantasy fighting weapon a god of war would more then likely use one and so most of there clerics should. If I worship Thor ya I will use a hammer but that's part of the deity.  And the explanation of using blunt weapons to not draw blood hit some one with a 10 pound hammer in the head you have my word the blood will flow.
  <br><br>
 Not that all the classes are old, my hat goes off to the EQ staff on the way they made a bard more then a spell singing rouge. Lastly the number of potential evil characters playable in this game is way higher then most games once again my hat goes off to the EQ team.

Tadaka,
<br><br>
I have seen fairly wild fluctuation in how many of each profession and race are being played, and I think a lot of it boils down to player knowledge of the game system and misconceptions about which professions are best at doing certain jobs. Also know that the statistics as to how many of each profession are online at once are going to me inaccurate in two manners. First, they only show a time block for who was online, not the actual total for that server. Secondly remember that players who are anonymous will not show up when you search by profession. Enchanters and Rogues are two of the top professions that might turn on anonymous, since rogues would not want to be seen as rogues, and enchanters can alter what they seem to be and would not want to appear as an enchanter on a player list. With that said I do have some commentary on your description of the professions you mentioned.
<br><br>
Enchanters might be underplayed yes, but mostly due to lack of knowing what they can do. Enchanters are quite formidable (devastating to say the least) when in a group with other players, and can definitely survive alone for some time. The role I often see overlooked for the enchanter is one of a travelling lore master or trades person. Since the enchanter can alter the reactions of those around him to favorable, he can travel basically anywhere in the world to do as he pleases. He would be an excellent companion to an assassin or band of outlaws, or as an addition to any group such as dark elves that are normally hunted by good. This also works when a group of good players wanted to travel through a highly hostile area to accomplish a task.
<br><br>
Enchanters can also use this to excel at trade skills by travelling to remote areas sooner than many other professions to gather the materials to make items to sell. Of course once they make this item, if one day they can magically enchant it, then they will truly be the masters of merchant skills. Lastly know that the enchanters are also unusually difficult to play at the moment because they have the greatest number of broken spells of all spell-casters. These spells will be fixed soon.
<br><br>
The Norrathian Rogue is the true jack of trades. The designers created a vast black market structure, which supports the lifestyles of rogues and fosters trade of illegal goods. These areas in the game make you feel like a rogue, not to mention that the people who don't like rogues will never let you forget you are one. Thievery is the least of his skills, as he is much more useful in combat and in dungeons. Picking locks is very nice to have later in your career, and not enough can be said about the power of backstab. Also, once they are implemented, poisons will be used almost exclusively by rogues, making them unmatched at sudden attack and lethal tactics. I feel that rogues will be a sleeper profession for a while longer, till more players see that rogues are rolling in money at higher levels, providing needed gold to the other professions that still need spells and armor at higher levels. The irony of this is perfect, putting the rogue in a position of generosity while Paladins are hurting for gold to afford that plate armor and spells. This is when the rogue reminds the Paladin of all those bad things he said a year ago about rogues… Bottom line is I think the rogue can be all things you wanted them to be.
<br><br>
About clerics, first let me say that I think you have confused the Cleric with a Holy Warrior, much like the Paladin is. Historically Clerics used "blunt" weapons only as a symbol of certain Judiciary status, much like the Hammer of Justice or a Staff of Wisdom might be seen. They were not often used as weapons, but simply as an ornament of battle field garb. Clerics were strictly healers who blessed the troops before war and healed the wounded. Where you are correct is that when pressed for his life, a cleric would be more opt to use a knife or anything deadly nearby to defend himself. However in a video game like this you have to have rules set in stone, or hardly anyone would pay attention to historical fact. I see the Cleric you describe much more in a Paladin's role or that of a Druid or Ranger. 
<br><br>
Bards yes, singing rogues they are not. Bards are invaluable to group tactics at higher levels, and even at lower levels will never be short of friends who want him to travel with them and play songs. If anyone has a hard time meeting up with other players, they might consider playing the people-magnet; a bard.
<br><br>
In closing, there are no "broken" professions and all have roles in Norrath worth playing. Some are much more difficult than others, and some might not suit your play style.  Test each profession out for a few levels and ask questions of those higher levels than yourself. Find what appeals to you best and play it, and play it well. This game is not easy, and the challenge will be more rewarding if you play what you enjoy best, rather than what other people suggest is the best.
