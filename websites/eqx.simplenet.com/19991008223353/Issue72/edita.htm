I'm hiding in my mother's dining room.  I'm supposed to be keeping my eyes on her since she is recovering from bypass surgery, but I can't take it in there anymore.  It's not mom, it's daytime television!  I actually watched an entire scene from some soap opera where Jamie Farr (you know, Clinger from MASH) played a guardian angel for some young woman.  His character's name was Ernie.  He was sent to watch over her when the angel of death, Bert, failed to reach her in time and she survived when she shouldn't have in some previous episode.  The dialogue was, well, crap.  The situation was a complete joke.  The whole thing hurt me so badly that I had to leave the room.  I don't think mom liked it much when I left, commenting that a twelve year old could write a better script.

Thank goodness that my little brother left his laptop behind for me to play with.  After an hour of tying to get the floppy drive to read (solved by a two minute phone call to my brother) I am now, for the first time all week, working on EQX.  But I haven't played all week, I've obviously been distracted.  I've only been able to poke my head into the newsgroups and fan sites a few times.  I haven't read half my e-mail, and the half that I did read I only skimmed.  So I'm feeling a bit detached from the game.  That makes it hard to write an editorial.
<br><br>
So let me talk about something that's been bugging me for a while.  Actually, it's been bothering Oghma more than me, since I send him a lot of our reader submissions to edit (I'm pretty lazy).  The most common response that I get from him about a 'story' is that it's too short.  Usually he also uses the words 'character bio' and 'good, but'.
<br><br>
I think it was Aklar, before she joined the staff here at EQX, that sent me a great long story with a note in her e-mail saying, essentially, that she figured it was too long for EQX...
<br><br>
Ack!
<br><br>
I also remember that the story in question was the first and second parts of the great <a href="../credits/aklar.htm">Druid's Duty</a> series.  How much of a loss to EQX would it have been if she never sent it in because she thought we only wanted short stuff?  I shudder to think of it.
<br><br>
It seems that she isn't the only one that thought this way.  We get a lot of submissions that are, basically, short character biographies.  Some of them, heck, a lot of them, seem like they could have been great stories.  But they are just one page long.  You know the kind of thing, a description of the character, a description of his life before his introduction to the guild, and a short description of what he did during his time there, setting him up to start his adventures in Norrath.  Some of them brilliantly written.  But they just are not tales.  Not enough is there.  I can't count the number of times I've sent a reply mail to someone telling them that they have a great start for a great tale, and that I would love to see them write more and then send it back.  I rarely hear back from them.  And that's a shame.  And a more and more frequently I just don't respond at all...
<br><br>
The same thing happens when someone sends us the 'first part' of a story, promising to send us more if we'll print the first part.  But the first part, as well written as many are, is only one page long.  In that one page the story starts, sometimes even promising something very entertaining to come.  And all too often the rest of the story never follows.  So we lose a lot of great potential stories.  Too many times have I printed a "to be continued..." story that never was continued.  I won't do that anymore.  So if you're going to send us a story, send it complete.
<br><br>
The same thing happens with articles.  Many of you have some very strong and interesting opinions that you want to express in article for EQX.  But far too many of them come in incomplete.  The ideas are there, and the desire to express the point is there.  But it's not fleshed out.  It's not enough to just tell us that you want a change in EverQuest, or that you like some aspect a lot.  Please, please, please, take the time to go into details.  Expand on the points, anticipate what opponents to your ideas might say, and counter those argument.  Go into detail.
<br><br>
Now don't get me wrong.  I don't think that the only good story is a long story.  Articles don't have to be thousands of words long to be worth printing.  Exactly the opposite.  A concise article is the best kind.  I'm talking about short <b>and</b> incomplete submissions.  And I wanted to point out that we <b>love</b> long tales.  I hope that others out there are not under the same impression that Aklar was.  Please make your character biographies into actual stories.
<br><br>
Well, I think that's it for this week.  I'm getting frustrated hitting the wrong keys all the time on this stupid (but very welcome) laptop.  I just can't get used to the shrunken keyboard and misplaced keys.  And thanks to anyone that has taken the time to send us something for print.  We really do appreciate it.  I'm not trying to dissuade you.  Just the opposite.  I know how discouraging it can be when we don't print something for a reader.  I would like to accept everything sent in.  And by writing this I am hoping to make it so that more of what our readers send sees print, and so that I don't have to write as many 'too short, please expand on points A and B' letters...
