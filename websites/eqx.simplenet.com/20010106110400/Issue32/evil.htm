An interesting question was asked on the Avault newsgroup Forum.Everquest.  Essentially, it pondered how to create an evil character who doesn't just run around arbitrarily killing people, but who instead is a force to be reckoned with… the kind of figure who inspires fear and disgust.
<br><br>
Well, I tend to think on the scale of good old fashioned cartoonish super-villainy.
<br><br>
Law Enforcement have a term for it: MOM.
<br><br>
No, I'm not saying your mom is evil (This is to be judged on a case by case basis).  I speak instead of Motive - Opportunity - and Method.
<br><br>
First, Motive:
<br><br>
As an evil character, what are my goals?  Am I here to simply see to it that dwarves are banned from the city limits?  Do I want gold?  Magic?  Power?  Babes with big, shiny, breathtaking…um… swords.  It's always important to keep striving.  For what is Evil without a goal?  (Yep, that's right:  An incumbent politician.  And we have too many of those in real life!)
<br><br>
Sure, you can do things just to be evil, you can run over the puppy with your wagon for no reason, but truly big evil needs scope and direction!  I want to conquer this town and subsequently the countryside.  Maybe I just want to make some political noise and be known by the king.  Maybe I want the town treasury.  I'm always after their lucky charms.
<br><br>
Second, Opportunity:
<br><br>
I love a parade.  But what better time to perform a noteworthy and memorable act of horror than when there are so many to witness it?  An assassination, poison in the free kegs of ale, even a dastardly counter-parade of your own (Like Illinois Nazis... I know: We all hate Illinois Nazis).
<br><br>
Being evil is about taking center stage at some time, either to be acknowledged and reviled, or to be patted on the back by your Gods.  So plan a big happening.  Serve plenty of devil's food cake and black bottom ale.  But most importantly, reach for something harder than what's immediately in front of you.  Simple, old-fashioned Back-stabbing impresses few these days.
<br><br>
Third, Method:
<br><br>
Consider the way that all great terrors have acted throughout history.  The Mafia essentially controls the flow of commerce through intimidation.  Beating on shopkeepers, skimming their profits, etc.  Communists were there to convince you that everything should be shared equally, but governed by them-politics in other words.  The Joker simply finds tricky ways of being more fiendish than last go round, his insanity pushing him to do something more wicked than he's attempted before.  Boris and Natasha plant a bomb at the big college football game for Whatsamatta-U, just to cause big trouble for Moose and Squirrel specifically.
<br><br>
But, all of the important literary allusions aside, what role-playing villainy is about is being nastier than the next guy is.  It's the important counter-point to heroism (Heroes typically not competing for attention if they are heroes by the classical definition).
<br><br>
So keep in mind that inside every petty thief there is an explosive potential for mayhem.  BE the guy who leads the Gnoll army into town.  Anyone can smack a few players around, not everyone can do it with purpose and conviction befitting a corrupt and blackened soul.
