This week an incident occurred that had the local gnolls puzzled.  Apparently the morning began like any other, with the locals mixing it up with the trespassing adventurers when suddenly all the adventurers took on a strange demeanor.
<br><br>
Gnoll spokesman Ergl Mudfoot described it as "Zombie like".
<br><br>
"They all began to ignore our attacks and wandered across the plains like we weren't even there," said Mudfoot. "We didn't know what to do.  It was a little spooky.  We found a cure though."
<br><br>
Indeed, Mudfoot and gang proceeded to slay the strange wandering adventurers.
<br><br>
Rumors again blame the mysterious and mythical magic known as "Lag".  The Wizards guild of Qeynos claims that lag has been around as long as the world and seems to fluctuate with the number of people who exist on the world at one time.
<br><br>
Reached for comment, the Temple of Life, who claim to be liaison to the gods themselves, say that the gods deny the existence of any such thing as lag.
