Ohaobol, deciding his rest time was over, picked up his poor attempt at setting a camp and continued on with his journey through the Feerrott. His sense of direction was very poor, so his progress was slow, walking around in circles a lot, and using the same rock as a landmark. This didn't stop him from trying to find a way out of the thick vegetation.
<br><br>
"Hrmmm. Ohaobol think he seen this rock too many times. Me must backtrack." Ohaobol muttered to himself, a little perturbed about his lack of direction.
<br><br>
He finally found a different landmark, not that it would do him much good, but now he could at least travel between the rock and the river hoping to find a new path. After doing this for a good portion of the day he made a decision. A poor one, but a decision by an ogre is usually a poor one.
<br><br>
"Me know. Me swim across river to other side. Me find way out of Feerrott there." Ohaobol said to himself with determination.
<br><br>
Tightening the straps on his packs and making sure his weapons were secured; he jumped into the river feet first. The water was mucky, and the visibility was very poor. Ohaobol wasn't the best swimmer, but as a child his mother used to force him to bathe once a week, so he had picked up the basics. A few feet into the river Ohaobol felt a piercing pain in his right leg. He kicked out and connected with something solid. What, he didn't know, but he knew it was hungry for him.
<br><br>
Unstrapping one of his swords he tried to swim in a tight circle so as to be able to see his attacker. To his surprise it was quite a large fish. He didn't know fish liked to eat ogres, but he knew now. He swung his sword, which was quite a task when surrounded by water, but the fish quickly darted out of his way and then back in biting him once again. Ohaobol became overwhelmed with fury and starting slashing and kicking, praying silently to himself that his sword would filet the fish.
<br><br>

Almost out of breath, he surfaced quickly gasping up big gulps of air, and then dove back into the murky depths to finish smashing the fish. A few more swipes and he finally connected, nearly obliterating the fish with his blade. The murky water now had a blood red tint to it, but Ohaobol decided he liked the red coloring. 
<br><br>
Soon after finishing off the ogre eating fish, he reached the other side of the river, or at least he thought he had. He couldn't tell if he had swam to the other side of the river, or was back where he had jumped in, but he decided to take a look around on this side anyhow. He began to roam around hoping he didn't run into that rock again.
<br><br>
Completely lost, he stopped for a brief rest. He began to really doubt his decision to leave Oggok. Fear of the unknown was slowly taking away his earlier brave demeanor. The damp clothes he was wearing didn't help much either, especially since they smelled really bad now.
<br><br>
"Me must find way out of Feerrott soon. Me no want to be out here at night all alone." Ohaobol tried to reassure himself that he must continue his journey.
<br><br>
After catching his breath, he continued to march slowly through the Feerrott. His head started to hang low, from exhaustion, and from loss of confidence. Another mistake on his part, because he walked right into a large group of undead, and they didn't like the sight of the ogre all too well.
<br><br>
A club smashed against Ohaobol's left side, sending him flying backwards. Caught completely off guard, he didn't even see it coming. The depression he was starting to suffer from quickly subsided into a fit of rage. His anger rose to levels that were dangerous, especially for an ogre. Blinded by this state of mind, he turned towards the direction the club had hit him. In front of him, three skeletons stood grinning demonically at him. He should have felt fear, but he was so angry he only felt hatred.
<br><br>

"You hurt Ohaobol, and now you die!" Ohaobol grunted as he hoisted his sword into the air.
<br><br>
The skeletons were unfazed by this and started to move in towards him. Their eyes glowed an evil shade of green, and their bones made a horrific noise as they positioned themselves in battle stances. Ohaobol took a deep breath and lunged towards the skeletons, fighting like he had never fought before.
<br><br>
Fear was not a word in the skeleton's vocabulary though, if anything they were quite pleased that the ogre was stupid enough not to run from them. For being dead, their speed was incredible, slashing, bashing and clawing at the ogre at a fierce rate. Ohaobol remained in a battle frenzy though; the minor wounds they were inflicting on him didn't stop his attack. In fact, it may have increased his combat abilities, his sword swinging with a power he didn't know he held.
<br><br>
One of the skeletons made a wrong move and was crushed into dust by Ohaobol. The other two didn't seem to notice or care, and kept trying to steal the life away from the large ogre. Another fell soon after the first, making nearly the same mistake, and paying for it dearly. With only one left, Ohaobol paused to tighten his grip on his weapon.
<br><br>
"You die too. You die now! Ohaobol crush puny skeleton!" Ohaobol yelled ferociously, swinging his sword with all of his might.
<br><br>
The skeleton's reaction time was too slow and it was cut in half by the massive blade the ogre was wielding. It's bones falling in a state of disarray at Ohaobol's feet. The glowing in the eye sockets slowly faded to darkness. Ohaobol breathed a sigh of relief, not quite knowing how he survived that battle. He shoved the tip of his sword into the ground and rested his weight on it, nearly spent from the fracas. 
<br><br>
Before he could draw in two breaths he was once again attacked from behind. The pain from the blow was tremendous and nearly caused him to double over. Fear of death quickly overcame the pain, and he twisted around to face his assailant. Before him stood a rotting carcass, a permanent grin etched on its face. The sight nearly caused Ohaobol to faint with fear. He had heard stories of such creatures and had hoped to never meet one face to face.
<br><br>

"You stink…You hit Ohaobol from behind and hurt him. Me no like you. Smash you!" Ohaobol tried to hide the fear in his voice with humor, holding his nose with one finger to illustrate the terrible stench of the zombie.
<br><br>
With no humor apparent in the zombie's glare, it swung its decaying fist at Ohaobol. Dodging quickly, Ohaobol took a swing back at the zombie, cutting away some of the rotting flesh. The zombie didn't seem to notice, or care that it had lost more of its body, and continued to swing at Ohaobol. Starting to become fatigued from battle, Ohaobol's sword swings slowed, and his upper body began to tingle with exertion. His only hope was to finish this quickly; or else he would be a feast for the zombie soon.
<br><br>
Clawing at Ohaobol the zombie made a fatal error, leaving his neck completely open to Ohaobol's steel. Ohaobol took advantage of this opportunity and swung with all the might he had left in his arms, beheading the vile beast. As the head rolled off and fell to the ground, Ohaobol fell to his knees, too weary to move. Gasping for air, the last thing he saw was the mossy ground before his head hit it.
<br><br>
About fifteen minutes had passed when Ohaobol finally awoke. Bloodied and beaten, he looked around hoping that the battle was over. He did not know that he had passed out, and didn't even remember fighting the zombie. If it weren't for the carcass next to him, he probably wouldn't have ever remembered. He pushed himself up off of the ground and looked for a place to rest that would be relatively safe, which none existed. 
<br><br>
He kept searching though, hoping that someplace would come along that looked inviting, but instead he found something worse. Stopping abruptly, he took a deep breath and held it. Before him, not twenty yards away, an undead army was camped. The battle he just fought must have been with a small party of scouts from the army that was before him, and realizing this, he knew he was lucky to be alive.
<br><br>
As silent as he possibly could be, he turned and began to flee in the opposite direction, hoping that the undead wouldn't hear him. He ran and ran, not looking back for fear that the skeletons and zombies would be right at his heels. His head pounded each time his feet would hit the ground, and his vision began to blur. Just when he thought he could run no more, a small pass appeared before him. He quickly maneuvered into it and paused for a breath. 
<br><br>
After resting for a brief moment, he pushed his way through the pass, which led him into a bigger mess. Innothule swamp opened up before him, and he knew he had finally found his way out of the Feerrott, but he wasn't so sure he wanted to be here. Horror stories stuck in his mind from his childhood about the Frogloks and Kobolds that inhabited this swamp. There wasn't really an option though; it was the undead, or the swamp. It was an easy decision for him to make.
