	In all the commotion the crowd didn't hear the dark elf's plea which was probably a good thing. The mob would quickly have persecuted anyone affiliated with the two dark ones without questioning at all. Oghma seemed to be quickly plotting a way to free his dark elf acquaintance, even though it seemed futile. Elaan, having a severe hatred for dark elves, was cheering the crowd on, bashing his sword to his shield. Banner had quickly found a place to hide, not wanting to be the next one on the spit going to the fire. Amlaith stood quiet, watching the folly before him, looking quite disinterested. Mundas, cheery as always, was digging through his many pockets looking for some device to end this nonsense.
<br><br>
	The fire was burning as bright as the sun at midday, and was surely ready to consume these two evil ones. The faces of the townspeople were all illuminating a triumphant aura because of their capture of the murderous dark elves, and nothing was going to stop their victory celebration. Oghma's face was twisted with a frown, and was still pondering some sort of plan to remedy this problem. Muttering to himself nonsensically Mundas had poured his entire collection of odd objects onto the ground and was on his knees digging through them.
<br><br>
	In the commotion, Amlaith had slipped into the nearby group of trees and was looking around frantically, sensing something very awry in the atmosphere. His keen eyes were searching the dusk filled land, searching for what his instincts had told him of. He secretly was hoping that they were lying to him on this occasion. If they weren't, the angry mob was going to become a fearful one very soon.
<br><br>
	"Found it!" Mundas exclaimed, looking quite proud of himself. "Remind me to organize my belongings a little better Oghma, I seem to misplace them way too often."
<br><br>
	Oghma, his concentration broke by Mundas' exclamation, looked over to the jovial Mundas and became more puzzled about this situation than before. There before him stood a gnome, dressed in the most gaudy colors possible, wearing a big grin on his face holding what appeared to be a twig from some unknown tree. He quickly shook his head at Mundas, wondering what kind of mischief the little object held.
<br><br>
	"If I may ask Mundas, what will a tiny twig do to stop an angry crowd from cooking Zasstryn alive?" Oghma questioned in a tone most would find degrading.
<br><br>
	Mundas' grin slipped a little, but being the happy gnome he was it returned to full and he quickly started to explain. "It is a little invention I made on accident once. It is quite a nifty little twig! I like to call it my Miniature Staff of Illusions. I just have to say the word to make it work and POOF I can make whatever I want appear out of thin air!" 
<br><br>
	The skepticism in Oghma's eyes said a million words, but he dared not say a word knowing that Mundas had gotten them out of binds with his odd toys more than once. He waved his hand as if telling Mundas to go ahead and try it, and made sure to step out of the way, having experienced some of the backfires of the inventions in the past.
<br><br>
	"Now what was that word again…err….Exmorta Vivo…. err, no um….hrmmm…." Mundas' voice trailed off while his mind tried to recall the power words, his free hand scratching his chin.
<br><br>
	Elaan had become lost in the crowd, overzealous in his need to see the dark ones persecuted. His companions had disappeared out of his sight and he started to panic, wondering what happened to them. His eyes quickly started to dart around amongst the crowd searching for one of their faces, hoping he could reunite with them so as to make sure that they were safe. He would hate himself if something were to happen to one of them. That is when he saw the group of dark elves emerge from a small wooded area to the north of the village. He took one last look around for his friends, and knew he was going to have to stop the dark elf war party himself.
<br><br>
	In the meantime, Amlaith had realized that the dark elves had returned also, and was running full speed towards Oghma and Mundas, hoping to reach them before the dark elves did. Secretly knowing that if anything happened to them, he would hold himself responsible for leaving their side. It occurred to him that Banner had fled, but it was of little concern to him right now, he had a lot of faith in the big cat's decisions. The cat would be there if they were in need.
<br><br>
	This entire time Zasstryn had been trying to communicate with the other dark elf hoping to figure a way out of the mess they had gotten themselves into. He would be damned if some common villagers would be the ones to take his life, after all the close calls and battles he had had in his life, he wasn't going to be killed by farmers. The other dark elf seemed to be lost in concentration, from his appearance he seemed to be a mage of some sorts, probably a necromancer from the look of death in his eyes.
<br><br>
	"This is the last time I listen to one of your evil schemes Beldro, it always seems to end up with us in a world of trouble!" Zasstryn whispered frantically.
<br><br>
	"No need to worry Zass, I have an idea that may save us yet, but I first must get one of my hands free so I can cast." Beldro stated in a mild manner, too mild for the situation they were in.
<br><br>
	"And how are you going to get your hands free to cast anything? We are bound so tight I can't even feel my fingers any longer!" Zasstryn exclaims.
<br><br>
	"Just trust me on this one Zass. Remember, I am more resourceful than I look and you should pay attention and learn some of my tactics, it may do you some good." Beldro's voice rings in a condescending tone.
<br><br>
	Zasstryn begins to mumble to himself, angry with Beldro's statement. He turns his attention towards the fire that is starting to come into view. Panic quickly begins to grab him, and he turns his head back to watch Beldro work his wonders, hoping secretly that they will work. Hoping that he can be freed so he can take out some of his anger on these commoners, human trash in his eyes. While he is plotting his revenge, Beldro is quick at work trying to free himself of his bindings. The villagers had stripped them of all their weapons that were visible, but forgot to check the inner pockets of Beldro's robe, where he had a tiny dagger hidden for emergencies such as this.
<br><br>
	Elaan was becoming frantic, his friends were no where in sight and he knew that trying to distract this invading group of dark elves could very well mean the end of his life. He had to do it though; it was part of the way he thought. His motto had always been, "Sacrificing yourself to give your friends a chance is the most noble way to die." He only hoped that the distraction would buy enough time for the rest to prepare for the onslaught that was coming towards them. He takes one last glance around the crowd in hopes of seeing at least one of them, but to no avail they are all still hidden from his sight. 
<br><br>
	"Erollisi please give me the strength and courage to overcome these adversaries, allow me to give my friends a chance to survive." Elaan whispers a prayer to himself, then turns towards the dark elves and lets loose a battle cry that made the raging mob sound quiet.
<br><br>
	On the other side of the crowd Amlaith had finally reached Oghma and Mundas. Nearly out of breath from sprinting, his usual short sentences were even shorter. "Dark Elves….whole party…north of village…" He panted nearly winded.
<br><br>
	Oghma's eyes were nearly hidden from view as his brow furrowed distressed with the news. Mundas didn't even pay Amlaith any attention, still deep in thought trying to remember the power words to make his toy work. "Banner…missing…not sure where he is…" Amlaith continued still out of breath. 
<br><br>
	"Great, no Banner, Elaan is missing and Mundas is forgetful, and we have a war party of dark elves on top of us! What else can go wrong?" Oghma said with frustration, very unlike his usual calm self.
<br><br>
	Beldro had finally loosened the dagger and was proceeding to cut the rope that bound him to the spit. He only needed one hand to cast, and that would be free in a few more cuts. Zass had closed his eyes and was silently praying to himself, praying that this would not be his end. Beldro's eyes rolled back in concentration, preparing to cast a spell, one that would hopefully give them enough time to escape.
<br><br>
	At the exact same moment Elaan had reached the invading Dark Elves, preparing to engage them in battle. His sword held high, inviting them to attack him, inviting them to taste his steel. He could tell that this was his death, before he even raised his sword, they were just too many, and from the looks of them, very experienced in combat.
<br><br>
	"I remember it! I remember now! Here we go…Exortic Venia!" Mundas states with authority in his voice.
