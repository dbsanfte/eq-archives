"Ohaobol leave Oggok now. He bored of nothing to smash." Ohaobol told Guntrik, his guildmaster. 
<br><br>
"Me think you need more training Ohaobol. You good warrior, but not good nuff to leave brudders yet." Guntrik quickly replied.
<br><br>
Ohaobol scratched his head. He looked like he was deep in thought, but merely had forgotten what his reasoning was for wanting to leave Oggok. He sat down near Guntrik and started to concentrate on why he wanted to leave.
<br><br>
"Feerrott bad place for young warrior like you. You need to bash with us more still. You leave, you eat the dirt. Guntrik promise you." The guildmaster calmly stated.
<br><br>
This sparked the fire in Ohaobol once again. He never liked being under estimated. In fact, he hated it more than anything else. He could smash things just as good as any other ogre, and he was going to prove it. Ohaobol wasn't quite sure how yet, but he would do it.
<br><br>
"Ohaobol leaving Oggok now. Me journey far away. Bring back trophy to prove me good warrior. Guntrik no stop Ohaobol from leaving. Have to smash me to keep me from leaving." Ohaobol spoke in a tone not usually taken with the famed Guntrik.
<br><br>
Guntrik, slightly amazed at the young Ohaobol's passion, and a little angry at his tone of voice shifted his weight from one foot to the other. He stood quiet for a long time trying to think of something smart to say. Not thinking of anything, he looked to Ohaobol with great empathy in his eyes.
<br><br>
"You go Ohaobol. Bring trophy to Guntrik. Make Oggok proud of its warriors. Leave now. Guntrik must think." Guntrik stated with authority, trying to hide the doubt in his voice.
<br><br>
A grin from ear to ear jumped onto Ohaobol's homely face. He didn't expect it to be this easy. It took him weeks to convince Guntrik to let him go out with the Lizard bashing parties that protected Oggok's border. Never in his life did he hope to make it out this easy.
<br><br>
"Ohaobol leave now. Ohaobol thank Guntrik. Me will come back with great trophy. Ohaobol will be great warrior, he promises." Ohaobol stated with pride.
<br><br>
Guntrik waved Ohaobol out of the arena. Trying to hide the fear in his eyes, considering that very few ogres of Ohaobol's skill level had ever returned to Oggok when they left. The dangers were great, and he knew it. Little he could do though when one is not happy in Oggok. 
<br><br>
Ohaobol bows before Guntrik. Mumbles something under his breath and quickly leaves the arena. He had a lot of packing to do before dawn. He knew he would get little sleep on this eve.
<br><br>
The next morning Ohaobol left Oggok. He had gathered all of his meager possessions and was on his way to the Feerrott. He hadn't a clue where he was going to go from there, but it was a start.

<br><br>
<b>The Feerrott</b>
<br><br>
The vegetation in the Feerrott is thick, making it dark and dreary. With the rolling hills and huge trees, ambushes were easily set. Ohaobol knew this, having dealt with lizardmen before, and knew that it was going to be dangerous. He was singing a song though, trying to keep his spirits up. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
Ohaobol's song -
<br><br>
"Smash em up an make em bleed<br>
Squish de lizard's good<br>
Hungry lil' ogre mouths to feed<br>
Kill de lizard's brood<br>
Smash em high an  kick em low<br>
Crush dere scaly head's in<br>
Swing de killing blow<br>
An squash em again an again<br>
Ogre warrior's never fail<br>
To smash de lizards good!"
<br><br>
Ohaobol continued singing happily for the early part of his journey, oblivious to the life crawling in the darkness around him. Not a good way to journey through the Feerrott considering the risks involved. Death lurked around nearly every corner.
<br><br>
Just ahead in the distance Ohaobol noticed a strange sight. A formation of stones carved intricately. Runes adorned the smooth stone surface. 
<br><br>
"Purty rocks." Ohaobol said with glee. "Ohaobol rest here. Stones make him feel warm inside."
<br><br>

<br><br>
Nearby in the darkness, a lizardman had been foraging for food until Ohaobol had made so much noise looking at the rocks. Lizardmen are known to be very short tempered, especially with ogres. Upset that the ugly ogre had interrupted his search for food, the lizardman attacked in a fit of rage.
<br><br>
"Ogre'ssss don't belong in the Feerrott. You shall die for your crimessss against my race!" The lizardman hissed vehemently.
<br><br>
Jumping on Ohaobol and tearing at him with his claws, the lizardman appeared to have the upper hand. Ohaobol was slow getting to his feet, taken completely by surprise. His warrior instincts quickly took over though, and he began kicking and swinging his sword at a fervent pace.
<br><br>
"Lizard eat Ohaobol's steel. Ohaobol smash! Ohaobol kick! Ohaobol squish li'l lizard!" Ohaobol yelled his battle cry, screaming it repeatedly while flailing his weapon about wildly.
<br><br>
Both combatants received some wounds. Ohaobol quickly turned the battle to his advantage though landing a critical blow to the lizardman. Knowing the battle was lost the lizardman started to retreat, but Ohaobol chased after him, slashing at the lizard's back.
<br><br>
"Ohaobol kill mean lizard! You die by Ohaobol!" Ohaobol said with a tone of victory in his voice.
<br><br>
The deathblow hit the lizardman hard, sending him to the mossy ground. The lizardman's eyes stared up at Ohaobol with rage.
<br><br>
"My tribe will avenge my death…The Feerrott will be ours…." The lizardman hissed with his dying breath.
<br><br>
Trying to hold back his laughter at the idle threat, Ohaobol knelt down and took the lizardman's pack. He rummaged through it and found a few silvers, enough to purchase rations if he happened to run out. He then spit on the corpse and decided that this wasn't the best place to rest.
<br><br>
"Guntrik right. Feerrott dangerous." Ohaobol muttered to himself.
