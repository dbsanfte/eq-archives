(By Keafa mother of two and wife to a geek)
<br><br>
Many have asked the question, "how do I get my woman involved in the games I love?"  Razor has written a few good articles like <a href="../Issue20/wife.htm">How to Geektify Your Wife 101</a> and <a href="../Issue42/hail.htm">"Hail Razor, Our Geek Master!"</a>.  Now I think it is time for a woman to add her two cents on how to get the female involved with the vast world of online games *grin*.
<br><br>
	My fist experience with 'mens' games was back in high school.  The dweeb that I was dating then spent more time playing paper RPG's then he did with me.  Of course just like any woman this was rather upsetting.  One day I asked him if I could come over and play with him.  Naturally he was amused and scared at the same time.   When I got there he had everything set up for me, including an unopened tube of dice.  This was the key factor for getting me interested.  When I asked, he got me involved, if your woman asks and you say "there is too much blood and guts for you" you will be sleeping in the dog house, after you find your computer in 1,000 pieces.
<br><br>
	Diablo, was my first online game, I was 8 months pregnant and stuck on my back with no energy and very very grumpy.  Our computer is in our bedroom, and I would just sit there and watch my husband Ian Ash laugh wickedly at the game.   I would sit by him and watch him slice and dice the pit-beasts and lava things…  Until one day the phone rang.  It was a call he had to take, but since he was with a group of people he did not want to leave the game.  He jumped out of the chair and said "don't let me die" and left the room.   ACK!  I was scared!  He had been playing this character for weeks and left him in my hands with no direction.  I decided to follow the group he was with so I would not get lost (like I was not lost to begin with).  
<br><br>
	It took me about ten minutes to get the hang of things (like how to swing my/his sword).  I soon felt this power come over me as I slew my first victim and the next and the next.  By the time my husband was off the phone (an hour had past) I was traveling on my own though the mists of Diablo's caverns, slaying everything in site.  My husband did not get the computer back for the rest of the night and had to fight me for it the next day.
<br><br>
	That, I would say, is the second thing.  Once you have let your woman know about your online life and involved her to a point after she has shown interest, give her your character, one that she knows you have put time into.  Make sure she has seen you play this character.  Find a way where you can be with a group (that is not foul mouthed) and have a situation come up in real life where you have to leave the computer, give her instructions on basic game play and tell her you TRUST her, smile and step away.  DO NOT get mad if she kills your character, this will only end up with you getting into trouble and her not wanting to touch the computer again.  If your character dies, simply say "heh I have made that mistake before" and make up a situation similar that happened to you, even if it didn't.  Let her know you are equal.  And most importantly do not 'crowd' her.
<br><br>
	Every woman is different, but most share the same interests, curiosity to try new things.  If your woman is they type who is scared of the computer, use this as a tool to lure her in and bring you closer.  Take her out on a date, find out what she likes and wants.  After the date come home and surf the web for those things.  Read about them, and the next time she comes to your house or into the computer room, depending on living arrangements, tell her "look what I found on …" and be excited.  That will make her happy to see that you care, and that will help make her interested in the computer at the same time.
<br><br>
	This type of woman will take longer to convert to the online life, and gaming, but it will be well worth your time.  Always keep a positive attitude and do not push her, so much, but involve her through her interests.
<br><br>
	<b>Myth:</b> Women do not like blood and guts.
	<br><br>
	<b>Fact:</b> PMS, beware! A good way for woman to 'vent' is to dissect something.  To be given power to rule the universe and blow away things.  Even the most caring person will find joy in destroying something.  For some Quake would be great, where they can go in with a gun and blow things up.  With others it is more complex, where games such as paper RPG's or EverQuest come in.  This is a more peaceful way for women like myself like to vent.  You create an imaginary person, give them a quest to seek out and destroy evil for sake of good.
<br><br>
	In RPG's you have romance, good vs evil and power!  In my opinion, I feel that EverQuest would be a good place to start a woman in online games.  They can create their 'princess' character and search out evil in their homeland, gain power and be happy.   
<br><br>
There is one drawback however, for you guys out there.  You will loose your computer to her, unless, you have the cash to buy her a new computer.  Yes buy <b>her</b> the new computer.  Just like you she will want the power computer and unless you want a fight you will give the new one to her.  Once both of you have a computer, things will unfold happily.  You will be spending all day on the computer, and she will be spending all day interacting with you, thus you will both be happy.
