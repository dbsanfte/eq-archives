   Daryth moved fast, and Kinory tested her limits as she struggled to keep up.  She never once saw him again after that one glimpse by Kelethin, but she didn't give up.  She tracked him through the forest, through the mountain pass that led into the Dwarven lands, and past the great city of the Dwarven folk.   She gaped up at the mighty gates of Kaladin, and wished she could go in, but Daryth's trail never wavered.  She followed him for two weeks, and barely avoided death any number of times.  The plants were different, the animals were different.  The trees themselves were unfamiliar and sparse.  Once she passed the corpse of a lion, and recognized the subtle signs of poison.  Daryth had surely killed it.

<p style="text-align: justify">We’ve all been told for the past several years that online gaming is the future of gaming.  We are gradually seeing game enhancements being added due to technological improvements, such as 3-D worlds, and gaming with voice.  As more programs are written with these newer improvements (such as the PIII chips and 3d accelerator innovations) and the bandwidth problems get addressed, we will see further enhancements to the games themselves.  Highly detailed worlds, more sophisticated AI, and more complex interactivity will make games more and more &quot;real&quot;.</P>

	"I have it!" Hargor's excitement could be felt throughout the room.  His apprentices all glanced at him unobtrusively, they all knew what would happen if any of them showed the slightest sign that they had heard.  The man was brilliant, but a tyrant.  As one, they quickly returned to their studies when Hargor swept the room with his gaze.  They all breathed a sigh of relief, again as one, when he stormed out, up the tower steps, and into his work room, slamming the door with a resounding thud.    A few seconds later the door opened and he bellowed for Lysinda to the top.  The students knew then that it was nothing to fear for Lysinda was the youngest and therefor was the one chosen for menial tasks, message running, component collections and so forth.  As she rose to climb the steps to her Master her fellow apprentices smiled in encouragement.

Time and again we have all heard that familiar refrain. "You can't tell me how to play this game!" A sentiment that is, at the core, completely correct. It is not our place as role players to tell someone they are wrong in how they approach a role playing game. In fact, some of my favorite role playing experiences have come about when someone simply decided 'join in'. In the parlance of role players every where, these are the people who finally get it. And it is a wonderful thing to see. Yet why is it that frequently the most vocal about screaming "don't tread on me" have no problem with the conundrum of telling me to stop playing my way?

Sigh…
<br><br>
A role-playing switch?  Alright, I'm baffled.  I thought all servers were role-playing servers?  I thought that we all role-played differently, and a definition of role-playing didn't exist?  And now we will have the ability to flip a switch and proudly announce to the world that we are role-playing, and role-playing correctly, in case you hadn't noticed.  While I'm all in favor of adding role-playing tools, this role-playing switch is no such thing.

Hail all al EQX!
<br><br>
	I have a question about this permanent hit point loss referred to in <a href="../Issue76/death.htm">Onyx'
article</a> in issue 76. What is this all about? Please inform me, as I need all
the hit points I can get and I often throw my self into ludicrous situations
for no reason other than to see if I will live. Thanks for all your help.
