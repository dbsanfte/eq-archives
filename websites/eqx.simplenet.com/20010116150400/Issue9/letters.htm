<em>Response to Jaga's article <a href="../Issue8/ultima.htm">Ultima Chronicles</a> in Issue 8:</em>
<br><br>
Just about everyobdy in UO and those in the EQ message forums seem to have
a preformed idea stuck in there heads (ie The Ultima Chronicles:The Speed
Dilemma) that pkillers do not role play.  I would like to submit an acticle
for your publication from a pkillers point of view, explaining how we (or
at least I) "role play" the evil ruthless bastard of Thumper.  Of course I
don't have it written yet, I'd hate to waste the time not knowing if you
would be willing to review it as a possible article.  Thanks for you time.

"Now that the smokes gone and the air is all clear,<br>
Those left standing had a new kind of fear.<br>
They would fight, and they'd be right,<br>
But we are just too strong"<br><br><br>

<em>[Ed.] I would like to tell you all what I told Thumper.  Please, send us your comments or articles.
I can't promise to use them all.  But I will promise to look at all of them and respond.  If we
don't use your work, we will tell you why.  I am hoping to see Thumpers article.  :)</em>
