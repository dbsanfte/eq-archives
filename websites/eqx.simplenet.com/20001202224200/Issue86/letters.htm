Dear Oghma,
 <br><br>
 I often sit down, when I am a bit tired of playing EverQuest, and read your articles. Most of the time I agree with what you write, and so also in the last article in the 85th edition if the EQExpress. EverQuest is my third online game so far, UO I played for one week, before putting it away, whilst Realm, with it's simplistic graphics kept me going for quite some time. But, as all games do, Realm got old, but there is ONE thing that I still admire both the Realm staff and the staff of Sierras next game, Middle Earth: Comunication. Verant lacks much of this. Why you might wonder. They have frequent interviews and they post updates every time they even just added a rock to EverQuest's landscape... but what they don't do, is when small things go wrong. 
<br><br>
Last week, a 1000+ (maybe more) players were kicked off EverQuest and were unable to log in, the game stated that our accounts were expired. Having played Realm, I stayed generally calm, and tried to calm the EQVault message boards down too, saying it would probably be up soon and that the Verant staff were probably working on it right now. But what I had expected to happen, didn't happen. Nobody from Verant came down from their pedestal to tell us what was going on, or later when the server was back up, what had happened. THIS is what annoys me about Verant, it has to affect the WHOLE of the population of Norrath, or they can't be bothered to give an explanation on what happened or an estimated time of when the problem will be fixed. I personally remained calm, since I have been through such problems before, but some people went totally insane, calling Verant and it's employees names. Verant has one of the worst customer service (next to UO) I have ever seen, and that I think is appalling and helps to ruin the game for some players.

<em>Dear Noor,
<br><br>
	I haven't personally had any problems with the guides or GM's but I know many who unfortunately have.  I think Verant's Customer Service does need work, and I certainly hope that the recent request for more GM's and Guides will address this.  I do think they do a lot of communication with players and I think they are very receptive to players comments and suggestions, as witnessed by the recent warrior and rogue enhancements, the call for more GM's, frequent quest updates/fixes, and the opening of two race war servers.  I'd like them to be a little more up front when they make a mistake, but I'll have to admit I'd be leery of admitting to the pottery sketch blunder.  The silence from them is maddening, though.  I won't agree that it's appalling, but it needs work.  It feels like you speak from the frustration of a player like myself, who loves the product but is frustrated with some of the issues.
<br><br>
When Brad did eventually come on to the chat servers after the TZ problems and said "I'm sorry", he did an excellent thing, and those customers who weren't complete idiots recognized that.  You probably had left by then, as many did.  Some of the things you were waiting for, acknowledgement of the problem and what was being done to address it, were later posted on EQV and EQSS.  The Tallon Zek problem was addressed on alt.games.everquest and posted on EQV on Saturday, July 31st. The account expired problem was posted about somewhere, but should have been made into patch note, as those who had their accounts messed with should know right away.  I'd like to comment a little about the guide/GM issue, though.
<br><br>
I know how hard it is to be a guide, since I have done similar jobs elsewhere. On Tuesday, August 6th, a post from Smedley on EQV showed an example of what a guide has to deal with, but I don't think it went far enough.  If a player contacts a guide they are almost always already  very upset, and, to be honest, feeling incredibly self-righteous.  Guides have to approach every customer patiently, thoughtfully, and with humor and compassion EVERY TIME.  I work in a field with good customer service, and know what it is like to be out on the front line dealing with complaints. (A slight brag here - since I became a library director, my library has gotten "excellent" customer service comments every month since I arrived, and has never gotten a rating below that "excellent".)  It is very difficult to be a guide or GM, and I'm not sure I'd have the stick-to-it-iveness that many of the guides have shown - remember, a guide gives up 10 hours a week of play-time for the dubious advantage of having the power to help frustrated and angry players while not being about to re-imburse or directly affect the game itself.  It's a volunteer position, and as such does not have a lot of the tools that a GM can handle.
<br><br>
The Guides need every bit of support that Verant can give them.  They need to know more about what can happen every patch, and what every patch contains.  They need to get the training which allows them to keep their balance when everyone freaks out, and there needs to be enough guides to handle the load.  The hiring process for guides is necessarily strict, as you need someone who is both ethical, knowledgeable about the game, an excellent communicator, even-keeled, and willing to give up 10 hours a week of their own time to help others.  If an applicant is let in lacking one of these qualities, the whole program suffers.  It's not an easy task at all to find and hire good guides.
<br><br>
This reply wound up being longer than I thought it would, sorry!  To boil down my response, I guess you can say:  I agree with you, I hope it will be addressed, and letters like yours are good for the game.  Thank you.

Totaly agree with you on your article, and your editorals always amaze me, I can always know what you REALLY mean, no just some senseless babble that sounds good. Anyway.. I've been having this very odd problem with EQ and I can't seem to solve it. I just cannot find a charcter that I like, i've played a human ranger up to level 9, but got so mad that I cannot leave the qeynos area (darn those griffians and huge eagle things !) that it got very boring day after day of fighting in blackburrow that I just gave up. I've didled around with a erudite wizzard figuring that it would be the best for a wiz, they are so combat weak I hated it. I don't like being a warrior because of the "all you do it hit things" type of charcter.. and everything else has just seemed very frustrating. I want to be able to get out and explore norrath, yet not have to sit in my home area for untill level 35 !! Not sure if this is normal to have to stay that long. I'm confused and frustrated. I love EQ for the game, but can't find my own niche in it. Can you help ??

<em>Wow, thanks! :)  As for your problem, try a character that begins in the Faydwer continent - I've played quite a few there and it is easy to travel from Ak'anon to Freeport and everything in between. Alternately, use a high level druid to move you away from your area - you may have to pay for the bind and travel, but it's another possibility.
<br><br>
Good luck! :)

Hail and Well Met!
<br><br>
I wanted to send a note to Oghma.. after reading his editorial in the 85th issue, I wanted to say that I was also lurking in the EQ chat room on friday waiting for the Test War Server to come up and I think I saw him there (his name was in blue heh).   I believe he hit the nail on the head when he said that frustration was the major emotion coloring all the chaos that ensued that day. I was more frustrated with the immaturity of a lot of the people there then with anything else. I wonder why Verant was the only Entity who did not realize that the Test War server was going to get swamped when it came up? There were discussions for a week prior to that friday that the GM's were privy to that came to that conclusion over and over. Don't GM's inform Verant of customer opinions and if not, why not? IMHO it would have been much wiser to put up 2 or 3 TWS and then remove them later rather than put up with the sheer rage of the people when they had to close it down.   Understand, this is not a rant. I was as disappointed as anyone when I couldn't try it out, but I was not maniacal about it. My Shieldmate wants to try that server and I just didn't want to be left behind. I'm not sure how I will react the first time I get attacked by raving PC's hehe.

<em>I think that Verant was caught in a bind - they had a survey which stated high initial interest but no long term interest, and with their present system, opening one server was the clearest option.  Initial logins were truly off the scale from previous initial server populations, but some method must be devised to cap initial logins.  Read the post, though I go into more depth.

<P>Hi guys! &lt;waves&gt;</P>

<P>Just a note to say.....</P>

<P>I liked OggyDoll's Editorial this week.  Hey don't look at me like that! &lt;g&gt; Yes this week &lt;hangs head&gt;.  It is not personal I want you guys to know that, it's just the sort of person I am.  Most weeks I think he's far to generous.  Other's I think he's gone over board &lt;the RP N word appearing in an article that completely polarized any point he was trying to make and I quit reading right there comes to mind&gt;.</P>

<P>But this week I really enjoyed his statements.  I view the game, I hope, from a completely neutral ground.  I don't expect to be handed fun in an online game on a platter, since I have yet to play any online game that would be FUN to play single player and therefore it's up to you and who your friends are.  Almost all my beefs can be pointed to as game mech beefs.  Then their impact on RPing.</P>

<P>This week I feel he gave a completely fair, non-biased call on EQ.  My feelings are that players have gotten so USED to the wonder of the world in EQ they now just over look it, or see the next level that doesn't exist except in their heads, and disregard what's in front of them.  I can RP in a mud puddle, but nothing to date could make that puddle look so real. I was glad to read an editorial from him that pretty much laid out the current happenings, regardless of which 'side' it was reflecting.</P>

<P>Of course to many, what's been accomplished has little impact.  It's the 'What will you do for me now?' that's always catching the eye.</P>

<P>Am I alone in that I still have a blast in EQ?  Just as much as my first day of beta standing there watching the snow fall in Halas?  Or am I just lucky I know such good people that when we game, it's a game and want to have fun together instead of a bad acting bitch session?  Maybe it's my disdain for "Monday Night Quarterbacks" that haven't actually had the ball snapped to them... but can sure tell you everything that was wrong with your positioning while watching it all in slow motion, that keeps my perspective in a different area.</P>

<P>Your tuding drivling WOWING gal,</P>
<P>--Onnie</P>

<P>Sorry for ending on a rhetorical questions &lt;g&gt;</P></FONT>


<br>
<em>Wow! What an honor to hear from the mighty Oxesies :)!  Thanks for your kind comments, I appreciate them and the thought you put into your reply.  I do have one question though - what was the RP 'n' word that polarized you?  I want to check to see if it was necessary top make my point or an omission on my part :). 
<br><br>
Yes, I think I am too generous at times.  I don't like to engage in rants in general, and I know some Verant folks, and how hard they work.  They do bonehead things at times, but we all do, and I hardly think that the constant bashing they receive will help create a better product.  Better to gently point out errors than to bash people over the head. You aren't alone - I almost ALWAYS have a blast in EQ, until something external (game mech-wise, or a badly done commentary) or internal (bad manners on a player) bug me.  I usually don't let it bother me too long, though.  Norrath is just a fun place to be!

Thank you.

That might seem a strange way to open an E-mail to you, but none the less,
thank you Absor and Oghma.  I spent three weeks debating with myself if I
should cancel my account.  Not so much because of the normal reasons you
hear "I hate Verant" type things, but just because I was tired.  Tired of
playing catch up with my friends, tired of killing Gnoll Reaver's in East
Karana, in general, you might say bored with the game.  I decided to check
up on EQX and maybe launch the game one more time, before canceling, when I
read your editorials for the last few weeks.  You have done an amazing job
of getting my mind back onto the interesting sides of EverQuest, the areas
and things that I haven't done.  You might not realize it, but the way you
can express yourself, has brought back my enthusiasm for the game, and all I
can say is thank you.
