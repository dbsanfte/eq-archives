The young bard walked gingerly through the door of the former headquarters to the Fit to Pint office. He glanced around at a scene of complete chaos, as various people ran to and fro stuffing boxes and crates in preparation of the imminent move to their new office. Lrets peered around the room in the hopes of finding someone who might help him. His search was rewarded when he noticed the heavy set man sitting behind a desk labelled editor in chief.
<br><br>
    Lrets shrugged and shifted his lute case to a more comfortable position and approached the man. "Hoi there!", he said, "I'm here to apply for the position of cub reporter." This statement illicited no response so he continued. "Errm, well ... In case ye do not know I am the one who gave ye that lil tidbit regarding the um ... errr ... "incidents" occuring with the magicians down in Erud. I'd be very interested in supplying ye with whatever more tidbits of information I can find." The man's left eyebrow raised a bit. "Providing ye might pay the right price?" His eyebrow fell back into place. "Errr .. well ... mebbe I'd be willing to give ye this information if'n ye'd be willing to provide a poor bard some space to print some of his stories?" Now both brows seem to move down and a not so pretty growl could be heard emnating from deep within the man's chest. "Ack!!! Oh! Forget it! How 'bout a free tankard of ale once in a while!"
<br><br>
    Lrets pressed on bravely, he WAS a bard, and performing for tough audiences was his stock and trade :). In any case, Lemme know if'n ye'd be interested an' lemme know if'n there's anything I should know .. should ye accept me offer :). Oh! And a lil somethin to tide ye over ... altho I don't really know if this is fit to print either .... I've heard from a friend of a friend of a friend of a brother's, cousin's, wife that the BlackBurrow water park has a new added attraction. It seems like the Diving Pool at the main entrance to Black Burrow was such a hit, that they added a lil something extra to the pool for fun. Razorgills! It seems management felt that it would be a great way to add an interactive element to the otherwise boring act of merely leaping 95 feet into the great Black Burrow pool.

<em>After insisting that the young Lrets find a safer place to rest during the confusion of our, er, sudden relocation, I looked through the pile of scrolls that had accumulated over the last few weeks.  This must be the one that he was trying to tell me about.  Though I'm not sure that I liked the description 'heavy set' much.  I'll have you know that the editor in chief here at Fit to Print is quite young, handsome, and muscular.  He often has to put off the affections of the beautiful women of Qeynos.</em>
<br><br>
Hoi there! This is Lret's D'pearl, aspiring Bard Extraordinaire, and I've just come a long way from Erud with news of the strangest sight I've ever seen. It seems that some type of strange magical essence has permeated to mists of the rivers of inland Erud, that causes magicians to have .... errr  ... ummm .... <blush> uhhh ... improperly intimate relations with their elementals. Well that's it. This is the first time i've written to ye, and I met the couple who submitted the letter in issue 63, that was a most cool experience (whew!! Got a lil starstruck there, although I'd really like to see if'n I can see any of the characters that have been written about :P). 
<br><br>
Keep up the great work!!!

Elaanilus Bordari, Half Elven paladin of Erollisi Marr, has retired. After many battles fought with many brave adventurers, he has decided to call it quits. When questioned about his reasons, he simply stated "I have fought bravely, and remained pure of heart. Every warrior must one day realize that he is not immortal and lay down his sword to better serve his people. On this day I will be handing down my duties, but I will be gaining more. You will see me working hard here in the Temple of Marr training young paladins and preaching the teachings of Erollisi." When asked what made him make the decision, he quickly replied "Death is not something to toy with. I fought to uphold the love that should be in all of our hearts, and I now feel that I can do that better without a sword, but rather with words." Elaanilus will be sorely missed, but his teachings should bring about many fine paladins.
