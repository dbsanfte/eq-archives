Concerning Death and Everquest
<br><br>
I just read the article <a href="../Issue9/news.htm">"News Worthy"</a> in EQX Issue 9 and I would like to
respond to it.
<br><br>
I see that the game Everquest has Gods in it and that provides the perfect
opportunity to incorporate death and death penalties in a role-playing
sense.  This is how I see it.  Every God has a belief (Death, Decay, Life,
Arts etc.) and their own agenda.  With that said every God also tends to
favor a particular "Class" or maybe a "Race".
</td>

<td width="33%" valign="top" style="text-align: justify"> <span style="text-align: justify">
When a character is made, a player is allowed to "choose" a God for their
character.  The character must then stay within the guidelines of the Gods
belief and agenda to stay in favor.  While that character is following the
God and is in his/her favor, resurrection is 100% guaranteed upon death. 
If the character should ever fall out of favor (or not have a God at all)
then resurrection has a percentage chance of failing and the character is
dead forever.  This allows another form of role-playing in the game and it
also would help to keep the game under control.  If done correctly it can
also keep rampant player killing down but not eliminated; the God system
would have to be setup correctly.
</td>

<td width="35%" valign="top" style="text-align: justify"> <span style="text-align: justify">
When a character dies and is resurrected he/she should lose 1/10th of their
levels rounded down, and all items that they are currently carrying.  This
allows a character of 1st through 9th level to die without losing levels
and 10th through 19th to lose one level etc.  This causes fear to step in
(but only to a point) to keep the "player" under control.  It also allows
new characters the ability to flourish and possibly survive for an extended
period of time.
<br><br>
I hope Everquest has a death penalty that will keep players from attacking
anything that walks or breaths.  This is not role-playing, it is action
playing, and does not belong in a ROLEPLAYING game.  Don't get me wrong,
there should be lots of action in the game but the players should have to
at least think about the possible penalties should their character die.
<br><br>
Thanks for listening,
Leanthar
