Consciousness splintered under the weight of the mace.  It cost Argossa precious seconds as she tried to gather up the shards of reality and put them back into something coherent.
<br><br>
Piece number one:  There were three of them.  Piece number two:  They were armed and she wasn't.  Piece number three:  She was nowhere near town and the guards would not hear her if she cried for help.  But wasn't there a fourth piece?  Yes, yes there was.  But this one didn't make any sense… wasn't she looking at her own face?
<br><br>
One of them grinned.  He was short and thick; A troll of a man, dressed in hides most likely skinned from some large lizard.  With a single glance she could count his teeth; not a tremendous feat considering their number.
<br><br>
The one that spoke was a woman.  If she hadn't spoken, Argossa would not have known this was a woman.  She was so heavily armored in plate that there was no hint of her sexuality, or for that matter, a person.  It could have been an empty suit if it weren't moving.
<br><br>
"Collect her and we'll get the cash and be gone from this pansy wood."
<br><br>
There were the other shards.  She was in the forest near Kelethin, home of the elves.  And lastly, she could see her own face, not in the reflection of the broad shiny surface of the armor before her, but on the enormous poster at which she had been looking before their surprise attack sent the thoughts spilling from her head.  She glanced quickly over her shoulder and spied the poster again.  Not a tremendously good likeness, but enough to surely get her caught or killed.
<br><br>
"Kinz ack dista bro adiak," said the third and shortest of the trio.  Like many dwarves he chose to speak Dwarvish in front of the enemy.  And perhaps Argossa might not have understood his instruction to distract her while he tossed the net over her if she had not spent the last dozen years as the wife of a noble, and therefore with many tutors and scholars at her disposal.
<br><br>
Argossa moved away from the wall.  Perhaps they would take it upon themselves to circle her if they had the opportunity.  They were very obliging in that regard, and Argossa turned her back to the dwarf.  He wore leather armor mostly, but fortunately he wore a pair of mailed shoes.  This would be of benefit, as at his height, he would have to make two quick steps before tossing the net, and she would hear them both.  It was now a matter of timing things.
<br><br>
The man with three teeth was first to act.  He cast a spell of some sort.  His hands began to glow in shades of ochre.  This, too, was a good sign; It meant that they had come upon her so quickly and unexpectedly that they had failed to cast their protection wards.  For a brief moment they would not have benefit of the magic, and the little lizard would spend his time and mana protecting his companions before he waded in with his offensive spells.
<br><br>
The first attacker was the woman in plate.  And she was just as clumsy as one might expect.  Argossa couldn't help but let out a smile as the blade crashed into the ground beneath her feet with a blow that only the earth could not dodge.
<br><br>
Argossa held off a moment with her blow, positioning herself just right and waiting for the toothless cleric to begin his next casting.  The dwarf was pacing behind her.  She could hear it.
<br><br>
When he began his oratory for the spell, Argossa slammed her foot into his gut, doubling him over and interrupting his casting.  The second swing of the clumsy woman came, and this time her blade found only air, and made nary a whistle cutting the air, as it's speed could be timed with a sundial.
<br><br>
After that miss and Argossa's step backward was when the dwarf's feet could be heard to stutter step as he pitched the net forward.  Argossa dropped to the ground.  At this point the armored woman was still in a forward position, but the heft of the net was enough to not only wrap her up, but send her spilling over backwards with a tremendous clatter that was louder than any cry for help she might have made.
<br><br>
The short man, whom she had taken to referring to as "Oral Hygiene", had begun to right himself and had his mace aimed at shattering her kneecap.  She most likely could have avoided his blow, but there was no need.  The cleric got such a look of pain on his face that it seemed to spook the dwarf, who was busy untangling the other of the three (who was cursing him like a sailor at low tide).
<br><br>
Oral began to drool.  Droplets of blood came down his chin and made a wretched mess of his face.  He fell to his knees and then sprawled out face down on the ground.
<br><br>
Argossa saw the look on the dwarf's face.  She simply turned to them and slapped the flat of the sword against her palm.  That was all it took for the two of them to be off.  And a more comical pair running away there never was.  She in her heavy plate clattering and cursing, and he with his tiny legs churning fast as they might.
<br><br>
She smiled and then turned back to the fallen cleric.
<br><br>
"Afraid it was my doing," A voice said from around the other side of the building.  A figured approached, swathed in black cloth, and lowered his hood to show his dark skin and bald head.  An Erudite.
<br><br>
"I am Lozanth.  I hope you are not too disappointed that you did not get to finish your fight."
<br><br>
"No…" Argossa said, rolling the cleric over, "I'm not disappointed in the fight."
<br><br>
He cocked his head to the left a bit and said, "then in what?"
<br><br>
"Well," she continued, "My Dwarvish tutor told me there was no Dwarvish word for 'retreat'.  But I'll be damned if that probably wasn't it."
<br><br>
The Erudite grinned then started with a low chuckle that turned into a hearty laugh.
<br><br>
"A fist is not what it contains," he said in Dwarvish, "but what the enemy thinks it contains."
<br><br>
It was an old Dwarvish proverb.
<br><br>
She looked at her picture tacked to the wall.  Above it in bright blue letters was the word REWARD.
<br><br>
"Not a very good likeness," Lozanth said, "It doesn't do you justice."
<br><br>
She gave him a sidelong glance.  He was certainly handsome.  Most Erudites were, in their exotic way.  Few were as muscled as this one.  They were scholars and mages, not front line warriors.  Fencers, not swordsmen.  Her fencing instructor had been an Erudite, but she was not as pleasant as this man before her.
<br><br>
"If you don't mind me asking, why did you interfere?"
<br><br>
"I didn't like the odds.  I waited long enough to see if you could take them, then when I was sure one way or another I stepped in to end it quickly."
<br><br>
"Hmmm…." She mumbled, "And which did you think was going to happen?"
<br><br>
"They are but children with knives who saw a glittering prize.  They would not win, but even if they'd gotten lucky they would most likely have killed one another over your reward."
<br><br>
"Ah, yes.  The reward," she said, and decided the best approach was to just ask this man outright what was there waiting to be spoken, "Is that why you are here?"
<br><br>
"I am here because I knew the Count Alakirr.  He was as much a friend as an Erudite can have on this continent far from home.  I am here because his death is more than an injustice, it is an insult.  Your husband's murder has prevented me from completing my obligations to him.  And I will not live out eternity owing a debt to anyone."
<br><br>
"Lozanth…yes," a glimmer of recognition crossing behind her eyes, "You are the man he pulled from the pirate freighter Ugolonese."
<br><br>
Lozanth was proud enough to avoid eye contact, but controlled enough to turn act as if he didn't hate the thought of being saved by any human.  Erudites are individuals and prefer to be beholden to none, particularly those of the continents east of Erudin.
<br><br>
"So," she said, looking again to the corpse on the ground, "Is the debt repaid?"
<br><br>
Lozanth looked back at her, "No.  To save you when you don't need to be saved is not a tremendous feet.  I will repay my debt."
<br><br>
"Well," Argossa said, collecting the cash from the dead man's pouch and then tucking the blade she had commandeered into her belt, "If you stay with me but a while you'll have many chances to collect on that debt.  With this bounty on me I am the most sought after woman on the continent."
<br><br>
"Hmm.  Indeed.  So what did you do to the Countess Opheneas that has caused such a sum to be leveled at your head?"
<br><br>
"Simple.  I married her brother.  Or perhaps it was when he died and I inherited his wealth.  She had it seized, but nonetheless he did bequeath it to me.  Maybe it was the time I called his side of the family 'a plague wrought upon the people'-though I doubt she knew about that statement.  But I'm betting that it was simply because my husband loved me and came home at night, when hers has a dozen mistresses to bed 'til dawn."
<br><br>
"He was a good man." He said.  Then he added the qualifier, "For a human."
<br><br>
She smiled.  And they were off to Kelethin.
