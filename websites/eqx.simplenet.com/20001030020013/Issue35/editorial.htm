Power Gamers suck!  You know, those that just want to gain levels so that they can play some big tough character.  They only do that so that they can feel superior.  Obviously they suffer from some very sincere deficiencies in their real lives and try to compensate for them in their fantasy gaming hobby.  All power gamers should be taken out and…
<br><br>
Er….
<br><br>
Wait, I take all that back.
<br><br>
I guess I have to.  Last Saturday I got to play one of my high level characters.  Not just one of the high level ones, but one of the toughest, meanest, most self-important characters that I've ever played.  And I loved it!
<br><br>
Our usual GM came back from his vacation early due to an unfortunate family problem.  And that really sucks.  But our replacement GM was out this weekend, so we put him to work to keep his mind off of it…  We've been having a blast playing little monsters (I being the little bard monster :P).  And I hope that we get to play that game more in the future.  But Mr. GM was back, and he had a chance to run a one day game during the break this campaign.  And he came in saying 'up to 15th level'.  Now for some that's not high level.  But I've only got one character that is over 15th, and a whole bunch under 10th (actually I was surprised when looking for a character for this game to discover that I don't really have that many characters at all…).  But I have one that is 14th, Radvar.  I mentioned him last time, I think.  He's the one that turned out very different than I had expected because his experiences were different than his fathers.  He's not nearly the anti-social, mage hating, hermit that his father was.
<br><br>
But he's no social butterfly either.  We play in a version of Greyhawk, you know, they one created by TSR.  Radvar is on probation in that city for crimes he did not commit.  Well, actually, he did commit them, he just had a really good lawyer.  Anyway, I was going to make a point… what was it…
<br><br>
Oh, I 'member.  Power gaming.  Now I've been playing Radvar pretty consistently for, er, many years.  How many I can't remember.  So I didn't get him to that level with any sort of power gaming.  Actually, quite the opposite.  When he was about 9th level he and his whole party were killed by a vampire (one of the greatest games I've ever been in, by the way).  They were rescued on a sketchy bit of work by our GM.  But as part of the ritual to destroy the vampirism they were all killed and raised again.  Literally raised again, for they came back as children.  So I've earned a lot more than 14 levels with this character.
<br><br>
But now he is one of the toughest fighters in our campaign.  And I got to play him again for the first time in a while.  And it was a hoot!  I loved being able to look down my nose at people.  I loved knowing that when the guards heard that I was involved in a ruckus at the Green Dragon they sent a few extra men, just in case.  I loved it when we found out that one of our new acquaintances had more money than her two war horses could carry!  Hehe…  I tell them that I can promise her that she'll get 90% of it back when she leaves if she'll let me store it for her (I know a thief/mage that would keep 5% and buy off factions in the guild with 5%).  But no, these so-called adventurers think that they can keep it safe without me.  So they bury it 20 feet down in a 'hidden' spot.  Next day it's gone.  Hehe, picture 20 thieves digging all night like mad to reach what was about 400 lbs. of platinum…
<br><br>
Anyhow, it was a complete blast being stronger than the regular person.  It was a giggle to always be right.  It was a lot of fun watching these hardened adventurers fall victim to beginners blunders.  I absolutely loved being the toughest guy in the room (well, except for that Samurai…  But he fights with honor, and that makes him real easy to beat.)  There is no denying the attraction of power gaming.  But I have to add one thing.
<br><br>
Radvar is only powerful because I played him to that level.  I earned every piece of gold, every magic sword, every scar, every skill.  If I were to have written him up at that level and played him, he would have been a weak little punk.  Nothing against the fella that was playing the character that lost all that platinum, but he deserved to lose it.  The character was one of those that was born when we were really power gaming.  You know, when you'd double the dragons hoard size.  When your first level characters were all children of your high level ones, and therefore they started with plate mail and magic weapons.  When we would roll a 20 sided die for stats.  You know, those days.  The poor guy (well, girl - note to self: do an editorial about what in the world makes men want to play female characters…) actually figured that his character would be able to keep that kind of money in a city where the mayor is the head of the thieves guild.  Hehe, let's not mention that I kinda traded that money for some information we needed to rescue the Circle of Eight…
<br><br>
You see we had to find someone and I figured the thieves would know where he was.  They did.  And in exchange for the information I made it clear that I was not too concerned about what happened to all that money.  Heck, she (a paladin, nonetheless!) didn't deserve the money any more than the thieves.  And I was certainly not going to get killed trying to guard it.  It worked.  The thieves made a bundle (note to self #2 - I think I should still have a 'favor' with that particular faction of the guild… that was a LOT of money).  We got our Vecna cultist and the information we needed.
<br><br>
Damn, it was fun to be bigger than life.  I love playing the little guy trying to get along in a world run by people that could squish him like a bug.  I like both.  I guess that as long as I like my character I will be able to enjoy almost any roleplaying situation.  That, and I play with the best bunch of gamers I've ever met.  In EverQuest it will be different.  Not everyone will start out the first day of the games release.  So six months later, Joe Smith opens his account with 989 Studios and starts playing.  He is immediately going to be in a world where probably hundreds of player characters are infinitely more powerful than he is.  And there will be no GM there to say 'the level of this game is 1st through 4th'.  So Joe and his new character are very small fish in a very big pond.  So will the guy that starts a year after release (thanks to my pal Winter for pointing this out and inspiring this rant.)  But that does not mean that he has to 'power game' to catch up.  Even if he tries, he will never succeed.  The rest have too big of a lead.  And besides, that's not what it's all about.  Play the character to that level.  Don't hook up with your friend, the one that convinced you to play, and have his 10th level character help you boost up.  Not only will you still not be top dog, but you will also have no idea how to play that character.  There are a lot of nuances that I know about how to play Radvar that only I can pull off.  Hand a copy of the character sheet to someone and let us fight, Radvar to Radvar.  I'm gonna win.
<br><br>
So maybe to truly power game you have to earn your levels by playing through them.
<br><br>
Hehe… and the paladin lost her paladin powers, too…  Hehe, paladins are sooo funny!  Condone one little murder and your god shuns you.  Why worship such a fickle creature?  Paladins make Radvar laugh.
