"By the gods, boy!", he shouted. "Have I taught you nothing?" Jarel stood and walked angrily around the tree stump, throwing his arms wildly about him.
<br><br>
"What is the first rule of combat?" He stopped and gave a piercing look to Groal. "The first rule", he barked.
<br><br>
"N..n…know your enemy."
<br><br>
"Know your enemy! Yes! And who is the enemy?"
<br><br>
" The….the Council?"
<br><br>
"The Council!" Jarel was still shouting, his surprisingly loud voice echoing in the quiet glade they called home. "Who else?"
<br><br>
"The trolls?"
<br><br>
"The trolls." He was quiet now, which intimidated Groal far more than the angry shouting. " The boy is a genius. Oh, tremble in fear, mighty rulers of Oggok. Prepare to meet thy doom". Jarel's dark blue skin took on a purple hue and he sat, collapsed nearly, onto the stump. He rubbed his left arm and grimaced against the pain running up into his chest, breathing hard. "Damnit, boy. You'll be my death." His panted in short painful gasps for a few moments and then a blue coloring returned to his cheeks turned violet by his efforts. He sat up and looked searchingly into Groal's small eyes.
<br><br>
"I have an idea", he said.
<br><br>
Spring turned to summer. The warm days passed and as the first snows fell, a young ogre approached the gates of  pulling behind him a small cart filled with dried herbs, bandages and arcane instruments of healing. He stopped at the sentry's challenge.
<br><br>Oggok
"Hold, stranger", the guard growled. "And what have we here?" He walked casually around Groal's cart, limping slightly and slapping a truncheon against a muscular thigh. He lifted the tarp covering the contents and began pulling out various sacks and packages, throwing them roughly on the cobblestones of the single road leading into the city.
<br><br>
"A smuggler, eh?"
<br><br>
"No, Sir. I am a simple country healer, come to make my fortune in your great city." Groal sounded shy and contrite, as Jarel had taught him.
<br><br>
The guard opened a sack and peering into it, smelled the dried contents. His head jerked back and he threw the sack down, scattering the powdered herbs about his feet.
<br><br>
"Innoruk take it!", he bellowed. "Aaah…..ah….CHOO!" He dropped the nightstick, drew his sword and menacingly approached Groal. "Poison! Aah...Choo!"
<br><br>
	"Sir", Groal said, backing away. "It is not. That will cure headaches and joint pains. I swear to you. It is not poison. Let me show you."
<br><br>
	The soldier hesitated and Groal took the opportunity to gather up some of the spilled medicine and putting it to his face, inhaled deeply.
<br><br>
	"See? I live."
<br><br>
	The guard looked suspicious but put away his weapon.
<br><br>
	"I suffer great pain in my knee", he said. "Will that foul dust help?"
<br><br>
	"Oh, absolutely. Let me examine your leg." Groal bent down and inspected the sentry's knee. It was scarred and Groal saw it had been badly set after having been slashed and broken. The scar ran purple along the shin. He felt the tendon and determined that it ran improperly down the leg. He shuddered invisibly to think that the ogres had no better surgeons than the butcher who had done this.
<br><br>
	"Sir", he said, looking up at the guard. "I can fix this wound so that you have no pain and no limp. Come to me after I am established. No charge to you." He picked up the sentry's club and handed it to him.
<br><br>
	The sentry looked doubtful. He had experience with "healers".  He scowled suspiciously at Groal as the strange young ogre returned his supplies to the wagon with an economy of movement the guard had not seen since fighting the elves in Kithicor. He'd keep an eye on that one, he would.
<br><br>
	Groal struggled mightily to maintain an aloof visage as he passed the gates into Oggok. As he pulled his little cart up the street he saw butcher shops displaying the flayed limbs of Dwarves and Gnomes and filthy, hideously wounded beggars whose desperate pleas for succor presaged a slow death from starvation. He passed a market square where a one eyed auctioneer bellowed the virtues of slaves for sale. He saw a group of ogre children playing at a game he thought should be called "who can bite the hardest". The gutters overran with filth and excrement, smelling of death and blood.
<br><br>
	'Welcome to Oggok', he thought to himself.
<br><br>
 He continued down the dirty, broken street into the heart of the city until he came within sight of the largest structure in Oggok, King Kilgor's Castle, now the seat of the Council. He would set up his base of operations near here.
<br><br>
He found a vacant stall and with a little inquiry, the owner. After a bitter negotiation he rented the dilapidated structure for an exorbitant fee and set out the herbs and ointments that would announce his presence as a healer for hire. The first phase of Jarel's Plan was nearly complete. In the weeks to come, Groal would roam and map the city at night and maintain his façade during daylight. By months end, he had a detailed map of the city for Jarel. All that was left to him was getting into the castle. The opportunity came just as the yellow moon of October lit the city with a diseased, shadow blurring glow, making of the streets paths of ochre fire leading to hell. The fates came in the form of a halfling servant, come to demand the young healer's services.
<br><br>
He followed the tiny, starved thin slave through garbage filled alleys and onto the worn stone steps leading to the service gate of the castle. He was led through a kitchen hot as the caves of  Kaladim and through a wide hallway carpeted with a rich thick velvet red and up a set of marble stairs banistered in hand polished Barrow wood and down another hallway. The halfing stopped and faced a wooden door, turning to Groal with a countenance devoid of expression, a face that had looked upon the abyss of utter fear and despair; a face that no longer hungered even for death.  The little soulless man opened the door and gestured for him to enter. 
<br><br>
Groal's warrior trained eyes scanned the large bedroom from wall to wall and he almost unconsciously counted three swords, four daggers and a crossbow arrayed among the richly robed ogres assembled around the huge canopied bed that filled most of the room. The figures hunched over the thickly blanketed bed looked up in rapid succession, stepping back and making room for the young healer. On the mattress lay Barbergan, his face wet and pasty, eyes glazed.
<br><br>
Groal saw at once the Elder had been poisoned. He walked quickly over to the old ogre and placing a hand on the fevered brow said, "I need something from my shop. I can save him. Maybe."
<br><br>
"If you think it is poison, young 'ogluk', we are all wasting our time."  An old but still large and  muscular ogre in uniform pointed a finger at him, using a slang term for runt.  "The food tasters have been 'questioned' and though none survive, they all proved their innocence. He has not been poisoned."
<br><br>
An even older ogre in splendid yellow silk robes moved to stand between Groal and the ogre in military dress.
<br><br>
"So far, all we have done is make things worse." He put a shaky hand on the soldier's arm. His voice was a thin whisper. " Let this young one try." His face was a mass of scars, the trophies of wars now forgotten, his eyes empty as the halfling slave's. "Go, ogluk, and return quickly. His life is now yours and you live because he lives. If he dies…."  Thrack left the thought unsaid, the meaning was unmistakable. Groal stood and with bowed head left the room as quickly as he had arrived.
<br><br>
         With a simple gesture of his hand, Thrack silently directed the old soldier to follow the young ogre. 
<br><br>
'Barbergan must die', he thought to himself. 'Then Ogra.'
<br><br>
Groal ran through the castle taking a different route from the way he had come, making a mental image of the floor plans as he went. He finally arrived at the kitchen and servants' entrance from which he had first entered and bounding down the marble stairs two at a time, paused for a moment at the bottom to let the warrior catch up. He didn't want to lose his stalker. As Ogra appeared at the top of the steps, Groal slipped into a dark alley, making sure the old ogre would see.

<br><br>
Ogra paused for a moment at the top of the back stairs to catch his breath. He was not as young as he used to be but by Innoruk, he was still more than a match for an ignorant country ogre like this young healer. The lad wasn't all that bright, he thought. The young fool had gotten lost leaving the castle and Ogra had followed him through the maze of hallways. He was lucky to have made it to the streets, having found the kitchens leading to the rear gates by accident or just inevitably. Even Ogra himself had not known the ways in one of the wings the silly child had wandered about . Ogra saw his prey slip into a narrow alley he knew led into the merchants quarter. He drew a small crysknife stained black with the blood of countless victims and walked down the steps quickly. On the street he broke into an slow jog. He would take a shorter route and lie in wait. An easy kill awaited him.
<br><br>
By the silence behind him, Groal ascertained Ogra must be circling ahead to lie in ambush. He debated ending the life of the old soldier. He had never killed except in self-defense and even then only savage animals in the forest. Could he kill a sentient? Jarel had indoctrinated him on the evils of murder and Groal felt no lust for killing his father's murderer, if this was indeed Ogra. But what other soldier would be in Barbergan's death chamber? "If it walks like a mandrakor…", Jarel was fond of saying. No, this was Ogra. He was sure of it. And he <u>would</u> kill him. His blood warmed strangely at the thought.
<br><br>
Coming out into the dimly torch-lit street, Groal heard the quiet breathing of his foe hissing from the shadows to his left. A clumsy ambush, he thought. Ogra is overconfident. Know your enemy. He pretended unconcern and walked noisily up to the hidden assassin, a crystalline dagger concealed in his right hand. As he passed, Ogra struck, swinging his knife in an arc aimed directly at Groal's neck. With the slightest movement, Groal dodged and backed off three paces, crouching slightly and planting his left foot slightly ahead of the right, presenting the smallest target to his attacker and setting his balance perfectly.
<br><br>
 The momentum of his swing carried Ogra into the street, off balance and open to a counterstrike. He whirled swiftly back into position only to feel the cutting edge of a very sharp knife slice a shallow wound into his side. An amateurish cut but painful nonetheless. His instincts, honed on a lifetime of battle, brought him around in a swift maneuver that would have left any other opponent lying bleeding to death at his feet. Instead, he struck only empty air while his target managed a cut to his shoulder, the blood flying out into the dark. The wound was deep enough to disable his left arm which  fluttered uselessly at his side and he backed up hastily, putting the torch pole between himself and this surprising young ogre. He hocked a huge spit ball at the lamp and it sizzled out with a foul stench. In the sudden darkness he struck again and again felt the razor's edge of Groal's knife slice him open. He dropped his own dagger and held his arms to his belly, holding in the stomach and organs that threatened to spill from the grievous wound. He fell heavily to his knees in shock, looking up at the victor in astonishment.  The pale moonlight revealed it was Grumthor, returned from the grave! 
<br><br>
He died with that old remembered face gazing down at him, the eyes blazing red with a blood-lust he knew must have countenanced the victories of his own youth. How he had loved the deaths of others. Now, he must love his own. He embraced the falling darkness eagerly, accepting this honorable end of life. He had died in battle and Innoruk would meet him in the plane of power and lead him to his rightfully earned station at the right hand of the dark god in the land of the dead.
<br><br>
An evil thrill ran through Groal as Ogra's lifeless body collapsed into the mud of the gutter, it's insides spilling obscenely into a river made of it's own red blood. Groal turned away and continued on to his stall. He felt exhilarated, alive. Something in the deed had awakened the ogre in him. His true nature that the sad old ShadowKnight (who sought redemption through acts of salvation) had tried to train out of him could not be washed away by the kindness or the discipline he had learned beneath Jarel's gentle hand. Groal felt strong. He felt…right. There was no shame nor remorse in depriving your enemies of life; there was joy. Revenge was like the wines of Toxxulia, sweet as honeypie and intoxicating. Groal was drunk with death. Death was life.
