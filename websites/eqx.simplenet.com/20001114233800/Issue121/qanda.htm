  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> How do I successfully teach a language and what are the 
  requirements of doing so?<br>
  Kilroy</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> The essential answer here is that you can only teach someone a language 
  if you have a higher proficiency at it than they do and you can only teach them 
  up to the level of your own skill. Before you can teach a language, then, you 
  need to gain as much skill as possible in it. To do this (after you practice 
  the language at least once at your guild), you can group with an expert in the 
  language you want to know and through some friendly spam, raise your skill level. 
  To turn around and then teach the language, you find a student, group with him 
  or her, and then send friendly spam to them in the language you wish to teach. 
  Of course, if you wish to become a professional language teacher, it’s a good 
  idea, through diplomacy with all races, to become as proficient in as many languages 
  as your skill list will allow you.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I was just wondering if you could enlighten me on the subject 
  of the Bards wonderful songs when grouped. Do they affect any pets in the group 
  or players only? . Hope you can shed some light on this an keep up the good 
  work.<br>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> As the master necromancer, Quetus, said, it’s a great pity, but bard 
  songs will not extend their effects to pets belonging to members of the group. 
  It would be really nice if they did. Bard songs basically can act on the bard 
  only, on the group only, on a single npc or on any npc’s in the immediate area. 
  (Immediate here is used relatively as due to variations in the geometry, bard 
  songs sometimes are heard in places the bard never intended, bringing all sorts 
  of angry listeners back to the bard and the group.) One thing I’m not certain 
  of is whether an aggro bard song will affect a pet in pvp. Perhaps someone could 
  let me know on this.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> In response to someone mentioning Mr. McQuaid's departure 
  from Verant, I believe there was an April Fool's post somewhere about just such 
  a thing. Something about him going to work at Origin now that Richard Gariott 
  had left there (interesting question, was that a stunt by RG?). I figure a lot 
  of people will probably answer this for you, but if not, yay me :0<br>
  Whyte Tyger</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Yay for you! Smile, no one else wrote, so I will go with your explanation 
  that it was all an April’s Fool joke. Thank you for writing.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> I'm a necromancer. I noticed something about my pet the 
  other day, he had an orc pic once, a rusty dagger the other time, and he did 
  14 damage! Does it actually matter what weapon you give your pet? I would have 
  a lot more money if I could sell all those rusty halberds and 2 handed swords.<br>
  Baloo, lvl 7 necromancer, Follower of Innoruuk</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> You can thank the Pillar of Wisdom, Teranil, for helping me out with 
  this one. It can matter what weapon you give the pet but whether it does or 
  not depends on what the base damage of the pet is. To determine how to equip 
  your pet, first figure out how much damage the pet does on its own, without 
  a weapon. Then, if the weapon will do more damage than the pet, you can give 
  the weapon to the pet to wield. If the pet’s damage is already higher than the 
  weapon, then of course you won’t need to equip the pet. It is important to consider 
  the type of weapon too. Teranil says that if you have a lower level pet, it’s 
  good to give them a 2h high damage weapon, while if you have a higher level 
  pet, you’ll want to give it 2 1h weapons so the pet can dual wield.</font></p>

  <b><i>Q:</i></b><i> This isn't a question, it's an answer to someone else's 
  question. Namely someone asking about whether or not he should roleplay a monk 
  as a lady's man. I say: yes. The reason is, I like characters who are a little 
  different from the stereotype for their class. It's fun to roleplay in unexpected 
  ways. For example, I have a high elf magician who I roleplay as a little friendlier 
  and less arrogant than the average high elf. He isn't self centered and snotty 
  like most of his kind. And I like having a character like that. If you’re just 
  doing the standard roleplay, then you don't have to think to roleplay. It's 
  just “monkey see monkey do". That's all I have to say.<br>
  Micheal</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Thanks for your response. It is so rare for me as a half elf to receive 
  such a pleasant and non-condescending answer from a high elf! Grin, I do agree 
  with you that the fun of having a roleplay character is to see what kind of 
  unique personality and presence you can create. </font></p>

  Do you have any bardic theories on what REALLY happened to the Combine Empire 
  since Verant isn’t talking? There are rumors flying around that there is a Combine 
  city in Kunark, but I'll believe that when I see Kunark in a week.<br>
  Deeg Darkhammer</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Of course there is a bardic theory on what really happened to the 
  Combine Empire. There is a bardic theory for everything, and usually more than 
  one actually. My own pet theory is that the Combine Empire was destroyed when 
  some arrogant high elven tailor decided that half-elves should never wear dresses. 
  Immediately after all soft, beautiful, comfortable dresses were removed from 
  every half-elven wardrobe, the entire empire crumbled leaving only the shells 
  of the teleport spires found throughout Norrath as a reminder that the power 
  of the Empire was a mere illusion compared to the power of half-elven females 
  deprived of their favorite accoutrements. Now, if there proves to be a Combine 
  city in Kunark, perhaps what rightfully belongs to the half-elven wardrobes 
  will be restored and an additional small measure of Combine influence will return 
  to the realms. Should anyone be willing to brave the terrors of the unknown 
  in search of a dress, please let me know so I may accompany you. </font></p>

  I have a riddle for you great super duper bard smarty pants! A question to stump 
  you and your pillars of wisdom! Why did the Bard cross the road?<br>
  Nillipus</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  <b>A:</b> Oh Nillipus, how cruel of you to strike to the very heart of my despair. 
  To call attention to my smarty pants when you know I long to wear a dress? Sigh, 
  what is the world coming to when even the halflings ridicule my clothing? However, 
  even taunting questions deserve an answer so here is yours: My Pillars of Wisdom 
  cannot be stumped and they are unanimous that the bard crossed the road to fetch 
  a gorgeous dress, thumbing her nose at you as she returned to the village inn.

  After reading Brackiss's tips on keyboard setup, I decided I'd bless you with 
  my own. *Smiles*. My setup is optimized for using both the keyboard and the 
  mouse at the same time. I have W as move forward, S as back, A as left, and 
  D as right. Then right underneath, I have X as autoattack, and Z as crouch, 
  and C as Consider. With this layout, your left hand has access to all the hot 
  keys, all the speaking related keys, such as R and T, and even your overlay 
  display key ~. Also, I often use the mouse to move, too, and I wasn't sure if 
  many knew this but if you have mouselook on, and hold right click, and then 
  hold left click while still holding right click, you can move in that direction!<br>

  <b>A:</b> Thanks for writing. I think your suggestions will give some good ideas 
  to players seeking ways to modify their keyboard assignments.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A:</b> 
  Without knowing Malren the Merciless, I can only surmise that he is cool because 
  he went to Halas for a brief vacation forgetting his long underwear, warm socks, 
  and breathable layers of outdoor fashions. Best get him to a warm fire before 
  he becomes positively cold!</font></p>
