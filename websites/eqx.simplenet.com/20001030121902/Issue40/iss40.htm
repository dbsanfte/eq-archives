<font size="-1">
	The battle between the races raged on, with the elves having the slightly upper hand. The forest was filled with screams and groans, as ogre and elf fell. Brendelson and Leif helped the wounded elves, trying to limit the elven fatalities. Brendelson wanted to help the elves more, but he was still weak from his earlier battle with the ogre camp. Leif, though, was disposing of the occasional stray ogre.  Brendelson noticed that Leif's face was hard and emotionless, killing without thought. If outnumbered Leif was afraid and cautious. When an ogre put up a good fight, it was as if Leif was enjoying himself. This was a distinct turn around from the Leif he had talked to earlier.

The alarm rings and I looked at the clock.  It's 6:00am.  I assumed I had forgot to set the alarm for my usual Wednesday "work from home" wakeup time.  I roll over and shut the alarm off, cursing at myself for forgetting.  I lay there in bed thinking of something to put me back to sleep, but its no use.  You know how you get use to a certain time to wake up and nothing can prevent you from waking up at that exact time.  <em>I hate that</em>!

Brian McNaughton has managed to get me to do something that I haven't done in over 15 years:  Read a fantasy novel.
<br><br>
It's not that Fantasy is a subject I don't enjoy, it's just that the marketing kills my interest.  In a world where the 'latest thing' dictates what is to be produced and how it's marketed, it becomes increasingly difficult to single out original contributions to the genre.  I typically find horror and science fiction authors to be more inventive (and of course less derivative of Tolkien).

The night itself keeps you awake.  Try as you might, you cannot overcome it's howling and thrashing.  You decide to take a walk along the grounds to ease your nerves.  You enter into the night and pull your cloak close, but let your face feel the wind as you wander toward around the castle courtyard.  As you come to the "royal crossroads", you turn to look down an avenue and see the cathedral, beckoning to you.  The winds howl more as you walk down the avenue and into the cathedral to escape the night<b>...</b>

Alright, now you've done it!  You've gone and suggested that we should have classes in EverQuest that are not primarily focused on combat!  You know who you are…
<br><br>
I want to talk about whether or not there should even be such things in the game.  Of course I've given this a lot of thought.  A disjointed and fuzzy sort thought, but thought nonetheless.
