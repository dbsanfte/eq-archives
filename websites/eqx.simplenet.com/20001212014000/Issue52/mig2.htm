The sun shines in Greater Faydark about as often as trolls clean their ears.  Despite that my travel companion forgot to bring the torches.
<br><br>
"You didn't say we were going to need them."
<br><br>
I just shook my head and continued walking.  Lotis was a great one for light when there was makeup at her disposal, but if it came to doing anything in the world that required work she was conveniently forgetful.
<br><br>
"Guess we can't do this then," she said, managing to muster up something resembling disappointment.
<br><br>
"Of course we can," I said, now determined not to let her derail us from making it to Felwithe, "now it's just much more dangerous."
<br><br>
The look on her face told me that I'd scared some common sense into her.
<br><br>
"But…couldn't we just find a nice cave," she said as she ran a hand over my shoulder, "and wait until morning."
<br><br>
Let me first say that I know I was being manipulated.  A man doesn't know as many woman as I've known without recognizing the subtle and overt ways some use sex to get what they want.  The only question then becomes 'is it what I want'.
<br><br>
We woke up around sunup.  She was laying there on her side, half curled up, half sprawled in a pose like those you only see in hermit paintings of remembered women.  If I hadn't been so distracted by her I might have noticed that we weren't alone.
<br><br>
I reached over and ran my hand over the smooth skin of her back.
<br><br>
Then something touched my ankle.  No, not touched… lightly grabbed.
<br><br>
It's common sense among those who've awakened to find snakes in their bedroll that one does not make sudden movements.  Having said that, I can tell you that common sense has no part in instinct.  I retracted my legs like a dwarven jewel merchant retracting a special deal.
<br><br>
Luckily, there were no snakes present.
<br><br>
Instead I could see a figure lying at my feet, his hand outstretched toward me.  He was obviously mortally wounded.  There was a trail of blood that led from the opening of the cave all the way to our temporary nest of blankets and backpacks.
<br><br>
I must have gasped or made a noise when he startled me because Lotis was now awake and seeking her clothing.
<br><br>
"He's in bad shape.  Do you know any heal magics?"
<br><br>
She pulled her top over her head and then realizing that he was in no position to ogle her she then dropped to her knees beside him and checked on his wounds.
<br><br>
I've seen mastodons that had fewer stab wounds.  He had more open holes than a necromancer's back yard.  He was not long meant for this world and Lotis' magics were of little assistance, being primarily attacks and shields.  He merely lasted a few more agonizing moments of life before a merciful death.  But he did have long enough to mutter something.
<br><br>
She extracted herself from the deathgrip he had put on her wrist during his last throes, when he pulled her closer to tell her something.
<br><br>
I paused for reverence, then asked "What did he say?"
<br><br>
"He said to take his bag to Felwithe to Freegaze at the Traveler's Home Inn."
<br><br>
"His bag?"
<br><br>
I looked around.  Sure enough there was a bag laying in the woods just outside the cave.  Had bandits attacked him then they surely would have made off with his goods.
<br><br>
Inside the bag was an odd assortment of goods.  Jewelry, precious stones, daggers of various design, loose coins, bits of cloth, each item seeming to have not too much to do with the next item.  Into the forest a ways was a shield, splintered from impact.  Amid the cuts and dents were a number of notches.  Our corpse had been a scorekeeper of sorts, perhaps notching his victims.  When I got back into the cave Lotis was sifting through the goods in the bag.
<br><br>
"About thirty platinum worth of goods," she said, "Maybe he was a merchant."
<br><br>
"Not a very smart one to be carrying that much money out here alone."
<br><br>
"And not very well liked," Lotis remarked as she studied the body, "These are all short blade wounds.  Lots of them.  Somebody wanted to make sure he was dead."
<br><br>
"Do we leave him?"
<br><br>
"Yes," I said.  The lack of hesitation seemed to surprise her, as if she were shocked that I wasn't interested in carrying a dead man across greater Faydark.  "Nobody is looking for him," I said.
<br><br>
"How do you know?"
<br><br>

Felwithe is one of my favorite places.  I like Kaladim for the simplicity of it.  Qeynos is home and therefore I know every inch of it.  Rivervale has a certain 'homieness'.  But with my proclivities known to anyone who has heard my tales before, Felwithe would be a favorite because of its stunning elven women.
<br><br>
Traveler's Home seemed as good an Inn as any in which to put ourselves up, so we went there directly upon crossing the bridge and passing the guards.
<br><br>
An elven gentleman stood just inside the front door, behind a counter.
<br><br>
"Hello traveler, would you look like you can use a brandy," he said.
<br><br>
"Beg your pardon?"
<br><br>
"Oh, I'm sorry.  I have a bad habit of selling whatever I've just gotten in stock.  What can I do for you?"
<br><br>
"We encountered a man in the Faydark who was dying.  He told us to bring his goods to Freegaze."
<br><br>
I set the bag upon the counter, unopened.
<br><br>
"Oh… um… I see.  Let me get him for you.  One moment," he said and then stepped into the next room.
<br><br>
It was about thirty seconds that we stood there before a number of individuals came through the door.  They were heavily armored, and numbered among them the man who had just been behind the counter.  All had their weapons drawn.
<br><br>
"Kill our friend, will ya," said the tallest.
<br><br>
Lotis started to reach for her weapon until I reached over and stopped her.  Last thing I wanted to do was brawl with these mercenaries.  They were obviously quite well armed and were ready for us, most likely with their magics and wards already cast for protection.
<br><br>
"We've killed no one," I said, calmly.
<br><br>
"We know better, murderers.  Prepare to die."
<br><br>
I looked them over.  A motley bunch, but certainly enough to kill us several times over.
<br><br>
"What if I can prove to you that we did not do this deed you claim."
<br><br>
"Nothing you can say will get you out of this, slayer," said another.
<br><br>
"But what if I could?"
<br><br>
They paused a moment and then the one who had been at the front desk said, "how would you prove it?"
<br><br>
I stepped forward slowly and dumped the bag out onto the counter top.  The items clattered and spread.
<br><br>
"What do you see here?"
<br><br>
"Quite a bit of stuff," said one of them.
<br><br>
"Indeed.  Why would we kill him and then give up all the goods he was carrying?"
<br><br>
"To remove suspicion," said another, "You've probably already stashed what you wanted.  You're just turning this over to either assuage your guilt or to prove to us that you are not murderers."
<br><br>
"An interesting theory," I said, "So what sorts of goods do you think we took?"
<br><br>
One of them stepped forward and began to paw through the pile.
<br><br>
"There are no platinum pieces here.  Just copper and a couple dented pieces of silver."
<br><br>
"Go on," I said.
<br><br>
"A dagger is missing.  It's quite ornate.  He was bringing it here to sell it to me."
<br><br>
"I see.  Was this dagger perhaps enchanted?"
<br><br>
"Indeed it was.  He was a cleric.  He opted toward the blunt weapons, so he wanted to sell this blade."
<br><br>
"Worth a great deal was it?"
<br><br>
"More money than you'll live to see," he said as he raised his sword to my chin.
<br><br>
"Have you all been expecting him?  All been waiting for him here?"
<br><br>
"We knew he'd be here today.  Now we're through with you delaying us."
<br><br>
They circled us and began to adopt attack postures.
<br><br>
"Can we say some last words?  It's least you can do.  The world will never heard our voices again after this day, right?"
<br><br>
"Make your statement," the innkeeper said after a pause.
<br><br>
"Oh, I'm not the one who'll be making the statement," I said and looked to Lotis.
<br><br>
She, naturally, was very puzzled and trying to figure out what I was doing.
<br><br>
"Say that prayer.  You know the one.  In Blackburrow, the prayer you said over the bodies of those three fallen adventurers we found."
<br><br>
Now she was really confused.  Especially since she was no cleric.  Lotis was indeed a Wizard.  She searched her memory for what she might have done in Blackburrow.  Three bodies.  Prayer.  No, not a prayer… A spell.  She said a spell over their bodies.
<br><br>
She spoke the words and gestured lightly.  Within seconds there was a glow coming from the hand of one of our captors.  We all stood there looking at his mailed fist, which clutched a dagger that had been wrapped in cloth to cover the pommel and grip.
<br><br>
They all looked at him.  And after a few moments his eyes began to change from sharp, accusing points of darkness to wide black shields of fear.  He stepped back and they followed him.  He dropped the dagger and began to plead with them.
<br><br>
"Costly," one of them said, "You.  You would slay a fellow guild member for a weapon?"
<br><br>
A stream of incoherent pleas escaped his lips in such a rapid succession as to make them incoherent.  He looked like a buck at an archer convention.
<br><br>
One of the men motioned us towards the door and we were gone before the first bit of blood was spilt.
<br><br>
"How did you know his friend had killed him," Lotis asked me.
<br><br>
"I didn't.  But it seemed to me that when he was first to volunteer a reason as to why we would return the goods that perhaps he was supplying us with his own alibi.  And when they said a dagger was missing and that's what he held, well that kind of cinched it."
<br><br>
She smiled and looked at the sky, "It's getting late again."
<br><br>
"Find a nice cave?" I asked mockingly, and we set off in search of another Inn in Felwithe.
