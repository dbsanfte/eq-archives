Some recent events have brought the issue of in-game versus out of game knowledge foremost in my mind.  First, I bought Diablo for Playstation, and have played it steadily for about 2 weeks. Second, I had an incredible adventure with my AD&D group.  Third, but not last, was EQVault's decision to not publish in-game tips.  These things reminded my of why I play, and how it is sometimes easy to think that making a game easier is making a game more fun.
<br><br>
	I started playing Diablo with a friend on his Playstation, and we were doing pretty well until we hit the 10th level of the church.  There, every time we stepped foot on the 10th level , about 10 lightning demons were there, and before we could do anything, we were dead within about 10 seconds.  We went back to our last save point and stocked up just for the lightning demon encounter, and tried again.  No luck.  The lightning bolts were so numerous that even having a 60% lightning resistance wasn't enough.  We saved our characters, out of game, and decided to do something we had been avoiding:  we passed gold from one character to another, saving the characters when they had all the gold.  We rapidly built up over 100,000 gold, and started a new game.
<br><br>
	What a game that was!  We rushed to the blacksmith's to buy the best equipment money could buy, then the witches for spells and mana potions, then loaded up on healing potions at the healers.  Maxed to the gills, nothing could stop us.  We reveled in our ability to toast those pesky lightning demons which had once plagued us, and wiped everything out.  It wasn't until we had overcome all obstacles that we realized we really had lost the mystery and fun that comes with risking your character's life.  Since everything we encountered could do nothing against our ability to inflict damage and heal quickly, nothing challenged us.
<br><br>
	Late that week that same friend ran our semi-weekly AD&D adventure.  In it, our mid level group ran across a group of high-level Drow multi-classed characters who had a part of an artifact we were seeking, and they nearly wiped us out.  Multiple darkness spells blinded us, and flamestrikes from a high level Drow cleric almost killed several members of the party.  I had not played against Drow in years, and had forgotten their abilities, so each new challenge we faced from our enemies pushed us to rise to the occasion.  Finally, after creative use of spells and using the tunnels of the dungeon as cave-in obstacles, we triumphed.  Three party members were at one hit point, our toughest tank fighter was in negative hit points, but alive, and we had only two spells left between six spell casters.
<br><br>
	We were elated!  We had overcome overwhelming odds with cleverness, foresight and determination.  The character that had been hit by two flamestrikes survived because, for some reason, he felt he should cast resist fire on himself before he walked into the cavern where the Drow cleric waited in darkness.  It was one of the best gaming sessions we had had for a while, and we are still talking about it 2 weeks later.
<br><br>
	On the heels of that gaming session came the EQVault decision to not publish in-game information, quest hints, etc.  I applaud them for having the strength to do what I did not do with Diablo, which is to let the wonder of the game world challenge me.  Game knowledge is good if you earn it yourself, instead of read it from a web-page.  I have followed game tips from other games when I was stuck, and had no one to help me through it.  I have also followed game tips from the start to finish of a game, and spent more time making sure I "followed the directions" than learning what the game was about.  I "won" the game, but would have been better off attaching a joystick to a fantasy novel.
<br><br>
	Statistics sites which analyze in-game performance also stop our curiosity and desire to try new things.  Everyone in UO used halberds, now they use bows, simply because it's the "best".  I tried for weeks to run a sword and shield characters, and wound up having to hunt down highly magical items  to stay competitive.  I wish we could return to a more balanced "yes, this weapon is good, and so is this one" sort of feel.  Why even have multiple weapons if no one uses them.  What happens to those enduring fantasy images of the dagger of a rogue, or the mighty axe of a dwarf?
<br><br>
	When/if we get into beta-testing, let's carry that spirit with us.  We are not trying to "win" the beta-test.  Our characters will probably be wiped on an almost daily basis, so let's spend our time making sure that everyone "wins" - that we have a good game world, bug-free (if that's possible), with an environment that keeps us in a state of wonder.  Once we get in the game, let's not create our own hell of boredom because we read too many web sites, and made a world where nothing surprises us.   We'll have no-one but ourselves to blame for being bored in a world as fascinating as Everquest appears it will be.
