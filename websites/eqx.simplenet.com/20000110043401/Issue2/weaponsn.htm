We can agree on one thing it seems, and that is the fact&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's&nbsp; too&nbsp; soon to say for sure&quot;. </FONT></A>

<FONT FACE="Arial">On the topic of weapons we have discussed the amount of training it takes  to  &nbsp;&nbsp; become &nbsp;  potent   in   a weapon &nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how &nbsp;&nbsp;useful &nbsp;&nbsp;that weapon is in certain&nbsp; situations. It started with pikes and polearms, which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be weapons &nbsp;used against mounted troops &nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  good   weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;  in &nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;melee &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fight. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Polearms,   &nbsp;like   the &nbsp;halberd, are &nbsp;&nbsp;  useful for about one strike or less before the opponent closes within (under) &nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp; range&nbsp; of&nbsp; the &nbsp;sharp end.&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; &nbsp;that &nbsp;&nbsp; point &nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; normal</FONT>
</TD><TD valign="top" style="text-align: justify" WIDTH=237><FONT FACE="Arial"> weapon could be used for combat. It could be as simple as not putting polearms in the game, but what about mounted combat?</FONT> 
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">If there are horses in the game and assuming that riding the horse gives <I>any</I> combat bonus at all the polearm becomes a viable weapon for defence against mounted charges. A long spear would do horrendous damage to the attacker, as well any polearm. Mounted soldiers vs foot soldiers has historically been about what weapons who was using. The same could apply to magical mounts, like Unicorns, Pegasi, Nightmares, Wolves, Griffins, Dragons, etc. I tell you I would rather fight a charging dragon with a real long sharp spear than a sword unless he&nbsp;was&nbsp;already</FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the same discussions is the issue of training. Should a non-warrior be able to learn a weapon skill? A few weeks training in a pike or polearm is about all you would need to use it, since there is no great mastery to poking someone with it. Historically polearms were used by the non-combat troops like farmers and children to kill as many mounted enemies as possible when charged. The conventional weapons are a different story. While two weeks of training in a sword is far better than none, it takes many years to become a warrior like out of classic role playing games.<BR>
