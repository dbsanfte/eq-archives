Kul'Taron stood by the city gates, waiting for admittance into the small town of Grobb. He was the basic stereotype of a Dark Elf, blue skin, white hair, sharp features, and he usually carried an evil grin. He was sweating horribly, and fidgeting with his fingers, but luckily no one noticed. He had never really had any human friends, the only ones he met were on a battlefield, right before he killed them. His lack of interaction with them made him think they would see him as being out of place. Though he was selected to do this job countless times, he still believed they would see him as a threat. Luckily, he was one of the few in their group that didn't look nefarious. Battles were one thing, he could fight them half asleep, after all, he had been fighting his entire life. He even fancied himself as their best warrior. His small minded troll and ogre friends had decided for themselves that size was everything, so he was given the job of getting the rest of the group into the towns and cities that had protective walls, even though he knew that cunning was something he lacked. 
<br><br>
"Welcome to the city of Grobb" bellowed the guard, as he ordered the gates to be raised. The two gnome slaves slowly began the pain staking process of raising the gates. If only they knew the size of the army of trolls that was waiting patiently by the forest's edge. The gates appeared old, and their levers were definitely not the easiest to use. At last the gate was raised, and the two exhausted gnomes drearily walked to the guard for their next order. Perhaps after this is over we can have two new additions, Kul'Taron thought. He walked forward in awe, the towers, which seemed so small before now appeared to touch the very sky. Merchants desperately trying to sell more than the others beside them were in a constant battle for customers, and people were swarming the streets carrying their newly bought valuables. Elation filled Kul'Taron, finally a town that would be worth the effort.  Memories of the villages destroyed in the past flooded through his mind. He was so distracted he almost forgot his purpose. Remembering his purpose once again, he began casting the spell he had previously been memorizing. Several people turned their attention to the chanting Dark Elf, but he kept on with the spell. 
<br><br>
A burst of flame appeared in the air, sending forth waves of fire, melting even the stone on the ground while horribly burning and disfiguring all around it, with the exception of Kul'Taron. A being of pure fire developed from the flame and began listening to its master's orders. The bell tower began ringing, and its tone was one which hadn't been heard for what seemed like a year. The guards that had been patrolling the streets barely recognized it; as no major threat had presented itself for over three months. They all rushed towards the entrance to the town, just in time to see the fire elemental shot forth fireballs of such fury that the once magnificent buildings fell without even putting up a fight. A wave of people stormed the elemental, only to be warded off by the heat and spurts of lava it emitted. The temperatures of the elemental were to great to have it attacked by steel. Valix stepped forward, she was not the most seasoned of warriors, but she was the most capable of taking out this abomination. She pulled out her claymore and rushed the beast.  It counteracted with a burst of flame, but she kept on. Slashing at the elemental with all her strength she merely scratched it. The elemental seemed to be annoyed by her, in the way that humans are with insects. A wave of lava shot forth from the elemental and overwhelmed her, sending her flying back into the crowd. Her armor hinting with the stench of burnt flesh, and the steam flowing forth from it like a volcano, somehow managed to hold together. Valix once again stood up, her hair had been singed from her head, leaving her bald. This time she was not so foolish as to rush into a fight with such a powerful being. She chanted the words of her greatest spell, and her sword seemed to immediately cool, and took on an almost pleasant look in the middle of this disaster. She ran at the elemental, and with one swipe of her sword decapitated it. 
<br><br>
This was the first time in her life enchanting had helped her. All the self-loathing for being useless was washed away. All those years that she had been put down, and told her place was in the market helping real warriors enhance their strengths lost its meaning. Her world of tranquillity was suddenly disturbed by Kul'Taron, rushing towards the city gates. Valix quickly grabbed a bow from one of the guards but it, along with the rest of them, had been damaged in the fight, its wood was warped and the string was broken. She began to charge at him, but Kul'Taron had already opened the city gates which had been half closed. Everyone present assumed he was trying to escape and if it weren't for the panic stricken guard, frozen with fear in the tower above, they would have known differently. Dozens of Trolls and Ogres began storming Grobb, pouring through the open gate like a river. Warriors of all types drew their weapons and rushed to meet the onslaught. A Troll made one sweep of his club, taking out the entire first row. Their sheer strength and size gave them a huge advantage in this fight. Valix once again raised her sword to battle when the blackness came. She dreamed a beautiful dream. She was running in a pasture full of flowers and everyone she was even remotely fond of was with her, watching her run and guiding her. It was the most peace she had experienced for as long as she could remember. Not knowing where her destination was she continued to run forward and began to hear Ogre victory chants. As she ran they got louder and louder, till eventually they made her collapse, holding her bleeding ears.
<br><br>
She awoke, startled, sweating, with an enormous headache and Kul'Taron staring her in the face, smiling. She reached for her sword but soon discovered her efforts were in vain. She was securely tied down. After seeing her face this reality Kul'Taron let out an evil laugh, his eyes gleaming at her now bloody face. She glanced around and her worst fears were confirmed, she was still in what was once the thriving town of Grobb. Her friends and family's blood ran in the streets and their possessions were now in the hands of the Trolls and Ogres. Kul'Taron was satisfied by the fact that she now realized the truth of what happened, since she missed the fight. The twisted purpose for keeping her alive was now fulfilled and he had no future use for keeping her alive. With the very enchanted sword she had slain his elemental, he slowly slit her throat, watching the sweet blood as it rushed down her chest. No matter how many times he watched the life drain from another being, he never ceased to enjoy it.
