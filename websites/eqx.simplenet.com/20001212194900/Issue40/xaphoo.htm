Temanarku Manitanis, the prophet, was born in the outskirts of Freeport, under a good star to Taraku his father, and Henamelda his mother. It was said that the One God Ma'anu looked upon his birth with a smile, and he sent his spirit in Karana to guide him.  Temanarku spent his younger years in the citadel of Freeport, learning the ways of his fellow human beings, and the ways of the others who frequented his town. Temanarku was intelligent, but not in the ways of the wise men who did magic...Temanarku was curious as a fox, and posessed the temper of a tree sloth. His young mind was fiery as the flaming ships of the Gods he was soon to know. He took to watching the ways of others, but he could not learn them. He instead gained knowledge of the sciences and the places of the world.  
	<br><br>
Nine years passed from his birth, and Temanarku saw the prescence of Ma'anu, two-armed, two-legged, three-livered, with a geometric fire of blue surrounding the Prime Radiant in his center, who spoke to him. 
<br><br>
"With a threatening fist you were conned from your bread, with a rod of ice you were prodded like a toad. Here I show you the Legend that you must live and elaborate, the patterns that must spread, so the threatening fist becomes transparent and the rod of ice becomes legible." 
<br><br>
Young Temanarku was struck by a divine bolt into a deep sleep, which lasted a year and eight days. He dreamed, he dreamed of yellow and white flames, and of a town, and of a mountain to the west of that town, a mountain fog-draped and green as the surface of the ocean in the southlands where the stars are strange, and where the lithe men climb trees and have white faces and black bodies. He dreamed of this mountain, and of a grand tree above the town, which spoke to him again in the voice of Ma'anu.
<br><br>
"Karana you must follow on Earth, as it is how the lesser Norrathi know me, and it is in the form of Karana that I will guide you. Let Logic be your guide." 
<br><br>
Temanarku awoke from his sleep, and continued living in his household as he had before, and as he had during his slumber. He dutifully lived life, but prayed secretly to Karana who granted his prayers. Young Temanarku felt within himself the true flames of goodness and spirit. He was proud. 
<br><br>
In his seventeenth year, his parents and family were stricken by fever, brought to them by the swift wings of the nineteen tiny minions of Cazic-Thule. The fever, slow as evil habitually is, took nine months to bring death to his parents, and in the end his many black minions brought death to his mother and father. Their death was slower even than their sickness, as it lasted thirty-eight years. Their minds had died by then, and their livers no longer pulsed with joy as it had before. 
<br><br>
Temanarku, seeing nothing, melted his gold and gave it to a poor man. He fled to a mountain where eagles lived, and lived among them for one year. The eagles looked at Temanarku, and gave him no evil stares, because they saw that he as well knew Ma'anu. In the gray stone mountains, not so high as to break a boulder if it falls from the summit, he saw brown eagles with green eyes, and yellow eagles with red eyes, all was colored with the expanding fire of Truth. One knew Temanarku, and held to his arm with his shifting and smooth claws, and accompanied Temanarku, called Mani. The man learned the ways of the hunt, and of the arrow.	
<br><br>
Temanarku grew restless, and with his eagle Mani, walked away from the mountain, and travelled by the stars to all corners of Norrath. He spent long years without seeing another man, though troll and elf he saw many. He came to a mountain, a mountain he recognized, in a green land, green as the surface of the ocean in the southlands where the stars are strange, although even greener. And to the east of this mountain he saw a ruined town. Temanarku called this mountain Azuketl, because that name rolled off his tongue like the yolk of a basilisk egg. He called the town Tamanoric, and that was where he made his home for three years. He went to the tree that overlooked the town when he grew restless. He sat. Ma'anu spoke to him again. 
<br><br>
"Now is the Dawn, you will be my friend upon the Earth. You will show them bread, you will melt them with my fire." Ma'anu spoke at length, and Temanarku comprehended all. Temanarku saw what was ahead of him and took the name Manitanis, Friend of Ma'anu. 
<br><br>
Temanarku travelled the world. More than any other man, he knew the wilderness, and spoke the languages of all the myriad Norrathi.  He became known by many as a wanderer, benevolent toward all.  Ma'anu did not speak to him during his life after the encounter, but Temanarku was content.  In the later part of his life it was known that Temanarku was the first human to bring truth to the heathens of Kunark.  There was not a being in Norrath who had not heard of this bearded and grizzled man who travelled alone, or with friends for aid and protection across the plains and mountains. 
<br><br>
His life ended ninety-one years after his birth in Freeport to Taraku and Henamelda.  In the moments of his parting, the beckoning words of Ma'anu were heard clearly in his mind...
