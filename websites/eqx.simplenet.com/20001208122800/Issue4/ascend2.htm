I emphasized player before because the player makes the decision.  The character might not want the change, but the player does.  Nobody really wants to be cursed to the darkness and feeding off the essences of others.  At least I hope not.
<br><br>
But if the player is still enjoying the character he keeps playing.  From then on the "mutate" option will be available.  If he keeps playing he will reach the second threshold level, let's say that it's 50th level.  Now when he logs in and chooses this character he will have three options: mutate, retire, and ascend.  Mutate you already know about.  Let's take the other two.

Retire.  A pretty simple option.  The character retires.  He is no longer under the control of the player.  The player would write a biography for the character explaining the circumstances of the characters retired life.  The character could have been called of by his god to serve that god directly.  Maybe he runs a tavern in his home town.  Maybe he dies of old age.  Perhaps he dies trying to defeat his arch nemesis.  Whatever the player feels is the best way for the character to finish his adventuring career.  A SISA game master will review this document and work with the player to make it fit Norrath and to meet any literary standards that Sony wishes to employ.  Once done, this document joins the history of Norrath.  The character is then available to the game masters as an NPC, perhaps to deliver messages from the characters god, to start quests, or just as a local tavern keeper.  The player is rewarded for the time put into the character this way.  He also gets to start a new character.  This new character would have advantages over other starting characters or would be of a race or class that in otherwise not an option to starting characters, much the same as the mutate option.

Ascension is even more interesting.  If the player chooses to have the character ascend, the character will come to reside on the plane of the gods.  Here this great and powerful adventurer will become the weakest of the residents.  This plane of the gods would exist on its own server.  A place where only very powerful characters get to go, where they interact directly with the gods.  Sort of EQ II.
<br><br>
This would allow people to either continue a great old character in a new situation (mutate), play in a new world where the character ain't so tough any more, or retire the character as a hero and a legend and start a new one with some bonuses.

Well, in the spirit of pre-beta angst that I am suffering waiting for EverQuest, it was nice to indulge in a little "Here's what I want!"  Thanks for reading all the way through it.
