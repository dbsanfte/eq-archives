Ok after reading The Ultimate Geeking Experience I figured I was pretty 
much on par with Razor.  After reading his new article How to Geektify
Your Wife I relized that I'm virtually a clone of Razor (in regards to
his computer habits and problems) and am not alone in this high tech
world. There is someone else out there with a network in their basement.
I have already printed out the article and plan on showing it to everyone
who has made fun of my network.

DashiPrime,
<br><br>
Thanks for your comments.  You are not alone.
<br><br>
I define us as pioneers, and a vision of the future in home networking.
<br><br>
BEWARE:  The invasion of the Geeks is near! Coming to a town near you.

I am not sure why, but the general idea on the irc
and message boards is that people are going to magically roleplay in EQ.
Well time to wake up, it's simply NOT going to happen.  Let me tell you why:
<br><br>
1.  The same kids (I say kids because the fact is most people in UO that
just wanted to exploit/inflict misery upon others were 12 yearolds) that
were assholes in UO are going to be assholes in EQ.  The kids people
assholes in UO are bored of the game just like us and are looking to EQ as
an answer.  Let's face it UO was an experiement to see if Online gaming at a
mass scale was possible, and from that perspective it was successful
(however very unsuccessful in the gameplay perspective, but this is neither
the time nor the place).  People's general feeling towards EQ is that these
kids will be gone, well this is not the case they will be there, not
roleplaying, being assholes.
<br><br>
2.  Some people just prefer not to roleplay.  I am one of these people.
I just don't get any enjoyment from roleplaying.  I know alot of you RPers
are saying, "it's a roleplaying game, if you don't want to roleplay, don't
play the game".  I could give a shit what you think I should do in this game
that I am paying $10 a month for.  Bottom line is it's a game and I want to
have fun playing it and I will play it as I so choose to.
<br><br>
I will say, however, that EQ has the tools to roleplay MUCH easier than UO.
The race concept is being handled beautifully and I really like the idea of
differenet languages for different races.  EQ has more traditional RPG
elements than UO did and I believe SISA will encourage roleplaying, but this
does not mean that the majority will roleplay.  The minority will be the the
roleplayers, I believe.

Greetings,
<br><br>
I must say that I loved Razor's article.  I have been aware of the TCF for
some time, but have never named it.  Now I finally have a way to relate
that concept to my woman, who has grown disgusted with the time I spend on
the computer.  Thankfully this article came out in time to prepare her for
the day Everquest begins, for my computer time will double.  I have been
looking for games she likes for some time, and haven't had a lot of luck. 
She has taken to Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit, but she makes me play with
her, contrary to Razor's suggestion.  It doesn't help that I beat her
consistently.  I guess I'll have to start letting her win.  Unfortunately,
I don't think she will want her own computer just to play Scrabble.  And
faking malfunction would be great, but I have to get my fix...  Maybe a
good follow-up to Razor's article would be a list of games ladies might
prefer.  I don't mean the type of ladies who slug it out with the rest of
us in Quake 2 and Total Annihilation, while offering advice on how to hack
the registry.  I mean the type of ladies whose only twitch reflex is
punching the husband/boyfriend that refuses to give up the TCF to hear
about the type of hair day she had.
<br><br>
Anyway, great article, great issue, great site.
