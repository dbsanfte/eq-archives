Anthiel staggered as the Gating completed, his skin crawling with the feel of the dark magic.  His guards jerked him upright again, their claws digging into his flesh.  He barely noticed.
<br><br>
 They had arrived in a rough chamber, the walls pale stone.  The sound of water echoed softly around them, and to his left, he could see the wavering reflections of diffused light on the walls and ceiling.  D'anok gave orders in a curt voice, sweat beginning to bead his upper lip.  The Gnolls hefted the stone altar and the Teir'dal led the way up a curving tunnel.  When it opened again into another room, larger and airier than the last, he paused for a moment and then forced himself through the portal.  A small sound escaped him, as of pain, and Anthiel realized where they must be.  The Gnolls dragged him through, into Surefall.
<br><br>
Another tunnel, and then another chamber.  Once, they came upon a brown bear, and it roared and charged the invaders.  The shamans killed it in an instant, felling it in a shower of flame, charring it beyond recognition.  Aklar walked like one in a daze, unaware of where they were or what was happening.  As they penetrated deeper, the Dark Elf began to sweat and waver.  The presence of Tunare would be like a heavy burning weight to him, Anthiel knew.  He watched him suffer with grim pleasure.
<br><br>
They came at last to a low doorway.  Through it, Anthiel could see a ramp leading across a deep rift in the rock.  Refracted light from the water below played on the ceiling.  Beyond, the ramp opened into a wide half circle, and there, lumbering to her feet, was an enormous bear.  Wise brown eyes regarded them solemnly.  Anthiel felt sure that she saw and understood everything in that brief moment.
<br><br>
"Mammoth," he whispered.
<br><br>
"Bind her," D'anok rasped.
<br><br>
Sickly green bubbles of light vibrated around the huge bear, trapping her where she stood.  She threw back her head and roared, making the floor shake.
<br><br>
"Silence her!"  A shaman gestured swiftly, and she choked, mighty voice dying in her throat.  "Set up the altar in front of her.  Quickly!"  The slab of black stone was swiftly brought forward, turned three times counter-clockwise, and laid before the bear.   The shamans took up positions around it, arranging themselves in a circle that took in the bear, D'anok, and the two captives.  Anthiel and Aklar were forced to their knees in front of the altar.  
<br><br>
Behind them, the High Shaman hastened in, two commanders and a score of guardsmen at his back.
<br><br>
"What kept you?"  D'anok's tone was light, but his eyes could have melted steel.
<br><br>
"There were difficulties," began the Shaman, but the Teir'dal cut him off.
<br><br>
"Never mind your difficulties.  Time grows short.  Lets us begin."  The Shaman's eyes narrowed.  His upper lip lifted in a silent snarl, and he stepped forward menacingly.
<br><br>
"We are partners in this, My Lord," he hissed.  "You might find it in your best interest to show a little respect."
<br><br>
"Well, well," said D'anok, and if he had been angry before, now he burned with a rage that was nearly palpable.  "Aren't we brave all of a sudden.  Remember, my <em>partner</em>," he spat.  "Once the ritual is begun, Tunare's touch here will falter, and my powers return.  So think of the future.  You might find it in <em>your</em> best interests."
<br><br>
The Shaman growled deep in his throat, but when a Gnoll stepped forward, gripping his spear, he motioned him back with a sharp gesture.  D'anok had already turned away.
<br><br>
"Well, I had planned on using your charming friend for this, but now I think she may serve another purpose.  And so, my High cousin, that leaves you."  D'anok drew out the obsidian knife.  He held it before Anthiel, turning it back and forth.  The light ran down the blade in ripples as it moved.  Anthiel could not seem to take his eyes from it.  "It needs blood, cousin.  The consecrated blood of a benevolent God's devotee.  I think that you qualify."
<br><br>
The shamans began to chant in low voices.  The High Shaman stepped up to the altar, and took out a heavy book.  It was bound in pale leather, and held shut with black iron clasps.  With a shudder, Anthiel realized that the leather was undoubtedly Dwarf skin, a tradition in Neriak.  The Shaman laid it on the altar, and opened it.  Raising his arms, he began to chant, his voice riding over the other shamans'.  The two rhythms combined strangely, set Anthiel's teeth on edge, and then built until his ears ached.  His heart labored to beat, drawn into the irregular pulse.  Even Aklar, distant as she was, began to suck in her breath as though in pain.
<br><br>
Then, mercifully, it was over.  The Shaman fell silent, as did his lesser counterparts. The air was charged now with a heavy stillness.  Anthiel waited fearfully.  D'anok nodded to Anthiel's guards.  "One gripped his hair and wrenched his head back.  He squeezed his eyes shut, and prepared his soul to meet Rodcet Nife.
<br><br>
The knife touched the skin above his right eye, paused, and bit deeply.  He smothered a cry of pain.  Blood ran down his face as the Dark Elf dragged the tip of the knife across his brow and down his cheek, laying it open.  The knife hummed like a greedy cat as Anthiel's blood touched it.  D'anok stepped away.
<br><br>
Anthiel opened his eyes as the guard released his hair, lowered his chin to see D'anok hand the bloodied instrument to the High Shaman.  Blood ran into his eye, and through the red haze he couldn't seem to blink away, he saw the High Shaman gesture grandly.  Mammoth was forced down by the invisible bonds, rolled onto her side and then her back.  Her head was pressed to the altar, throat exposed.  Her eyes rolled, and she dragged air in painfully, great sides heaving.  A pitiful moaning came from her as the Shaman raised the knife high in the air.  Crackles and sparks began to crawl across the blade where Anthiel's blood was smeared.  Aklar began to moan as well.  She and Mammoth sounded eerily alike, a dreadful harmony of fearful expectation.
<br><br>
The Shaman glanced down at the book and shouted guttural words.  The knife flashed and began to glow blackly, a glow that was an absence of light, an aberration that hurt the eyes.  He lowered it slowly to Mammoth's neck, his whole arm trembling.
<br><br>
"Do it," said D'anok harshly, his entire body rigid and twitching with anticipation.  The High Shaman sucked in a ragged breath, and sliced the blade jaggedly across.
<br><br>
Aklar screamed, a sound that seemed torn from her very soul.  The bear's blood fountained out, spraying the Gnoll and the Dark Elf.  The Shaman backed away, but the Elf plunged his hands into the rush, face ecstatic.  The red liquid spattered the altar, and the Shaman snatched the book up as he retreated.  The tide of red spread over the expanse of stone and ran onto the floor.  Mammoth shuddered and was still.  Aklar staggered to her feet, tearing away from the grip of her guards.  The room shook.  Wind howled in through the door, whipping at hair and clothing.  It rose higher and higher, until all that could be heard was it's shriek.  Aklar reached out with a hand that seemed possessed.  Her fingertips hovered above the pooled blood.  She threw back her head and screamed again, her voice lost in the wind.  The Gnolls covered their ears with their paws, bent double, mouths open in soundless wails. Anthiel crouched on the ground, face distorted.  Aklar flung her head back and forth in denial, fighting to keep from touching the gory altar.  D'anok turned from the hulk of the dead bear.  Blood covered him from head to toe, streaked through his silver hair and soaking his clothes.  A terrible smile could be seen through his mask of gore.
<br><br>
He reached across the altar and laid one wet hand on her forehead.
<br><br>
Asleep in the cell, Aklar had fallen back into the dark void.   Dreams of the Tree broken and withered, of D'anok laughing amid the ruins of Surefall, of all that she knew and loved turned to ashes on the wind...her dreams set her fleeing.  She sought the heart of herself again, that sleek, slick wall that held her from the Goddess.  She'd been safe.  When the Gnolls had come, she'd only closed herself off, huddled against the barrier, and they had not been able to touch her.  Even D'anok's voice, dimly heard, could not reach her.
<br><br>
Then, in the deep recesses of her soul, she had again heard the voice of the Goddess.
<br><br>
<em>It is time now, my child</em>, it had sighed.  The wall vanished, melting away.  The light flooded out.  She knew fear then, a panicky scuttling retreat, but the glow of the Goddess's presence was all around her, and there was nowhere that the Goddess was not.
<br><br>
<em>I fear, my daughter.  I greatly fear</em>.
<br><br>
<em>What?</em>  Aklar fled for the surface, for the outside world.  She didn't understand, and she was in no way prepared for the enormity of what was happening.  
<br><br>
<em>I fear that you are not ready</em>...
<br><br>
That was when she felt more than heard Mammoth's muted cries of helpless fright.  She cried out in unison with her, feeling suddenly as if it was her own body that was trapped, her breath stifled in her lungs.  The knife was at her throat, and fear swelled like a tidal wave.  
<br><br>
The shock of the blade tearing through, letting out Mammoth's life in a gush of vital red, flung her out of the depths of her being into the world around her.  Still linked to Mammoth, for one instant she was both bound and dying on the altar and witnessing it with horror.  She screamed, feeling herself torn in two, ripped asunder in the wake of the great bear's death.  The wind howled in and she knew it was Tunare, summoned by the death of her living manifestation.   Her body was not her own.  She stepped stiffly toward the altar, and her hand lowered slowly toward Mammoth's blood.
<br><br>
<em>No!</em> She begged.
<br><br>
<em>Do you love me?</em>  The Goddess was weeping.
<br><br>
Aklar threw back her head and shrieked again, whipping her head in futile denial.  Then D'anok's hand was on her forehead, and the world became a blinding, spinning whirl of light.
