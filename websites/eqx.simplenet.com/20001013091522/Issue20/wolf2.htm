I shushed her.  The pain of what she had witnessed was too great.  I waited and
soothed her.  Soon she passed out.  I was afraid she would never awake again.  But I
still held her.  I looked down at her face.  The world would be lesser without her.
She was fair, her skin light and her hair dark.  Her eyes were of the deepest green,
though her lids were closed.  And she was a priestess of the Quellious.  Or at least
I guessed so by the shortness of her hair and the style of her sandals.  Quellians
often chose such simple but durable trappings.

seek shelter.  Certainly the beast was beyond our power to defeat.  But as we headed
for the inn, it howled again.  Orm was certain that he knew where the sound came
from.  He drew his blade and ran off after it.  I tried to keep up, but no one can
keep up with Orm at a run.  Orm is a great warrior, and I guess he thought he could
defeat the creature.  I think we both knew that it would never stop hunting us.
