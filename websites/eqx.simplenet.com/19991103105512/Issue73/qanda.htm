<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest. We cannot answer questions about payment

the game. This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only. Thank you for 
understanding.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a place I can find a full listing of pet commands?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they are in the manual.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confused.  Everybody tells me that if a creature cons lower than blue (green for instance), I cannot gain any experience. However, I just took a trip to Butcherblock (from Freeport) and many things that con green to me are giving me experience.  What gives?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can gain experience from things that con green, but not much. However, as you gain more levels, more and more monsters will con green, and most will not give you any experience.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to name all 8 of your characters the same name?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No two characters on the same server can have the same name.  The only way to have multiple characters with the same name is to play them all on different servers.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it still possible to fight the gods? I've seen screen shots of a big fight vs Innoruuk, but I haven't actually SEEN a god myself. So where can you find them?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not exist in the game such that you can go to their lair and kill them. When the gods visit the lands of Norrath, it is only through an event run by the GMs and Guides. The gods are controlled by real people, which should make the roleplaying experience especially fun. 

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard something about a calendar you guys did. Where can I find it?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Girls of Norrath calendar can be found <A HREF="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/Issue65/index.htm">here</A>. No word yet on the Men of Norrath.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some weapons of Norrath, such as the dagger and the short sword, attack more frequently than others. Would your one handed slashing skill increase quicker with a short sword than with a bastard sword?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer is yes. The reason is because you get more swings in the same amount of time, and thus more chances for your skill to increase.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to put some money or equipment with a Banker, let's say in Halas, and have another character you have to be able to retrieve it?  For example, have my high level barbarian leave money for my low level paladin at any bank. Is that possible?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, only the character who deposited items into the bank can withdraw those items.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I see on the daily screenshots on many of the EverQuest-related web sites that there is an in-game command to take a screenshot.  What is this command?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in the manual, the '-' key on the numeric keypad will take a screenshot and store it as a BMP file in your EverQuest directory.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does cancel magic remove charming effects on your group members?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has the potential to. Like other spell effects, the strength of the original spell and the strength of the cancel magic spell have a direct impact on whether the dispel will succeed. Since NPCs who charm players are typically quite high level, it may be pretty difficult to cancel the effect.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a level 11 rogue. My pierce skill is quite high as I've used it almost exclusively due to the fact that it is the only type available for stabbing backs. I would like to improve some other weapon skills. Can I improve these other skills attacking creatures that /con green to me? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can only gain combat skills by fighting creatures stronger than green. If you are starting from scratch, you will likely need a nice group who will let you swing at stronger creatures without letting you die.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do PvPers and duelers gain any experience from fighting other players, and can they gain skill increases while fighting them?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, and it's a good thing. The potential for abuse would be too great if this were allowed to happen.

<BR><BR>

<B>Corrections</B><BR>
There has been much confusion regarding the "green rule".  Here is the real info:
<UL>
<LI>Any monster 66% of your level will remain aggressive, from 1st through 50th.
<LI>Any creature that is 18th level or higher will ALWAYS be aggressive to players, regardless of the player level.
</UL>
The two rules do not contradict, a 17th level mob will remain aggressive to a 22nd level player, but not to a 23rd (the 33 percent spread).  An 18th level mob will attack a 50th level player.

<P>This was to make dungeons more challenging, and to prevent high level players from just waltzing down to a loot mob.  They're forced to fight in, and fight out now.
