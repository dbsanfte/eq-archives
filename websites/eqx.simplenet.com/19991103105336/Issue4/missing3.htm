    align="JUSTIFY"><big><big>I</big></big> awoke somewhat stunned this morning.  I had just had the longest dream yet.  Vivid!  It is like I am living two lives.  So far I prefer the sleeping one to the waking.  Though the waking has improved.  After what must have been a month of this terrible treatment I awake to find it all changed.   The horrendous food, that I always suspected was drugged, is gone.  In its place some fresh fruit of a kind that I can not fully recognize, and some very warm bread.  It was not much.  But it was more than I could eat at one time.  It seems that my body is not ready for too much real food at this time.  And fresh water!  Not only enough to drink, but enough to wash myself with.  After this long I can only imagine how poorly I smell.  I, of course, have grown used to it.  The hard, cold floor, is still here.  But there is a small cot with a heavy blanket in a corner.  There is also a small lamp.  I can actually see!  The lamp is curious.  It is obviously magical.  It gives off a small, warm light.  Easily enough to read by.  What is odd, though, is its shape.  You know that I have studied the items of our world and a few others.  I have seen the craftsmanship of many lands.  And this item is from our home!  It is similar to the lamp that was by our bed  Least surprising is that they have also given me more parchment and ink.<p>

<p align="justify">I am left to wonder why?  At least I think I know how.  I suspect that none of what I experienced to this moment was at all real.  I think that this room has always looked as it does now, but they have prevented me from seeing it.  That, or none of what I see now is real.  My captors must be masters of illusion.  That would explain, at least in part, the method of my capture.  I had been traveling alone.  The device that brought me across the planes stopped glowing immediately upon my arrival.  I knew I would not get home without help.  I walked that island until darkness fell.  It was absolutely silent.  Lush vegetation with no animals?  It did not seem right.  I suspect now that my captors simply left this detail out of their illusion.  Either they wanted to simplify the vision or they simply did not think I would notice the lack of animals.  But as odd as the place was, I searched it all day long for three days.  I could not find the hidden cave that I sought.  On the third night I awoke with a start to find myself in this prison.  The power required to do this is disturbing.</p>

<p align="justify">They also must have some ability to influence the sleeping mind.  I still dream about that other world.  Since the dreams are all that are new in my life these days I shall describe them to you.</p>

    <td valign="top" style="text-align: justify" width="34%"><font face="boldPS" size="3"><p align="JUSTIFY">They call their world Norrath.  It seems like a fresh place.  That's the best word I can find, fresh.  It all seems new, even the ancient, craggy mountains.  It must just be that I am new to it.  But it is refreshing to be a part of a world at its start.  When I was born our world was ancient.  It seemed to be, well, heavy.  This one is light and free.  In my dreams I am young again.  Not myself, exactly, but not far from it.  Absor of Norrath is a half elf.  His appearance is similar to my own:  long brown hair (remember my youth, our youth?), green eyes (a bit sharper than my pale ones), nearly six feet tall and lean.  His past differs from mine, but again only slightly.  He was, unlike myself, loved by both of his parents.  He spent his youth in between the society of humans and elves.  He has just finished training under a famous minstrel.  In this incarnation I am not only a good musician, but I have a fantastic singing voice!  That, of course, is how I know that this is only a dream.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">It seems that this young Absor, this other me, is only just about to start on his journey.  I feel the excitement that I once knew when I first traveled alone.  I can't wait to tell you how it goes.  And I will do so as soon as the journey begins…</p>
