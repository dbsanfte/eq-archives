<B>Please Note:</B> EverQuest Express is not the official voice of Verant
Interactive, makers of EverQuest. We cannot answer questions about payment 
methods, hardware requirements (i.e. video cards), or technical details about 
the game. This Q&A is meant to cover gameplay issues only. Thank you for 
understanding.

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Magicians summoned things (Food, Water, Bandages...) disappear at Logout or disconnect. But do they also disappear, if the Magician have traded them to another Player and then the Magician logged out. Does the other Player still have that summoned things after logout of the Magician?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the summoned item is in the possession of the other player, it will not disappear when the mage logs out.  However, the items WILL disappear when the player logs.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be getting new computer in a few weeks. What do I need to do to have a smooth migration. Which files if any do I need to bring over.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Since your character files are kept not in your computer but at Verant, all you will have to do is re-install Everquest.  All your hotkeys will have to be reset though.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there such thing as the elemental plane of Fear, and Hate etc? In the beta I started on Xegony because a friend told me the plane of Fear had been recently implemented upon this server. What are these planes and where are they?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The elemental planes  (Air, Fear and Hate, so far) are just zones like any other in the game, but they are not accessible except through special portals.  No portals have been implemented yet, and so there is no way to get there as of yet.  

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;You ever bin ta Lake Rathetear, lad?  Dey has dese little boats parked at da docks.  I wuz jus' wundrin' if dere was any w ay ta gets 'em ta move?  I be tired o' swimmin'.  No wunder all da weaps is rusty...
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rowboats are tricky lil critters.  To operate one, get into the boat, then right click on it.  You should get a message saying "You have the helm, captain" or some similar bit of silliness.  Then just move as if you were walking, (ie. the forward button,etc.)  and the boat will move.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent EQ Express - 72 I think, at the bottom there is an errata which states that green creatures will not attack characters below level 18. But that above level 18 they'll suddenly develop aggressive tendencies and attack. Apparently to prevent characters from walking through the 'easier' parts of dungeons to camp the nasty creatures below.
<br>
My question is: If greens are suddenly going to start attacking level 40's etc, isn't this just going to make it harder for those who're around the 'greens' level? If a level 30 paladin walks through your level 15 dungeon floor, he's gonna have to wipe them out, 'cos they're going to be attacking him.
<br><br>
Furthermore, are we going to start seeing trains of wasps following a level 20 wizard to the gates of Felwithe, because a) he's walking home and b) he simply can't be bothered to stop, turn around fight them and continue. They're never going to hit him anyway...
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long answer, but the short one is:  above lvl 18, any mob that is 66% of your level will be aggressive to you.  So your wasps and such will never attack a lvl 20 Wizard, and the lvl 30 paladin won't have to worry about those lvl 15 mobs.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How many orcs does it take to change your faction rating, so that a troll can enter Freeport?  I gained levels 9,10,11 almost entirely on orcs and I'm still attacked by the guards.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, depending on your choice of god, faction adjustments can take a long long time.  In your case, because you are a troll, a race hated by humans, it may take even longer to get them to even glower dubiously.   As for how many orcs exactly?  Umm, how many orcs are there?

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep seeing people that are charmed, in your last issue you talked about breaking charms with cancel.  My question is:  Does charm wear off if given time?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, charm does wear off, but it takes a while, and most times the charmer has killed you in some unpleasant and inventive fashion before it has a chance to.  It is possible to negate Charm with Cancel Magic, but because most charmers are high level, it is not that likely that the spell will work.  I've seen it happen, though , with the Evil Eyes in the Gorge of King Zorb.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I have a question about the spell 'Lull'. I play a Paladin and was grouped with another Paladin the other day who kept casting 'Lull' in battle. I was under the impression that the spell made creatures less aggressive and decreased their 'excitability' range. The other Paladin said he was under the impression that it also reduced a creature's number of attacks (if multiple) per 'round' by one. I've used the spell to calm a room full of creatures and pull one out without firing off a train, but I'm dubious about it having any effect if used during combat against the creature(s) you have already engaged. Any info would be appreciated.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, "lull" is a spell that does one thing...calms creatures so that you can pull others and not get them all coming down on you at once.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I be considered as a candidate for the next Girls of Norrath calendar?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No plans are in the making for another calendar, but if we do one, we'll keep you in mind =)

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are quests given based on the char. level?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.  If you are not high enough to do the quest, they will tell you at some point that they need a more experienced person, and if you are too low, they will say that it is too trivial an affair for you.  Or words to that effect.

<br><br>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any way to just have a non-adventurous character in Norrath? I mean, can you build less needed skills with out having to battle beasts or go on dangerous quests? Like, you have a character who just wants to hang out in a bar but cant build his alcohol tolerance because he never levels.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, no, Norrath is a land of adventure, and that is what you must do to advance: adventure
