<p style="text-align: justify">


	The old Dark Elf squatted in the concealing shadows of the forest just
	outside the southern walls of Oggok. This was the difficult part, finding
	Groal. As much as Jarel detested all things magic, it appeared he had no
	choice but to summon again those considerable skills he had so long held
	in abeyance.
<br><br>
 	Clearing away the newly fallen leaves before him, he began a casting. It
	had been many years since he had practiced these accursed arts but his
	great skills had not diminished through unuse. His finger traced a
	strange design in the damp loam and he began a quiet incantation in a
	tongue so ancient not even he understood the words or their meaning. He
	knew their effect, however, and as silver and red threads of brilliance
	started from his outstreched hands, he felt the familiar thrill of <em>Power</em>; ribbons of blood and moonlight bled from his fingertips like waterfalls of diamond and ruby into the choatic pattern, making an unearthly sigil in the soil. The magic moved with a life of its own, it's colors pouring into the shallow grooves like  streams of dancing metallic lava, overflowing and then melding into a swirling disc of shining veridian that glistened beneath the forest's mottled shadows. The pool darkened and visions took shape within it. Jarel peered at the gathering images and he saw Groal walking up a shallow incline, his feet splashing in the liquid detritus flowing slowly past and behind him. He was apparently following someone deep beneath the streets of the city for Jarel could see a shadow dancing ahead, cast by the light of the lamp Groal held at arms length. He whispered into the glittering pool of alizerian silver.
<br><br>
	"<em>Groal. I have come.</em>"
<br><br>
	Groal stopped in midstep, almost dropping the lamp. "Jarel?" He looked about him, seeking the owner of that well known voice. "Where are you?" He heard the silence ahead of him as Dalgra too stopped.
<br><br>
	"What? Who are you talking to?"
<br><br>
	"Shh. It is my master."
<br><br>
	"You are a slave?"
<br><br>
	"No. I mean my teacher. My…father. My friend. I heard him speak just now."
<br><br>
	"It is only the sound of the wind in the catacombs, Groal. We are alone. Don't let your fear affect your mind now. We are close to the outside. I can smell it."
<br><br>
	"I am not afraid. But I heard him speak."
<br><br>
	"Impossible. These walls are too thick."
<br><br>
	"It came from nearby. He must have followed me in here somehow. He is very resourceful. But I don't see how……"
<br><br>
	"<em>Groal. I am outside the city. It is time to finish this. I will meet you at the Southern Gates.</em>"
<br><br>
	"I am on my way there now, Jarel." He looked up the tunnel to where Dalgra stood staring at him as if he were mad. "How much farther?"
<br><br>
	"A little ways only. <em>Who</em> are you talking to? You said 'Jarel'. You mean, 'the' Jarel? The evil 'Bane of West Karana'? You are crazy. He's long dead. And he certainly wouldn't be helping you if he did live. My uncle Barbergan told me many frightening stories of that Shadow Knight. It is a name used to scare little children. A myth, a legend; the stories are exaggerations, at best."
<br><br>
	"No, Dalgra. There's only one and he's no myth. He raised me. He is all the family I know. Thrack, Kinlack and your uncle killed my true family. He found me as an infant near death in the woods. Now he has come to help me set these matters aright. It is why I am here." He stared straight at her, daring the disbelief so evident in her expressive, perfect face.
<br><br>
"Let's go", he said into the quiet growing between them. "He is waiting for me near the Southern Gate."
<br><br>
	With a last puzzled look at her unusual saviour, Dalgra started again up the shallow incline towards the gate. He was very handsome, she thought, even if he was smaller than most of the ogres she knew. His accent was unfamiliar and he spoke as if he'd been educated. There was only one place that could have happened yet if he had ever attended the College where ogres of her caste were schooled she would have met him and having met him, she knew she would never have forgotten him. So who was he? Maybe what he had said was true. Any other answer would have to be at least as strange so until she was shown differently, she decided to accept him at his word. A lightening in the tunnel drew her from her thoughts. She halted and turned to Groal. 
<br><br>
"We are at the Gate", she whispered. "We must be very quiet now. There are patrols that pass by here."
<br><br>
	"Alright. Wait a minute then." Groal's small eyes squinted in concentration and he quietly said aloud, "Jarel, I am ready."
<br><br>
	"<em>We must wait until the sun is down. Tell the girl to go home and say nothing about this.</em>"
<br><br>
	"No. You don't understand. I saved her from the trolls and now Kinlack is dead. She can't just go back as if nothing happened."
<br><br>
	"<em>Kinlack's dead? Stay out of sight. This changes things. I will contact you again after night falls.</em>"
<br><br>
	"As you say, Jarel."
<br><br>
	"What? Shh. C'mon." She grabbed him by his arm and dragged him back into the tunnel. "There's more to this than you know", she whispered. "You think I was kidnapped just randomly? Thrack arranged it. My uncle died last night and I was to have died also."
<br><br>
	"I believe your uncle lives. The herbs I administered should save him but it's not certain."
<br><br>
	Her grip on his arm tightened. "What do you mean? You saved Barbergan? Why? That ambitious fool has sold out Oggok to Grobb and he should die for that treachery. Oh, Groal." She shook her head in exasperation. "You have no idea what is going on, do you?" She brought her head up and looked directly into his eyes. "Do you think all of Oggok is just standing idly by while Thrack and Barbergan destroy us?" She let go of him and stepped back a pace. "Myself and a group of students from the College have been secretly working with some influential merchants and a few high officers in the guard to stop this madness." She paused for a moment then looked hard into Groal's face, taking his measure; deciding what to tell, and what not to.  
<br><br>
"Many of the ruling elite have lost sons and daughters to the trolls", she continued. "Despite what the outside world thinks, we are not fools, even if the Council has worked hard at keeping most of us ignorant peasants. The caste system we have lived under since Kilgor's death is not the natural order of things, Groal. It was established by Barbergan's grandfather to further his own attempts to rule Oggok. Fortunately, the King's Vizier was assassinated before he could consolidate his power. But that system has been perpetuated by the Council ever since, for their own selfish reasons. My group is going to put an end to all this and return the race of ogres to it's rightful place as equals to any race in Norrath. That is why I was abducted. Thrack means to end all resistance and eliminating me would go far to further his ambitions. But with you now on our side we can at last make our move."
<br><br>
	Groal's head swam in confusion. All this political intrigue he had learned of in the last few hours was more than he was able to assimilate. This lovely young ogress was involved with a group of counter-revolutionaries? Thrack was maneuvering to make himself King? He himself was a descendant of the last King of Oggok? All he had wanted was justice for his family and instead he had been thrown into the midst of the  complicated politics of a people he knew only from his readings. He was not prepared for this and wanted no part in it. He stepped away from Dalgra.
<br><br>
	"Enough! I have no part to play in this. I seek only what is right for me and my dead family. It was just an accident that I stopped Kinlack from killing you. It is my father's death I mean to avenge. I won't get involved in this."
<br><br>
	Dalgra returned his angry glare. "Fine. You just sit here in the filth of the sewer and wait for the command of your 'father'. With Kinlack dead, we can begin our plans and eliminate the Council. The trolls and traitors will not rule Oggok as long as I still live." She turned from him and ran swiftly up the tunnel, disappearing around the bend.
<br><br>
	"Dalgra! Wait!" His call was answered with silence. She was gone, leaving him alone within a flickering sphere of yellow light that cast thick shadows made from the darkness around him. He staggered slightly and the flame danced about the wick, shedding sparks he barely felt as they burned themselves to ash on his wrist. A deep fatigue possessed him and he sat heavily. Myrlor's warning came to him as he fell asleep; the orange colored extracts were demanding payment. Groal passed from the world of the waking into a place of absolute silence where neither light nor dreams  intruded.
<br><br>
	The sounds of distant armor clashly faintly far away etched themselves in his field of vision like strikes of lightning against a low October sky. His head felt as if it were in a dwarf's vise; like the iron between the anvil and the hammer. Gods, he was thirsty. 
<br><br>
	"<em>Groal…</em>"
<br><br>
	The gentle sound floated through the pain throbbing behind his eyes. A familiar word. He wondered what it meant. 
<br><br>
	"<em>Groal, wake up!</em> Now!…."
<br><br>
	His eyes opened, startled. He found himself back in the dark corridor beneath the city, looking up at a beautiful young ogress and her seven…no, eight… companions. …Sixteen, he thought, as his vision doubled. Or thirty two. He shook his head.
<br><br>
	"Groal! Wake up." She slapped his face. "The entire garrison is looking for you. Come on!" She pulled him to his feet, holding him up with one hand while reaching down with the other to pick up Kinlack's dagger which he had carried away when they had fled. "Bashra, pick him up. We've got to get him out of here."
<br><br>
	The clattering of soldiers' armor sounded nearer and almost he could hear bellowed commands echoing around the stone walls of the catacombs.
<br><br> 
"Wait", he said. "I'm alright." He staggered back from dalgra and the huge shadows hunkering behind her. "Who….Wha….?"
<br><br>
	"We don't have time for this. Carry him, Bash. C'mon!" Her voice was a harsh whisper as Groal felt himself lifted over a massive shoulder.
