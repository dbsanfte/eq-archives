Reading our interviews for this issue I am struck by one of the questions:  What character are you going to play when you finally get to play EverQuest?
<br><br>
I've been thinking about that.  I keep thinking that I will play characters that I have played before.  I, obviously, want to recreate Absor in EverQuest.  Absor is a Half-Elf, born of a peasant Elf maiden and a rogue Human.  He knows that they were never in love, but that they were in lust, and that only lasted one evening.  His mothers tribe shunned her for her indiscretion.  While her life was poor before, it was miserable after her pregnancy became obvious to the tribe.  And Absor felt that all through his youth, the hatred and scorn of a people too proud to accept a half breed, a living breathing reminder that one of their own should shun her own people and allow an animal to be with her.  But his mother was terrified of the world beyond the tribe.  Before Absor had reached the age of maturity he had realized that his mother was…  simple.  Not truly an idiot, but certainly not capable of surviving on her own.  And because of this he could not leave the tribe, despite his hatred of them.  It was not until the agony and stress of her life killed his mother that he could leave.  He packed up and left the day after her burial…
<br><br>
But then I thought about it.  Sure, that's the beginning for Absor.  But most of what he is to me now is much more complicated than just a beginning.  There were the years that he spent living a double life as a town guard and thief.  The day his best friend, Talon, sold out all he held dear to save his own life and was killed anyway.  The great adventure amongst the Titans where Absor discovered the fountain of youth.  The time Kalikan gave up his soul in exchange for Absors.  And of course the day that he met his soul mate.  And the day, years later, that he finally married her.  All of these things make Absor what he is to me today.  And, as wonderful as EverQuest will be, there is no way that Absor would be the same character if I recreated him for the game.  He'll live a totally different life.
<br><br>
I tried this once.  At one time my favorite character was a ranger name Relnargh.  Relnargh was a Human.  When I started playing him he was a pretty typical ranger, he hung out in the woods, he drank a bit much, and he went adventuring for fun.  But on nearly every trip he took some magic user did something to piss him off.  A bolt of lightning would strike him.  A ball of fire would toast him.  Once a giant fish swallowed him and some mage, we assume trying to save him, used an untested magic item on the fish, transporting the fish and Relnargh to another time!  By the time Relnargh managed to return home he swore an oath to himself.  He promised that all magic users would die.  He became a bounty hunter.  He would take jobs to kill any wizard, mage, illusionist, doctor or shaman.  He became an expert at killing them.
<br><br>
Then one day, he died.  He died in a way that precluded returning to life.  I wanted to play him again, so I decided to create his son, Radvar (now my favorite character).  I intended to make him pretty much the same as his father.  I figured to make him a fighter so that he could start out more like Relnargh ended up.  And I tried to make him the same personality.  But I am always aware that when I play a character he/she is a part of the world around him.  And as I played Radvar he met Lurk.  Lurk was a mage.  And he was a damn devious and smart mage.  The two worked together so well that Radvar became almost the opposite of his father.  He knew the usefulness of a wizard, and used them to his advantage.  Some day I'll have to tell you about the Lurk Party (that's the name our adventuring group went by, not one particularly festive occasion.)
<br><br>
So should I even try?  I mean, why would I want to make another character with the same name, same starting background, if he will not be the same character?  Should any of us do this?  Hmmm…  I plan to.  But I will keep in mind that this is a totally new character, and that he will definitely develop differently than the old one.  I suppose that's a good thing, really.  I've been playing Absor so long that he's made enemies out of most of the player characters in the campaign…
<br><br>
So I guess I have two points here.  For those of you that have been roleplaying for a long time, allow your characters the freedom to grow on their own, leave your preconceived ideas behind.  And for those of you that are new to roleplaying, let your character grow as the game progresses.  The best characters are grown, not created.
