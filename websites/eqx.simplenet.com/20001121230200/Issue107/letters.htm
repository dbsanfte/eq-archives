Static Stuff:
 <br><br>
Yep your right. I would gladly give up the *chance* to get things if there were lots of differnt things. What I mean is... 1 person per server should have a rare item, say those thulian bladed claws. Now that person keeps them till he gives them to someone or sells them. The only time they should reappear is awhile AFTER they are completley gone (ie, the character is deleted, person closes account) and then you could say like "The myth of the lost thulian claws is true ! At last I have uncoverd them !" and they could be on a differnt NPC, hell they could just be in the bushes in some stuidly obscure place. That would make ALOT more sense to me, then 50 people camping the avatar of fear or wherever they come from. I think that right there would solve alot of camping problems, and the problem of too many people having the item. It doesn't happen cause all those dammed little video game, quake playing, idiots would have a shit hemmorage. OOps ! there goes 80% of the income from EQ. Sorry your idea was rejected. This is why EQ is the way it is, because like it or not, the major player base is "quake" type players that don't give a rats ass about role playing or anything that has to do with the relastic aspects of the game. They just want there full set of fear gear, best weapon, and then the ability to transfer to the PVP server so they can kill somene easier.
 <br><br>
The thing I would like to see most is a ROLE PLAYING server. One that is actully DESIGNATED for roleplaying. Fine I understand that I should just go find a group to play with, but when I see all the other idiots out there, talking about how they just go the latest kewl limp bizkit CD just RUINS it for me. I haven't played eq in a 4 weeks, and have NEVER gotten a character past level 15 because it just gets rediculasly boring, I get pissed off at idiots, and it's the same old crap, kill, loot, kill, loot, kill loot. Maybe 2 times I've gone on a "roleplaying" type adventure and that was the most fun i've ever had in everquest. Example: one day I was in Qeynos, and a gnome came up and asked if he knew how to get home because and evil dark elf teleported him there. Me being a wood elf ranger, natuartly wanted to help. I knew the way well, and he got us into all sorts of silly problems, but made it fun and advetntuorus, when I got back to Gfay I found out he was like a level 45 wizzard, and rewarded me with a a few pices of nice banded armor I wanted badly. Great adventure, No twinking. All I ever wanted. Chances of that happening again... 1 out 34862896328368293. Oh well, just tell me what ya have to think of my rabelings today. Maybe i'll start on your server and me and you can go adventure some time your free.
 <br><br>
Oh yea, can we sue verant (j/k) for false advertising ? The discripion on the box says "role playing" among the other things that are tottaly false !

I heard you started a character on Rallos Zek...
<br><br>
Welcome to my Server =)  I just wanted you to know that the person with the 2handed sword met a horrible end at the hands of my level 8 Enchanter. Mesmerize is a wonderful thing... In any case, I hope that encounter does not cast a bad light on Rallos in your eyes. Qeynos is known for the amount of PKing that goes on there, more than any other area in fact. Most of us aren't crazed, and we even have some roleplayers =) In fact, we've been doing a player-run storyline since a month after the game opened, and if you decide that you want to spend more time on your Rallos character, you might want to get involved. You can find details at www.ralloszek.net . I would recommend hanging around on the message boards (OOC and RP) and reading the story section first though...

Just some notes from a non power player
<br><br>
I have been reading alot of differnt sites all on EQ 
I visit yours weekly (heh or more)and have been for quite some time now in fact I even have a link to you on my web site (let me know if ya wanna see it and I will send the address I don't wanna push)
<br><br>
OK enough rambling on to the reason I choose now to write. 
<br><br>
This whole thing about camping and crowding.. sheesh.. 
Me and my regular group of friends (guild mates) have found ways around the sometimes boredom of just camping for an item.
<br><br>
My guild now runs in guild Quests that us council members come up with and run for the lower levels in our guild and I must say this is great fun!! Also for Xmas (even though its not a Norrath holiday so we are going to just have it as a gift giving ceremony) me and one of the other council members have been camping things to get as presents now none of our camping was for ourselves and we never took a camp spot from anyone else wanting it. When ever we went to a spot that was camped we would move on to the next stop in our gift giving list.
<br><br>
Sometimes I logg on for a few hours running around newbie areas keeping people alive and buffing them (its fun to see the reaction the first time they take off after I cast Sow on them esp if they have never had that before)
<br><br>
Also I keep my self busy trying to set up an upcomming event my guild is going to sponser (now this is not an ad for the guild that is why I am not mentioning the name here but if your interested let me know)
<br><br>
The point is that if you are bored or tired of camping or trying to level (I have had half a bubble into 30th level for about a month now) come up with things to do.. 
<br><br>
Forget the nifty cool item that you would forsake your god to have, Forget how much exp it will take you to level (you won't beleve how much fun I had running into CB sitting at the zone waiting for a train that people couldn't handle and finally Getting my Justice for all the times they have killed me)
<br><br>
come up with something that has nothing in it for yourself 
Or if your an evil person.. 
run around insulting followers of light gods and accept the duels 
(I got my tail handed to me by a 50th level DE it was Great) 
<br><br>
Sorry just realized I am ranting or babbling and making this quite long.. 
I will save the other issue for next time. 
<br><br>
May Tunare always Smile on you, <br>

Hello good Sir,
<br><br>
I wondered if you could possibly do up a DOWNLOAD area for the NEWER
EQ players who are interested (As indeed am I), in downloading the
entire set of of your Excellent News Paper?  I like to print these
type of things out for perusal during my sojuorn through the BORING
bits of the day when NOT online.
<br><br>
Thank You in advance.
