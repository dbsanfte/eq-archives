  <b>Chapter 4- Ascension</b>
<br><br>
The duo stood at the foot of Greywolf Ridge. Torgrim rubbed his bandaged shoulder, still lightly throbbing. Storm clouds hovered ominously to the East, but he knew they must continue. The sun was just cresting the mountains, turning the skies vibrant colors. They stood in silence remembering the flight they were forced to make last night. The wolves neither of them ever saw gave chase. He remembered running for what seemed like an eternity, their panting and heavy footsteps barely audible over their snarls. It was then they realized that the wolves had the intent of following them, not surrendering to the mountain. Dra'Ka looked over at Torgrim, frowning.
<br><br>
"So begins our climb, Torgrim." Dra'Ka said as he began walking up the gentle incline. They hadn't so much as said a word since last night. Dra'Ka knew it was too late to turn back, he did not want to risk making the trek through the wolves domain. He mindlessly headed towards the mountain, having no plan on what to do when they reached their destination. They followed a winding route that snaked up half the mountain, then disappeared as the slope shot dangerously upward.
<br><br>
The mountain was relatively easy to climb as for right now, and Dra'Ka took relief in that. They continued onwards at a steady pace but they were both exhausted from the lack of rest they had received the last night. A few hours passed and the climb became slightly harder.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka's nose twitched. The smell of rotting flesh entered his nose. He looked around slowly, seeing nothing he tried to ignore it. The smell lingered though, and it became stronger as they continued. He glanced around and put his hand out to halt the dwarf. The dwarf looked at him in curiosity. Dra'Ka scanned their surroundings, then a small cave caught his eye. He pointed it out to the dwarf, and they walked over to it. The cave rested up the mountainside, a short climb away. Dra'Ka could tell that was where the smell came from.
<br><br>
After reaching the cave Torgrim reached into his pack and pulled out a torch. A new smell made itself known to Dra'Ka, that of goblins. He quickly readied his bow as Torgrim lit the torch. Seeing his friend's negative reaction, he put his axe in one hand. The cave made a sharp turn to the left. They walked down the passage very cautiously. As the passage ended and opened into a large chamber, Dra'Ka fully expected to see goblins.
<br><br>
Instead what lay before them was gore. A large pool of blood covered almost half of the chamber, and body parts were sitting on top of it. All the bodies were beyond recognition, but they were covered in bites and claw marks. Not a single wolf body was among them. Dra'Ka figured there must have been at least ten goblins, maybe more. The wolves had given up pursuit of the duo and most probably went here in search of food. That meant that the wolves were ahead of them now.
<br><br>
They quickly left the cave, barely being able to hold back from vomiting. They didn't bother to pillage the gruesome lair. They were both disgusted by the wolves' relentless malice. They hadn't killed the goblins solely for sustenance, but also for pleasure. Dra'Ka doubted they would cease their hunt even if their hunger had been satiated. He almost felt sorry for the goblins, they had brought the wolves to them. Then he saw the dwarf, grimacing in pain, and all pity washed away.
<br><br>
They continued their journey into the afternoon, when they stopped for lunch. They were well over a fourth of the way up the mountain, but the walk would only become harder when the slope ended and the climb became sheer for the last third of the mountain. Dra'Ka then realized that the last third of the mountain would be too steep to ascend.
<br><br>
"Torgrim, how do you plan on making it up the last part of the mountain?" Dra'Ka inquired. Torgrim explained how he had mentioned a cave at the inn which lead almost all the way to the top. Torgrim looked to the East and wondered how he had not noticed how close the clouds had moved.
<br><br>
"Dra'Ka, a storm is coming!" Dra'Ka looked over and the realization dawned on him. They both knew must make it to the cave before night fell.
<br><br>
They moved at a quick pace, every second the clouds grew thicker and nearer. The clouds were almost black, and already winds began to assault the mountain. The sun slowly sank below the horizon, but they were safely within the reach of their destination.
<br><br>
Ahead on the slope the incline began to angle upwards. Far off in the distance Torgrim spotted a speck which must be the cave. He pointed it out to Dra'Ka, and they both breathed a deep sigh of relief. The sky was a light purple, and the moon began to climb its way up into the sky. They arrived in the cave and rested.
<br><br>
Wafting up the mountain came a light breeze and it began to drizzle. At least for tonight the two travelers knew they would not have to fear being assaulted by the damned wolves. They fell into a heavy sleep, not so much as setting up watch. They knew tomorrow would be a hard climb.

 <b>Chapter 5- The Storm</b>
<br><br>
When they awoke next morning they both felt rejuvenated. Torgrim stretched and smiled at Dra'Ka. Dra'Ka got some provisions from their pack, and sat down near the dwarf. Nearby the entrance the rain was falling fiercely. It was overcast and the clouds looked black and angry. They had seen no sign of the wolves, much to their relief. The dwarf looked over to the elf.
<br><br>
"I'm so glad you chose to help me out." The dwarf said as he got out the map and unrolled it. They had to use it to navigate the caves, traveling by seeing the mountain had been much easier. The natural network of caverns were enormous, with many drops and dead ends. Lighting a torch, they began to traverse the caverns.
<br><br>
The cavern was pretty small, offering little room for the elf to move. Long shadows danced at the edge of the torches light, and stalactites clung to the low ceiling, their long sharp endings looking like blades. The caverns twisted in an erratic fashion making them even harder to travel through. The tunnel would branch off and they constantly had to refer to the map, which was often inaccurate. It would show a split in the cave that would not be there. Also having to struggle with the fact that the tunnels were at small incline made the journey no easier.
<br><br>
"What do you suppose formed these caves," Dra'Ka inquired as he ducked around a corner. Torgrim said he had no idea. Dra'Ka ran his hand along the wall, which was very moist. For the next couple of hours they made their way through the caverns, sometimes having to climb over obstacles. For the most part they traveled in silence, even the dwarf didn't supply any of his usually chatter.
<br><br>
"Those wolves really must plague this region," Torgrim said, trying to make conversation. The elf merely nodded and continued on. "This cavern isn't stable either," Torgrim made another attempt. All of a sudden the elf put his hand up to the dwarf, demanding silence.  In a moment Torgrim heard it too, off in the distance, a low rumbling. Instinctively they both readied their weapons. Dra'Ka jumped as he felt water splash against his feet.
<br><br>
"I think I just figured out what made the tunnels . . ." Dra'Ka said. They desperately tried to find somewhere to hide from the oncoming torrent of water. The small stream on the floor grew to a small river. They scuttled into a small side cavern and waited. Soon the small river became a large one, and water began to wash up on them. As it turned into a torrent, Dra'Ka prayed to a deity, any deity. Torgrim grabbed on to Dra'Ka's leg, struggling to hold on. Dra'Ka Held him with all his strength.
<br><br>
Torgrim looked up at Dra'Ka, wide eyed. He kept a grasp on Dra'Ka with all of his strength. Behind them the water churned furiously rushing by. It pulled at Dra'Ka who held onto the wall. There seemed to be no end to the raging rapid's source. He felt Torgrim's grip relax. In a moment the dwarf disappeared in the rapids, and Dra'Ka clung to the wall for his life.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka sat up and looked around. He blinked with his eyes, which were wet from the rapids and from tears of frustration. The recollection of what had happened set in, and he crawled over to a nearby wall and propped himself against it. Regaining his courage he realized his bow was gone, but he still had his sword. Shivering, he looked around for Torgrim. A small stream still ran down the passage. Walking down a short ways he saw the Dwarf's axe. It was dark in here, even for his infravision.
<br><br>
A low groan came from nearby, and Dra'Ka ran over towards it. He found Torgrim laying there, he gasped with relief and helped his friend up. They sat there for a while, Torgrim recovering and Dra'Ka resting. He had no idea what time it was.
<br><br>
"Next time, it's your turn to get hurt, elf," Torgrim said, breaking the silence. Dra'Ka smiled a thin smile.
<br><br>
"Our provisions are gone, what do we do now?" Dra'Ka asked. Apparently Torgrim didn't know either, because he simply sat there in silence.
<br><br>
Behind them a low growl emanated from the darkness. Dra'Ka jumped up and looked over. He helped Torgrim up. A snarl came followed by another growl. He turned torgrim around and they bother began to run up the passage. A loud bark was made trailed by many paw steps. They fled up the passage, only knowing where to go by following the water. After running for a few minutes their pursuers seemed further off.
<br><br>
The cavern opened up into night, the sky was filled with broken clouds. They were in a bowl shaped summit, scattered around the cave exit was the remnant of a large boulder, now seared by lightning. Dra'Ka realized when it exploded it allowed all of the water from the summit to leak in. But that wasn't important now.
<br><br>
Looking up he saw the top of Greywolf Ridge. Torgrim pointed out a ledge which they began to head towards. They scrambled up the mountainside with all of their strength. They stopped halfway up and peered back down at the cave entrance.
<br><br>
Emerging from the caves were black forms, that began to snake their way up the mountainside.
<br><br>

<br>
 <b>Chapter 6- Greywolf Ridge</b>
<br><br>
They both lay there, gasping for air. Down the mountainside the wolves grew ever nearer snarling and growling. It was so dark that Dra'Ka couldn't see all the way down the mountain.  Instead, it was enveloped in darkness. They readied their weapons and watched quietly, the wolves were no more the fifty feet away.
<br><br>
Instinctively Dra'Ka reached for his bow, but he found only air. Torgrim looked at him, his eyes apologizing. The wolves were less then twenty five feet away. Dra'Ka's mind wandered back to his home of Faydwer. The bright forests reached up to the skies, he played there with his other friends. Torgrim nudged him, bringing him out of the trance.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka got his first good look at the wolves then. They were a dark grey, with a thick coat. They bared their teeth revealing bloodstained fangs. Foam dripped from their mouths, splashing on the rock below them. But what really scared Dra'Ka was their eyes. Such intelligence they showed, but it was clouded over by a bloodthirsty red color.
<br><br>
The first wolf leapt up at them, but Dra'Ka nimbly sidestepped the attack. Torgrim swung at it hard, hitting it with the flat of his axe. The wolf flew a ways, then got back up and charged back into combat. More wolves began to make their way to the brave duo.
<br><br>
Another wolf jumped at Dra'Ka, burying its' jaws into his arm. Dra'Ka screamed in pain, then brought his sword up to strike his attacker. The other wolf bit his sword arm, Dra'Ka pulled it up against his side. A new combatant challenged Torgrim, he grabbed it's neck and began to struggle with it.
<br><br>
More wolves began to battle Dra'Ka, who was wrestled to the ground by all of them. He began to fight for his life, kicking and biting, much like his relentless attackers. He skin was torn from his flesh, and long claws made their was along his arm. He threw wolves off, but still more came.
<br><br>
Torgrim looked over and saw the terrible massacre. He threw the wolf up against a rock, and charged towards Dra'Ka. His axe cleaved into a wolf's back, and cut through it's sinewy hide. The wolf rolled down the mountain in two parts. The wolves looked over at Torgrim, and began to attack him.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka looked blankly at the sky, he could here Torgrim fighting the wolves. He could think of nothing to do, his blood leaked from many wounds. And his bones were aching and cracked. He tried to look over, but his head throbbed and he lay flat again. He wanted to close his eyes, but he refused to feign to unconsciousness.
<br><br>
Torgrim felt exhausted, the wolves mercilessly assaulted him. He knew not how many he faced, he had slain only a few. Their eyes laughed at him, as their nails bit into his skin. He finally gave way and collapsed, he could hear something distant, some sort of calling.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka kept chanting, using his remaining strength to stand, but he still leaned heavily against the rock. The wolves looked at him, the stared at the colorful array dancing around him. One wolf barked and ran, the others soon gave into fear and began to dash away. He crumpled to the ground near Torgrim.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka slowly opened his eyes, and looked around. He saw Torgrim applying some odd leaf to his wounds. He sat up and looked for the wolves. A jolt of pain ran down his spine and he laid back down. It was day now, off in the distance below he saw the sad forest, and far off he saw a clearing which was Kyanar.
<br><br>
"The wolves where are they?" Dra'Ka asked. Torgrim explained that they had run away, he the offered Dra'Ka some water and some jerky, which he graciously accepted. In a few hours Dra'Ka managed to stand up, the leaves had lessened his pain greatly.
<br><br>
"The treasure, should we go and get it?" Torgrim inquired. Dra'Ka agreed, and they slowly made their way to the top of the ridge. They both used their weapons for support while climbing. "You should really see the other side, it has a small forest."
<br><br>
They arrived at the ledge, And Torgrim got out his axe. He began to strike the giant shelf of rock, digging up some ancient hole. Dra'Ka helped him dig into the hard ground. The work went slow, they were both tired and weak. Finally Dra'Ka stopped and rested, he immediately fell asleep.
<br><br>
Torgrim was content to dig by himself. A while later he ate lunch and enjoyed the magnificent view. At last after more digging he hit a box. Greedily reaching down into the hole he retrieved it. He gently placed the oak box at the side of the hole. He opened it religiously and peered inside.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka awoke and looked over at the dwarf. In his hands was a great battle axe. From it's ornate handle to it's silver blade it was a piece of work. He smiled resignedly and walked over to the dwarf.
<br><br>
"You mean I went up the whole mountain so you could get an axe?" Dra'Ka demanded.
<br><br>
Torgrim simply said yes.
<br><br>

<br>
 <b>Prologue</b>
<br><br>
Dra'Ka kept running the blade along the thick sliver of wood. He bit into the tasty jerky and looked over at Togrim. They were in a large forest along the slope of Greywolf Ridge. The forest was a pine one, and it was quite cheerful. Evening was setting in and Torgrim walked over and sat by him.
<br><br>
Dra'Ka heard a howl in the distance. He could tell this was a different howl, that of lament. The wolves were now moving away from Kyanar. He was glad that they had freed them from the terror. Torgrim thought it was so funny that Dra'Ka had scared them off with a pacify animal spell.
<br><br>
"How's the new bow coming along?" Torgrim  asked.
<br><br>
"Perfect. but I want to know, what is my reward for this trip?" Dra'Ka asked back.
<br><br>
"I don't know, I'm sure I can find something." Torgrim replied.
<br><br>
"Well then, I guess I'll just have to come along and see." Dra'Ka said, permitting himself a smile.
