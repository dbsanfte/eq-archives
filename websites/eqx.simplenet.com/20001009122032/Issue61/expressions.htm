I have been a fantasy fan of things like Tolkein and Jordon, etc.  Coming from a limited fantasy background then, I don't have a basis by which to Role Play a Dark Elf, or Drow but they seem interesting.  Maybe a description of these "evil" creatures and hints about RPing them?</em>
<br><br>
Ah, the much feared and a bit maligned Dark Elf.  You may be interested to know that the EQX staff have roleplayed them quite a bit.  Expect to see our guild sometime soon.
<br><br>
Let us not forget the history put forth by the good folks who made EverQuest.  According to legend, Innoruuk took two of the beloved and beautiful high-elves and tortured and twisted them in order to make the Dark Elf.  They are constantly at odds with the beings who dwell the surface world.
<br><br>
Some of the generally accepted characteristics of Dark Elves are that they are essentially evil, and are considered to be one of the more intelligent races, though their intellect can vary about as much as that of humans and other elves.  They are beings crafted from hate, and therefore are themselves filled with rage.
<br><br>
Playing a Dark Elf isn't much different from playing an evil human, although in playing any non-human race it's important to take into account their history and culture.  I recommend reading up on the dark elves in the "Encyclopedia" section of the EverQuest homepage.
<br><br>
I often create an evil personality by selecting an emotion to fuel with that pent-up hatred.  I can simply play a hot-head who picks fights with anyone, but it might be more fun that my character is jealous of the wealth of others… greed can be his motivator.  Revenge is a powerful force; Maybe the character is just getting even with everyone for having a terrible life.  
<br><br>
My dark elf character, Ezmend, is the least hateful of our pack.  Essentially a drunkard, his one distinct trait is indifference; He could care less about saving the world, destroying the world, or anything else, save the satiation of his own desires.  He wouldn't bother adventuring if he hadn't already spent all his inheritance over the years on drink and women.
<br><br>
The most important thing to consider in playing an evil character is that you not worry about what others think of you.  If you are playing in a group and your character is greedy, then maybe when it comes time to divide up the treasure you can always claim that you deserve more than the others.  Truth be told, it's often fun to be a bastard; Maybe less so for people who aspire to it in real life.  Don't worry about it; You'll have plenty of opportunity to be a nice guy when you are out of character and when you are playing your Paladin.
<br><br>
Perhaps we'll cross in Neriak, and you best not be a Halfling when we do.

“Let the shadows Tier’dal stretch far and wide across the corpses of their
pale and insolent foes.”   -Ezmend B’lask (Said in a toast, naturally)
