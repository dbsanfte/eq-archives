Tauithar squinted into the bright light that reflected off of the dunes. In the distance, barely audible, was the sound of the ocean as it met the desert. Tauithar could make out the shapes of palm trees along the coast and everywhere there was sand, lots and lots of sand. Tauithar was currently standing on top of a particularly tall dune clearly waiting from someone. Clearly that someone was late for he was cursing a streak that would make Tunare blush several shades of red. He scanned the surrounding landscape cursing the heat and his armor that seemed to make the heat ten times worse than it was.
<br><br>
"Where is that miserable tin can? This heat is unbearable! What I wouldn't give to be back home under the grand trees of the Greater Faydark."
<br><br>
Tauithar grumbled. He paced for a few more minutes before starting to turn and walk down the dune to find a shady spot to wait. The ranger didn't take two steps before he was caught full in the stomach by a short, stocky, and bearded missile. Tauithar groaned as he was pinned to the ground. The heavy shape then got off of Tauithar's chest and the ranger delighted in breathing again. He looked up to see a dwarf clad in plate mail (How the dwarf moved was beyond Tauithar) clutching his stomach, tears streaming down his face…tears of laughter. The dwarf, still laughing, regained enough composure to stand up straight and dab his eyes with the corner of his beard.
<br><br>
"You should have seen your face, tree frog, it was…" The dwarf never got to finish his thought. His eyes widened to the size of dinner plates as Tauithar crashed into him with surprising quickness. The collision carried the pair tumbling down the side of the dune, the dwarf sputtering and cursing the entire trip. When they reached the bottom Tauithar landed on top of the dwarf pinning him.
<br><br>
"Good to see you too, Khar." Tauithar said with a sly grin.
<br><br>
"Get off of me you damn tree frog!!!" Khar shouted. Tauithar stood up and began to dust himself off. The dwarf had slightly more trouble. Tauithar made no move to help.
<br><br>
"I don't know how you stand all that heavy binding metal, tin can. I much prefer the freedom of movement chain mail provides. Looks better too I might add."
<br><br>
"Quiet, tree frog, this metal has saved my skin more times than I can count." Tauithar simply shrugged.
<br><br>
"Are you going to show me where your friends are? I thought you said that you could use one such as myself."
<br><br>
"About as much as I could use another hole in my head," Khar grumbled. "But you are good in a fight and any sword arm is a welcome one."
<br><br>
"Then let us be off!" Tauithar checked his gear and waited for the dwarf to start off. Khar moved with surprising speed despite his short stature, Tauithar had to run to catch up. And so there they were a Dwarven paladin and an Elven ranger, an odd pair to be running across the desert together so far from home.
<br><br>
Soon Khar led them to a small valley where several dwarves were milling about. The other dwarves greeted Khar warmly; their symbols marked them from the same clan, but looked warily at Tauithar. Khar introduced the ranger and explained that Tauithar was with him. Immediately the dwarves treated Tauithar like he were one of their own. "A friendly bunch these dwarves," Tauithar thought, " but I sure wouldn't want to get on their bad side." Their apparent leader, a solid imposing dwarf named Grimme, outlined the plan for Tauithar. This was a major passage for the orcs of the surrounding areas, from one camp to the next. They were here to harry the orcs as much as they could. Tauithar said he understood and that his sword would never waver, a typical mercenary sign of agreement. The day went smoothly with no serious mishaps, the cleric Glynn, made sure of this by keeping everyone healthy. Late in the afternoon however was when that all changed.
<br><br>
It was Khar's turn to lure an orc into the waiting ambush. Khar found a suitable orc wandering through the desert singing snatches of a marching song in the beast's own language. Khar threw a rock at the orcs head to get its attention. The orc growled as its eyes locked on the dwarf. Khar made a rude gesture and sprinted off in the direction of the rest of the group.  The orc followed howling in bloodlust. Khar was within sights of his party when the texture of the sand shifted and he lost his footing. Khar went down in a cloud of dust and the clanging of plate mail. Sputtering a constant string of curses Khar tried to pick himself up. The orc grinned triumphantly and raised its axe preparing to end the dwarf's life. Khar turned himself over and saw the deadly blade poised to strike. He could do nothing but shut his eyes and wait for the end. Several seconds passed and the blow didn't come. Khar opened his eyes to see Tauithar standing over him, the ranger's sword locked with the orcs'. Tauithar slowly began to push the axe back. The orcs' expression went from one of grim amusement to one of anger and…a little bit of fear. Khar recovered from his initial shock and picked up his great battle-axe where he had dropped it. The paladin crouched and swung his blade in a deadly arc aimed at the orcs' kneecap praying to his god that his aim be true. His god heard him. Khar's blade cut through the leg as if it were air. The orc began to topple but before it could fall to the ground Tauithar plunged his sword into its gut ending its life. Tauithar helped Khar to his feet.
<br><br>
"Are you all right, tin can? Must have been too top heavy and just fell over?" Tauithar laughed at the look the dwarf gave him. His amusement was short lived however because at that moment three orcs crested the hill and upon seeing the body of their comrade they rushed into battle. Tauithar and Khar decided to make an orderly retreat back to the rest of the group for back up. Unbeknownst to them however the rest of the group was already engaged in battle with a five-orc patrol. 
<br><br>
When Tauithar reached them the trouble only increased. Soon after Tauithar and Khar rejoined the group another two orcs joined in assured that the odds would be in their favor. The group was quickly fighting a losing battle. Tauithar was facing two incredibly large orcs by himself. He kept one at bay with his shield, but it was all he could do to parry the other orcs' blows. Soon the ranger was covered in minor wounds and his sword arm began to feel as if it were made of lead.
<br><br>
Tauithar was on the brink of giving up when the war cry of Brell split the air and from out of nowhere Khar appeared and buried his axe in the back of one of the orcs. Tauithar's strength returned and with his own goddess' name on his lips he drove after the orc like one possessed. The orc wavered at the sudden change in his opponents' attitude. That was all the opening Tauithar needed. With one quick swipe he severed the orcs' head from its body. Unfortunately by that time more orcs had arrived and the party was being sorely pressed. Grimme shouted to make a last stand, to fight to the death. 
<br><br>
Bolstered by their leader's courage the other dwarves fought even harder, but the orcs would not let up. Tauithar closed his eyes and began to pray to his goddess. She heard his prayers and answered them. Bolts of lightning streaked from the sky to strike several orcs killing one, but two others were only stunned for a brief moment and they turned their attention on the ranger. Still reeling from the spell Tauithar could do nothing to defend himself. One of the orcs brought his fist hard across his face and Tauithar tasted blood. The other kicked him in the ribs sending him flying. Tauithar pulled himself to his feet, finding it hard to breathe. He knew one of his ribs had punctured a lung, he also knew he didn't have long left. He lifted his sword and leveled it at one of the two orcs' chest.  Screaming his patron's name he flung himself at the orc. The orcs' face contorted in surprise as he felt the sword go into his chest up to the hilt. Tauithar smiled as the other orc brought down its fist on the back of his neck and thought about what he'd say to Tunare this time around. Then the world went dark.
<br><br>
Tauithar awoke with a splitting headache. He tried to collect his thoughts from the mists that clouded his mind. Then it all came back to him with sudden clarity. He sat up and was glad to find that the pain was only mildly excruciating. Tauithar was not surprised to see Liza up and about ministering aid to those of his party. "That's the second time in so many weeks ranger, you should stop being so reckless."
<br><br>
Liza said with a smile. "I'll take that into consideration next time Lady Liza." Tauithar replied.  He then got up and walked around searching for Khar. He found him sitting on a rock watching the sun set. Tauithar sat next to him and pulled out a flask of brandy, after taking a sip he passed it to the dwarf. Khar took it readily and sniffed it to make sure it wasn't just water. "So, tin can, some battle. Did you get to see Brell?" Tauithar asked casually. Khar just grunted and took a long pull from the flask, a very long pull.
