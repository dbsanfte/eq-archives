<em>As much as I am looking forward to the release of EverQuest, I have one major concern.  That is the issue of "unrealistic riches".  What I mean by this is, will every player I encounter be loaded up with the highest levels of equipment, spells and abilities within 5 minutes of the game being released?  I would rather see a wide range of player abilities and inventories in the EQ world and the achievement of high levels and powerful objects difficult and rare.  Will we see every paladin walking around in plate mail by day 2?  What have you experiences been so far?
<br><br>
A question asked by an anonymous reader.</em>
<br><br>
Greetings all!  First off I would like to say hello to any people who have read any of my works before. I know it has been a long time since I have written anything, but work and that dreaded game called EverQuest have consumed my life. Sometimes I wish I had 18 or more hours a day to play due to all the characters I would like to create and journey with. With the release of EverQuest, this question may be a little outdated, but I felt I could add some insight on how I saw the economy work in 4 phases of beta, and how I think it will work in final.
<br><br>
You will see absolutely no one in plate for at least a month, and those people would have to be putting in phenomenal hours to reach their mid twenties. Plate armor is coveted highly by many, but the price is outrageous. Some races will have access to bronze plate earlier than others, but all in all, most will not touch it until their mid to high twenties, and it will take into their early thirties to get a full set, which at that point the armor starts to become obsolete. Plate is the "average" armor, and there are much better forms of protection out there that you need to adventure for.
<br><br>
Late in beta they added code that made armor essential to combat later on. Plate offers an average protection, and most people choose to keep some of their magic items. The magic items and quest items in the game offer attribute bonuses, save bonuses, and are just much cooler to look at. I know I wanted people to inspect my Paladin just to see what toys he had. The hard part about toys is you have to WORK hard to get them, or pay high level characters who do find them lotsa money, or even worse trade other coveted magic items to get them.
<br><br>
This is where Verant's "trickle down economy" idea comes into play. Now I know this is final, and most people will be hoarding magic items. They will probably bank them to twink other characters they have, but some won't. You will hear auctions from time to time such as "Elaanilus auctions Shiny Brass Shield for 10pp. Great source of light!" Or maybe "Elaanilus auctions Shiny Brass shield, looking to trade for other magic items!" Before long I am sure there will be spoiler sites that include the npc, the location of the npc, and what nice items they load. So if you are not the adventuresome sort, and don't like the surprise of "Oh WOW, that mob had a cool toy!" feeling, you will be able to join in on the camping of certain npcs for certain items or possibly trade or purchase them from another pc.
<br><br>
Also, another thing to take into consideration is the newly implemented trade skills. Banded mail is cheaper and offers up more protection than store bought chain, so I advise either becoming a smith, or making friends with one. I am sure there is a way to make a better plate mail in the game too, but no one has figured out the proper distribution of resources to make it yet. And with the Enchanter class, be prepared to see lots of magic jewelry and such auctioned off also.
<br><br>
All in all though, you will see NO player fully equipped with the best of the best until they are level 50 and spend all of their time trying to get the best toys. There is such a variety that even when they think they have the best toys, they might not. And if the situation arises that you see a level 1 paladin in plate armor, well you can just assume that they were twinked and go about your business.
<br><br>
Hope this helps! May your journey through Norrath be swift and prosperous!
