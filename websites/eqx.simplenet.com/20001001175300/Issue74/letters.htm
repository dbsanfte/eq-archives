In Wynn's latest Q&A she answered the question "Is there a place I can find a full listing of pet commands? with the obligatory: in the manual- however this is apparently not completely true, as the manual only states the pet commands for magician and necromancer- playing an enchanter who animates a dagger as a pet, the pet responds to none of the typical commands, even differing syntax- thinking it was a problem of the game I /petitioned a request to check on this and was informed that enchanter pets respond differently and I would need to ask another enchanter what the commands were. I have not since then encountered any other enchanters to ask, but I seek confirmation or denial of this information, and if it is incorrect then I need to correct the Guide/GM I spoke with as well.

<em>[Ed. - Well, I last played and enchanter in beta, when the animation spells weren't even working, so I don't have personal experience with this.  But from what I hear the animations are just animated junk and they have no brain.  They don't accept any commands at all, they only defend you if you are attacked.  Oh, and Wynn isn't a she...]</em>

Greetings!
<br><br>
I just read your editorial in issue 73. I agree with you totally even though I do run the new Fennin Ro Event calendar (no need to plug it, I'm not even supplying the address).  There is a problem with your logic though.  Even though Verant has provided us with some means of in-game communication, they are lacking. The game should have some in-game bulletin boards or some other method of written communication available to players.  I realize that this may not solve all the problems, but it would help those of us who would prefer to stay in-game to do our role playing.

<em>[Ed. - Absolutely!  I keep a short list of things that I would like to see in EQ, and this is on it.  There are some bulletin boards.  But there should be one in every city, and more than one in most.  And we need a way to write scrolls or even books.]</em>

&lt;ahem&gt;  Hey everyone! &lt;waves&gt;
<br><br>
Sorry this is so late, cause I was on vacation and all, but all I gotta say is...
<br><br>
WHEEEEEEEEE!!!!! the ArcDoll FINALLY showed me what colour Lil Archy's hat is!  You have NO idea how that has just bothered the heck out of me.  I always thought it was a little PURPLE pointed hat, and some how I had a problem with that image.  You know... ALL decrepit old wizards seem to have lil PURPLE pointed hats.
<br><br>
I am SO glad to see Lil Archy at his age, is strong enough to break the fashion mold.
<br><br>
Your driveling tuding gal,
