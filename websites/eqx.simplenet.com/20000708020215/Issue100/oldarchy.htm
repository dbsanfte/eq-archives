I know 50 cartoon strips is not a career of work.  But for a guy with the attention span of a gnat, that's like saying I wrote a novel!  Actually it's more like 55 strips now, but I figured issue 100 is a good time to babble.  (It's my second language!)
<br><br>
We used to discuss in IRC chat meetings what would make our little periodical seem more like a print magazine.  "I always think of the cover art on a magazine or the photo on the front page of a newspaper," I said.
<br><br>
Sports section sure didn't seem to fit.  ("This week's Sollusek Ro MVP is Garth Apnickel, Human shadowknight, with eight registered duel wins, 36 kill steals, and over one hundred trains dumped.")
<br><br>
A cartoon, someone suggested, would be a nice addition.  "Make it like 'Far Side'," I believe Oghma said.  So Razor did a few strips, as did a number of other people.
<br><br>
So I said I'd give something a try.  Don't even remember my first idea.  All I remember is that I thought it was so bad that not only did I delete it but I thought about formatting my harddrive to make sure it could not easily be resurrected.
<br><br>
And then there were the halflings.  I wrote 101 uses for dead halflings.  Not my favorite bit of comedy.  I knew it was good for 20 uses at best, but the title was better at 101.  So I made it from recycled clipart.  Good for the environment!  I was glad when I came up with Archy, which was simple enough to draw over and over again.
<br><br>
A guy hired me once to do a graphic for his company.  I'm no professional, and that's why he picked me… because he knew I'd be cheap.  I made all kinds of wizards.  What he wanted was something reminiscent of the Mickey Mouse wizard in Fantasia, so I made him an Owl in a robe with a wand, and he loved it.  That left me with about a dozen other wizards I had made.  My favorite was a little guy with a big nose and a drooping hat.
<br><br>
Fact is, there's only one cartoon I've done in the series where you can see Archy's real height.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I started off drawing the cartoon by hand and scanning it in very poorly into my computer.  Often the result was unreadable and the text had to be typed in again.  I had to redraw lines that didn't show on the scanner and remove specks that appeared for no reason.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Pitiful, ain't it?  I mean it's hard to tell what I'm drawing here.  I was relieved that someone at our next meeting laughed at this.  I thought maybe it was just way to hard to make out the joke in this calamity.  I like the joke, just hard to carryout with my limited cartooning abilities.
<br><br>
I went to making the cartoon in Corel Photopaint.  The Problem is that anytime I use Photopaint, I go overboard.  So I tried to control myself and use simple tools…circles and lines.  But when I saved them they looked cheap.
<br><br>
So believe it or not, the program responsible for Archy is MS Paint.  The simplest drawing program on the market, available in every copy of Windows.  I still use it.  My drawing style hasn't gotten better.  As I'm fond of pointing out to anyone, I'm NOT a cartoonist.  My artwork has always been more of a comic book style, but not cartoon.  Batman as compared to Snoopy.  There is a world of difference.  Simplicity is the first principle in cartoons.  Dump all the shading, the complicated color schemes, the dramatic effect "camera" angles.
<br><br>
In a way it's like doing Vaudeville each week.  Two characters stand side by side and one does the set up and the other the punchline.
<br><br>
I needed a travelling companion and started throwing circles together, erasing parts, etc.  Snaffu was born.  He was vaguely troll-like, so I decided he was a troll and away we went!
<br><br>
This is all pre-beta.  We didn't have a game to bolster or mock yet.  But there was a game on the market that many people feared EverQuest would be just like.  I speak of Ultima Online.  My first few cartoons were direct commentary on the Ultima Online experience.  Jokes about the ridiculous names, the short-hand language, etc., were enough to give me a start, but I was going to need more, and soon!
<br><br>
I was so glad when I could actually poke around the gestating world and select items that were ripe for comedy.  The great number of people packed into Blackburrow, the way ships run, the complete lack of role-playing during beta.
<br><br>
Sarcasm is my favorite tool, naturally.  That's why this is my favorite Lil' Archy strip…
<br><br>

<br><br>
But this one comes in second.  Dueling sarcasm here.
<br><br>

<br><br>
It was a good week if I could make myself laugh.  I think this has perhaps one of two quotable lines from a Lil' Archy.  "Guess you can't have a revolution without cracking a few carapaces."  That's so loaded with sarcasm I'm laughing at it right now.
<br><br>
The selling of items in game, the ridiculous skills that at the time were worthless, the way people selected other people for their guilds… So much to pick on.  Just goes to show you that no matter how great you make a game there will always be some a-hole (ME!) who can find fault.
<br><br>
Pulp Fiction.  What makes a good movie is good dialogue.  Lacking the drawing skills to draw something funny and leave it at that, I decided anything funny had to be spoken.
<br><br>
Now this one could be any two players hanging out having fun with the environment.  It goes back to the days when following a patch there would be a Verant representative sending messages out to the populace.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Guest stars can be pretty important.  I mean, that's why folks stopped reading Peanuts about a hundred years ago.  Same characters, same situations, same environment.  (Here I am, poor cartoonist that I am, mocking Charles Shultz!  I must be mad!).  My favorite guest appearances are Absron the Bard, and D'archy the Lil' Archy simulator, and in a non-speaking role, Torchy the fire-elemental.
<br><br>
This is not easy work.  In fact, I am surprised that I can come up with anything, funny or not, by deadline each week.  I'm not sure how long I can stick with this, but the supplement to EverQuest, "Ruins of Kunark" is just… about 20-24 strips away.  If I can just come up with a dozen witty things for Lil' Archy to say or do then there may be a new infusion of comedy (read:  problems).
<br><br>
I almost quit Archy twice.  First time I simply had no idea and sat out a week.  I was genuinely surprised that Absor got two "Where's Archy?" e-mails.  Heck, if I've got two people for an audience that's enough to keep me trying!  So I made a Lil' Archy and sent it (Though Absor forgot to include it in the next issue).  The other time I nearly quit was simply a matter of wanting to do something memorable and to end the strip before it became very weak.  I began a "Death of Lil' Archy" comic strip but wound up putting it into the "unfinished ideas" folder because I got another idea in the meantime.
<br><br>
I have to say that although all I've really achieved with this is a tiny amount of notoriety in limited circles, it's still nice to have people in the EQ chat say, "Hey!  Are you the guy that writes those cartoons?" or sometimes (R U DUH GUY WHO DUZ THE CATROON?).  "Dat b me," I reply.
<br><br>
EverQuest Express has been a great venue in which to explore my evil, sarcastic side, which normally does not see much light of day outside of work.  I hope that I can keep it alive a little longer.  But Verant will have to start messing up a few things for me to have more material.
<br><br>
So how about it, huh guys?
<br><br>
Oh, and the other quotable line has since been included in many of my correspondences.  "Free the Blackburrow Seven!"
