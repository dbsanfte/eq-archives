<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question about safe zones.  What is considered a safe zone, and is it bannable?  I wouldn't like to think that the only way to fight in EQ is to foolishly charge into battle, especially for a mage class.  I can understand some one picking monsters off for 5 hours, but if I'm being chased by a monster, can I take refuge on a temple where they can't get me, or am I just supposed to let it kill me?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;A safe zone is defined in EverQuest as any location where a monster cannot physically attack you. The reason why it cannot hit you is usually due to a bug in the pathing of the mob, or it is stuck in the geometry of the world. Using these locations to kill monsters or even just to sit and rest in is considered exploitation and is definitely a bannable offense. When you get in over your head, you should flee to guards, the next zone, or some other players who are willing to help you.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do about kill stealers?  Is it a bannable offense, and if so, how do we prove it?  There are three notorious stealers on Veeshan that consistently annoy the heck out of everyone.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill stealing in general is not illegal. The idea is that no monster "belongs" to any particular player just because he or she attacked it first. In a real world situation, people would likely be very grateful for help in vanquishing foes. Unfortunately, in a gaming world where experience is not shared, this does not hold true. I would recommending finding a different location to hunt in, or find some other way to not fall prey to the kill stealer. For example, you could work out a rotation, challenge him to a duel, or step back and let the mob attack him for a change. 

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way to see your skills' numeric ratings whenever you want?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is not. You can only estimate the value based on the worded level it shows in your skill listing.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been hearing a lot about races that have penalized exp. What does that mean? Do they not get exp as fast as other races? Also, what races have this disability and how severe is it?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty-free combination is a human warrior. These characters may need to kill, say, 10 rats to reach level 2. Meanwhile a more penalized race, such as the troll shadowknight, may need to kill 20 rats to reach level 2. The advantages of the specialized races and more flamboyant classes result in the need for extra experience to reach the next level. Hope this (inaccurate) example helped clarify this.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that safe fall can not be practiced right now. However I did put 5 practice points into the skill yet every time I fall from even the smallest distances I take damage. Am I doing something wrong?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the reason for this is your skill level is very low. Even if your skill succeeds it will only reduce the damage you take by maybe a single hit point. You will not begin to enjoy the true potential of this skill until it is much higher.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a 3rd level Wood-Elf Druid, who is wondering about pets. Where can I find more info on pets? How does one acquire one? When is a good level? What happens when pets die?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;It depends on the magic class, really. Druids attain pets by charming NPCs with spells. Magicians summon new ones. I would recommend consulting with higher level druids in the game and ask them the best way to safely get started with the charming spells. When a pet dies, it is gone forever. Fear not, because they are in a happier place, playing with all the other pets who pass into the great beyond. 

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;How important will the different languages be in that actually researching of spells? I'm a dark elf necromancer and find it a bit hard to travel around and stop for a chat in the middle of different towns to learn up on the local dialect.
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages will be extremely important for spell research. I'm sure with some clever role playing, you can manipulate some unknowing players into speaking their language for you to learn. The Dark Elf Necromancer has a high difficulty rating, so you should expect these challenges.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it me, or is anyone else bothered by the fact that the Elven girl on the front screen has no nipples? 
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;No comment.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that shop keepers in Kelethin are apprehensive about wood elves who start there, but in Freeport all the shop keepers are neutral?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Without more information, it is hard to say for sure. It is most likely your choice of religion. Wood elves typically worship Tunare, so if you don't, they may think you rather strange. Your class may also have an effect.

<BR><BR>

<I><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it possible to learn the languages of other races?  And if so, is there an in game benefit to it beside the obvious (like being able to read books scribed in that language)?
</I><BR>
<B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes it is possible to learn other languages. You will be able to understand their speech, and they are used in spell research.

<BR><BR>

<B>Corrections</B><BR>
Players above level 18 will now be attacked by the things that are green
to them therefore the higher level players cannot just run through a
dungeon and camp the hard guys. Players 18 and under have the green rule;
Something green will not attack.
