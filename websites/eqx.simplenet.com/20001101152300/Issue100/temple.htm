'Neath murky Feerrotts darkened sky<br>
Where green vines creep and frogloks cry,<br>
There looms a temple large and old<br>
That many secrets still does hold.
<br><br>
For Cazic Thule, this keep was made,<br>
In forgotten ages the stones were laid,<br>
And no one knows who built these halls<br>
Or who inscribed the mighty walls.
<br><br>
Ancient dangers dwell within,<br>
Where no one but the brave have been,<br>
They guard the courtyards and the throne<br>
And fool is he who comes alone.
<br><br>
Armed with teeth and claws and spells<br>
Death lurks in the rooms and wells:<br>
Vicious lizard, golem, ape,<br>
And Fear itself in monstrous shape.
<br><br>
There is no pity for the weak,<br>
For those who run and cry and shriek,<br>
And only with both luck and skill<br>
Will you live to make the final kill.
<br><br>
But in spite of death and pain and fear,<br>
Many come to battle here,<br>
And in days gone-by those of patient might<br>
Even find the Rubicite.
<br><br>
Sought by many, found by few<br>
Red as the blood of me and you,<br>
This was the prize for which they all did scheme,<br>
That filled their every thought and dream.
<br><br>
Such dreams did drive the best ones mad<br>
With yearnings for what could be had,<br>
And many a brave and goodly deed<br>
Was here betrayed by lowly greed.
 <br><br>
The age of Rubicite is past,<br>
It was too good, or we too wicked, for it to last, <br>
Yet armor is still wrested from the dead:<br>
Dark ravenscale  replacing red.
<br><br>
Aye, in this lost temple 'neath Feerrott's sky,<br>
They still come to fight, and come to die.<br>
Some find fortune; some find a friend,<br>
And some find only a bitter end.
<br><br>
Still the creatures of the God of Fear<br>
Will never shed a single tear,<br>
For dwarf and gnome and man and elf<br>
Who braved the halls of Cazic Thule himself.
