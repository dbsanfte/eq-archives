The night itself keeps you awake.  Try as you might, you cannot overcome it's howling and thrashing.  You decide to take a walk along the grounds to ease your nerves.  You enter into the night and pull your cloak close, but let your face feel the wind as you wander toward around the castle courtyard.  As you come to the "royal crossroads", you turn to look down an avenue and see the cathedral, beckoning to you.  The winds howl more as you walk down the avenue and into the cathedral to escape the night.  You step in reverently and are thankful for the relative quiet and soft light of nearby candles.  As you sit in the pew and gaze upon the moonlight coming though the stained glass, you notice a figure stirring up near the altar.  Wondering who could be here at this hour, you cautiously walk up.  As you approach, the figure lights a torch spilling dancing firelight on himself and the altar.  A tall, dark man turns to face you.  He smiles and his bright green eyes shine, silently speaking of his kindness.  It is the Archbishop Crascis.  As you exchange a silent greeting, he steps down from the altar.
<br><br>
"What might you be doing here at this hour?  Service isn't for many hours."
<br><br>
"Father Crascis, I would ask the same of you."
<br><br>
Crascis turns away from the candle he was about to light, and turns cold, hard eyes on you.  You wonder what you said wrong.  
<br><br>
"I am here to thank the light.  It saved me, years ago, from the clenches of those forces less than loving. "
<br><br>
The priest turns to gaze out the window, to feast his eyes on the darkness of night. He appears to think to himself for a minute or two, and then turn's back, his expression softening.
<br><br>
"Well, I am happy I can share this hour with you.  It is not always enjoyable to spend this anniversary by myself."
<br><br>
Crascis starts to walk toward a door to the side of the inner sanctum.
<br><br>
"Please, come with me to the inner chambers where we can speak.  Would you listen to my story?  I have not spoken of it since I came to the kingdom."
<br><br>
Compelled, you nod.  You follow the still youthful priest as he walks to the inner chambers.  You enter a well-lit room, adorned with many paintings depicting ancient scenes of divine war and conquest.  You see numerous books spread out in research, and various amulets hanging from pegs.  He settles down in a chair, and pours a glass of wine for you.  You accept it, and sip from it gratefully.  He then pours himself a drink, and begins sipping as well.  In this moment, he looks more like an old friend you need to catch up with, rather than the Archbishop.  He looks down, and the torchlight reflects out of his silvery goblet, casting a red hue to his face.  The shaking of his hand sets a pattern across his face as he begins to speak….
<br><br>
"As a young man, every day I had a list of chores to do for my father.  His temple was the largest in Qeynos, and it had a lot of mundane needs that I mostly took care of.  I didn't particularly LIKE doing the work, but it was expected of me.  I especially hated the thought of serving Cazic-Thule…  If I complained about the work, being used in the next pain ceremony was my punishment.  Once I tried to run away, and I was caught by fanatics and dragged back to the temple.  That, is an experience I never wish to relive.  
<br><br>
I didn't hate anyone for it though, not even my father.  I came close though, for one man named Darius.  He was the cruelest, oldest and most devout of all the priests in the temple.  He always grinned in eager anticipation when I was to be punished.  
<br><br>
As time went on, I grew older and more expectations were thrown on me.  At age fifteen, I was initiated into the third blood.  That meant one day I was to journey to the sacred graves of Cazic-Thule, and beg to be tortured.  I would than be eligible to become a high priest.  
<br><br>
I suppose at that age, chores were a release from the horror that I believed awaited me.  Yet, in the back of my mind, I planned an escape.  Failure while attempting this would mean the worst death possible...The proper punishment for <em>unfaithful</em> third blood.  
<br><br>
Yet, staying would be no better, in my mind.
<br><br>
A year later from being initiated, my chance would come…."
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
…A servant boy, dressed in red garb, finds his way down the city street.  He is to go to the market in order to purchase food for the elite members of his temple.  They would be at the daily gathering to discuss the future of their religion in Norrath.  Many of them are city authorities or wealthy merchants.
<br><br>
The people in the street, noticing his clothing, stepped away from him and huddled their own children away and out of sight.  The boy ignored them.  He has a task that needs to be completed, no excuses.  
<br><br>
One of the fat nobles, named Philip, had a strong taste for honey-buns.  Philip demanded the best, and knew where they were.  The servant-boy had to go to the same booth everyday on his way through the market, and he both despised and eagerly anticipated the daily trip.
<br><br>
At this booth, there was a beautiful half-elf girl who seemed to like him.  He would have ignored her, like every other girl who showed such interest (as the laws dictated), yet he was required to go to her everyday to purchase the pastries she sold.  
<br><br>
The boy DID try to ignore her, but as usual, the heart of a young man cannot ignore the charms of a girl forever.  
<br><br>
The temple boy was at the pastry stand, grateful the girl was not in sight.  He began prodding through the buns, looking for the best one.  He spotted a large one at the far end of the table, and reached out to try and take it.  As he did, however, a delicate and slender hand appeared from under the table to take it before he did, and Sylvis, the little elf girl popped up from her hiding place.  She held the bun in front of the boy's face, grinning at the way he jumped.
<br><br>
The temple boy looked into the girl's eyes.  They were a striking green, similar to his own but highlighted by the sharp, pale features of her seemingly delicate face.  Her long, silky brown hair was tied back by a green ribbon, which dangled down her back.
<br><br>
"Hi again!" she piped cheerfully
<br><br>
The boy snatched the bun away from her and forced a scowl.
<br><br>
"Aw, you wouldn't steal from a helpless girl like me, would you?"  She batted her eyes innocently
<br><br>
"No, uh…um..  of course not!"	
<br><br>
The boy became very flustered, and began fishing madly through his pockets at the accusation.  Sylvis' eyes turned playful, quickly poking the boy in the ribs as she squealed in mischief.
<br><br>
"I know you wouldn't Silly!"
<br><br>
The boy looked pretty annoyed by now, and angrily grabbed a coin in his pocket.  He held his hand out firmly, silently commanding her to take it so he could be off.  Yet, before he could do anything else, the girl snapped her hand out and grabbed the boy's hand completely.  She yanked him partly over the table, and moved her face inches away from his.  She looked like she was going to say something, but decided to examine him for a moment longer.  As he tried to pull away again, she lunged forward and kissed him.  After a moment of that, the boy pulled away in shock.
<br><br>
Sylvis grinned.
<br><br>
Crascis shivered.
<br><br>
He wasn't allowed to do this sort of thing.  He had to wait until the elders told me he could marry.  If they caught him doing such a thing…. Well, he did enjoy it.
<br><br>
He was brought back to reality as Sylvis, still holding his hand, squeezed it.  She leaned forward, and whispered into his ear:
<br><br>
"I'll be at the temple-kitchens back door at midnight.  I want to see you then."
<br><br>
She then let go, and went back to work as if the "incident" hadn't occurred.
<br><br>
…"I remember how the rest of the day was a blur of fear, anxiety and excitement.  I was already months ahead in my studies, so I let them go for a day to daydream about the beautiful half-elf girl."…
<br><br>
A small tap came at the window.  The young Crascis crept over to it, and opened the window.  There was Sylvis in the shadows, smiling as usual.   So, Crascis walked over to the door and opened it to sneak outside.  The girl wasn't visible this time, and he looked around in the dark not seeing to well.  He almost jumped again when there was a tap on his shoulder.  He whirled around to see Sylvis, in a dark outfit.  She silently took his hand, and led him off.  They ran and bobbed through the thick woods, and Crascis took his share of branches in the face before they stopped.  When they were far enough away, Sylvis turned to Crascis and said:
<br><br>
"I'm glad you decided to come.  I know this is dangerous for you, but I had too see you outside of the marketplace."  She smiled … and Crascis' heart nearly melted
<br><br>
She continued to lead him through the forest outside of the city.  As they walked along, she began telling him more about herself. 
<br><br>
She told him about how she was abandoned as a child, and merchants bought her for her looks.  The merchants thought they would help in the bartering process.  She said she longed to run away as well, but if she were caught trying to do so, the merchant would have her hung.  
<br><br>
They wandered through the forest for awhile, talking to each other about where they had come from, and where they wanted to go.  Sylvis said that maybe she could go live on an island where there were mostly elves.  Crascis listened, not quite sure knowing what to suggest.  How could he suggest she take a risk like this?  They continued to walk and then found a small waterfall from a fast moving brook there. They decided to stop for a rest on a nearby rock.   It was really quite beautiful there, as more moonlight turned the water into silver.  The gentle rush of the water gave the place a peaceful sense, so they mostly sat there together in silence.  Crascis looked over to see Sylvis looking down at the water, thinking lonely thoughts.  She looked beautiful there, with her silky hair drooping down as she leaned over to get a better view of the water.  She sat like a nimble animal, ready to pounce, and Crascis found himself studying her.  Sylvis looked up at Crascis, and smiled slightly.  There was, however, a barely discernable pool of pain behind her eyes.  Crascis noticed this, and moved over and put his arm around her, causing her to relax visibly.  She looked up again into his eyes, with a lot of happiness, but still some grief.  Sylvis thought it wouldn't last.
<br><br>
Crascis turned his gaze back onto the silvery pool, and knew what he had to do.  He kicked a small rock into the pool in frustration, sending out moonlight dipped ripples.  He watched as the ripples created variations in the ones caused by the waterfalls, and grinned at the symbolism.  He started to hold Sylvis a little closer, and said without looking at her:
<br><br>
"We will leave this place Sylvis.  We will run away together, and find new lives.  But…I do want you to be sure on your decision, it will be very dangerous.  "
<br><br>
That earned him another kiss.  It was settled.  They then turned serious as they decided when they would make a run for it.  Crascis was older now, and would not be so easily caught…
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
The man smiled to himself from the shadows.  Master would be enraged…
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
The next morning, after Crascis got a few hours of sleep, he woke to do his morning chores after having breakfast with father.  Sylvis had decided that tonight would be the best night, as tonight was an important holiday.  The temple would be having service outside in the city center, on top of a stage, and  preparations were almost finished.  Sylvis and Crascis had decided to make a run for it during the ceremony.  He would wander off to "get fresh candles", but he would really go meet Sylvis back in the marketplace.  From there, they would quickly spend all their savings on supplies, and run off faster than the wind.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
Night came, and a huge crowd gathered in the city center.  Even those who did not worship Cazic-Thule went, for fear of being singled out as non-believers by the priests.  Crascis had spent the entire day arranging the ceremonial items.  Black sand, bone chalk on "holy symbols", blood from various creatures and various candles were all required to be arranged in meticulous detail.  In a sort of rebellion against the evil god he knew he now hated, he subtly altered their arrangement.  Enough to throw off the various spells and hexes at the end of the ceremony.  Crascis grinned to himself throughout the entire first part of the ceremony.  He then whispered to the master of ceremonies that he would go off to "fetch new candles".  He nodded to Crascis, and Crascis slipped away. 
<br><br>
Strange…
<br><br>
As Crascis walked away, he wondered at how easy that was.  He had done the same a thousand times during ceremonies, but he always got a quick lecture or set of instructions.  This time, he had had no such encounter.  Still, Crascis could only rush to his agreed meeting point.  He refused to believe that the temple would know his plans…  He wanted to pray for safety, but to whom?…certainly not the evil one.  He rushed through the now empty city to Sylvis' booth.  He was shocked to find a woman who was middle aged sobbing with her head down on the table.  He rushed over, and looked around the booth for Sylvis.
<br><br>
"What?!  What happened?"
<br><br>
"They…   The priests came and took her! They…" she stopped speaking as she noticed the garb Crascis was wearing.  She put on an evil face, and shouted a string of curses at him.  Apparently, she knew Sylvis from around the market.  Crascis held up his hands, and pleaded with her.  At the mention of his own name, she stopped yelling.  
<br><br>
"Your him?!  Oh my!  She has been taken by men at your temple!!"
<br><br>
Crascis held onto a wall so he could stand up.  Little use, as he fell down anyway.  He stared blankly up at the night.  He couldn't believe it.  How had they known?  Darius.  Crascis leaped up, and began tearing apart the booths with an unlucky plank that happened to be lying around.  The woman, in terror, closed her booth's window and ran away.  After a few minutes of breaking things, he walked in a state of misery into a nearby alley, and let himself collapse at the end of it.  He pulled his knees up in a state of sorrow and fury.  He shook, knowing the fate that now awaited he and Sylvis.  He sat there for awhile, and could think of nothing to do.  He decided to pray.  To anything that gave a damn.  He sat there, praying fervently to a good god he had heard about.  Maybe he could go and end his life in public in protest.  Maybe he would set the temple on fire, before he was caught and tortured to death.  
<br><br>
As he was about to get up, a blinding flash knocked him back down again.  He could feel the ally walls around him, but could see nothing but bright lights.  Blurs shot around his semi-blindness, and he started to panic.  He then noticed a man walking toward him out of the blue.  He wore simple white robes, and a kind face.  He took Crascis face in his hands, and closed his eyes…
<br><br>
It then felt like a wave of warm water rushed through him.  All his was suffering washed away, and his soul was cleansed.  After a minute, the man took his hand away.  Before Crascis could ask, the man spoke…
<br><br>
"I am one of those who desires the end of Cazic-Thule's rule over the people here.  I am a god, Crascis.  I am here, because I have heard your calls.  We have been watching you, Crascis.  We know you are noble and good of heart.  Your father has kept you from doing the work you are destined to do.  He knows your nature and true destiny….  Such as him will suffer greatly in the end.
<br><br>
Crascis was reeling.  He couldn't think of anything to say.  As his thoughts raced, the being turned loving eyes on him.  
<br><br>
"I will be your new father, Crascis, your old one is dead in my eyes.  I would ask that you give yourself to the light.  You will than be released from all the oaths you have taken.  You will be cleansed from the taint of your father."
<br><br>
Crascis, in tears, knelt down in front of him.  He kissed his feet, and begged he be forgiven for every bad thing he had done.  The being embraced him, and Crascis saw his body become semi-transparent.  He saw the blackness in him be washed away, and be replaced with Holy strength.  Then, two angelic warriors appeared with armor and weapons.  The armor was glowing as bright as the sun, but it did not hurt his eyes to look upon it.  They smiled proudly at him as they fastened the armor on him.  They handed him a large morning star, with etchings carved into the silver plated handle.  The being, then but his hands around the head of Crascis, and a helmet shimmered into existence.  
<br><br>
"You will be my missionary, Crascis.  It takes more than a strong arm to do the good work.  That is why I have chosen you.  You will do battle with the minions of the dark.  This is the only path you can take, if you wish to ever be happy…if you ever with to truly save Sylvis." The being smiled as he said the last sentence, and pulled his hands away.
<br><br>
"You must start with your former father Crascis.  He is evil, and is a minion of the dark.  I am sorry though, as I cannot direct you to Sylvis.  Cazic-Thule hides her from me, to keep you suffering.  He will offer you many things on your quests, your love being one of them.  Do not accept, for they will be lies.  You must be strong and secure.  That is why I have given you this armor to wear at all times.  However, Crascis, you must be a beacon of light for everyone.  Not just Sylvis and not just the ones you love.  Both enemies and friends are your students."
<br><br>
The being waved a hand, and a soft blue light settled upon Crascis.  
<br><br>
"You have my eternal blessing.  Go, seek out the darkness and destroy it.  I hereby give you the name LightBorn, for you were reborn into the light.  You are now my priest, and will bring the gift of light to others.  God blesses you, my son."
<br><br>
Crascis than fell down, and was asleep for a few minutes.  When he awoke, the armor he had seen on him before was gone, and was wearing his red robes.  Yet, he felt the armor's protection still.  He felt safe, and an ocean of conviction roared through him.  He looked at the ground, and saw a plain looking morning star on the ground.  Crascis smiled, picked it up, and hid it in his crimson colored robes.
<br><br>
By the disgusted look on people in the crowd, Crascis dreaded the worst.  He put on a cold, hard face before he again appeared in public view.  He then walked up the wooden steps in the back of the stage, to see the temple priests out in full splendor.  There was some blood spilled on the floor, and a few bodies were piled in the corner.  Crascis could see it was now time to teach the city the price of not obeying Cazic-Thule.  Crascis walked around an acolyte, to see his love Sylvis near death with wounds and burns.  She was barely conscious, but she spotted Crascis.  Her eyes started to cry, and a look of pleading came across her face.  She tried to mouth some words, but could not.  Two men were holding her up, to receive the next "rite".  Crascis looked back to here, across all the temple men on the stage, and mouthed the words "I love you.."
<br><br>
Apparently, Darius saw the girl looking behind him, and turned to see Crascis.  He smiled an evil smile at him, and dared him to try something.  At Darius' turn, the others did as well.  The crowd all turned to look upon the young man the priests obviously found of great curiosity.  His father did not betray much emotion.  ...only his sternness.  
<br><br>
Darius spoke: "We know about you, and your precious half-elf wench.  Your lucky we found her before you two did something foolish."  Darius smirked at that.  "Now, you will watch her suffer.  Then, you will be next.  We will not kill you, but we WILL teach you."
<br><br>
Crascis surprisingly did not turn to run either to Sylvis or away from the priests.  He only stood there, looking at each and every man on the stage.  His new gift let him see the blackness of their souls.  Apparently, Crascis' non-response only angered Darius further.  He gestured too two strong-arms, and the three of them advanced toward Crascis.  As they came closer, with menacing smiles, Crascis gripped his morning star tightly under his robes.   When they were within ten paces, Crascis roared out in a voice no one had ever heard him use…
<br><br>
"Halt!  Strip yourselves of your robes, kneel down, and beg for forgiveness!  Than, you will be spared the punishment of the light!  Your souls, and lives will be spared from the punishment you most certainly…have…earned."
<br><br>
The three stopped in shock, and looked at each other.  The crowd became completely silent.  His father actually betrayed shock.  The three strong-arms then looked at each other, as Darius forced a laugh.  They started to approach Crascis again…  
<br><br>
A ball & chain fell from the billowy right sleeve of Crascis' robes, and snapped taught at knee level.  At that Darius hesitated, and the two strong arms drew blades and advanced the young cleric.  
<br><br>
"This, children, is where mercy ends and Justice meets!"
<br><br>
At that, Crascis whipped the morning star around his head, and brought it down on the skull of the first strong-arm.  His head spilled its contents, and he fell limply off the stage to the screams of the crowd.  The morning star now turned white hot, and gave off a penetrating blue light.  The other strong arm screamed and rushed to avenge his fallen comrade.  Crascis stepped to the side and back, and spun away from the swing of the attacker.  The morning star, having a power of its own, swung itself back around as Crascis turned, and caught the stumbling man in the lower jaw as it swung upward.  A load "crunch" could be heard, and the man, trying to scream, went down writhing in pain.  Crascis swung the morning star over his head again, and brought it down on the chest of the man, caving his chest in!  Crascis, now in a righteous rage, stepped over the fallen attackers and toward Darius.  Darius was completely terrified by what he saw in the "servant-boy's" eyes, and tried to run away.  He fell backward over a hot poking rod on the ground.  As Crascis walked toward him, Darius brought his hands up and screamed for mercy.  Crascis thought of all the times he watched victims do the same for Darius, and the punishment he received from this man when Crascis begged on their behalf.  Crascis was about to kill him, but he felt the holy presence in his heart telling him not too.  Crascis, breathing heavily, lifted his head and looked around.  In the space of four seconds, the priests had not moved.  They only stared in shock.  Crascis turned and gazed on Darius, and commanded him to give himself to the light.  Darius stripped his red robes off, and began begging the light for forgiveness.  Crascis looked up again to see the priests drawing ceremonial knives and walking toward him.  He also saw strong-arms bearing more steel racing up onto the stage.  He started to back away, but two pillars of more blue light appeared on either side of him.  The two angelic warriors he had met before stepped out of either column, bearing flaming swords, golden armor, and bright shields.  The crimson color on Crascis' robes turned into liquid…blood in fact...  and dripped off his robes and splattered on the stage around him.  Every drop of red fell off his robes, leaving them a gleaming white.  Everyone halted in terror…  Except Crascis' father
<br><br>
"You have failed me, son.  You have gone to the other side.  That much is…clear.  You will die now….  You will be deprived of paradise of the abyss."  Crascis' father began a spell of great proportions, and the ceremonial stones began glowing a dark red in response.  Crascis could see the evil running between the ceremonial artifacts on stage and his father.  As the high priest pointed at Crascis, a look of terror came on his own face.  Fire sprung from air all around him, looking like hands of fire, and grabbed him.  Crascis realized his little "alterations" had worked.  His father knew what he had done, and looked upon his son with eternal hatred.
<br><br>
Crascis spoke: "You are my father no longer.  Give yourself to the light, before you die, ye follower of Cazic-Thule."
<br><br>
The high priest stared at Crascis through the fire engulfing him, and let out a scream of hate.   Then, the fires took him and dragged him screaming into hell. 
<br><br>
"Such is the fate that awaits the evil" Crascis muttered.
<br><br>
Some of the priests began kneeling down and begging mercy.  Their more faithful friends killed them for it.  Those in the crowd unfaithful to Cazic-Thule began cheering and singing songs of praise to the God of Crascis.  Those that would not convert slunk away into the shadows.
<br><br>
The highest-ranking priest still alive screamed the order to attack, and the faithful priests and hire-swords rushed Crascis.  The angelic warriors had other ideas…
<br><br>
The angels streaked toward the attackers bringing death on all sides.  They were truly angels of death.  Down went the evil priests in groups of three, screaming in horror.  The angels were here not so much to protect Crascis, (his faith would do that), as they were here to bring punishment.  Crascis stared ahead, and saw the ones behind the fighting fleeing, and bringing his love Sylvis with them.  She didn't seem to be alive now, but Crascis couldn't tell.  He stormed after them, killing anyone in his way.  Pretty soon, he stopped using his morning star, and the rushing attackers found invisible forces knocking them away with incredible strength.  He rounded the corner, to see several horses and coaches being loaded.  They started moving, and Crascis raced after them.  They were prepared now, and had spells of their own to keep him at bay.  Crascis finally broke free, and ran after the coaches…  yet… he could not catch up.  They raced off down the king's road.  Crascis looked around to see the remaining horses killed…
<br><br>
Crascis slumped down in despair, and looked at the setting sun with tears in his eyes.  A voice from inside spoke to him: "The evil one keeps her hidden from us, so that he may cause you greater suffering.  He knows your destiny, and intends to see it unfulfilled.   Your ONLY choice, my son, is to hunt down those who would follow evil.  Bring your light to those who only see darkness.  Bring down the growing forces of evil in this land.  Only then, will you be able to re-discover your loved one -  when you break Cazic-Thule's power over this land.  Go my son, the world awaits you…."
<br><br>
Crascis gripped his morning star tightly, stood up, and swore an oath to himself, to Sylvis, and to the light.  He would never stop fighting while he still drew breath.  The evil ones would fear his approach, and be either killed or converted.  Indeed, their crimes warranted no less…
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
From there, Crascis brought those faithful to the light to the Center Square.  The holy-men in hiding came out, and sang praises to the heavens.  The people who had seen what Crascis had done, swore oaths to the gods of light to do the good work.  Crascis gathered a group of clerics, as well as a standing army of converts, and marched out of Qeynos in a week's time.  They stopped at every village they came across, and freed them from the horror of Cazic-Thule.  Crascis sent out groups of missionaries to different directions as he gained more and more converts. He aged a few years while on his journey's, and grew into full manhood.  
<br><br>
As he went further out however, the resistance became stronger, and more deadly.  He could not continue, lest he waste the lives of countless followers.  He set of a system of communication between the faithful villages and towns, and left the local priests in charge.  He then journeyed with nothing but the clothing on his back and his morning star, and searched for another way to perform his duty.  Then, he came across a mighty, noble kingdom.  He had never seen the likes of it before, and found that the light had brought him here on purpose.  He pledged loyalty to the great and noble King there, and was enlisted in their ranks as a cleric.  He soon learned how to be close friends with someone other than his love Sylvis.  He also became great friends with the Archbishop there, as they held the same views on the universe.  His reputation soon reached the kingdom through traders, and the kingdom, approving of his work, moved him up ranks within the Church there.  Over time, sadly, the Archbishop had to leave.  They asked Crascis to take his place, and he reluctantly accepted.
<br><br>
Crascis would begin building an order of devout and powerful clerics.  He became brother to all in the kingdom, and did anything he could to serve them.
<br><br>
Here, in this place, Crascis would work with the kingdom to keep the onslaught of the evil back.  He would also continue to bring the light to those who have never known it and justice to those who opposed it.
<br><br>
<hr color="black">
<br><p style="text-align: justify">
Having finished his story, Crascis looks upon you and states:
