<b>Part Six</b>
<br><br>
   The first day of classes was a nightmare.  The trials that Pedder had given her the day before seemed like play compared to the warm up that they were expected to do.  The other students were openly contemptuous of her, and whispered loudly among themselves about favoritism.  One arrogant Dwarf told her to her face that she would never have passed the Tests, and that if the training did not kill her, the final Exam would.  By the end of the day, she was weary to the point of incoherence, sore in every muscle, and ready to weep at the next snide word or sideways look thrown her way<b>...</b>

	The first thing that ran through my mind was 'WHAT happened?' quickly followed by 'WHERE am I?'.   It was totally dark where I was.  I could feel the difference in temperature and ambiance from the light show I had just left. Water was dripping somewhere and I could smell the dankness of it.  I discovered I was crouching, holding an unfamiliar dagger in my hand<b>...</b>

<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="-1">
Verant has presented us with an interesting quandary. They have proclaimed role playing to be this undefineable, nebulous thing. Yet they are perfectly willing to label their game an RPG and provide switches. Just what is going on here? To kick start things, I'm going to paraphrase the definition of 'role play' from a psychological journal. To wit: Role play is the act of defining an imaginary persona, replete with desires and motivations for the express purpose of acting out an imagined situation. Now while this is obviously intended to be very general, it certainly is applicable. To paraphrase, you create a persona with motivations, and then stick with it. Contrary to Verants objections, they have done just that.

Beneath Befallen's putrid mound<br>
Amidst the boulder'd tombs<br>
Where undead creatures slink and moan<br>
A treasure may be found
<br><br>
Yet seek ye not this thing of lore<br>
Until your blood is warmed<br>
For finding it shall test thee true<br>
And lead through thrice locked doors

<center><big><b>Balancing and/or Strengthening the Classes: Caveats to Consider</big></center></b>
<p style="text-align: justify">

<font size="-1">

There has been an extensive and ongoing debate about strengthening and balancing the various classes. The most popular of these, so far as I have seen, surrounds the Warrior class. I have been following this and other discussions for some time now, and have noticed that there are a number of things to be said about it. This article has two parts. First, I would like to summarize some of the points made about strengthening/balancing the classes. Second, and my main focus, is centered on an issue which I have not seen discussed: How strengthening the classes would result in a need to similarly recalibrate monsters' statistics and abilities as well.

Gurgle has been getting many comments and questions from envious Ogres and irate blue-elves about her adorable little blue-elf pet Cynarra. Gurgle not so much concerned about the blue-elves who rant and rave about not taking them seriously.  However, Gurgle has realized that the many justifiably envious Ogres who see Gurgle with such a cute pet may rush out and get a blue-elf pet for themselves without considering the very serious responsibilities that come with blue-elf ownership!

I recently read Brian Hooks <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/ask/editorial2.htm#jun-16">article at Voodoo Extreme</a> about camping, and what his solution for it might be.  It's a very smart analysis.  He has all the reasons for camping and its affects nailed.  But I think his conclusion will prove wrong.
