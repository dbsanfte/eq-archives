The favorite comment among diehard mudders and online rpg players after 12 hours (or more) of playing goes something like, "Welp, I guess I better log and get a real life."  This is followed of course by the appropriately emoted smirks and snickers and smiles from the companions of the day's adventure.    The thing is, though, as numerous all night conversations I've been part of have focused on, there is really not a clearcut demarkation between the fantasy life of an online game and the "real" life we experience daily.   In fact, I think that there is a continual flow between the two kinds of reality, mundane and imaginal.  They are not really opposite sides of a coin but are two spheres of experience that constantly influence each other with what might be described as overlapping psychological gravity fields.  This statement, of course, makes it seem like a person's involvement with gaming/mudding and real life can still be examined in neat little packages, but what happens in this ebb and flow of consciousness, unconsciousness, expressions of different parts of our psyches, and interactions with the hearts, minds and souls of other individuals is something that can not be separated drily and meticulously.  What we are dealing with is a kind of chaos, a Jungian eros, that is often messy, murky, muddy (pun intended) and yet still serves to enrich our existences and nurture the creative energies that often burst forth in real life once we spend time with others in the sphere of the imaginal.
<br><br>
Of course, if we were all perfect people, unflawed and fully realized, then our lives wouldn't be ruffled or mussed by our transitions back and forth between real life and imaginal life.  Well, maybe you are perfect.  I'm not, though, and as I think about how the people I've met and played with have influenced me, endeared themselves to me, cheered me, hurt me, surprised me, shocked me and pissed me off, the conclusion I come to is that it's a good thing to look at the pleasures and pitfalls I've encountered trying to balance my imaginal and real lives, trying somehow to allow a reasonable flow between them.  The pleasures include friendships -- forming, moving to real life, moving back to imaginal life, and so forth; creative involvement -- arising out of the imaginal but being expressed in real life in art, music, writing and speaking; and, finally,  a freedom of being where I can try out ways of seeing myself and interacting with others in the virtual world in ways not available real life. 
<br><br>
The friendships can be wondrous.  Where the elements of judgment in real life -- looks, age, money, etc. -- have little to do with how people see us, there is a fresh opportunity for relating.   Humor  and goodwill work their wonders.  Smile, sometimes there is even love. Freedom for honesty in telling of our real lives, receiving attentive listening and returning the favor, creates strong bonds of caring.  Even in the most intense roleplay, there remains (hopefully) a compassionate awareness of the essential personality creating the imaginal character.    What is interesting to me is that out of this positive way to relating to people on the mud or in the game, is that as we play our characters, very often all kinds of new creative impulses will arise and as we share them with our friends, the bouncing back and forth of the new ideas and images will support the real life person in trying to make them tangible.  New roleplay ideas and scripts arise, stories get written (or at least imagined - grin).   Poems insist on being set down on paper.   Images pop into mind for drawing and other artistic renderings.  Then when the stories or art or songs or new ideas are shared, something else occurs.  Gates in the psyche are open and long held defenses can be set aside as we use our strengths in both aspects of our individual reality to infuse our actions in the other.  My favorite image of this is my mud warrior Rela, fearlessly racing into the dragon's lair, hoping to inflict just enough damage before death to help the next wave of the group's assault, whispering to my real life self words of courage when a monster energy seems to be threatening me.  
<br><br>
The pitfalls are a little harder to describe.  Some of them still hurt actually.  People in imaginal worlds are not  always just role playing with no real life consequences.  Sometimes they lie and the lies affect both worlds.   Sometimes people attempt to damage others in both the imaginal and the real life.  Many times we take the frustrations or anger that we cannot change or overcome in real life and put them into our imaginal lives and create enormous  problems for ourselves when the real  people behind the players we meet react to them.  And of course, there is that big bugaboo about being productive.  Non-gamers sit in puzzlement at the investment we put into a game with no tangible reward.   Or, after a pwipe or loss of characters and possessions, there is that moment, comfortably slouched in front of the screen, where we moan, "Oh nooooooooo, I lost everything."    Other pitfalls are the possibility of neglecting people and responsibilities in real life in favor of "just one more level" and finally, the possibility to trying to live out in real life what exists in the imagination to the detriment of the way we live our daily lives.
<br><br>
I still shake my head over my naivete about the fellow who had me convinced he had written "Sweet Home Alabama" until my best friend, chatting with him on the phone, started writing in huge letters on my desk pad, "He's a big fat liar", and set me straight about him.  This is a pitfall.  That particular example isn't life ruining, but sometimes people do lie about deeply intimate things hurting the person they lied to enormously.    Friends can be hurt too when we bring our frustrations and anger into the game unconsciously and use them against others.   Often people will also include attributes of their personal or business ethics in their game interaction, like the friendly warm person I met who became distant and cold when it was obvious I could no longer help him achieve his goals and he moved on to another level where people could.  It doesn't seem to matter what particular neuroses we might have in real life, they pop up in our roleplaying and in how we treat those we interact with.  Who hasn't experienced seeing themselves through gossip and innuendo from others who needed a scapegoat or a handy target for whatever negative energy they needed to hang on someone else.  It happens frequently in a world where so much is conveyed by, usually, so few typed words.  Interpretation and misinterpretation often create a monster out of a person seen a moment before as a likeable individual.   I suppose in a way this is the flip side of using an image, such as I do with Rela, so that the negative flows from our real lives into our imaginal lives and then, often, back out again as our real life person becomes angry or hurt by the mud or game interaction.    Or, again, there is the night where one comment uttered becomes the entire basis of how a group member will forever see you.  Hmm another way of putting it is that a major pitfall in this traffic back and forth between real life and the imaginal, is that the limitations of the interaction do cause us to assume we know and see a lot more about a person than we do.  And the judgments that follow are askew because of it.  
<br><br>
Even if you are lucky enough to avoid the above experiences, there is still the pitfall of nonproductivity to be considered.   How do the products of the imaginal life balance the products of the everyday?  Does the lightweight effect of a silly poem by Nepenthia balance the heaviness of a basement full of dirty clothes?  What about grades?  Jobs?  Material gain in the imaginal versus material consumption in the day-to-day?  The interinfluence of the two worlds can both clash and support what we do.  I can list a horde of people who can and do point out that I'm wasting my time.  And in some ways they are right.  But then again, did I ever sit down to ponder and write like I am now?  Did I experience the rich fire of images warming me from the imaginal world I wander when I only stayed in the details of real life?  How do I measure the lack of achievement in real life with the pouring out of creative energy that otherwise would have remained locked up tight and sunken deep into the dishpan of daily chores?
<br><br>
Even this discussion of pleasures and pitfalls, real and mundane is impossible to keep in neat organized measures of thought.   I guess maybe it's the "vibration of the butterfly's wing in Japan affecting the weather in Nebraska"  kind of thing.   Back and forth, the influences fly, positively and negatively, between the Nep that sits on the docks in Freeport and the woman who sits in her chair, directing from the depths of her soul and the warmth of her real life toes, consciously and unconsciously, Nep's next step.    It is going to be messy and muddy.    The exchanges between the realms can also be lovely and lively.  If we're very lucky, the meeting of the real life and the imaginal energies and the crossings created, can deepen the dimensions of our wisdom and wit enriching both realms as we continue to wander through them.
