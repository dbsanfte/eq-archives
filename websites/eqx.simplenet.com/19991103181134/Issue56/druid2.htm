It was cool inside the hollow of the Great Tree.  Druids lined the walls, casting spells and talking quietly, a few with shaggy wolves panting amiably at their feet.  The ceiling rose up into the tree, disappearing  into darkness over Aklar's head.  The sap of the living tree pulsed in the walls, a flickering light that filled the place with a soft wavering glow.  As always, when she came here, Aklar could feel the harmony of nature, the loving gaze of Tunare like a palpable touch on her skin.  Here, it never seemed hard to live in peace, to do no harm.  Here, she could remember what it had felt like the first time she heard the Tunare's call, that soft surging like the wind, like tree sap in spring, like the flow of a stream over rounded pebbles.   It was impossible not to feel humbled and awed.  
<br><br>
Te'Anara stood behind the great wooden Meeting Table at the back of the chamber, discussing something with a few Druids of the Conclave and Hagar Sureshot, the Master Ranger.  They looked intent and worried, and Aklar paused just inside the entrance, hesitant about interrupting.  Te'Anara shook her head firmly and Hagar laid a hand on her arm, leaning forward, pressing his point.  One of the Druids stepped forward, lips thinning, and Te'Anara stopped her with a gesture.  She plucked Hagar's hand from her arm and moved smoothly back from him as he reached out again.  His hand dropped, and he made a stiff formal bow before turning on his heel and stalking away.  Aklar moved quickly aside as he made for the entrance.  His face as he passed her was a mask of frustration and… it couldn't be… fear.  Fear on the normally unflappable Ranger was enough to make the knot in Aklar's stomach draw achingly tight.  Hagar was like rock, immovable, impervious.  What could be bad enough to make him show such obvious emotion?  
<br><br>
"Aklar."  Te'Anara's voice was like the stab of a thorn.  Aklar jumped and spun toward her.  The Druid's face was smooth and calm as always, but her eyes could have drawn blood.  "I had thought our conversation about the Karanas had been clear to the both of us.  Or have you learned patience so quickly?  I find myself that some days it is an uphill battle."  
<br><br>
Aklar flinched slightly.  Te'Anara had never been so sharp with her.  Her legendary serenity was a thin veneer today.  Taking her courage in both hands, she advanced slowly into the chamber.  All conversation had ceased, and making the short trip from the door to the table was like march of shame, with everyone's eyes fixed on her.   Her assignment to the Karanas had been a private matter between her and Te'Anara, but now everyone would know.   Aklar's cheeks burned, but she kept her head high, and made the walk with as much dignity as she could muster.  
<br><br>
It slipped like sand through her hands, however, when she finally stood face to face with Te'Anara.  The Head Druid looked at her expressionlessly.  Aklar swallowed.
<br><br>
"Leave us, please, my friends," she said finally, and Aklar felt a brief moment of relief as she turned her gaze on the others in the room, gathering them up by eye and sweeping them out.  They left, murmuring swift courtesies, some with sympathetic gazes at Aklar.  One or two looked at her with thinly concealed satisfaction.  There were many that felt that the Head Druid had been too lenient for too long.  Then Te'Anara turned to her again and her mouth went dry.
<br><br>
   	"Well?" demanded Te'Anara.  "What is your excuse this time? Boredom? A yearning for home? Or did you have another <em>feeling</em>, like the one that drove you to enter BlackBurrow at the 4th level?  I grow tired of speaking and having my words ignored.  If I cannot inspire obedience, surely some level of respect is not too much to ask.  For you to walk in here, not two weeks after I reassign you!  Aklar, do you not think at all?"
<br><br>
   	"Te'Anara, I..." she began.
<br><br>
"No.  I will not hear it.  If you cannot be trustworthy than you cannot expect trust.  You gave me your word, Druid.  It was false.  Why should I listen, then, to what you say?  Of all times, Aklar, for you to let your Fellowship down…" Te'Anara turned swiftly away, but not before Aklar saw tears glisten.  Shame washed over her like a flood.  Te'Anara, weeping!  
<br><br>
"Druid Te'Anara," she began formally.  "I have erred grievously, and I will formally submit myself to the Conclave if that is your will, but I have urgent news."  Te'Anara's back stiffened.  "I…" Aklar faltered, fearing the storm that she would surely brew with her confession.  "I went back to Blackburrow."  Te'Anara, slowly turned, head tilted slightly as if not sure what she had heard.
<br><br>
"What?" she said dangerously.
<br><br>
"I accompanied two adventurers who wished to lend assistance to the fight.  I guided one in from the Karanas, that's why I abandoned my assignment, which," Aklar swallowed, "I will stand accountable for to the Conclave.  They needed me, Te'Anara.  You always say the Tunare touches us not in miracles but through the patterns of our lives.  I swear, I felt that there was a part for me to play in this.  I have learned much.  I have!  And it was well that I went."  Aklar faltered under Te'Anara's ominous silence.
<br><br>
 "Well?" she said in frozen tones.
<br><br>
"The Gnolls are massing.  They are much more numerous than they have been in recent months.  They are gathering their numbers for some nefarious purpose, keeping underground, recalling scouts and watchers, protecting their caverns more fiercely than ever.  I saw it with my own eyes, Te'Anara."
<br><br>
"You saw it." Te'Anara pinched the bridge of her nose as if her head pained her.  "Aklar," and Aklar winced at her tone.  "You feel that with your vast experience, you can judge the tactical strategy of the Sabretooths?  You have become a military strategist when I didn't notice? Is this what the Karanas taught you?"  Her voice was rising steadily, and when Aklar opened her mouth, Te'Anara rode over her without a pause. "I cannot believe that you would invent such a tale to escape your duties.  I am appalled, Druid!  Have I taught you nothing?  Even if your story were true, it is not a Druid's duty to become involved in such matters.  Our charge is the forest, the trees and beasts our responsibility.  Let the city dwellers become embroiled in war if they so wish.  It is a corrupt pursuit for the corrupt.  We are outside, we hold ourselves apart.  It is who we are!  If you cannot accept that, then you do not belong here."
<br><br>
"Are you blind?" Aklar fought to contain her anger.  "Hold ourselves apart? Outside of war?  The Gnolls will not agree with you, I am sure.  Already the poachers encroach on us.  That is how much they respect our stance of non-involvement.  As for our duties," and Aklar took a step forward. "I have read the old texts and there was a battle clan in the old times, a clan that marched alongside warriors of Qeynos.  Stand aside if you will, Te'Anara.  I cannot!"
<br><br>
"Then you will stand alone."  Te'Anara's eyes were distant.  Aklar felt a cold hand grip her heart.  Alone…
<br><br>
"Are you casting me out, Head Druid?  You will need the consensus of the Conclave."  Her lips felt stiff and numb.
<br><br>
"I think it is best if you just go."  The Head Druid turned away and laid a hand on the wall as if for support.  The glowing sap ringed and pulsed under the pressure.   Aklar stared at her back for a long moment, wanting to say something, wanting to take it back…but she would not lie, not to herself, not to Te'Anara.  Not to Tunare, and she did feel the Great Mother's Hand in this.  But to be alone… 
<br><br>
"As you wish," she whispered, and slowly made her way out.  She paused in the entrance, wanting to lay her face against the Great Tree and weep, but she forced herself to leave, each step like ripping a part of her soul away.  Her home, her <em>life</em>…
<br><br>
"Tunare help me," she prayed, the tears beginning to slowly slide down her cheeks.  "Guide my soul."
<br><br>
                                                               <hr color="black">
<p style="text-align: justify">
Te'Anara pressed her forehead against the Tree's skin and closed her eyes.  Steps behind her failed to make her look up.
<br><br>
"I wouldn't have thought to choose her," Hagar's deep voice was worried..and thoughtful.
<br><br>
"I didn't." Te'Anara wearily lifted her head.  "Tunare did.  I must trust in the Goddess, but Hagar," she turned to him, face anguished.  "She is so young!  And I drove her away, made her think she is alone."
<br><br>
"We must go on as we began," Hagar too looked tired.  And old, as if care and worry had made weeks into years.
<br><br>
"I know." Te'Anara went to the door and gazed after Aklar's retreating figure, shoulders bowed under a weight she seemed barely able to bear.  "May the Mother forgive us both."
