perversion by the Church of the Sun, it is impossible to fathom whence came the
strange sub-race of men known as &quot;Shades.&quot; Often called the
&quot;Children of the Damned,&quot; Shades are born as human children, normal
but for cold demeanor and chilling appearance - for their skin is ashen gray,
and their pupiless eyes the color of bone white. No one knows why Shades walk
among us, but it is clear the cause - when a human father dies with the child
still in the womb, there is a likely chance - but not a certain one - that the
child will be born as a Shade. Inexplicably, there are also no written accounts
of such births before the Turning.</font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF0000"> </font><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">Denounced as perversions and abominations by the Temple of the Cleansing Flame,
strange beings known as Shades are feared throughout the lands of Men. Debate
still rages over the true nature of these beings, who seem Human, yet are
afflicted with a sinister taint that warps their bodies and poisons their souls.
Often called the &quot;Children of the Damned,&quot; Shades are born to Human
parents, normal but for their bizarre appearance. A Shade's skin is ashen grey
and cold to the touch, and their pupil-less eyes are as black as coals. No one
knows why Shades walk among us, but the cause is finally becoming clear - when a
Human father dies while his child is yet unborn, there is a chance - but not a
certain one - that the child will be born a Shade. There are no accounts of such
births before the Turning. The pallid visage and detached demeanor of the Shades
has given rise to countless rumors and stories that link them to the Undead, and
few of any race have grown to trust the Pale Ones.</span></font>

<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Widely viewed as aberrations, Shades are easily the most distinctive and the
most mysterious of the breeds of Humanity, if they are indeed a
&quot;breed&quot; at all. Unlike the Aelfborn, Shades are not hybrids born of
mixed blood: both of a Shade's parents are Human. Also, a Shade's physical
appearance does not depend on the race of his parents. Whether born to a pale
Northman or an Irydni with skin the color of pitch, Shades are uncannily uniform
in appearance. Often called &quot;the Stillborn&quot; or &quot;the Children of
the Damned,&quot; Shades seem touched by death itself. The skin has a pasty,
corpse-grey pallor, with sunken eyes that give their faces a drawn, skull-like
appearance. Few can look directly into the strange, bone white eyes of a Shade
for very long. Shades are born hairless, and never grow any hair throughout
their entire lives, even lacking eyebrows. A Shade's flesh is cold to the touch,
like the flesh of a corpse. Shades have thin, chilling voices that rarely rise
above a whisper. Despite their light skin, Shades show an uncanny aptitude for
stealth, and blend easily into darkness or shadow. Shades creep through the dark
so easily, in fact, that many simple folk believe them to be practitioners of
evil magic.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for their bizarre and frightening appearance, a
Shades' physiology differs only slightly from their Human parents. Shades are
slightly weaker than the average Human, but are slightly more agile. Shades also
show a profound weakness of Spirit, having even less spiritual aptitude than the
average Aelfborn. Some claim that the Shades' lack of Spirit contributes to
their greatest flaw - Shades are incapable of siring or bearing children. Magi
who lave researched the issue claim that the spark of life a Shade is too weak
to transmit life into a child.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shades are also the youngest of the Children of the World,
having only appeared in the wake of the Turning. Shades were born rarely at
first, but have become more and more common as the Age of Strife has ground on.
Why some infants were born Shades while others (even in the same family) were
not was a mystery at first, but eventually the patterns were surmised by Magi
and Loremasters, who now understand the method (if not the cause) by which an
unborn Human is transformed into a Shade. If a Human man is slain while his
child is yet unborn, there is a chance (each expert disagrees as to the exact
likelihood) that the child will be born a Shade instead of Human. The more often
the father dies and returns to flesh, the more likely the transformation
becomes. If a woman who is with child is slain, when she returns to flesh the
unborn child inside her will almost certainly have changed into a Child of the
Damned. As time has passed since the Turning, the number of Shades in the World
has risen sharply. Whether this is simply a product of the endemic wars of the
Age of Strife, which slay so many mothers and fathers-to-be, or whether some
other force might be at work remains unknown. The Shades themselves do not seem
to know or care.</span></font>

<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shades follow the customs of their Human parents, and have yet to develop any
true culture of their own. Indeed, despite almost a century of persecution, most
Shades still dwell among the Sons of Men. It is far easier to measure the impact
Shades have had upon Human culture than it is to define any kind of unique ways
of life practiced only by Shades.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after the Turning, an entire host of rituals and
traditions sprang into being to eliminate Shades, who most of Humanity viewed as
abominations. Once the Sons of Men discovered that Shades remained Shades no
matter how many exorcisms were worked upon them, and returned to life no matter
how often they were burned, banishment became the preferred solution. Today
Shades are tolerated, if not accepted, and most cities allow their Shades to
dwell among them, though few Humans will admit to liking their company. An
entire subculture of Healers and Magicians has arisen, who try to prevent the
transformation of unborn into Shades. Strict regimens of fasting or prayer,
exotic candles and incense, foul smelling potions, and magical talismans all
figure into their methods, which they claim can keep the shadow of Death at bay.
Surprisingly, these so-called &quot;Shadow Chasers&quot; number many Shades in
their ranks, who claim to bring a personal insight to the problem. Whether the
Shadow Chasers' methods are truly effective remains uncertain. Some consider
them to be well-meaning philanthropists, others see all Shadow Chasers as greedy
charlatans.</span></font>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">
While Humanity has been quick to weave a tangled web of superstitions around
Shades (it is considered bad luck to drink from the same cup as a Shade, be
unexpectedly touched by a Shade, cross a Shade's path, etc), Shades themselves
are, for the most part, a pragmatic people. They have no fear of Death: indeed,
some Shades claim a unique understanding of it. Shades who work as Assassins or
Rogues are quick to use the widespread dread of Shades to their advantage,
cowing and intimidating their victims. When not &quot;working,&quot; however,
Shades do not embellish their macabre appearance the way an Irekei might.</span></font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">
The oldest Shades, born immediately after the Turning, are also the most
eccentric. They bore the full brunt of persecution and inquisition, and as a
result many have come to hate Human civilization. These grim specters lurk in
the shadows of Human cities, spreading whatever madness and terror they can to
avenge the cruelties and tortures of the past. Some of the Aberrant Shades, who
whispered rumors call Shadow Lords, are said to be able to speak with spirits
long dead and manipulate the very stuff of darkness. The Shadow Lords, it is
rumored, often go mad, haunted by visions and nightmares of times long gone,
memories that are not their own</span></font>
