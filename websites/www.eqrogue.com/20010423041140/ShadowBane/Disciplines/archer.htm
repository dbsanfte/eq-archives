<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">Long before
the rise of the Ten Kingdoms, there lived a nation of Men who claimed no land as
their own. Exiled from Ardan, home of the First Men, they wandered over the face
of the World, following the winds. These vagabonds were called the Anomani
(which means &quot;Wanderers&quot; in the Old Tongue of Ardan), and were
universally mistrusted as a nation of half-breed Aelfborn, misfits, tricksters,
and horse thieves who had no place in civilized society. Long did they wander,
coming into conflict with Elves, Centaurs, and the First Men alike. The Anomani
worshipped their own pantheon of Pagan gods and fostered their own unique brand
of myth and magic. Save the echoes of a few songs and fables, nothing is known
of their culture today. Hunted and persecuted wherever they wandered, by the
time Ardan fell the Anomani were all but extinct. Their practices have all been
lost… all save one.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Art is called Il Gwailin ab Eyn, or &quot;the Calling of
the Winds.&quot; While most of the peoples of the world have learned to use
bows, it remains an undisputed fact the the Windcallers of the lost Anomani were
the greatest Archers the World has ever known, capable of astonishing feats of
marksmanship. The Windcaller's Art was born even before they were exiled from
Ardan, when the Shining King of that realm held a great archery contest to find
who was worthiest to marry his daughter. A dim-witted boy of the Anomani came to
the contest, and despite the jeers of the other Warriors, his arrows flew
further, faster, and truer than any other. When asked how he had won, the boy
replied &quot;the wind just told me to shoot.&quot; The Shining Lord was
outraged, and declared that the Anomani had used sorcery to win, and exiled them
from Ardan, the High Kingdom. The boy kept practicing his bow, however, and the
winds kept talking. In their wanderings, the Archers of the Anomani learned that
there are spirits of the air, unseen by mortal eyes, whose voices whisper in the
wind. An Archer must listen to them, learn their secrets, and win their favor.
Their hands will guide your arrow's flight, and their strength will hurl it
home.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elves wrung the secret of Windcalling from the Anomani
through torture, and quickly took the Art as their own. After the fall of Ardan,
the Archer's Art has been lost to the Sons of Men until the Age of Kings, when
Gerriant the White, oldest and most loyal of Cambruin's Champions, joined the
court of the High King. Gerriant's great oaken bow, &quot;Dirgeharp,&quot; was
crafted for him by an Aelfborn Archer of unknown name, who taught the old
Champion the secrets of his Art. Gerriant had spent his life mastering the
ancient discipline of Windcalling, and taught the practice to many of the High
King's warriors before his tragic death on the Day of Woe.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any peasant may learn how to shoot, but only one man in a
hundred can become an Archer, and join our ancient brotherhood. Every Archer
must craft his own bow, tuning its string so that will ring like a harp and call
the Wind Spirits. An Archer needs a keen eye, along with strength of arm and
will. An Archer also needs to learn to calm his heart, to listen for the wind's
faint voices. If you have the mettle to harness the wind, you'll learn how to
hit a target at a thousand paces, how to loose a dozen shots in a minute, and
how to make each arrow fly not only true but fast, striking with the force of
lightning.</font>
