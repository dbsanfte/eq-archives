Civilized and noble, the Birdmen are a race rarely
understood by Man. When first encountered, Man believed them to be primitive and
tribal, but time has proven this to be a completely incorrect assumption. Hunted
by the Elves to a point of near extinction, the few Aracoix who remain are
fierce warriors and brilliant hunters, but disdain the use of Magic beyond the
use of artifacts and relics.</font>

Of all the new creatures encountered since the Turning, the avian humanoids who
Men have come to call Aracoix are the most remarkable. At first many thought
them to be nothing more than a strange, sorcerous fusion of Man and Hawk,
perhaps created by the Elves to use as slaves and soldiers. Others thought them
to be old creatures previously undiscovered, who had lived in some isolated
corner of the World but now roamed far through the use of the Runegates. Magi
and Loremasters now believe Birdmen are creatures from another World entirely,
who have journeyed to the fragments of our World by methods unknown. Civilized
and noble, the Birdmen are a race barely understood by the other Children of the
World. When first encountered, Humans judged the Aracoix to be primitive and
savage aberrations, but time has proven these assumptions completely incorrect.
Hunted to near extinction, the few Aracoix who remain are fierce warriors and
brilliant hunters, and bare little love or trust for any of the peoples of the
World. Rumors tell that the Aracoix disdain all Gods and religions, and are
profoundly suspicious of all Magic.</span></font>

<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Like the Centaurs and Minotaurs, the Aracoix combine the physical features of
Humans and animals, in their case, hawks and eagles. The bodies of Birdmen are
very similar to those of Humans, only with a large, Avian head atop the
shoulders and a pair of broad wings sprouting from the shoulders. Instead of
hair, Aracoix possess thick coats of feathers that cover their heads and wings,
forearms, upper chest, midriff, and lower legs. Aracoix stand taller than Men,
and their body frames are so heavily muscled that it at first glance it seems
impossible that such a creature could fly. Yet fly they do. Aracoix tend towards
dark, stern plumage of scarlet, brown, or deep black, and their faces resemble
hawks, with large, keen eyes and wicked beaks. Aracoix also have remarkably
light bones, and weigh less than a Man of comparable height. Light as Aracoix
bones are, they are still remarkably resilient, and many tribes among the
Twisted Breeds cherish Aracoix bones, using them to fashion weapons and armor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the greatest and most obvious feature of the Aracoix
is their ability to fly. The Birdmen's broad wings can easily carry them into
the air, even when fully armed and equipped. Aracoix fly faster than a Human can
run, and are capable of brief bursts of speed where they can outrace a horse at
full gallop. The Aracoix are clearly, however, more Man than bird. They glide
more than they fly, and they are incapable of a hawk's dives or aerial
acrobatics. Flight is solely a means of transportation to the Aracoix, and they
must return to the ground to enter battle. Unlike many birds, the Aracoix spend
most of their time with their feet firmly on the ground. Limited as the
Aracoix's flight may be, their wings have still freed them from any concerns
about terrain, and hunting wings of Birdmen can move faster than any grounded
army, for they travel as the crow flies.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aracoix are the only race who can compete with the Elves in
terms of nimbleness and agility, and are also surprisingly strong. Some Aracoix
are also remarkably tough, and flight requires that Aracoix have as much or more
stamina than the average Half Giant. Mentally, Aracoix seem at first to be
little more than savages - their beaks and throats are incapable of pronouncing
any language spoken in this World, and their skittish nature defied all early
attempts at communication. In recent years, however, the Children of the World
have discovered that the Aracoix are as strong in Mind and Spirit as the Sons of
Men, and very adept at fashioning buildings and tools. The silence of the
Aracoix has also finally been broken: recent reports indicate that an Aracoix
can, if it is willing, project its thoughts directly into the mind of a
&quot;listener,&quot; provided that the Aracoix can learn to fashion their
thoughts into forms that beings of this World can recognize. As more and more
people have begun to communicate and even befriend the Birdmen, the true picture
of their nature has emerged.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two factors dominate the Aracoix mindset and stand as the pillars of their
culture, and are the keys to understanding the ways of the Birdmen. First,
Aracoix fear and mistrust any and all enlightened beings different from
themselves. Hints dropped by wandering outcasts seem to indicate that the
Aracoix were the only civilized race to inhabit their homeworld, and that they
therefore regard all &quot;heavy ones&quot; (any beings who cannot fly under
their own power) as dangerous pests to be subjugated or destroyed. Secondly,
Aracoix possess profoundly ordered minds, and tend to be highly meticulous,
fastidious, and stubborn. The few Aracoix who have left their people behind tell
tales of the Law, a compilation of laws, rules, and customs that dictates every
aspect of an Aracoix's life. Most Aracoix are absolutely devoted to the tenets
of the Law, which fosters a sense of duty, honor, and absolute loyalty to
family, empire, and species. While some younger Aracoix have rebelled against
the Law's restrictions and turned their backs on their people, most Birdmen are
bound to it with a fanaticism that rivals that of the Irekei.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aracoix fear of outsiders and their absolute devotion to the
Law have combined to create an incredibly warlike, regimented society. Birdmen
live in small communities called Aeries, each inhabited by a Kh'ree (the closest
translation into any of our World's languages would be 'squadron'), an allied
group of families related by marriage. Every Kh'ree is ruled by a commander with
absolute authority, and the roles and duties of every member of the Kh'ree are
rigidly defined by the Law. Flight is one of the central aspects of Aracoix
architecture: their Aeries consist of tall towers with elaborate landing
platforms and walled compounds without gates. In recent years, the Aracoix have
constructed even larger Aeries as their influence has spread. Aracoix unable to
fly due to injury or disease are immediately abandoned by the Kh'ree and given a
ritualized funeral. Defense is paramount in Aracoix communities, for every
Kh'ree must function not only as a social entity but as a military unit as well.
The commanders of every Kh'ree defer to a supreme commander, a Grand Marshall of
sorts, to which of all the Aracoix in our World are held accountable. This
Marshall, it is rumored, is subordinate to some kind of supreme council or
emperor on the Aracoix homeworld, the closest thing the Birdmen have to a god.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be that the first Aracoix that entered the World came
as conquerors, not explorers. Their lack of magical ability led to the initial
defeat of the Birdmen, but in years since the Aracoix have withdrawn to their
unapproachable Aeries, gathered their strength, and recently renewed
hostilities, showing a tactical and strategic acumen worthy of the Centaurs.
Slowly and methodically, the Birdmen are extending their territories through
conquest. Aracoix are highly disciplined in battle, and perfectly willing to go
to their deaths for the success of their squadron. They employ some means of
communication that is not yet understood but seems, in all accounts, to e fast,
easy, and silent. Aracoix show an almost uncanny organization in battle, and are
able to easily coordinate even the most complex battle Laws and assaults.
Masters of hit and run tactics, the Birdmen disdain large engagements,
preferring to wear their opponents down through lightning raids. Most Aracoix
become Warriors, and even those Birdmen who serve their Kh'ree as providers or
craftsmen must spend a portion of their time in military service. Aracoix seem
to despise organized religion and the study of magic above all else, and single
out both temples and arcane libraires in lands that they conquer for
particularly brutal treatment.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, a new phenomenon has swept through Aracoix society,
a trend that has indirectly provided the peoples of the World with all that we
know about the ferocious Aracoix. Hundreds of young Aracoix have renounced the
Law, decrying its restrictions and endless regulations. Apparently, this is the
first wave of dissent the Aracoix have encountered since the Law was formulated
untold millennia ago. Exiled from their people, these young outcasts have
wandered far, mixing with the other peoples of the World and charting their own
destinies. They have revealed much about the culture of the Aracoix, but have
also kept quite a bit hidden.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even these rebellious Aracoix refuse to reveal any of the
secrets of their people, or talk of their homeworld. Hints and inferences seem
to indicate that their entire world is ruled by one vast Aracoix Empire, but no
more details have been forthcoming. Even when enchanted or tortured, Aracoix
reveal nothing of their original homes. These outcasts have also proven unable
to shed any light on the Aracoix disdain for gods and religion. They are
certainly familiar with the concept of deities, but will not comment about
religion, other than dismissing all gods as dangerous. Some comments seem to
indicate that the Aracoix may practice their own forms of the magical arts, but
so far no hard evidence has been reported. Finally, the Aracoix are absolutely
silent when asked why they have come to our World. Given the attitudes and
activities of most of the Aracoix who have come across so far, their plans for
the World are likely far from pleasant.</span></font></p>
