<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
unenlightened and uneducated presume that Alchemists are just another variety of
Wizard, who spend long hours brewing strange potions and distilling chemicals.
While we do work long and hard in our laboratories, we are not magicians: we are
scholars, and we work not to cast magical spells or effects, but to better
understand the basic nature of Life itself. The heathen tribes of the Horwathi
Steppes have an ancient saying: &quot;the Blood is the Life.&quot; Centuries of
trial and experiment by master Alchemists have proven the humble proverb true.
Alchemy is the study of Blood, and its power to transmute the basic elements of
the universe into Life itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many
years, Alchemists have known that the blood that flows in our veins is the
medium through which our bodies are kept whole, soft, and limber. Talmiaches of
Karaton, the greatest Alchemist who ever lived, was the first to prove that all
true living things have some form of blood, be it the red blood of men or
beasts, the sap of trees and plants, or the noxious ichor of the Chaos-tainted.
Non-living objects like ponds, stones, and metals have no blood, and therefore
do not live. Other master Alchemists have since proved that it is the action of
the blood that allows living things to digest the elements they consume in the
form of food, water, and breath, and thus stay alive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As there are four elements in the universe, so are there four
components to all blood, and the proportion of their mixture will vary from
individual to individual and species to species. If you would learn our ancient
wisdom, learn well the ingredients, so that their names are as second nature to
you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maegus, the Spirit Water, is a clear fluid which carries life
and youth to all parts of the body. Without water and the maegus to carry it,
all living things quickly wither and die.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halgon, the Healing Unction, is red like the purest flame. It
draws in the heat from the sun's fire and directs it throughout the body,
melting away sicknesses and refashioning injuries, allowing them to heal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timar, the Thought Wine, is the bright blue product of
elemental air. Timar allows the will and thought of the Spirit and Mind to
travel throughout the body, telling organs to function and limbs to move
according to our volition. Timar is the noblest and most critical of all the
blood components: a man without water will die in days, but a man without air
will die in moments.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bile, or the Dark Sediment, is the fluid that results when
the three ingredients above mix too freely with the earth of which our bodies
are composed. All living things create bile as a consequence of their existence,
but if their bodies are balanced they will naturally shed their bile and remain
pure. Imbalanced beings will slowly accumulate bile in their blood, and must
beware of it, for raw bile is pure and potent poison, which can kill anything if
the dose is high enough.</font></p>
