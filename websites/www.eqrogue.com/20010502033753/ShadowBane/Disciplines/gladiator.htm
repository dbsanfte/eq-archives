<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">I don't know
why you've signed a portion of your lifetime away to me - perhaps you need the
money, or you were forced to by a magistrate, or perhaps you've simply got a
taste for killing - I don't know, and I don't care, either. Now that you're
mine, I intend to put you to as much use as possible. Murder is barely a crime
anymore, and now that our illustrious sport, once illegal throughout the Petty
Kingdoms, is here to stay. The crowd loves to watch: to see the red blood
fountain from a sliced jugular, or to hear the exquisite crunch as bones break,
or a limb comes loose. They'll pay for the chance to see men gasp their last
breaths, and I provide it to them. You, my friend, will do the fighting. And the
dying. Think of it - a crowd of hundreds, chanting your name, staring at your
every move, holding their breaths in anticipation of that fatal stroke.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are some drawbacks to the current state of
affairs. While I no longer need worry about my performers using themselves up
permanently, now I must compete with a new enemy: boredom. The crowds get jaded
quickly in this age of cheap and ready death. To keep them coming back for more,
we have to show them sights they can't see even in the thick of battle. The
bloodier, the fiercer, the more shocking, the better. Spectacle is the name of
the game now. Costumes, beasts, even strange, dire sports with arcane rules are
becoming the rage in every arena. We strive and strive, but still we must give
the crowd more. They want pathos, they want tragedy. They want to see the blood
of heroes. And you will supply it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have talent, you should do pretty well. By the time
your contract's up and you leave this place, you'll be a finer warrior than any
mercenary legion could produce. To survive in the arena, you'll need tricks no
fencing master teaches. Don't ever forget: this battlefield is a stage, and the
people, above all, want a performance. Learn to move like a tiger, and dance
like an Elf. Act for them, let them see your valor in every stride, or the pain
in every movement. Your acting can lull your foes as well, luring them into
overconfidence or frightening them away. You'll learn how to kill a man in one
strike, the points that can cripple or stun a man, and what places a blade can
draw the most blood while letting the victim linger on. The fight must last,
after all: the crowd must feel they've got their money's worth. You'll learn to
deal with pain, the tricks for how to ignore it and stay in the fight. If you do
well, they'll come back for you, day after day after day. If you're truly good,
I can make you a rich man. You'll lack for nothing: fine wine, the best food,
any kind of luxury can be yours. If not, well… you'll get chopped into
fishguts ten times a day, every day. And you'll keep coming back for more. Don't
worry, you'll find a place here. You no longer have any choice.</font></p>
