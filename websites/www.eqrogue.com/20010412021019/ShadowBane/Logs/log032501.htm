<p align="center">Here is the log of the meeting that took place 3/25/01.</p>
<p><br>
<font color="#808080">Kromel</font>: Hello and welcome everyone. I like to start
by saying thanks for showing up. During this process, if you have any questions,
please send me a private tell. I'm going to start this by allowing Veishkav to
begin. He has some ideas I would like everyone to hear. Veish, please start.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Veishkav</font>: Before I begin, I'd like to introduce
myself to you all. There are no formalities between us but I see some new faces
around here. Some who are interested and share the same goals and ideals of the
Order. I have joined the Order of the Black Rose (OBR) on the month of March
last year. Making this month my 1 year anniversary being part of the community.
Before my gaming in Everquest, I always dreamed of being part of a
rogue-society. A tower of brotherhood. A foundation, home for all thieves. Being
part of the Order has always inspired me to reach the top end. To gain
recognition and whatnot as I'm sure all you do. But in my gaming of Everquest,
something there lacked that I wanted in a game. And so unfortunately, I came to
quit (retire) out of the game. Having to leave the guild (in game) and take my
leave on November. I reached 44 in level (2 levels before to hit the planes) I
retired and never came back. However I could not leave the guild I was so fond
of somewhere I called home. It grew more than a gaming community for me. I've
gotten to know some people in the Order and saw that they were truly dedicated
members that gave me the inspiration to stay. Now from outer perspective, I
believe that what Everquest lacked for our type can be done in Shadowbane. I
have not given my hopes in the Order and plan to build our guild from heart to
stones, gold, what not. To see the guild from birth all the way till end if that
time would come. But before we march silently through that unknown path. I
believe we must have structure within the Order. I believe that we must work
inside-out. I believe that we can all come to this end. Now, there are some
great ideas and concepts some of you have and this is why you are all in this
meeting for. Let us discuss...</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>:<font color="#0000FF"> </font>Veishkav
is a touch long winded but a good speaker none the less =)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Vandolas</font>: How many people can be expected to be
the primary leaders of the guild, the inner group?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Veishkav</font>: The &quot;inner group&quot; I'll
define that as &quot;officers&quot; for this question. For now, we're not
entirely sure but its assured from Elidrin himself that some of
&quot;officers&quot; from our EQ side of the guild moving to SB will likely be
in the &quot;inner-group&quot; to help and shape the Order.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: My officers for the SB Order
will be chosen from a select few who have earned the unswerving respect of its
members. To name a few in no particular order: Takarae, Boshi, Sterk, and
Alistor for their efforts as previous and/or current guild masters of the Order,
these people understand the true politics and hassles of the guild and have my
respect as well as that of those whom they have led. In addition: Veishkav,
Memnoch, and Pinnter for their previous and continuous help with the
websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Takarae</font>: The future of the OBR is something that
will require MUCH discussion, but where does Veishkav place himself in the world
of Shadowbane? How does he fit in and what image does he hope to achieve?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Veishkav</font>: That will be entirely upon Elidrin
himself. How he decides where I may take in place for the Order. My hopes for
postion in the Order is high. I am fairly confident in aiding Elidrin and the
guild members. My hopes is to inspire others. To have good image as an
&quot;officer&quot; for others to achieve and help to aid and shape the Order.
Those are my hopes. Good question Takarae, and I'm willing to do whatever it
takes to build our home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Arctyc</font>: How do you think that the image of the
OBR as a 'school' will change in the new game, both to insiders and newcomers?<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">Veishkav</font>: From personal perspective, I believe that
we'll still carry the image of being a &quot;school&quot; for rogues. In no end,
we will give that image up... But it will work differently in SB yet the same.
In EQ, we were able to only &quot;train&quot; rogues because of the game
mechanics. But in Shadowbane, I believe we can carry more. It will require more
strategy than EQ. So I believe we'll still carry the image of being a rogue
&quot;school&quot; to train and teach other rogues in the Order. As a side
thought, imagine as you will, being in a building or &quot;dojo&quot; built by
us. Training, sharing tactics together. Perhaps having a tutor role-playing out
as a master to teach &quot;rogue students&quot; I think it'll be exciting to
actually have duel tournaments in our own doors, and who knows what other things
we can do. If everyone plans to have fun, we will have fun, one way or the
other. Good question Arctyc. I'm glad you brought that up.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: We will continue to be a
school for the young.. and so much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Obsidian</font>: What types of requirements will be
enforced to become a member of OBR in Shadowbane?<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">Veishkav</font>: First, I personally don't think
requirements will do. Reason here and I'm sure most of you may agree with me
here. With numbers and stat to outsiders to see, its a system for them all laid
out to beat. I'm more inclined towards watching a petitioner together.
Petitioner being the ('requester') interested in joining us. Making it hard but
easy with the right mindset and heart to join our ranks. Perhaps we should have
a voting process to tag the person interested. A group of us selected few could
be &quot;recruiters&quot; and both seek out potential members and vote together
at the same.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: To become a petitioner is
easy be a rogue primary of a class we accept. To become a member will require a
white ball/black ball vote of the officers. I understand the game will support
this naturally. I am leaning towards sponsorship of the petitioner from an
officer to become a member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Vandolas</font>: Will the officer have specific jobs to
do, like head of blackmail or head of gambling or head or a region and will they
have certain people report to them in that role?</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Shin-Kai</font>: What is to be OBRs functional layout
in SB. Centralized around one city and land or wide spread and in many cities?<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">Veishkav</font>: That's an interesting question. I believe
its open-field play for specific jobs you excel at. If you're good at something,
say making weapons, by all means go ahead and market them. Its open-play, if
you're good at it and you are recognized for it, I'm sure all those who want to
be of use of your skills will flock to you. I don't think we'll have something
in set like that because that'll be closing others to express their talents and
Now for head or region &quot;master thief&quot; ... I believe we have to in
order to have tight control.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>:&nbsp; I am torn between
department heads and area leaders each has its own inherent problems. This
requires further discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Obsidian</font>: To tie in a question with
Shin-Kai...Are we going to choose one server or many?? (If SB is using many
servers??? I am not sure on that issue, thus this Q)</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Veishkav</font>: OBR will not be centralized around one
city. We will try not to show on the map SB will update once in awhile.. we will
try to be the worst yet best hidden organization. We will take the role to be
wide-spread. We will be your neighbor &quot;band of thugs&quot; We will choose
one server to start out with I believe in order to grasp and form our guild
first. Better not to bite more than you can chew/eat. But that doesn't mean that
we will not go server-wide with out guild. Who knows, in time we will. Depends
on the size of us and control. Yes, we are aware of that servers will be
interlinked and &quot;different&quot; as in having different themes for each. I
believe Wolfpack said there will be 3 servers for start-up on their release of
game first... but I can be wrong. To choose a server we will all meet is not my
place to answer. In time however, you will all know this of course.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Arctyc Comment on servers</font>: They are all
interlinked, and potentially traversable, not to mention 'different'.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: In the beginning I would
like to start in the same place and then quickly branch out. I want to start
with our eggs in one basket for strength but quickly scatter before someone
finds the nest.</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<font color="#808080">Arctyc</font>: Hello everyone</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Kromel</font>: Hello Arctyc.&nbsp; Please give a brief
introduction and what your function of what you do for OBR.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Arctyc</font>: Well, my game name is Arctyc Foxfyre,
and I have self-appointed myself as a resident bard and 'board junkie'. Arctyc
I've been around OBR for a loong time, ever since a friend of mine introduced me
to the EQ PvP-teams server. While I haven't exactly done much there, EQ has
served as one of the greatest chat rooms I've ever seen. At this point in time,
I play probably once per month. =) Other than that, I rabidly follow developers
and their titles. (aspiring comp. programmer) and beta test. In my little quest
for knowledge and experience, I have run into many, many guilds, with different
populations, leaders, and other aspects. OBR, however, has been the only truly
unique group of players I have yet seen. Other comments fail me.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Obsidian</font>: My question is in relation to cities.
After a guild takes one...first how do they do that and second how does one take
over another guild to control it? If there is a war, then do all members have to
be present? or can you just ransack?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: We all wish we knew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Kromel</font>: Arctyc, do you have any clues on how
this is handled?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: But... it is known that destroying the
city is equivalent to destroying the tree, and vice versa. Also, you CAN take
over a city. It is also known that attacks to try and take over a city will be
something of a siege, taking quite easily over 24 hours to do. In my reasoning,
it may end up being a slow battle until one side breaks, or the aggressors
somehow take possession of the tree. This could be another important use for the
oft-discussed death timer. This, however, would mean that there would be
something in place to provide a 'default' ToL to respawn at in a GM-town if your
guilds' were taken over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Boshi</font>: On taking a city I would like to ask your
opinion on this tactic. Sneak all our OBR members into a city to attack from the
inside while an employer or ally is outside the city doing the siege.</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: Sounds like it is going to be a good
tactic, if difficult to pull off. Chokepoints, like gates and city walls are
probably going to be important for sieges, and being able to attack from two
sides is a definite advantage. I.e. those darn archers on the walls. If you can
reach them without first having to fight your way up the steps...</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Takarae</font>: I think our role is better suited to
only sneaking one or two members in to take out key individuals. Leaders
specifically.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: Infiltrate before the battle
starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Veishkav</font>: Arctyc, you know the role of a bard
within the Order and as an extraordinaire bard yourself, how confident are you
with your role? and what do you personally like to see *if there are any* within
the structure of OBR for bards? Hmm... may not be able to rely on the leader
being in the city, easy to get to. But if a commander is leading a wedge
formation, and you can take him out from the inside, it could be quite important,
yes.</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: Confident? If any part of bardism isn't
just playing a lute to make sparklies fly around you, then I will be ecstatic
and more than happy to act as one. OBR has already promised more to the position
than just music-playing, and even WP promises more to the class, insinuated in
their skill with ancient lore (phew!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Boshi</font>: Do all cities have sewers ?.<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: Interestingly enough, I never found an
answer to the sewer question. I think they will, but simply an opinion there.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Takarae</font>: WP has already stated that there will
be a certain ratio to sewers. For every amount of city, there is a certain
amount of sewer below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Vandolas</font>: Would we want to have members with the
&quot;command&quot; discipline to help form ranks and if so how many people
would we want to have this skill?&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: The Commander discipline seems to be
shaping up to be one of those powerful 'sleeper' skills. One where you may not
want everyone to have it, but if you do, it'll really help.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Veishkav</font>: We're not sure on disciplines yet for
one, WP hasn't released all information regarding discipline power but since
we're not taking the role to go &quot;head to head&quot; with enemies or
'contracted' guilds we'll likely take the &quot;sneaky&quot; role. But from
personal view, I think the discipline will come in handy in group adventures and
in emergency ambush attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Boshi</font>: Are the spell casting disciplines still
in the game for now casters, such as rune caster &amp; traveler?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: So far, not much has been said about the
magic system.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Veishkav</font>: From my knowledge and most of us here,
not a single discipline has been put out. Alone, we don't know the
&quot;hidden&quot; disciplines yet, I'm sure there will be many interesting
combinations one may take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Obsidian</font>: Are the Magic Users going to be as
powerful as they are in every game or is the rogue and fighting characters going
to get a chance in this one?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Arctyc</font>: I think that WP is trying to give rogues
and fighters a good chance through two tactics. One is diversity, as specified
by their discipline system. The other is by giving some of the skills melee
characters use a 'magical' quality. That whole 'rock-paper-scissors' thing might
deal with this as well. That magical quality being an inherent power hopefully
equivalent to spells.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Takarae</font>: They also mentioned a better accuracy
as afar as line of sight. A rock will stop a fireball, or a tree a lightning
bolt. None of this Nuke-the-guy-two-floors-down-and-around-the-corner crap like
in EQ.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Arctyc</font>: Oh yeah. AC's life-magic abuses, EQs
infamous pathing and MOB jumping... etc. etc. :\<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: Expect them to be deadly on
offense but with a weaker defense then we are used to in EQ.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Kromel</font>: Obsidian, you now have the floor,
Welcome.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Obsidian</font>: Hello to all members of OBR. We at OSR
are happy to be part of this United Guild action in Shadowbane. I did not expect
to be talking. So I am not sure what to say at this time. We at OSR are a group
of gamers that have been playing other games and have chosen to remain together
as you have in this new one. We are still trying to find our place in SB as you
are...Unfortunately Malus had other meeting to attend to and has sent me
here...(btw, he is a dead man) I guess if you have any questions for OSR I can
take them for the most part...otherwise, thank you for letting us be part of
this meeting.</p>
<p><br>
<font color="#FF0000">Boshi</font>: Am I correct in assuming both our guilds
plan to operate in a like manner , such as &quot;secretly?&nbsp;or does OSR have
other plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Obsidian</font>: Yes, we are going to be a secret guild,
especially in the first few months. After that it is anyone's guess until we
know what the game is going to offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Vandolas</font>: I recall reading that OSR's members
will all the the disciple of wererat, is this a requirement of your guild?&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Obsidian</font>: It will be a requirement for our guild
that they be a wererat for the purpose of more deadly attacks. We hope to have
many contracts out there but we will do what the game allows us rogues to do. If
we have to...fight in a more fighter method like EQ.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts:</font> By limiting yourself to not
only rogue but wererat you restrict your guild to not only class but race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Veishkav</font>: With the recent alliance of OSR+OBR, I
am sure as most of us are here are interested in your motives on the recent
move. Therefore, what can we expect from you and in turn, what do you expect out
of us?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: Motives, everyone needs a good ally, I
scouted OBR for a while in EQ. I see that we will work will together. As for
what you will get and what we are looking for. We are looking for support when
we need it, in game knowledge sharing, and anything else that the game may hold
in store and we will offer ourselves in the same way. I cant honestly answer anything
more than that now because the game isn't out yet and I don't know what it
holds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Shin-Kai</font>: How are contracts be handled between
guilds or are they?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: I wish for that to be something we can
work together on</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Kromel</font>:&nbsp; I don't think Elidrin or Malus
have discussed this yet.</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: I like the idea of helping with
certain jobs, we have not. That's something else we will know more of once we actually
do a contract in game.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: Never complicate a simple
issue. Whoever gets the contract pays whoever helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Vandolas</font>: If group of OBR and a group of OSR are
working together on a mission who is to lead the groups? or does it matter?</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Kromel</font>: I think which-ever Guild landed the
contract or founded the mission.</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: That makes sense. I think that would
work, open for discussion as well later</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: Understand that OSR is swearing
featly to us, read the codes of conduct on who leads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Takarae</font>: Being a single-class guild may have
limitations when it comes to defending a city/town/fort/whatever. Does OSR have
any plans on how they might defend or help defend a city from hostiles?&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: Well I am coming public with this
info now, so why not now we at OSR are going to be wererats, and also I plan on making
alliances with a merc. unit or two they as I see it will be valuable we as
rogues will need a small army available to our uses but may be able to hold our
own...we will see how they rate us :) obsidian has something to add...</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Obsidian</font>: Well, the wererat we hope will add to
the strength in our fighting for the walls or defending them...as asked earlier,
that is why we hope to have that as a requirement.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Veishkav</font>: What are your long-term goals in this
alliance and do you think if ever, you will split from us? Is that a possible
vision for your guild?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: To be honest. I do not see us
splitting ever...I am a loyal man, if I am to ever leave it is because we have
been betrayed. I don't see that happening so expect us hairy stinky rats around
for a while. I didn't answer his first, long term goals. All I am looking for is
our own little town to control and call home:) we are in this for gaming as
friends and need a place to come back to after work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Vandolas</font>: Does OSR plan on controlling their own
city or joining OBR in one city?&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: We plan on controlling our own city,
yes, I wish to have neighboring towns to help keep control of lands, small
network and with other alliances. perhaps a long chain :)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: Have fun! Personally I have
no desire to be a lord of a manor, complicates issues greatly.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Veishkav</font>: Does OSR plan on having its own policy on
alliance with others or team policy (single policy) for all alliance under OBR?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: What I want is an Order of the Rose
if we get other alliances. I want our to be the main glue. I want to stay tight.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: We will see what the future
holds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Veishkav</font>: Perhaps, its an early question but if
you have any comments or concerns on that, I'd like to hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: I want to share policies. I believe I
can work with OBR's leadership:) Not any doubt, so I don't see anything being an
issue that cant be taken care of.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Boshi</font>: Is it correct to assume you look at our alliance
as equals &amp; all other guilds under OBR &amp; OSR as lesser ?</p>
<p><font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: Yes, true, I was even to go as far as
this, create a history, just a story:) We are the fallen, the wererats that couldn't
be lived with anymore:) old buddies... :)</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Elidrin's Thoughts</font>: *confused look*</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000">Arctyc</font>: Truly flattery by imitation? Had you a
specific name before the alliance, or was it such a coincidence? =)<br>
<br>
<font color="#008000">Malus-OSR</font>: It was a combination, I had a thieves
guild in my D&amp;D days, similar in name that I used a lot of. and when I seen
this game and researched OBR, I seen the game fitting to where if I was to swear
fealty to OBR, the OSR name would fall into place and make a lot of sense so it
became order of the scarlet rose a faction of the OBR<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#808080">*Meeting Officially Ends*</font></p>
<p><font color="#808080">Malus-OSR</font>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to take this easy, and just play the game and learn
as much as we can, before doing anything important. But I do want a town ASAP. I
don't want to step on the toes of the future king of an empire:)</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Takarae</font>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think alot of OBRs are planning to make junk
characters to learn with before making the real deal to settle down and play</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Boshi</font>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be in all of our best interests to get you a town ASAP.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Vandolas</font>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was thinking that I might play an alt spell caster, I
thought it might be a good idea to have this character join an opposing guild to
try to glean info from them, what are your thoughts<br>
<br>
<font color="#808080">Malus-OSR</font>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vandolas that's a good idea<br>
<br>
<font color="#808080">Veishkav</font>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vandolas, personally I'm against that idea because well..
its against my gaming ethics... heheh, all spying will be in-character for me.
No out character knowledge. To wrap this up on Vandolas, personal decisions like
that wont be forced by the Order. Your game-play style wont be enforced<br>
<br>
<font color="#808080">Obsidian</font>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very good idea. I was hoping to do the same but different
class<br>
