<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">How tiresome
the ways of humans are. We have seen their &quot;Jen'e'tai,&quot; their
so-called blade masters, and we know their teachings all too well. As with
everything the Sons of Men have wrought, it is but a pale shadow of the wonders
our immortal fathers made of old. These &quot;Blade Masters&quot; whose lives
play out in the span of a daydream for our kind - do they really believe they
know more than the mighty Elf Lords who have been practicing with their swords
since before the first Man was even wrought?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are wise to look to the stars for wisdom, these
&quot;masters,&quot; but they forget too quickly that there were other masters
of the World before them. They claim that Draethen the Trueson cut the stars in
the dome of heaven with his blade, drawing the constellations that are, in the
end, only a stilted mockery of our dance. An interesting fable, but patently
untrue. We remember the stars that glimmered long before that, in the Endless
Twilight that existed long before Time. These are our stars, and yet the
meddling Humans would steal them from us, too, as if all of our arts and wonders
and lands were not enough. We remember the early stars well, and how they lit
our world of night and beauty. We remember how we wept to see them vanish at the
dawning. The Dragon stole them from us, that terror whose rising we alone
remember. The greatest Blade Weavers danced a mighty dance of death with that
horrible beast, and all of them perished in flames save one: Talamar Solanthanor,
the greatest sword master who will ever live. He turned from the deadly battle
at Hennan Gallorach, for he knew that no victory was possible against the
Dragon, and that his wisdom and mastery of his Art must not die. Though no Human
will ever know his name, we will ever praise his name.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And well do we remember Draethen Truesword also. Those who
call themselves the Jen'e'tai proudly recite his parentage, claiming him as the
last son of the All-Father. Indeed, he was. But who then was his mother? No
human tale will tell you, but we remember the truth. Long did the wounded
All-Father linger at the Opal Court after he drove the Dragon away, to be nursed
back to health by the fairest of our Fair Folk. Draethen was born of none other
than Silesteree Allvolanar, princess of the Deathless Realm, daughter to the
First Queen who ruled beneath the eternal stars. Strange that so many human
artists forget that Draethen's ears were pointed. Long did Draethen Trueson stay
at the Elvencourt (aye, long his wicked father left the hospitality of the
Elves) and long did he study with Talamar Solanthanor, whose blade was called
Clalidhedril, the fire serpent. We've heard the tales the Blade Masters tell,
their parables of pigs and tusks. Most amusing, but we remember the truth. Would
you hear it?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know then, that there once was a Human slave, one of the
first of his kind given the honor of serving us, who hid in the shadows and
spied upon the Yard of the Dance. He watched Draethen and Talamar sparring
together, and did steal a longblade from his masters. This craven wretch, first
of the Jen'e'tai, would creep into the cellars and practice when there were none
to witness him. The thief was discovered, of course, and punished with the loss
of his left hand. He would have died, but Draethen took pity and the wretch,
gave the thing his own sword, and spirited him away, allowing the thief to
escape the Queen's justice. And so we turned this &quot;True Son&quot; out, and
have never trusted any half-breed since. This is why the so-called Blade Masters
revere Draethen, and why they fight with only one blade while every true Blade
Weaver uses two. This is why their so-called &quot;Art&quot; will never be
anything but a parody of our Dance. Here is the truth behind the Human's feeble
myths. Never forget it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have learned the secrets of the Dance and joined the
ranks of the Blade Weavers, you will be able to show the Humans just how wrong
they are.</font>
