<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">Alright,
here's the plan. You four, gather all the wood you can. We're going to kindle a
bonfire here, atop the hill. You - set yourself to making torches. We'll need at
least four for each of us. Fire is our friend tonight - it's one of the few
things that's guaranteed to hurt our deceased friends, and it will keep back the
darkness. Don't expect the Vampyre to show himself until late. He's more like to
send his horde against us first, just the thing to wear us out. They'll be
walking dead mostly, with skeletons thrown in for spice. Not too rough, but
always be careful: you'll get winded. They won't.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You, young one. It's your job to keep the bonfire burning, no
matter what happens. Now you there, take this axe. It'll be your job, once a
dead man's down, to take his head off, quick as you can. It's a good sharp axe,
it should do well. Just tell yourself you're chopping firewood. And you, you
look quick. Here… take this. Keep a torch in each hand. Once the fight begins,
you're to follow Woodcutter here. Once he has his Zombie chopped, you set your
torch to it. If the two of you do your job well, we'll only have to fight each
Zombie once. The rest of you, you'll be doing the nasty work with me. Pair up,
always fight shoulder to shoulder with another man, and never turn your back
from the bonfire. Now, every man should have a blade. Use that on the fleshy
ones. Aim for the legs or the neck, try to knock them down, immobilize them. For
the skeletons, keep a mace at your belt, or within reach.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they start coming, you'll have to be ready for them.
Fear is their greatest weapon. There's no shame if you vomit when the stench
hits you, and their rotten faces can be hard to get used to. Keep your wits
about you and the fire to your back, and you'll survive. They'll fall pretty
quickly, once you learn how to anticipate them. Be careful - once you hack
through a dozen Zombies, it's easy to just run from one to the next. They'll
lure you out that way, don't fall for it! If you leave the circle of firelight,
you're doomed. If a man should fall, leave him there. Don't turn your back to
the dark to drag him away, and above all be ready for him to get up. When he
does, he's just another Zombie. Take him quick, or he'll take you. Should you
meet a Wraith, or something without a body, call me. My truncheon's made of
wierwood, touched by a saint. I also know a few invocations they don't teach at
seminary. The same goes for our Vampyre. Once Mister Dead joins us, leave him to
me. I know a few tricks that do for their kind every time. Now, if there are two
Vampyres, then we might be in trouble.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing to do now but wait. I remember the days just after
the Turning, when nobody knew the working of the Trees, and every man slain rose
as foul undead. There were legions of them back then, stumbling through the
night, eating everyone they could find. That's when my kind found our calling.
We learned how to kill the dead, and started taking back the night. Once folk
turned to the Trees and escaped death, we thought our fight was over. We were
wrong. Throughout all the Ten Kingdoms, whole churchyards are rising by
moonlight. Some say that there's a Darkness beyond the Void that the souls of
the dead fly to, and that it devours them. Others think it's a mind, pure, clod
and evil, that thirsts for the vigor of life. Some even think that the Dark is
alive, like a Beast, and that since the Turning its hunger for fresh souls has
been denied. We've come to know the Shadow, and we've seen that it's reaching
into our World, touching the dead, filling them with hate and will and unnatural
life. Where it comes form I don't know, but there's more undead in the World now
than ever before. Darkness is coming. We've tried to tell the Bishops, but
they're too busy proving that the World hasn't ended. Who knows - maybe it has.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that's none of our concern now. Dusk has fallen. They'll
be coming soon. Light your torches, keep them burning, and stay sharp, all of
you. If you do what I tell you, you might just see the daylight.</font>
