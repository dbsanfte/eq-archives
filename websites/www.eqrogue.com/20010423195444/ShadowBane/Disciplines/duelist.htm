<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">I've seen
battles and wars with shining knights and fearsome berserks hacking away in
clumsy fury. I've seen the massive cleavers of the Dwarves, and fought my share
of brigands and mercenaries. I've even seen one of those sword priests, the jen
'ed die or somesuch. I've taken on Warriors of all kinds, and some of them were
good… but I've yet to see anyone who could match a master Duelist in his
prime. I've fought some two hundred duels, many to the death, and I swear by my
Spirit and my word, I've never lost. There are only three scars on my body, all
dealt by the same blade. The other one hundred ninety-nine never managed to
touch me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Free Cities of Tariponto duels have been fought for
centuries. The High Families used to paint the city squares red in their
vendettas, until they finally got the idea of settling disputes by proxy. So the
Duelists were born, master swordsmen contracted to bring justice on the point of
a rapier. Back in those days, every aspect of the fight was measured and pursued
according to precise custom and rules of etiquette. It was not uncommon for the
highest families to retain a master Duelist as a House Champion. They lived like
princes, and their blades were cherished heirlooms, passed down through the
generations. My father was such a man, though the house he served exists no
longer. See this blade? It has a name, as all great blades do. It's called the
Shining Rose, for crimson flowers sprout in its wake. Stand against me and you
will surely feel her thorns. Look well, for you shall never see its equal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In better days just about anyone, from noble-born to
tradesmen to wealthy farmers, would settle their disputes in the square, by
hiring a pair of duelists. You could tell everything about a feud by merely
looking at them: tokens revealed each man's patron, the man in the red tunic
stood for the accuser, and the color of his sash told the nature of the
argument. The length of the blade in his left hand gave the terms, from first
blood to first yield to death. Of course, they rarely fought to the death back
then. Now it doesn't matter as much. And the rest of it doesn't matter anymore
either. It's been a long time since I've met a duelist who still knows all the
old signs and protocols, though their mastery of the forms is still adequate.
Don't worry: I'll teach you everything. As my dear father often said, better
known and not needed than needed and unknown.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what have you seen of swordplay? I'm more than a match
for your average Knight, grown fat and weak since he was landed, counting on his
priceless armor to save his hide. To encase one's self in a steel shell, like a
turtle or a crab, how bold is that? Where's the skill in it? This is pride? This
is honor? Try walking onto the square with only your wits and your agility
between you and the other man's blade. That's courage. That's skill.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more than a dozen styles still taught in the Free
Cities, and I know them all: the Harrantine March of Two Foils, the Blade
Brawling they teach in Rovayle, even that Shadow Dagger style that was so
fashionable ten years ago. I know forms that can find the gaps and chinks in any
armor, and leave a Knight bleeding from his liver before he even knows that
you've struck. Dueling takes skill, training, and practice, but I can teach you
to fence like Death himself.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now draw that toothpick of yours, and let's see what you're made of.</font></p>
