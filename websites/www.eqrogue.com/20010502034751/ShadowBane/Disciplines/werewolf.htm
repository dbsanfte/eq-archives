Rank 1</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can
run. Any fool can. To run with us, you will need to learn much more. In the days
to come, go off into the wilds, alone. Watch and listen. Wait. As you see the
grass and trees and listen to the wind, find the coal of rage that burns deep
inside you. It matters not how you came by it - harsh parents, cruel
circumstance, or even mere chance. That rage is both the door and the key. As
you focus on the rage, you will learn the Becoming, the art of acting without
thought, killing without qualm, hunting without equal. When you finally learn to
see things without thinking of the clumsy words for them, you will enter the Now
of wolf-thought, and you will change. The Wolf that sleeps inside your heart
will claim you, and you will run free.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Becoming is easier at night, when the world is alive with
prey. Many beginners find that the moon helps them in their concentration, that
its silver face can act as a gateway to the Now. Use it if you will, but do not
become dependent upon it. A true man-wolf does not need the moon to change.
Peasants and farmers' wives think we can only change by the light of the full
moon, but they are wrong. If they knew the truth, they'd likely go mad with
terror.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go now, and learn the ways of the Becoming. Once you think
you have mastered the wolf shape, find me again and you'll learn how much you
have yet to know. Revel in the wolf shape, but be careful: it is far too easy to
lose oneself in the Now, and never return to two feet. It has happened to many.
Those Who Run Forever have wasted our gift. Always remember the path that leads
back from Beast to Man. Just as we are more than men, we must be more than
wolves also. Soon you will know why.</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 2</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've
learned to howl, to hunt, and to run on four legs in a wolf's shape. Now the
time as come for you to learn the story of the first werewolf, Sesheth the
Hunter. A Champion of Kenaryn, Lord of the Hunt, Sesheth was a mighty man,
strong and fierce.&nbsp; Many claim that the blood of a giant courses through
the veins of his ancestors.&nbsp; In those early days Sesheth was the protector
of his people, and roamed far and wide throughout the wilds hunting to feed his
tribe and driving away foul monsters and creatures of chaos. Though the love of
battle was strong in his heart, Sesheth ever favored the chase, and loved the
hunt above all things. He spent years watching the beasts of the wild, learning
to hunt and stalk as they do.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sesheth spent an age looking for the greatest hunting beast
in the world, and finally found them: the wolves, grim marauders of winter. For
years Sesheth lurked at the edge of a mighty wolf pack, ran with them, and
hunted with them. As he ran, he forgot his homeland, forgot his people, and even
forgot his name. Finally, he realized he had forgot the speech of men
altogether, and had become a wolf himself. In the fullness of time, Sesheth
Wolf-walker won many challenges and finally became leader of his pack. By then,
the pack had roamed to distant lands, where the stars themselves were strange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Who is this, who walks before me on legs that are not
his own?&quot; said a voice, and Sesheth turned and saw the Wolf, the great
Beast Lord who is bigger than a bear and more cunning than any man. &quot;I
smell your fear, and your true nature, man-child,&quot; said Wolf. &quot;Why
have you stolen this shape, and why do you run with my children instead of
yours?&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sesheth was instantly returned to his man shape, and bowed
before the great Wolf. &quot;Oh mighty beast lord,&quot; he said, &quot;I sought
only to become the greatest hunter in all the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You shall never be greater than I.&quot; Said the Wolf. &quot;Run with me,
if you dare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sesheth ran at Wolf's side for a long time, and the Wolf
showed him the workings of the world, and the beauty of its balance. And then
they returned to the lands of Sesheth's birth, and saw the forests ravaged, the
lakes fouled, and the animals all slaughtered to feed the hunger of greedy Man.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;This is your world,&quot; Wolf said grimly. &quot;Do
you see how vain the All-Father's ambition is?&quot; Sesheth saw. &quot;As I
balance the herds of all the animals, from mighty moose to tiny mouse, here are
your prey. If you would be the greatest hunter of all, stalk the greatest prey.
Become a hunter of men.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will.&quot; Said Sesheth, little knowing that the choice would drive him
mad.</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 3</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have at
last mastered the Becoming - know that there is another shape that you can chose
to wear. Just as you are both Wolf and Man, yet wholly neither, the dreaded
Vargr shape is a hybrid of your shapes. The Vargr walks on two legs and has
hands at the ends of its strong arms, yet keeps the pelt, claws, and fangs of a
wolf. This shape is our greatest weapon, inspiring terror in the hearts of all
the weaklings who have so ravaged the world.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Now of wolf-thought is the key to taking wolf shape, but
to find the Vargr locked within you turn to your hatred. The fury that burns in
the center of your soul is the force that will twist your body, working it into
the greatest of all shapes. Like a thing of chaos will you become, a monster
undreamed of. How better to fight the tide of chaos tooth and claw, to win
vengeance for the sundering of the world?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Vargr shape can come madness - beware. When first
you take this form, your mind will be filled with screams of agony, so loud and
horrible that they drive out all thought but killing. Know that these are the
cries of wounded Braialla, the very Earth herself, still screaming from the
grievous wounds of the Sundering that shattered the world. Hear them, and
remember them, but try to drown them out. A Vargr who is lost to his rage
becomes a true monster, and loses all of his cunning. The Templars and Knights
of the Sash are ever watchful for such creatures, and cunning enough to destroy
them with silver and fire.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 4</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By now, you
have probably heard that there are others besides us who can don an animal's
shape. They roam the night as we do, with their petty crusades and hunts, but
only we truly hear the call of the Beast within. If you ever meet other skin
changers shun them, or destroy them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First there are the ratmen, degenerates who can take the form
of vermin. They are thieves, liars, and connivers who lurk in sewers and eat
carrion, while greedily sucking the blood from the cities that they so love.
These have heard the call of the Beast, and betrayed it. Cities are an
abomination in the eyes of nature, and these skin changers make them worse. They
are meat to be wasted, not even worth eating.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The others, the great ursines, think themselves our betters,
but they delude themselves. They take shapes of bears and think they are masters
of the order, believing that they must preserve the balance between man and
nature, worked and wild. They fail to realize that the balance is already
destroyed. The All-Father's cursed ambition and the rebellion of his children
led to the death of the World Tree, and the Sundering. The broken world is
dying, and while the world dies around them the fool bears try to find some
harmony between field and forest and fight the twisted minions of chaos. They
forget that Man is the true culprit, and that Braialla cries out for vengeance.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 5</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you have
won challenges, and have led packs on many hunts. You rightfully take the first
share of a kill taken in the hunt, and your word is law. As an elder of our
kind, it is time you learned our darkest secret, and our eternal shame. Learn,
then, of our role in things, and of how we could have prevented the breaking of
the World.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was there. We all were, hunting in the woods on that
fateful night. The sky was clear, our every movement left holes in the fresh
snow, like needles puncturing a coat of white cotton. The moon was pure silver,
and set the hills on fire with icy blue light. It was the final night of the War
of Tears. Cambruin the High King, avenging angel of the All-Father himself, had
finally laid waste to Kierhaven, the last Elven city. The great Empire was no
longer, her towers toppled, her spirit burned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw them through the trees. The High King and two of his
companions, heroes of his band that men call 'the Champions.' They came into our
woods, giving chase to the last of the Empire's fleeing soldiers. We watches as
the three fought twenty. We watches as the veteran, the Old One fell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the last of the Elves fell before him, the other
companion, the Betrayer lifted the Sword. We saw the dull red glow in his eyes,
a twin to the gleam of that dark blade. We watched as the Betrayer drove it
through his liege lord's heart, pinning him to the Great Tree and dooming our
World. We watched him scurry off into the shadows, as the blood of an angel
soaked into the Earth, and our world was forever broken.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched, and listened as Braialla the green mother wailed
in pain. We who are her chosen protectors watched, but we did nothing. Nothing!<br>
<br>
We watched, but did not Act.<br>
<br>
This is our shame, and the source of all our Rage.</p>
