<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">Manhunters
are becoming common sights these days, moving slowly from tavern to tavern, town
to town, either on a hunt or looking for work. You can often tell a Bounty
Hunter by the manacles he carries at his belt; however he may intend to bind his
target, manacles are as much a symbol of a Bounty Hunter's trade as a tool of
it. If a merchant, lord, peasant or even a whole village knows the name of a
villain they want to see face justice, they talk to us. We're the finest hunters
and trackers in the world, save maybe for the Horwathi plainsmen. We find our
quarry and bring him back. Whatever it takes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We're not judges, and we're certainly not assassins. A
hunter's business is his quarry and their delivery, that's all. If the village
who hired me wants to hang the bandit I bring them, or forgive him, or burn him
at the stake after he's skinned alive - that's their business, not mine. If you
want somebody killed, go hire an Assassin. If you want somebody killed with a
lot of panache you can't afford, hire a Black Mask. If you want to kill them
yourself, hire a Manhunter. Most folk don't trust us, and there are some who've
spit in my face and called me a dog. Well, dogs are bred to hunt. You can be
sure them as won't look at me on the street will come find me as soon as their
world turns cruel.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of our work boils down to vengeance, one way or the
other. The real trick is to keep it from getting personal. It's not easy work,
but I've been at it a while. I can read a trail that's a week cold. There are
men in every tavern between here and Irydni who watch comings and goings for me,
and who are quick to remember names and faces. Between them and my fellow
Hunters, there's few places left anyone can run where I can't find them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which brings me to you. You're Harris Trevayne, right? It
doesn't matter how I know. You've a brother named Dalton. It seems he's had
himself some fun over in Berrenger. Killed nearly a dozen, and stolen some
things too. A lot of grief to pin on one name. The Lord Confessor and three
Guilds besides have contracts out on him. But I see you know that already. Wait,
let me guess: you don't know where he is. Maybe that's true. Maybe it's not. In
the end, it won't make any difference. There are eight of us hunting him, some
of us masters. We just wanted you to know that. You want to fight me now? Bad
idea. You tell your brother that we're on the Hunt. Like any dog, we just won't
stop either. Why don't you go warn him, and save us all some time? As you will.
We'll still get him. And once the Temple of the Flame has him, well… probably
best not to think to much on that. Tell me where he is now, and I can make sure
that one of the Guilds gets him instead. That way you might get to see him
again. No? Very well. We can wait, you know. Some say all Time has ended, so
what difference is it to us?</font></p>
