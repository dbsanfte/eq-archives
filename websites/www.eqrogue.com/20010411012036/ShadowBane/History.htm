<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day the blackened sun rises, an inescapable legacy of the
Treacherous Stroke and the Turning that followed after. In the daytime sky, history has
been made real - its impact is inescapable. Alas, the Turning is one of the few events in
history that is recorded with any accuracy. The War of Tears and the War of the Scourge
before it have killed far too many lore masters and destroyed too many records. Only the
haziest outline of the Ages before this survives, preserved in a few meager fragments of
history jealously guarded by prelates, scholars, and magi. Those who would seek to
understand our World and the strife that has shattered it must cultivate an understanding
of the past, but this is no easy task. An understanding of the past could hold the key to
ending the conflicts and troubles that plague the present. Unfortunately, too many
historical researchers seek power instead of wisdom or understanding, scouring ancient
records for the locations of lost treasures or the secrets of forgotten magic.&nbsp;<br>

Scholars have traditionally divided the span of history into five Great Ages:</span></font>

Nothing of substance is known of the times before the Age of Twilight, although ancient
myths and the patient deductions of lore masters and magi have given some hint of what
might have occurred in the Age Before. Seekers of wisdom or power should beware - few of
the sources that survive agree on all of the details of the events they describe, and many
stand in direct contradiction of each other. Also, any record of events rarely conveys the
meaning of those events, or can accurately describe their causes.</span></font></p>

&quot;In the Before Time, before the sun was made, the World was upside down, with sky
below and ground above. The People lived as animals, naked, without speech, and ate raw
flesh or the grasses of the Plains. The animals back then were the masters, and built
Yurts, made tools, and had speech. They hunted Men for food, or for sport, and kept people
for pets or in pens. But First Man knew better. From the great Lioness he learned the
secret of Fire, and he rose up in battle against Snake, Boar, Wolf, and Bear, the Kings of
the Animals. So great was their battle that the Earth fell, and the ground was laid down
under the sky, as it is now. So the world was made.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><span class="content"><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;His true name none shall ever know.<br>
Wand'rer call Him, whose path did go&nbsp;<br>
from highest plane where He was born<br>
to our World, broken and forlorn.<br>
A Godling true, strong was His arm<br>
and keen his gaze. Such radiant charm<br>
infus'd His voice that none would dare<br>
deny His wish. Black was his hair.<br>
Why left He heaven? None may know<br>
who are born of this World, far below<br>
that primal sphere where He was rais'd.<br>
But leave He did, whose name is praised.<br>
Others followed, companions true.<br>
Kenaryn, armed with bow of yew<br>
and blacksmith Thurin with his axe.<br>
These three, and others, turned their backs<br>
on Paradise and left, descending<br>
to spaces bounded yet unending.<br>
<br>
There long the Wand'rer and his train<br>
walked o'er a formless, empty plain<br>
where Law and Chaos, Dark and Light<br>
frothed together under endless Night.<br>
One feature broke the endless plain,<br>
an Orb of ebon, smooth and plain.<br>
The Wand'rer moved to look within<br>
but of a sudden the harsh din<br>
of Demon voices shook the air,<br>
and Prince Kolaur was standing there.<br>
&quot;Who comes unbidden to my realm?&quot;<br>
the demon hissed, and donned his helm<br>
of hardest adamant. &quot;I meant<br>
no trespass,&quot; Wand'rer spake. &quot;Sent<br>
from Paradise by mine own whim.&quot;<br>
And all the Demons laughed at him.<br>
&quot;Go back, Godling, from whence thou came!&quot;<br>
Kolaur did cry, his eyes like flame.<br>
&quot;Your haughty eyes shall never spy<br>
what wonders in that orb do lie.<br>
And take these other wastrels back<br>
When you depart, and look not back.&quot;<br>
<br>
For Wand'rer's honor, thus denied,<br>
a battle shook the Void outside<br>
the Universe that mortals know<br>
whence Chaos would deal such a blow.<br>
The demon legions were as sand,<br>
and in each clawed and twisted hand<br>
there gleamed a long and wicked blade,<br>
but the Wanderer&nbsp; was unafraid.<br>
As ocean waves against a line<br>
of pillars hewn of marble fine<br>
the Chaos horde did strike, and melt<br>
away when Wand'rer's wrath they felt.<br>
And each companion fought as well<br>
And gaily sang as their foes fell.&nbsp;<br>
Kolaur's fell spear possessed such might<br>
that its point could e'en a Godling bite.<br>
He found the Wand'rer, high in the flood<br>
of battle, struck, and drew His blood.&nbsp;<br>
The Shaper stayed at Wand'rer's side<br>
when Callynthir pierced Wand'rer's hide.&nbsp;<br>
Thurin's stroke left the Demon dead,<br>
and all its twisted legions fled.<br>
Kernaryn's arrows, thick as flies,<br>
Found their black hearts and pierced their eyes.<br>
<br>
So Wand'rer did the battle win,<br>
and, drawing nigh the orb, look'd in.<br>
<br>
Three Orbs of stone and ice were there,<br>
like Pearls cast into darkest mere.<br>
&quot;What is this place?&quot; said He, &quot;This prize<br>
all Chaos hid from Godling's eyes?&quot;<br>
Of His companions, none could tell<br>
their names, or what beasts might yet dwell<br>
in riven deep or icy height<br>
of these worlds, seal'd in orb of Night.<br>
One world shone brightly, as a jewel,<br>
to this one Wand'rer came to rule.&quot;</font></span></p>

<p>&quot;&#133; therefore stands to reason that there must have been some chain of events
that happened before the All-Father engendered Braialla, the Green Mother, and thereby set
into motion the rebirth of the World. What these events might have been, however, is
unknown. Before Braialla awoke there can be no history of the World, for there was no
World, at least not in any way that we can perceive of it. We can presume that the
All-Father must have journeyed to the place of Braialla's birth, but from where?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The philosophers of Hrillanderon<sup>1</sup> speak of things in terms of causes: the
immediate cause of an event, its root cause, and a primal cause. Braialla's birth is the
immediate cause of the World's existence, and the intervention of the All-Father is,
thereby, the root cause. But what caused the All-Father to be there, or to desire to
infuse his spirit into Braialla, or to even be at all? As there are no means of testing or
proving any assertion about the events of the times before the Age of Twilight, any answer
to these questions is as true or likely as any other. The World was created: this is the
only truth that can be accepted with certainty. The events of any earlier age are, alas,
not only unknown but unknowable, for what is not known may be divined or deduced, but even
the most potent magics fail to pierce the Veil of Origins and look back to a time before
the beginning of the world. While there have been accounts of the origins of the
All-Father, all of these are the products of superstition and mythology, and should as
such never be&#133;&quot;</font> </p>

  <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><sup>1</sup> - Alas, this is the only reference to Hrillanderon

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ancient Arts of Wizardry and
Channeling, called by some the &quot;True&quot; or &quot;Eternal Arts&quot; were first
developed and practiced by the Elves in the Age of Twilight before the count of time
began. Indeed, ancient records reveal that the Elves of the Twilight Kingdom had reached
the pinnacle of perfection in those lost times, and that what we know today as Magic is
but a humble shadow of the power known of old. Sadly, too many secrets of the Elder Days
have been lost forever, obliterated when the rise of the Dragon swept away the ancient,
pristine order of the World.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Early in the Age of Twilight, the Elvish Magi discovered that every kind of animal and
beast has a True Name, and that these names hold great power. They began to divine the
Names of everything in the World. So was born the Art of Summoning, a powerful branch of
magic that let a Magus call creatures to him and do his bidding. Over time, the ancient
Summoners learned to call greater and greater beasts, and even learned to reach out into
the Void to call its denizens: the mighty Jinn, the twisted Imps of Chaos, and even the
great Archons themselves. Learning the True Name of an animal or beast requires exacting
study, precise divinations, and more than a little intuition. The True Names of most
things in the World were recorded in great lists by the Elvish Magi of old, but
unfortunately many of those records have since been lost or destroyed.&nbsp;<br>
</font></p>

<p align="center"><span class="content"><b><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica"
color="#FFFFFF">The Age of Days</font></b></span> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Age of Days witnessed a new ordering of the World, and the rise of the Sons of Men. As
the World changed, so did Magic change with it, and seekers of arcane power soon developed
New Arts, called by some the &quot;Lesser Arts&quot; or the &quot;Arts of Man,&quot; for
human Magi stood at the forefront of their development. Of all the New Arts, Sorcery was
the first to be discovered, and has had the greatest effect on the studies of the
Wise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in the second century of the Age of Days the Elves of the
Deathless Empire first discovered the scattered Runestones, the lost fragments of the
Giant-Carved saga that foretold the destiny of the World. After much experiment, the
Elvish masters learned to tap into their power. Some Magi, not content with harnessing the
Stones' power, tried to fashion new Runestones of their own. Their efforts all failed, and
most ended in disaster. Finally, the High Concordat of Magi ended their experiments, and
further study or research in the topic was forbidden. So it would remain for centuries,
until the rise of Men.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almeus the Young, tutor of Zaristan and one of the greatest Wizards
Humankind has ever known, discovered the principles of Sorcery after he seized the throne
of Paolus, First King of Brethild. From arcane grimoires of the Deathless Empire the
Wizard learned of the Elvish efforts to create Runestones, and took up the cause himself.
Even Almeus could not succeed in fashioning new Runestones (for truly, they are the work
of the All-Father, and beyond the power of lesser beings), but his attempts prompted other
discoveries which revolutionized Magic throughout the World. While trying to find the
ideal medium from which to fashion Runestones, Almeus determined that certain objects and
materials hold an inherent &quot;resonance potential,&quot; a sensitivity to specific
magical auras and energies. In time, he found that objects placed at the intersections of
ley lines slowly accumulate magical force, called Mana by initiates. Almeus devised ways
to tap into the stored Mana within these objects, as well as other ways to trap mana
within the substance of particular grades of stone or metal. Thus were born the Rings,
Talismans, and Powerstones so prized by Wizards and Channelers alike.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two centuries later Almeus devised the first Sigils, arcane marks based
both upon the Runes and the arcane geometry of the Tapestry of Creation. When properly
enchanted, a sigil acts as a trap for magical energy, a net that can bind a spell and hold
it indefinitely.&nbsp;<br>

<p align="center"><span class="content"><b><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica"
color="#FFFFFF">The Age of Kings</font></b></span> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the dawning of the Age of Kings, that the treachery and wickedness of the Fey (Elves)
led them to break the All-Father's Last Commandment, and the Elves waged the War of Tears
upon the Sons of Men. The New Kingdoms of men were divided, as prone to fight each other
as the Elvish host. One by one, the New Kingdoms began to fall before the Elvish
onslaught, the savagery of the Orcs, or the fury of the Northmen. Men prayed for the
return of the All-Father, but He would not come, and the faith of the people waned.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And then, just as the future looked its darkest, a beacon of hope was kindled, and the
tide of fate began to turn. A young warrior named Cambruin appeared in the Kingdom of
Caledorn, a warrior who could not be defeated in battle. Cambruin spread the word of the
Five Virtues, which he said were the source of all his strength, granted to him through
the grace of the All-Father. As Cambruin's fame grew, the strongest and most noble
warriors flocked to his banner, becoming the first Knights. Battle by battle, league by
bloody league, the Knights won Cambruin a kingdom through toil and war and became legend
by bringing the light of his wisdom to all who would see it. As his kingdom grew,
Cambruin's enlightened rule transformed the Heartlands into a land of peace, order, and
justice. In time, the One Kingdom spread from the jungles in the South to the Ice in the
North, with legions of Knights as the High King's defenders and enforcers. Once the Sons
of Men were united under Cambruin's banner, even the ancient armies of the elves were as
wheat before the righteous swords of the Champions, the greatest of Knights, who served
Cambruin as his lieutenants and companions. Men throughout the One Kingdom praised
Cambruin, calling him the All-Father returned, or the mightiest of His Archons, the savior
of humanity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas, that ever those days of quest and glory should come to such an
evil ending! Peasants of virtue who had followed Cambruin's vision and noble warriors who
had given up title and family for the High King's cause were given lands for their
service. As the War of Tears dragged ever on, even the greatest Knights began to go
astray, their strength sapped by an easy life of wealth and greed or consumed by bloodlust
born of war. Some tried to revive the Path of Virtue, creating the Holy Knighthood of the
Sash, while others convinced the High King that crusades against the fey folk and the
Dwarves of the mountains were the key to peace and order. The Knights lost their way, and
ancient feuds resurfaced. Dissention split Cambruin's court, and even the knights of the
Shining Champions, Cambruin's chosen, quarreled amongst themselves. The High King, alas,
was too distracted by the War to see the shadow growing at his back.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on the eve of his final victory, disaster struck. Even as the
walls of Kierhaven, the last great Elvish stronghold at the edge of the Northern
Wastelands, broke before the strength of the High King's siege, the King himself hunted
Elvish archers in the nearby forest. The King came to a great Oak tree, the largest ever
known, and in the shadows of its ancient boughs he was betrayed. The Betrayer, one of the
King's own Champions, drew the great sword Shadowbane and drove it through Cambruin's
heart. And so was broken what could not be broken, and with it Hope was broken. And the
very World was Sundered, and the Heavens raged and wept at the High King's passing and at
the death of his greatest Champion.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been five full generations since the
Age of Kings. When the All-Father turned his back from the World, the Realm was cast into
Darkness. The sun became but a wives tale, as the World was blanketed with furious storms.
Even the clouds let forth endlessly, drowning the land with a sickening rain of blood.
Disease and starvation struck hard, turning most cities into little more than festering
wounds.<br>
<br>
Then came the endless War.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brutal Warlords rose up, turning brigand mobs into formidable armies.
The Church struggled valiantly, a final attempt to calm the hearts of the few innocents
who remain.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most knowledge was lost, as a new Dark Age
descended on mankind. Statues of wondrous might lie forgotten, half-buried in the sand,
the Great Library of Aerynth burned, her once great Towers fallen.<br>
<br>
The End is Near... and in this Final Hour, a single hope remains.&nbsp;<br>

They call it Shadowbane, a light to stand against the Darkness.&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it curious that the last &quot;single
hope&quot; is the same sword which splintered the world with the death of Cambruin by his
betrayer.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elves seemed to rule the Age of Twilight,
holding humans as slaves and perverting all of the All-Fathers works. During this time the
elves kept no track of &quot;time&quot; as such there are no calendar references, it would
seem that in this age the sun had yet to exist.&nbsp;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Age of Days seems to be the beginning of
dated time, due to the kindling of the sun. This age also marks the rebellion of the
humans upon their elvish masters.</font> </font></span></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Age of Kings seems to be marked by the
Tribes of Men forming scattered kingdoms, while fighting a slowly losing battle against
the elves. It ends with the great king <span class="content"><font
face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">Cambruin uniting all of the kingdoms under his
banner and crushing the elvish armies. However he is betrayed and slain by his own body
guard, it is assumed he was hired by the elves, but it is curious that he would wait till
then to strike. I find it curious that the All-Father chose to leave us to our own
devices, while the world splintered in his absence, over the death of one man.</font></span></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <span class="content"><font
color="#FFFFFF" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">Due to the patchwork finding of my
studies of our history I have come to the following conclusions. The All-Father created
the Elves but they corrupted all he made and bent it to their wills. This angered the
All-Father who then created Men, the elves quickly enslaved this new race of the world.
But the spirit of man kind broke free and they rebelled. The All-Father pleased with the
Human race sent his &quot;Godlings&quot; to teach them various
&quot;disciplines&quot;.&nbsp; With the new knowledge the humans almost crushed the elves.
But they had a last bit of treachery, they found a way to have a trusted bodyguard kill
the All-Fathers chosen. At this time I believe the All-Father lost faith in humanity and
its ability to triumph over the elves and turned his back to begin again elsewhere. But as
he gave up on the world all the forces he kept under control suddenly reverted back to
their chaotic nature, all he built and controlled came apart at the seams and continues to
rip itself apart. Because the All-Father is no longer to control the chaos and provide
law, nature works differently now, which would go far in explaining why magics that did
not used to work now do.</font></span> </p>

<p><span class="content"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I can not help but wonder why he did not simply destroy the elves himself. I have heard
others make reference to the possibility that the All-Father is a creator incapable of
destruction, I found this to be amusing but anything is possible.</font></span> </p>
