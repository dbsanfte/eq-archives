<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">One man may
be a master of the blade, yet he will surely fall if a hundred foes are set
against him. A hundred master warriors may stand together, and they will be a
mighty force indeed, yet if each man acts as one, looking only to his own
concerns, even they will fall before a force that is directed. A crowd of
untrained farmers with long spears can prevail against a phalanx of armored
knights, if they form a good line and stand together. Ten men in the right
formation will fight like fifty, and a thousand men who can work together toward
one purpose are invincible. The Commander must serve as the brain to the body of
his army. His eyes must see the events unfolding before him, and his orders must
move across the battlefield and guide his troops. As crucial as a Commander's
orders are, his very presence can be critical as well. The Commander's will and
courage must sustain every man, from weary veteran to green recruit, and more
than one army had fled the field when its Commander fell, even when victory
seemed assured. An army's strength depends on every soldier, but the keenness of
the Commander's mind and eye is all that divides victory from defeat, glory from
ruin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient Elvish masters knew this well, and their great
commanders first refined the Arts of warfare. Their ancient wisdom still holds
true on the blighted battlefields of today. The Centaurs of the vast plains to
the East learned the ways of War early, in their bitter skirmishes with the
Deathless Empire, and it is from them that the principles of formation,
discipline, and strategy first came to the Sons of Men. In all the bloody ages
since, generals of renown have arisen among all the Children of the World. Most
know the intricacies of formation and maneuver, and a few have even mastered the
finer points of strategy. But even they pale before the Master Warlords of
legend, the Commanders who carried the crude practice of War into the highest
Art of all.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember well the tales of Gamrist Olostor the Elf General,
leader of the Steel Wind, a handpicked force of 300 mounted archers. At the peak
of their power they could travel 20 leagues a day, and defeated forces ten times
their number. Learn from Asranar, the Black Bear of Lambourne, whose army
journeyed a thousand miles through the Chaos Gate and yet returned. For these
masters of the Elder Days logistics, strategy, morale, and deception were as
crucial as numbers, arms, and armor. Sir Gerriant the Old, Right Arm to King
Cambruin in the War of Tears, he was such a man, the last great General among
the Sons of Men. Their like is gone now, swept away by the War of the Scourge
and the War of Tears, and the World may never see their like again. Look well at
the lives and teachings of these great generals, for the Commander who can
master their ancient lore will rise above the mob of petty Warlords who hack
crudely at each other in the Age of Strife. An Elf armed with such knowledge
might win back a kingdom for his people, or a Man might take the High King's
throne.<br>
<br>
Guilds and Cities, Nations and Hordes, all the folk in the Age of Strife seek a
leader. Who will you call to your banner?</font></p>
