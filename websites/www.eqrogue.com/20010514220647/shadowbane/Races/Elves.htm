<font red>Elves</font> </font><font color="#FF0000">- Mournful
descendants of a Forgotten Empire. Arrogant and cruel, the Elves were put down
by their own slaves, the trained animals known as Man. What few Elves still
remain wander the world as outcasts, rather than Kings - their legendary
immortality now a curse, as they watch their world crumble and wait to die. The
remnants of the greatest Elven families can still be seen among those who
wander, borne out through years of ancestry in each elves' skin tone : White in
the oldest families, ruling in the cold and desolate Northlands; Brown, for
those born to the wild and Lords of the wood; Green for the coastal families who
mapped the once-great Seas.</font>

<p><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp; The most beautiful of all the Children of
the World, Elves are tall beings, lithe and graceful, with slight frames and
long, delicate fingers. Never renowned for their physical strength, Elves are
fair and frail, yet possessed of keen minds. No other race can match the Elves
in intellect, and only the bird-boned Aracoix are their equal in speed and
agility. Born in the Age of Twilight, that dimly remembered time before the
kindling of the Sun, Elves can see quite clearly even in the dimmest light, and
their large, haunting eyes are as keen as any cat's. Elves' pointed ears are
instantly recognizable, and grant them superior hearing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the distinction is lost on most other races, three
distinct types of Elves have emerged over their long history. Only the wisest
Human mages have learned the names of the Elvish peoples, though to Elves the
distinctions are painfully distinct. The Dar Khelegur, or 'High Ice Lords' in
the old speech, dwelt of old in the frozen mountains of the North and founded
the Deathless Empire. Their fair skin is as white as alabaster, white as the
snows of their homelands. Tallest of the Elves, the Dar Khelegur are known for
their mastery of magic and their limitless cruelty. The second Elvish race call
themselves the Gwaridorn, 'Masters of the Sea,' and in their skin the green of
the seas can faintly be seen. Of old they dwelt by the shores of the great
Western Sea and built mighty ships, and were the strongest of the Elves in
battle. Last of the Elvish peoples are the Twathedilion, the 'Elves of the
Forest,' whose faces are touched with the brown of the trees of their homelands.
Stealthiest of all the Elvenfolk, the Twathedilion are also their greatest
artists, and are known for their mastery of the bow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first Elves were born before the creation of Time, and
are thus immortal, though few of these Firstborn have survived the tumult of the
Ages unto the dark present. Every Elf born since the beginning of the Age of
Days was born mortal, although their lifespans measure many centuries. Of all
the peoples of the World, the Elves have had most cause to accept the Turning,
for with it their immortality has been restored. They greatly resent, however,
that in this dark age they must share their immortality with the lesser races of
the World.</span></p>
<p><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Elves believe that they are the
most perfect of the Children of the World, and their arrogance knows no bounds.
The Elves remember that they were the first to walk beneath the twilight, and
try to ensure that no other race can forget it. Every Elf regards their culture
and civilization as naturally superior, having matured for millennia before the
other races were even born. Elves are creatures of passion, and tend towards the
extreme in everything they do. Elvish songs are almost hypnotic in their
intensity, their revels are unrestrained, their loves fierce, and their wars are
grim and terrible. Lovers of wine, starlight, and music, Elves appreciate all
forms of art, though their tastes tend toward the decadent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Twilight Kingdom once reached a pinnacle of refinement
and advancement, but the Ages since have seen Elvish society grow corrupt and
cruel. Grotesque magical experiments, torture, and debauchery became
commonplace. Assured of their innate superiority to all of the so-called
&quot;Lesser Races,&quot; the Elves have, over the course of their long history,
enslaved many and fought bitter wars of extermination against the rest. The grim
outcome of the War of the Tears has fueled the resentment of the Elves even
further, and most Elves today are bitter and spiteful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the undisputed masters of the World, the Elves built
mighty cities of alabaster, silver, and crystal, or dwelt in hidden glades at
the heart of the great forests. Now their glorious towers have all been
shattered or pulled down, and the forests dwindle as the kingdoms of Men expand.
Their numbers decimated in the War of Tears, what few Elves remain are prone to
melancholy, and wander as outcasts in the wild, far from the eyes of Men. The
Sons of Men remain implacable in their suspicion and hatred of all Elves, and
the Temple of the Cleansing Flame has proclaimed a perpetual crusade against all
of Elvish blood. Their long lifespans and immortal beginnings leave most Elves
unconcerned about the problems of the present or the immediate future, and Elves
seem therefore easily distracted, lacking the focus to carry a project or an
idea through to completion. Once an Elf becomes convinced of a course of action,
however, their pride gives rise to an implacable resolve.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the wake of the War of Tears, some Elves have been
consumed with hatred for the Sons of Men, and are marshalling their forces for a
renewal of that bitter conflict. Others, more fatalistic in their view, mourn
the loss of their great empire and have decided that it is far better to outlive
their enemies than engage them. Many of the oldest Elves have withdrawn from
even Elvish company, vanishing into the wilds. Their destination and their
plans, if any, remain a mystery.</span></p>
