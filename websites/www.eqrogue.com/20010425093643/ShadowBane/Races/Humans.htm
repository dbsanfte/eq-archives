mere
slave race of the great Elven Empire, the Humans have prospered through our
broken World and hold tightly to the few vestiges of civilization which remain.
Inheritors of a world they barely understand, most of the other races consider
the Humans to be the cause of the Turning, and their constant warring a direct
cause to the destruction of our World. The truth or falsehood of this claim has
never been determined, but even among men, the argument rages on.</font>

Wrought by the hands of the All-Father, Humans claim to be His truest children,
and the rightful rulers of the World. Through their long history, the Sons of
Men have known nothing but strife and struggle. Humans are the most varied of
the World's children, however, and their cleverness and adaptability ensure that
Humans have survived and even thrived despite all adversity. Once the slaves of
the great Elvish Empire, the Sons of Men threw off the yoke of their oppressors
and have since built empires of their own. Inheritors of a world they barely
understand, most other races consider the Humans the cause of the Turning,
cursed with a hubris that far exceeds their wisdom. Strife remains a way of life
among Men, and some believe the constant warfare that plagues their petty
kingdoms will eventually lead to the destruction of our World. The truth or
falsehood of these claims has never been determined, but even among Men the
argument rages on.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of all the Children of the World, Humans are the most diverse. Whereas the
differences between Elvish nations are barely discernable to outsiders, and
Dwarves tend toward an uncanny unanimity in their features, a scholar who knew
no better might mistake the Sons of Men for five great races, not one. There is
no such thing as a &quot;typical&quot; Human, from the Northman, pale as snow,
to the ebon skinned Irydni, difference is the rule. Scholars have identified six
great Human tribes, although the passage of time has blurred the lines between
them.<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> <i>The Ethyreans</i>: Mightiest of the tribes of Men, the
Ethyreans are fair of skin, with hair tending towards deep brown or black. The
chieftains of the Ethyreans became the first Kings of Men, and founded the Ten
Kingdoms that Cambruin united. While not the strongest or most learned of Men,
the Ethyreans have left the greatest mark on the World, and the Petty Kingdoms,
humbled as they were by the Turning, are still the mightiest in the World.<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> <i>The Invorr</i>: Tall and strong, the Northmen are fairer
even than the Ethyreans, with pale skin that rivals even that of the Elves.
Invorr hair is bright, favoring either gold or fiery red. Feared and reviled as
Barbarians and savages, the Northmen know little of reading, lore, or religion,
yet take fierce pride in their heritage, and believe themselves to be High Men,
the true heirs of the Titans.<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> <i>The Irydnu</i>: Dark as the Northmen are fair, the Dark
Sages of the South have skin that ranges from dark brown to the color of pitch.
Only the Irekei, dwellers in the Burning Lands, are darker. Before the Turning
the Irydnu kept to themselves, and only rumors of their ways reached the rest of
Humanity. It is said that they are the wisest of all Men, and that Magic runs in
their blood almost as freely as it does with the Elves.<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> <i>The Horwathi</i>: The savage tribes of the Great Steppes
are lean and short, with black hair and skin the color of honey. Most Men think
the Howathi even more bestial than the Northmen, but there are few who can match
their hardiness. The Horwathi are survivors above all else. Rumors persist of
great empires beyond the Steppes, Horwathi Empires of silk and magic. Since the
Turning, however, the trails to these lands have all vanished.<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> <i>The Gwendannen</i>: Stout Men of the Hills, the
Gwendannen have ruddy, tan skin and dark hair. The Northmen and the Men of the
Ten Kingdoms have long warred against the Gwendannen clans, and their numbers
have dwindled. It is whispered that the Old Ways are still remembered among the
Hill Folk, who revere the names of the Titans and worship alongside Druids in
the deeps of the forests.<br>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </i> <i>The Taripontor</i>: Quick and nimble, the lusty men of
the Free Cities have brown skins tanned by the Sun, and dark curly hair.
Passionate in war as they are in wooing, Taripontor do nothing halfway. Their
craftsmen are among the greatest in the World, and they are master sailors. If
the Men of Tariponto were not so busy feuding amongst themselves, they might
make even the Petty Kingdoms tremble.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obscure legends mention a seventh race of Men, forgotten
history, a wandering tribe known as the Anomani. Very little is known of them,
though they are believed to have been dark skinned and prone to revelry. Long
extinct, Sages have named Anomani the &quot;Lost Men.&quot; Ancient legends also
claim that all seven of the Human nations are but shadows of their former
selves. The First Men, which ancient fragments call the Ardani, were perfect in
both form and faculty. The Ardani lived as Titans, masters of craft, war, and
magic. These Titans, tales say, were destroyed long ago by the Elves. Today, the
heirs of the Ardani are known as the Sons of Men, and all the glories they have
wrought are but an echo of splendors long faded.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scholars and Loremasters have long troubled over the question
of Humanity's greatness. The Sons of Men are not the strongest, nor the
smartest, or even the hardiest of the World's children, yet they have thrived in
the harshest of climes, and prevailed in war over all the other races. While
short lived (at least before the Turning), the Sons of Men are clearly the most
fertile of the World's Children, and have recovered from disasters more quickly
than other peoples. Humans may not be the greatest of the World's children, but
neither are they the weakest, dullest, or most sickly. While most of the other
races will surpass Men in one quality, in others they invariably fall behind.
Some Prelates believe that Humans are uniform of spirit if not of body, with
characteristics that are more balanced than those of the other races. Alchemists
have furthered this notion, hypothesizing that Men offer the perfect balance of
humors in their blood. The unlearned believe that the Sons of Men have built so
much because they are the All-Father's truest children, wrought by His hand in
His image, and proclaimed by Him to be the masters of the World. How then, they
reason, can any stand against them?</span></font></p>
