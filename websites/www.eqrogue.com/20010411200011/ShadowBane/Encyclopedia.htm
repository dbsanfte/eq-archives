    Even Almeus could not succeed in fashioning new <a href="#Runestones">Runestones</a>, but

    While trying to find the ideal medium from which to fashion <a href="#Runestones">Runestones</a>,

    accumulate magical force, called Mana by initiates. Almeus devised ways to tap into the
    stored Mana within these objects, as well as other ways to trap mana within the substance

    Powerstones so prized by Wizards and <a href="#Channeler">Channelers</a> alike.&nbsp;Two

    blood for gold. Some Assassins are ruthless predators, who've developed a taste for blood
    and thrill at the act of killing, while others are grim professionals, bringing a kind of
    honor even to the direst of professions. There are some Assassins who are less direct,
    however, and began their dark careers not as Rogues but as Wizards, and use magic instead
    of a dagger. These dark magicians have practiced the art of murder so long that every
    Assassin learns spells of stealth and shadow, evasion and death. In any battle, the
    mightiest weapon is one that strikes unseen. If history has taught anything to the peoples
    of the World, its grim lesson is that anyone can be killed, if the killer tries hard
    enough. In these days since the <a href="#Turning">Turning</a>, death has lost its
    permanence but not its sting: though the Champion of a guild may only stay dead a few
    hours after he tastes an Assassin's blade, his absence may well turn the tide of a

    found among all the peoples of the World.&nbsp; But there is far more to a Bard's life
    than singing and playing. Bards must record the events of the present as dutifully as they
    remember the past, and therefore every Bard is a vagabond, a chronicler in search of a new
    epic. Bards are welcomed everywhere, for a good song and a moment free from care have
    become precious things in this troubled Age. Bards also carry news and tidings from
    distant places, which the folk of remote towns crave more than ale. Through the work of
    Bards deeds seen become sagas told throughout the World. So the works of the strong and
    the honorable are known and revered, and glory is heaped on the names of the brave.&nbsp;A
    Bard's knowledge of the sagas has other benefits as well. Bards know how every hero
    triumphed or failed, and remember every trick and secret employed by giants, sorcerers,
    witches, and heroes. There is a power in words, names, and songs, and Bards know much that
    is hidden.</p>

    The Druids hold their rites at ancient stone circles lost in the deeps of the forest, far
    from the prying eyes of Man. Their rites and rituals are the echoes of ancient ceremonies
    intoned by the Elves under the <a href="#Age of Twilight">First Twilight</a> ages ago.
    Through the power of their faith, Druids attune themselves with the world around them,
    utilizing the hidden connection between all living things and the World itself. Plants,
    beasts, and the weather all respond to a Druid's magic. No beast of field or wild will
    ever seek of its own will to harm a Druid, and many serve them as their eyes, ears, and
    protectors. During the <a href="#Age of Kings">Age of Kings</a>, the Druids and <a

    minimize or offset the damage done by civilized peoples to the world. Above all, the

    the Fury is born of pain and sacrifice, so the furies deprive themselves of all luxury and
    refinement. Fasting, meditation, and even self-mutilation are the keys to their power.
    Furies adorn themselves with dozens of fetishes, handmade talismans, and striking body
    paint. The Furies learned long ago how to work together to produce greater magical
    effects. Three Furies casting together are perilous indeed, and the High Circle of Furies
    can call up a storm so terrible that it can lay waste to an entire region. Though they
    look and act like primitive Healers or shamans, Furies do not worship the forces of

    discipline as any Wizard or <a href="#Priests">Priest</a>. Previous to <a href="#Lyestra">Lyestra</a>

    chained within deep caves unable to die. From the very foundation of the <a href="#Amazon">Amazon</a>
    Empire, the Furies have served as advisors to the <a href="#Amazon">Amazon</a> Queens.
    Their cryptic words carry much weight within <a href="#Amazon">Amazon</a> society, and
