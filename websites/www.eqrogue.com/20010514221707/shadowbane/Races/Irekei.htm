The &quot;Devilmen&quot;,
little is known about these strange, red-skinned tribes of the desert. Common
folklore claims them to be the descendants of a long lost family of Elven
nobles, banished to the Burning Lands for their ferocity and warlike nature.
Known primarily for their teachings in the mystic arts, they are also known to
be cunning assassins. It is said that Irekei children are trained in the use of
knives from birth.</font>

The &quot;Devilmen,&quot; little is known of these strange, fierce, red-skinned
raiders of the desert. Folktales claim they are the descendants of a long lost
family of Elvish nobles who were banished to the Burning Lands for their
ferocity and warlike nature. While Irekei and Elves are distinctly similar, the
Devilmen deny any kinship, and respond to the suggestion with violence. Known
primarily for their ferocity in battle and their ruthless treatment of all
non-Irekei, raiding parties of Irekei are the terror of all settlements that
border on the deserts. Renowned for their teachings in the mystic arts, Irekei
also make cunning assassins. It is said that Irekei children are trained in the
use of knives from birth, and learn to fight before they learn to speak. What
outsiders see as cruelty, Irekei see as strength tempered by grim necessity. The
crucible of the desert has turned the Devilmen into a grim, hard people for whom
survival is the ultimate priority.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once the fourth great nation of Elvenkind, Irekei are practically identical to
Elves in their physiology. If closely examined, however, some startling
differences appear. While all Irekei have the same slight frame, pointed ears,
and large eyes of the Firstborn, their bodies are leaner and harsher, covered
with taut muscles. Irekei features are harsh and angular, a stark contrast to
the sleek smoothness of an Elvish face. Their life in the harsh desert demands
both strength and fortitude. As a result the Irekei, while not quite as agile as
Elves, are both stronger and hardier. Desert life has resulted in other unique
characteristics. Constant exposure to the Sun's glare has dimmed their night
vision somewhat, though their hearing remains as keen as any Elf's. Irekei do
not perspire, and their bodies radiate far more heat than the other peoples of
the World. There is no mistaking the hot touch of an Irekei: even if their cruel
natures had not earned the Irekei the name &quot;Devil Men,&quot; their burning
touch surely would have.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest difference between the Elves and Irekei is also
the most visible. Where Elves are pale and fair, with a slight hint of blue,
green, or brown in their coloring, an Irekei's skin is dark, their coloring
harsh and intense. Irekei skin tones vary from blood red to crimson to jet
black, with hair running the gamut from pale white to gold to deep ebony. Irekei
loathe tattoos and refuse to deliberately mar their skin, though they proudly
wear any scars gained in duel or battle. Irekei faces are harsh and stern, for
they rarely smile.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life in the empty desert has left its mark on the manner of
the Irekei as well. Used to having an uninterrupted view of the horizon, they
grow nervous in enclosed spaces. Irekei find forests unsettling, and large
bodies of water terrify them. The heat of the desert has taught the Irekei to
conserve their energy and strength: all Devil Men act with a utility of
movement, wasting little motion. When action is required, Irekei move with an
uncanny speed, directness, and intensity. Even when at rest, Irekei project an
aura of menace, of furious action restrained by intense concentration. When
dealing with fir'khanim (literally &quot;rain bleeder,&quot; a derogatory term
for any being weak enough to waste water through sweat) Irekei seem stoic, and
tend to brood and scowl. Among their own kind, however, Irekei are as capable of
laughter and frenzied revelry as any Elf.</span></font></p>

&quot;As the Flame burns and the Sun burns, so must we. To do less is to
die.&quot; This ancient Irekei proverb forms the core of Irekei culture and
philosophy. In the parched wastelands life is a continual struggle, and only
those mobile enough to scavenge and brutal enough to pillage can hope to
survive. The strong must prey upon the weak, and the weak must be either clever
or quick to escape death. To be weak is to die - the Irekei test their children
rigorously after birth, and any who cannot keep up are left to the mercies of
the desert. Constant strife between Irekei tribes and the continual threat of
desert predators have given rise to a brutal, militaristic culture. Most Irekei
are Warriors, and every Irekei child learns the basics of knife fighting before
they learn to speak.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the Irekei no longer consider themselves Elves,
they still boast the arrogance of the Fair Folk. In some cases they take Elvish
haughtiness to even greater extremes. As the Irekei see it, the Sons of Flame
live in the desert not because they are forced to but because they choose to.
While most Children of the World wither in the deserts, the Irekei thrive there,
a testimony to their superiority and worthiness. When the Dragon rises, only the
fiercest will be spared his wrath - every Irekei believes that his highest duty
is to prove himself worthy. Every day the desert tests their strength and will -
if the Irekei were to live in the Greenlands, surely they would become as soft
and weak as all the other peoples of the World.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concept of khar'ika is central to Irekei thought.
Khar'ika does not translate into any non-Irekei language (including Elvish):
&quot;soul flame,&quot; &quot;blood,&quot; &quot;heart,&quot; and
&quot;toughness&quot; are all valid yet incomplete translations. The khar'ika is
the flame of Khalikryst, the holy fire the transformed the Irekei from Elves
into superior beings, and the reserve of strength and endurance that an Irekei
calls upon to survive at all costs. Battle and tests of fortitude can kindle an
Irekei's khar'ika, making it burn brighter, while death snuffs out the khar'ika
forever (since the Turning, death diminishes the soul flame, but no longer
extinguishes it). Non-Irekei have no fire in their souls, their flesh is cold
and their bodies are weak. While most Irekei prefer to fight with wickedly
curved blades, some Warriors walk the Shining Way instead. These Warriors,
called Sun Dancers, fight without any weapons at all, harnessing their khar'ika
to turn their bare hands into deadly weapons.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Irekei are nomads by nature, roving from oasis to oasis
and ruin to ruin. Every Iriekei is a member of a Virakt, a tribe composed of
several allied clans and family groups. The bond between Irekei tribemates is
the strongest in their culture - no Devil Man would ever willingly harm or
betray the others of his Virakt. Most tribes (the Irekei plural is Virakt'al)
have only a few dozen members, although the largest tribes number in the
thousands. Every Virakt has its allies and blood enemies among the others,
although the patterns of trade, marriage alliance, friendship, and vendetta
shift constantly, like the ripples on a sand dune. Every Virakt also makes a
living through raiding, taking goods and captives from anyone weaker than
themselves. The goods are consumed and the captives forced to serve as Jov'uus,
or slaves. Only fir'khanim are kept as slaves - any true Irekei would rather die
than be a thrall. Irekei build great buildings of sandstone, intricately carved
with runes and decorative designs. Around these structures stretch vast awnings
of canvas or silk, and Irekei of lower castes live in great tents. Ancient
Elvish ruins, remnants of the Twilight Kingdom, rise up out of the desert sands
here and there, and are held as sacred by the Irekei, forming the nucleus of
every Devilman city.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peoples of the outside World believe that the Irekei are
all wanton, barbaric savages that eat the flesh of their enemies and drink
blood. While most of these stories are exaggerations (if not outright lies), the
truth of the matter is that the Irekei have a highly advanced culture, rich in
history, folklore, and art. True equality exists between Irekei men and women,
for any who can prove themselves under the harsh Sun are worthy of respect and
power. Poetry, storytelling, and music come easily to the Irekei, and their
festivals are wondrous to behold. Among the Irekei rigid protocols and elaborate
systems of etiquette govern everything, from greeting to eating to declaring
war. All Irekei have a highly developed sense of honor, which they see as a
product of their khar'ika. To break with custom or violate tradition is to
declare oneself too weak to live by the ways of the Irekei, a fate all Devil Men
regard as unthinkable. Of course, it goes without saying that the fir'khanim are
unworthy of courtesy of any kind. Any ruse, deception, or brutality is perfectly
acceptable if used against rain-bleeders: indeed, deception and cruelty are
considered the honorable means of dealing with weak beings.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War is the only time the constraints of honor break down
between Irekei. Khan'jallakar, or Blood War, is one of the Irekei's most ancient
traditions. Wars are not to be confused with duels: in Irekei cities fatal
fights between Warriors are frequent, and governed by strict traditions. Dire
insults or crimes against a Virakt can, under certain conditions (which are,
again, rigidly defined by tradition) lead to Khan'jallakar. There are precise
rituals for declaring a Blood War, but once declared there are no rules, and the
conflict turns as bloody as any raid of the Greenlands, if not more so. Entire
Virakt'al have vanished because of Blood Wars, yet as they must not always end
cruelly. Usually, within a few months of the Blood War's end, the two tribes are
neutral towards each other again, resuming trade and possibly even becoming
allies. To the Irekei, War is a passionate diversion, like wine or song, meant
to be savored to the fullest, then set aside before it distracts them from the
business of survival. Since the Turning, Blood Wars among Irekei have decreased
in their ferocity, while the number of Blood Wars called against fir'khanim has
increased drastically.</span></font></p>
