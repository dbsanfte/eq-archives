<p align="center"><font class="faqQuestion"><font size="4">Excepts from the Stratics SB
FAQ and <font color="#FF0000">Elidrin's Comments</font> </font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00">How many characters can I have per account?:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font class="faqAnswer">Right now Wolfpack is aiming for around
five, but will not commit to any number. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">Don't worry, though, you won't be limited to one. <font
color="#FF0000">Damn!</font></font></p>

<p><font class="faqQuestion" color="#FFFF00">Will character advancement be level based?:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">In a word, yes. Your character will have an
attribute called level which will denote his or her general strength. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">However, this is not the single determining factor
in your character's success since skill will be very, very important.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000" class="faqAnswer">I wonder how level and skill
levels come into play, and just where disciplines fit into it.</font></p>
<font class="faqQuestion"><font color="#FFFF00">

<p>How do I acquire experience points?:</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font class="faqAnswer">The only way to get experience points
is to kill players or monsters.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">YES YES YES Finally</font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">It is not definite how experience will be split
between groups, but all that will be taken care of before the game is released. </font></p>

<p><font class="faqQuestion"><font color="#FFFF00">Is there a level or skill cap in
Shadowbane?:</font></p>

<p></font><font class="faqAnswer">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This really hasn't been discussed
much. If there is a level cap, it will be fairly high (probably in the 100 range, but
Wolfpack hasn't committed to a number). As for a skill cap, that is completely up in the
air. They have mentioned the idea of a &quot;soft cap&quot;, though, which means it
becomes exponentially more and more difficult to reach a higher level and you gain less
and less of a reward as you hit that level. In that light, people won't be striving to hit
that next level anymore, thus the idea of a &quot;soft cap&quot;. <font color="#FF0000">Basically
this puts a limit on power leveling due to it becoming tedious even if you had a full
group constantly working. In addition I understand at a certain point XPs only come from
players further reducing the ability to power level.</font></font></p>

<p><font class="faqQuestion" color="#FFFF00">How customizable will character appearance
be?:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">Very--in fact, Wolfpack thinks they can make
it deep enough so that no two characters look alike! Social Interaction is the key point
of Shadowbane, and Wolfpack feels that being able to create your character with as much
freedom as you want is important in expressing your personal character. Rest assured that
things such as height, build, hair color, facial hair, skin tone and hue, and scars will
be completely customizable. Well, maybe you can't be a seven foot, pink Dwarf, but you get
the idea. <font color="#FF0000">I wonder how disguise (Assassin) will work with this?</font></font></p>
<font class="faqQuestion"><font color="#FFFF00">

<p>Will I be able to wear cloaks and robes?:</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font class="faqAnswer">Well, that part is sketchy due to the 3D
Engine. Robes and Cloaks are very difficult to create properly due to the way they
naturally flow (much like hair). In addition, like hair, it is one of the things that has
been baffling programmers and artists alike for a very long time now. Rest assured that
Wolfpack will do its best to make the possibility a reality, but they will only implement
them if they can do it right--they don't want to throw it in &quot;just because&quot;. <font
color="#FF0000">Anyone here want to wear a robe?</font></font></p>
<font class="faqQuestion"><font color="#FFFF00">

<p>Are the attributes (strength, dexterity, etc) that you choose static or do they improve
with use?:</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font class="faqAnswer">There has been no information released
about this. We do know that the attributes will be Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
Intelligence, and Spirit. <font color="#FF0000">There isn't even any info on how the
attributes affect your skills</font></font></p>
<font class="faqQuestion" color="#FFFF00">

<p>Will my character need to eat?:</font> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">If eating is in Shadowbane, it will only
enhance gameplay, not become a tedious &quot;necessity&quot;. It has not been confirmed if
it will be in Shadowbane, though. <font color="#FF0000">So much for poisoning food and
drink =(</font></font></p>

<p><font class="faqQuestion" color="#FFFF00">Will male and female characters have
different attributes?:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">Yes, they will both start off slightly
differently with men concentrating more on strength while women will be high in spirit and
agility/dexterity. However, there will be no cap limiting the genders--women will just
have to work harder at gaining strength (due to lower testosterone levels) and men will
have to work harder at gaining speed. <font color="#FF0000">*Contains himself*</font></font></p>

<p><font class="faqQuestion" color="#FFFF00">Will all characters start in GM towns?:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font class="faqAnswer">Yes. Since guild cities could fall and
change power, all characters will start in GM-Towns which will never grow or decline in
size.</font></p>

LEADER is in charge of the guild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He (or she)

itself. </font><font color="#FF0000">Me</font></span><font color="#FFFFFF"><o:p> </o:p> </font></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Most
players within the guild will be ACTIVE members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
gives them the right to use the guild channel and facilities, invite new players into the
guild as petitioners, and vote on all guild matters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

Band</font></span></b><span style="font-family:Verdana"><br>
<font size="2">Most of the great cities boast an organized syndicate of thieves,
vagabonds, and cutthroats. While some dens are tightly organized groups with master
thieves, apprentices, dues, and specific territories, others are much more informal: the
familial bands of thugs and extortionists of the Merchant Cities, for example, or the
Council of Street Gangs in Rovayle. All Thieves' Bands have this much in common - they are
places where Rogues can band together and organize outside the bounds of the Law, and they
are devoted to profit above all else. Joining a Thieves' Band allows rogues to hone their
skills to near perfection, and in some corrupt cities these organizations have grown so
powerful and influential that they operate in the open, with an air of legality.<br>

Legion</font></span></b><span style="font-family:Verdana"><br>
<font size="2">War has left an indelible imprint upon the history of the World: vast
armies have decided the fate of nations and whole peoples for more than an Age of the
World, and in the wake of the Turning, the wars have only grown more fierce. From the
scattered remnants of the great Elvish Hosts to the squadrons of the Aracoix to the elite
battalions of the Dwarves, every race has its Legions, and few are idle for long. Among
the Sons of Men, the Shining Legion Cambruin led to victory in the War of Tears has
shattered, leaving a crowd of dark knights and petty kings, each with a vast army of
vassals, knights and yeomen. These armies battle the hosts of the other races, hoping to
gain land and wealth, and turn on each other as well, fighting for the scraps of
Cambruin's High Kingdom. The Legions are always in need of more soldiers of any kind, and
enterprising recruits can win fame, land and title if fortune smiles upon them.<br>

Barbarian Clan</font></b></span><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p> </o:p> <font size="2">The
frozen wastes of the Utter North are home to a tall, fair breed of men, known and feared
throughout the world for their great strength and savage tempers. Called
&quot;barbarians&quot; by the enlightened nations of the South, the Northmen hold as much
contempt for the weak mud farmers of the warmer climes as the southerners do for them. The
Northmen believe that they are the first sons of the All-Father, His strongest children,
and therefore the masters of the world and everything in it. These beliefs drive the
barbarians to endless raiding and plunder, and battle is a way of life to them. While the
Northmen acknowledge the All-Father as their creator, they do not worship him (He never
answers prayers, after all, so why pray to him?). Obsessed with the ordeal of survival in
their harsh homeland, the Northmen venerate the natural forces that can bring them
prosperity or a quick death: Cold, Storms, the Sun, and the Spirits of their Ancestors.
Although they know nothing of reading and writing, the Northmen possess a rich oral
tradition of legends and sagas, and their craftsmen can produce works of art with a beauty
that matches their maker's brutality. Northmen value honesty, skill, strength, and glory
in battle above all things. Their feuds with the Giants and Minotaurs are legendary.<br>
