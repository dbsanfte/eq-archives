Initiation: Rank 1</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
six rules we who wear the mask live and die by, a set of traditions we call the
Code, hammered out by the first master Black Masks of old. If you've ever hired
one of our blades, then you already know some of The Code, but we don't tell our
patrons everything. There are six tenets to The Code - learn them now.<br>
<br>
<i>The Rule of the Choosing</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Black Mask may refuse any contract or the terms of any
contract without loss of prestige, and need never give his reasons.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i>The Rule of Commitment</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a contract has been accepted, a black mask may not
accept another - the contract ends with the mask's death or with the target's.
The killing of a man, especially a great man, is no light matter - a Black
Mask's commitment to his profession must be absolute, or he (and by extension,
all under the Mask) are nothing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i>The Rule of the Blade</i><br>
A Black Mask kills only with a knife, and only works alone. If a man wants a
murder mistook for an accident, let him hire a common thief or a poisoner. If a
man wants the death of his enemy to send a message, he calls for a Black Mask.<br>
<br>
<i>The Rule of the Sheathe</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While pursuing a contract, Black Mask will kill only the
contracted target and none other, save in the direst need. The mark will be
killed one time, and one time only.&nbsp; We are men, not beasts. To us death is
the highest art.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i>The Rule of One Shadow</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Black Mask must render aid, safe harbor, and assistance to
any identified Black Mask who asks, save in violation of the Rule of the Blade.
The same shadow must hide us all. We may be many, but the Mask makes us one.<br>
<br>
<i>The Rule of the Mask</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Black Mask will never reveal his identity, the identity of
his patron, or that of his agents or any other Black Mask to anyone. Secrecy is
the darkest shadow of all, and our very lives depend upon it.</font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you see,
even we Black Masks have our honor, and our own type of glory. But know this -
our glory is as silent as our tread. You've made a bit of a name for yourself,
and you've got talent. But if you wear this mask, that ends. You'll never get to
boast of the jobs you've done, or tell even your wife or lovers just how skilled
and crafty you are.<br>
<br>
If you do, I'll be coming in the night for you.</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 2</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is far
more to the Black Mask's art than an agile tread, a black suit, and a blade. Any
man can kill another with a knife. Any rake, rogue, or warrior knows where to
strike to kill a man quickly. Ours is the hidden blade - no castle, wall, or
army can save our target from his fate.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To excel at our craft, to become truly great, one must study.&nbsp;
No knife is sharper than knowledge.&nbsp; No mask more deceptive than Truth.&nbsp;
Travel to distant lands, and learn the ways of the people there, how they dress,
and how they speak. Disguise and evasion will bring you closer to your targets
than a quiet pair of boots, and even vigilant guards learn not to look at
butlers and chambermaids. I spent eight moons finishing a contract, once -
disguised all the while as a poor butler from Ethyra. Two months of cleaning
stables won me duties inside the manor of a merchant prince, where I spent the
next months winning the trust and respect of the chamberlain. My knowledge of
poetry (as well as other… finer arts studied in my travels) won me the heart
of the merchant's wife. Once I had access to his bedchamber, the merchant's doom
was sealed. Had I not known the ways, fables, and speech of Ethyra, never could
I have finished the job.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not to say that your should neglect the rogue's arts
- stealth, agility, and a keen blade are the foundations of our success. The
Rule of the Blade demands that we kill with knives - use the straight sort like
those made in Rovayle. A long, light stiletto that can pierce a man's heart or
liver in the blink of an eye is best. And always, always use venom on your
blade. While an expert hand can kill with but a single strike, only a fool
leaves anything to chance. Be careful when buying poisons - the loose lips of an
alchemist can betray your secret profession and lead vengeful enemies to your
doorstep. If your mind is keen enough (and your purse deep enough) go study the
distiller's craft and become an alchemist yourself. If you depend on anyone for
anything, you open a window to betrayal.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, to carry out your work you will need an agent, an
intermediary. Every large city has one: someone who's looked death in the eye,
and can win the ear of the Black Masks for anyone who would hire our knives.
Agents are often old slayers past their prime, who wear the mask no more in
favor of a more mundane profession. They'll bring you word of any prospective
contracts so that you never need meet your would-be patrons in person. Some
agents work in secret, hidden behind a web of rumors, secret messages, and night
meetings. Others are open in their affiliations with us. After all, who would
dare do harm to such a man and risk the ire of our knives?</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 3</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poison is
the Black Mask's greatest ally, but its use requires special diligence and
discipline. The venom that coats your blade will make your every blow a lethal
one, but beware - the poison cares not who it kills, and more than one novice
has died from a tiny scratch of his own blade.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As any alchemist will tell you, the world is brimming over
with poisons of all sorts: berries, beasts, spiders, even the trees in the foggy
swamplands of the far South beyond Irydni all hold toxins than can kill a man,
render him lame, or cast him into slumber. By long standing tradition, Black
Masks use three types of venom - all are among the most potent that can be
delivered by a blade, and the easiest to obtain. Each is very different,
however, and requires its own discipline and cautions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To kill your target, use the mixture known as pellegorn. A
mixture of adder's venom and hemlock mixed with crushed thiroo berries, this
potent poison is rendered into a thick paste that sticks well to a blade and is
easily applied. Beware, however, for pellegorn loses its potency within an hour
if exposed to heat or the sun's light. Also, use it sparingly, for the paste has
a distinctive odor. Even a small dose will kill, but too much spread on your
blade will smell so strongly that your target may be warned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A favorite among Black Masks, the venom of the galpa spider
sends its victim into a deep slumber. A single drop of galpa will suffice, and
the sting can be delivered through a pin or needle. Judicious use of galpa will
allow a Black Mask to disable guards or other foes while still obeying the Rule
of the Sheathe. When you procure a vial of galpa venom, mix in two drops of your
own spit: this will temper the poison, making it useless against you (and hence
removing any danger of you pricking yourself by accident). Galpa will keep for a
month if stored in a vial, but becomes inert quickly in air.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other poison most favored by men behind the Mask is
buchinine, or gorgon's venom. This insidious oil seeps into the very flesh of
the victim, stiffening their sinews and muscles. The victim remains awake and
aware of everything around them, but is frozen in place, as if they had been
turned to stone. The experience is terrifying, and never forgotten. If your
patron wishes you to deliver a message to the target before the kill,
immobilization with Gorgon's venom is the preferred method. It also works well
on men and dogs. Note, however, that buchinine will only stay potent if it is
kept warm. Keep it in a brazier over dim coals, and wear the vial under your
armor, next to your skin.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 4</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wear the
Mask is to embrace a way of life, a double life that few of us were ever ready
for. In all things, let the Code be your guide - every one of them is there for
a reason, or for more than one. I myself was once contacted by a patron (through
my agent, of course) and asked to kill a prominent man that lived in my city, a
man who just happened to be me! I refused the job, of course, and gave no
reason. My agent and I had a long laugh over the whole affair. Too bad the
would-be patron didn't find it half as amusing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always be sure to research your targets extensively before
accepting a contract. There's a song the troubadours of Mellisar sing about the
Black Mask who was hired to kill the corrupt sheriff of a faraway county in a
time long before the Turning. The price was so high that the Mask eagerly took
the contract, only to discover soon after that the sheriff was his long lost
brother. The Mask agonized about the whims of Fortune and then, depending on
which version of the song you prefer, either killed his own brother without
hesitation or killed himself, holding true to the Rule of Commitment. Either
ending is very tragic. The fact that the song's composer died soon after writing
it for betraying working secrets of the Black Masks makes it even more popular.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Etiquette and custom influence a Mask's work profoundly, and
vary wildly from place to place. In the merchant cities of Tariponto a Black
Mask is expected to fulfill a contract by the next full moon, and agents work
openly, posting the names of targets on poles in the city plaza. 'Ponti Masks
tend to be arrogant artistes - they think giving the target warning makes the
job that much more challenging, demanding more of their skill. Conversely, in
the caravan town of Berenger hired killing is strictly outlawed by the order of
the High Templars, and according to them, there are no Black Masks in the city
at all. Wise men, however, know better. Anyone needing our services drops a
potsherd into the Well of Tears at the edge of town, with the target's name and
an offer of payment scratched into it. If the Mask accepts, he'll send word to
the applicant, and undertake the job. The Berengar Mask keeps his own schedule
and sets his own terms, having to avoid the attentions of both the Templars and
his targets.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you come to a new city, beware the different customs, and
seek out the agent or agents there. Know them by the cut of their dress - they
will favor black hose or leggings, and will always drink with their left hands.
When you meet such a man, ask him for directions to the next town while glancing
left and scratching your head. If he is an agent, he will answer by saying
&quot;Funny, how the road is never so straight as it seems.&quot; Once you have
identified each other, inquire of him (in private, of course) how business is in
town. Some Masks are very territorial, and don't tolerate free blades in their
cities.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font color="#0066cc" face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Rank 5</b></font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now
time to initiate you into the deepest secrets of our order, for you to learn the
true face behind the ebon mask. The Deepest Shadow is a council of master Black
Masks, who stay in contact with each other and look out for the best interests
of our order as a whole. They decide if any leaders are especially deserving of
death, or whether a contract against any man might prove bad for the order in
the long run.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But wait, you say - the Black Masks supposed to be aloof and
neutral, catering only to the highest bidder and caring little for politics!
True, but only up to a point. Only a fool has no interests. Would we stay in
business long if a new High King were to draw the Crimson Blade, or do you think
the Lords of the East would have any place for us once they'd conquered the
Several Kingdoms? I think not. Too much peace breeds complacency, while too much
war gives rivals another outlet for their enmity. Both are bad for business.
Better to keep the petty kings and lords vying for power, but afraid to
unsheathe the bloody sword of war. That way, they will always look to us as a
hidden ally, an easy way to overcome their enemies. And the people do not
suffer, at least so long as it serves our ends.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Deepest Shadow knows, from bitter memory, that just
as one man's death can prevent a war, one man's death can easily start one as
well. And wars are always bad for business. Well, almost always…<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Deepest Shadow does more than steer the tide of
History. Their first and most important task is to keep the Black Masks in
order, and punish violations of the Code. Usually, if a Black Mask steps outside
the laws of our order, he is warned. Once. Then, a Mask in a neighboring city
will be contracted to find the offender and bring him to face Justice. Thus the
Shadow culls the unfit from the lesser ranks, without even their knowledge.</font>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the times
before the Turning, death was a welcome punishment for those accused.&nbsp; The
ultimate punishment is Sanction, in which the offender's identity is made known
to every member of our order, and the Rule of the Sheathe is removed.&nbsp; The
accused will be hunted by each and every Black Mask, forever.&nbsp; Such a thing
has not been done in thirty years, since The Spider violated the Rule of One
Shadow by killing a family rival who asked him for safe harbor. The Spider was
one of the greatest Masks who ever lived - the hunt was long, but retribution
finally fell upon him. He remains in our safe keeping.&nbsp; Take heed of this
warning.&nbsp; You have not heard his screams. , I have.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Black Mask doesn't kill because he enjoys it, or even if it
might make his job easier. He kills his target and only his target because
that's his job. We're no army (you might be surprised to learn how few of us
actually wear the mask), and we can't walk through walls. Heartless? Hardly.
Soulless? Maybe.</font>
