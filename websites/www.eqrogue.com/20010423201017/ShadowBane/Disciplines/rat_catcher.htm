<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day we
don our candle helms and heavy gloves, and we descend into the dark below,
crawling through sewer, drain, and basement in pursuit of our prey. Every day we
risk our health and our lives for the good of all, that the people of the cities
may live without fear of disease and hunger. The simple folk may mock us, but
they do not understand. The names they call us don't bear repeating here in
public. And yet our work must be done, so we do it gladly. Indeed, our
commission was handed down by the High King Cambruin himself! You scoff, but go
and read you the Chronicles - you'll find it there writ plain.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days after his coronation, the High King marshaled his
mighty army, making ready to carry the great fight to the treacherous Elves.
Bardulph of Brellamere was one of his champions, great was his glory, and many
reckoned him the strongest and bravest in all the Shining Company. Mighty as he
was, Bardulph was also surpassingly modest. He lived for service, not glory -
thus his name has been forgotten by so many of the common folk. Bardulph yearned
for the coming war, yet battles were not to be his fate. On the eve of his
departure, Cambruin took Bardulph aside. &quot;You shall not go with us to
war,&quot; Cambruin said, &quot;but do not despair, my loyal Champion, for you
shall have an even higher calling. You must remain here, and see that nothing
evil lurks within my blessed city. Be ever vigilant: let no spy or beast creep
into our out of my city until I return. You must stop even the lowliest rat in
the sewers below! For if disease or treachery should take this city in my
absence, then all my victories on the field of battle will be for nothing.&quot;
Cambruin asked Bardulph if he would accept this mission, and Bardulph readily
assented.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So loyal was the Knight of Brellamere that he adhered to the
very letter of his High King's command. Bardulph fixed a lantern to his helm and
went down into the sewers, driving out the rats and other beasts that dwell
below. Others joined him in his mighty crusade, and soon brave men in other
cities followed his example. As Bardulph sacrificed his place in song and story
to serve the King, so we sacrifice our dignity for the good of all. We are
mocked and reviled by the people we serve, but we have never forgotten our high
calling. Without us, the vermin would eat all stores of food and the people
would starve in the winter. It was our order who first discovered that rats
carry disease, and thanks to our efforts the great plagues of old are almost
unknown in the age. There are rats in the depths of the sewers who can strip the
flesh from a man's arm in ten heartbeats, great rats the size of dogs who would
steal children from their cradles. They would eat all of us out of house and
home if not for our efforts. But we hunt far more than rats. Skrell, lurk in the
sewers, cunning and evil, their numbers steadily growing. There are things worse
than Skrell, but I will not speak their names, even by daylight. Ours is a
calling that takes strength, skill, and courage - I'd like to see a Knight crawl
through half a mile of filth and plunge into a Skrell den! Once you've walked in
the dark long enough, the lesser vermin of the sewers will come to know you, and
will fear and respect you. Folks what live in the sun don't understand us, they
never will, and they'll never thank us neither. It's no matter.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Time to bid the Sun goodbye, for my traps are waiting. Vermin, make ready! The
Brothers of Bardulph come for you!</font></p>
