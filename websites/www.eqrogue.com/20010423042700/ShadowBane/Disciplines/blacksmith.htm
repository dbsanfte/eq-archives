<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2">And the
Shaper laughed. &quot;I know little of food, child, but here I give you an
answer to your first question.&quot; With that he handed Golgrim a stone.<br>
<br>
&quot;What good is this?&quot; Golgrim asked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is called Iron, boy. Look around you - as water
turns to ice and twigs to trees, so too even stones can change, into new forms
wondrous and terrible. From iron will come claws for your people, and shells,
and tools against famine. You must learn how to craft them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know not the answer to this riddle.' Golgrim said, despairing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fear not, True Man!&quot; The Shaper said. &quot;My
children know, and will teach you. Seek them in the shadowy deeps.&quot; With
that, the silver handed stranger turned and walked away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so Golgrim wandered far, and crawled through many caverns
until he found the dwellings of the Stone Folk, and they did teach him the
virtues of Iron and of Steel. Golgrim returned at last to the daylight, and
brought this wisdom back to his people, and the Men of Ardan became
strong.&quot;<br>
- From the Chronicles of the Ardani&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Golgrim was the first learned the secret. Iron and steel are
born from the bones of the earth just as the Sons of Men were. As the All-Father
wrought the World in ages past, so the Blacksmith tinkers with the forces of
creation, and builds things of permanence. Men were made without wings, claws or
fangs, but tools of metal make the difference. Most think that swords and suits
of mail are the greatest of tools, and our most important works. This may be
true, but imagine our lives without nails to hold our houses together, without
iron cooking kettles or horseshoes or plow blades. We Blacksmiths not only make
weapons and armor, we also forge the things that hold our lives together.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good Blacksmith must be many men, all at once. He must have
the eye of an artist, and the steady hands of a sculptor. He must have an
alchemist's knowledge of the elements, of fire and metal, and how the two
mingle. Finally, he must have the strength and patience of a laborer, enduring
hours of toil and thousands of hammer swings to finish a single piece. Only a
fraction of a blacksmith's time is spent pounding metal; running a shop and
forge involves dozens of tasks, some hopelessly mundane. As an apprentice, you
will come to learn them all. Perhaps, in time, you will come to have a forge and
apprentices of your own. Watch in the meantime, and learn, and be careful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A busy forge is a dangerous place. Fires hot enough to melt
iron are kept close at hand, and sparks fly from the anvil. Acids and oils for
etching are also close by. And finally, the labor itself can be a hazard - a
moment's distraction while hammering will leave you with a broken thumb, or a
spark in your eyes. Touch the wrong end of the tongs or the wrong bar of iron
and you'll crisp your hand in a heartbeat. There are dozens of men lamed,
blinded, or scarred who thought they had a Blacksmith's concentration. Be
careful and you won't have to join them. A Blacksmith is no fair prince - we're
left black by smoke and coal, and we often shave our heads and beards - best not
to tempt a stray spark. We're strong from our labors, but raw strength isn't
necessary to master a forge. If you've the stamina of a mule and the patience of
a mountain, you'll do well. May it truly be so, for there have never been enough
master smiths.</font>
