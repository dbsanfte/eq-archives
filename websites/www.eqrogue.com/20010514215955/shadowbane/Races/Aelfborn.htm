breeds, the Aelfborn are the sterile offspring of Elf and Man. It was once said
that the offspring of man and elf were the vessels of chaos, creatures of spirit
rather than soul. For this reason, Aelfborn children are often marked with
protection runes to stave off the madness that is rumored to come from years of
exposure to human society. Aelfborn lack the immortality of both races -- they
age as men, yet can produce no offspring.</font>

The sterile offspring of Elf and Man, the Aelfborn are feared and distrusted by
the both of the races that sired them. Creatures of passion, Aelfborn are driven
to extremes of emotion and often are driven to madness by the imbalance in their
blood. In previous Ages it was believed that the offspring of Man and Elf were
the vessels of Chaos, creatures of spirit rather than soul, consumed by demons
of madness as they grow older. No sure cure for the Curse of the Aelfborn has
ever been found, but Aelfborn children are often marked with magical tattoos to
magically keep them sane. In the days since the Turning, unprecedented numbers
of Aelfborn are said to be gathering in the wilds, far from the eyes of Elves or
Men, to forge a new society of their own. Aelfborn lack the immortality of both
races -- they age as men, yet can produce no offspring.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The offspring of Men and Elves, Aelfborn (there are other names for them, but
few so kind) show a balanced blending of their parent's features. No matter the
stock of their Human parent, Aelfborn always have fair, pale golden skin,
although their hair is quite varied. The child's face also tends toward Elvish
features, although their eyes are not quite so large and their faces less sharp.
Their large ears are distinctly pointed. Aelfborn inherit an Elf's sharp eyes
and keen ears. If their faces favor the Elf blood in them, the bodies of the
Aelfborn are more Human. Aelfborn, though taller than most Men, are shorter than
Elves, and tend to be more muscular as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aelfborn are more agile and quicker of mind than Men, though
they fall short of an Elf's speed, grace, and reason. They also inherit the
strength of their Human parent, and are hardier than most Elves. While the
traits of an Aelfborn might seem an ideal blend of Human and Elf, their great
weakness lies in Spirit: the conflicting virtues of the Human and Elf blood
leave the Aelfborn with weaker Spirits than either Humans or Elves. Their mixed
blood gives rise to other flaws as well. Aelfborn inherit the mortality of their
Human parent, and actually live shorter lives than men due to some instability
in their blood (since the Turning this shortcoming has been eased somewhat).
Also, Aelfborn are incapable of siring or bearing children: like a mule bred
from a horse and donkey, these hybrids are sterile. Born of mortal enemies, Fate
denied the Aelfborn the immortality of either of their parents until the
Turning, when true death ceased altogether.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="2"><span class="content">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Aelfborn are not truly a race unto themselves, and as such have developed
little in the way of a unique culture, at least so far as the rest of the World
knows. Their infertility has ensured that there are no Aelfborn nations or
kingdoms, and the animosity between Elves and the Sons of Men has always kept
their numbers low. Rare in the extreme, most Aelfborn tend to be loners,
wondering from one place to the next, and only rarely finding a permanent home.
A Half Breed must chose the ways of one of his parents: thus, some live, dress,
and speak as Elves, while others take on the culture of Men. As many seem to
choose a Human life as an Elvish one, and each Aelfborn chooses for his own
reasons.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whichever parent a Half Breed emulates, Aelfborn tend to be
unanimously rejected both by Humans and Elves alike. Most Aelfborn are
automatically deemed illegitimate, and forced to live at the fringes of society.
Humans fear the touch of fey blood in the veins of the Aelfborn, while Elves
believe that the hybrids have been corrupted by the &quot;lesser&quot; blood of
Men. Rarely trusted and almost never befriended, most Aelfborn are outcasts, and
come to hate one side of their heritage for giving them birth at all. There are
some places in the World, however, where the lot of the Aelfborn is easier. The
Church of the All-Father has always been tolerant of all Aelfborn, especially
those who take up the cloth. Aelfborn are also drawn to the deeps of the wood,
where the Druids and Rangers welcome them into their ranks. The Amazons are
probably the most tolerant of all the people of the World when it comes to the
Aelfborn, and more than one Aelfborn Huntress has ruled as Queen of all Amazons.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reputation of the Aelfborn is hurt even further by the
Curse, which strikes many Half Breeds as soon as they reach adulthood. As an
Aelfborn grows older, they become subject to a strange, lingering madness that
strikes each Aelfborn differently. Some hear voices, while others are tormented
by hideous nightmares or waking visions. Many rock between violent rages and
fits of despair. No one can say with any certainty why those born of Men and
Elves should be so afflicted, but most Aelfborn battle the Curse all their
lives. Throughout the World, the parents of Aelfborn children have intricate
magical tattoos inscribed across their scalps and other places on their bodies
when they are born to keep the Curse at bay. Their effectiveness is uncertain,
but they look very striking, and many Aelfborn shave their heads to keep them
visible. Most Aelfborn try to bring peace and balance to their troubled souls by
taking professions which demand focus and calm - many have calmed their inner
demons by living the contemplative life of a Druid, tempering their focus as a
Warlock, or devoting themselves to the discipline of Blademastery.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The days since the Turning have been times of both hardship
and change for the Aelfborn of the World. It is widely believed that the Traitor
who dealt the Woeful Stroke was Aelfborn, a Half Breed turncloak who betrayed
his father's people, became one of Cambruin's Champions, but finally had not the
heart to destroy the Elvish Empire forever. The Traitor's deeds have brought
down the wrath of all the Men of the Petty Kingdoms on all Aelfborn, and the
Grand Inquisition Against the Misborn, pursued with fanatical precision by the
followers of the Cleansing Flame, will soon celebrate its one hundredth
anniversary. The Elves, for their part, have been no kinder to their wayward
children, and have shunned all Aelfborn since the Turning. In most lands,
Aelfborn try to hide their natures, for safe havens are few and far between. It
is hardly surprising, then, that bands of Aelfborn outcasts have begun
congregating in the wilds, forging new nations of their own. What will become of
them remains to be seen.</span></font></p>
