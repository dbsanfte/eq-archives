Zek Guild Charter</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Monotype Corsiva" size="5">So you want to join the
order&#133;.</font><font size="4" face="Monotype Corsiva">&nbsp; Think you have the
stomach for it? Anyone can be a petty thief or a thug for hire, but only a few can be a
rich thief and fewer have the stomach and talent to ever become a master assassin. So you
know how to sneak around maybe even hide in the shadows of an alley, but can you take what
you want without notice? Can you kill before the victim sees you or anyone else for that
matter? Sloppy rogues are short-lived ones, and what is worse is they can get other rogues
killed with their carelessness. Are you prepared to learn from the masters and teach your
skills to those who are less experienced than you? It is not as easy as it sounds. Are you
prepared to join up in arms with your fellow brethren of the shadows to make the big
score? Do you have the honor required among professional rogues? If you think you do, then
feel free to pull up a pillow and listen, learn and someday teach. However, know that
should we find out that you don&#146;t, well its better not to think of that.</font></p>

power leveling guild or even a grouping guild you are looking in the wrong place. We are a
group of rogues who place the rogue class above all else, seeing to it that questions
about the class, skills, tactics, etc. are answered in as efficient a matter as possible.
If you are looking to learn how to be a rogue and to be in the company of other rogues
then please read on, otherwise...move on.</font></p>
