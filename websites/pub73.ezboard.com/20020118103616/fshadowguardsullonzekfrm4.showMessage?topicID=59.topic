The Obsidian spires of the Shadow Keep rise off in the distance, surrounded by a dark aura.  Around it, a chasm swirling within a greyish mist that shreaks as it moves as if in pain.  A single figure stands out on the opposite side of the bridge heading toward the keep.<br>
<br>
Brown skin, the true color hidden by dirt caked upon the surface.  Shoulder length brown hair locked and unkept, twigs protruding about randomly, his face hidden behind it all.  By his slender figure and pointed features it is clear he is of elven descent.  Armored by furs and unkept tanned wolf-hide.  In his right hand he tightly grips an old axe stained with blood.  He weilds a leather shield in his left hand, which is battered from previous battles.  Ducas' eyes are glazed over with rage, tempered with hate.<br>
<br>
Ducas walks weary of his surroundings across the bridge, steadying himself against the howling 'wind'.  As he nears the Keep, the shrieks increase in volume, and seam to swirl about him.  The elf falls to his knees as visions flood his mind.<br>
<br>
Darkness...   Followed by screams of agony of a soul that gave up long ago but has no release.  Sorrow, the very essence of the emotion seems to fill Ducas' very being, his body begins to quiver and tremble on the cold stone bridge.  Pain, loss and defeat strike next as Ducas pictures the helpless murdered and risen from death to destroy their loved ones.  All the feelings of the souls that shriek about this bridge, all their agony and torment that they cannot rest enters his mind at once, his body still shuttering and convulsing.  And as quickly as these torments came, they stop, leaving an impression upon his mind.<br>
<br>
Ducas staggers as he begins standing slowly, gathering composure only to look up to a frightening being...  Greenish skin and standing nearly twice his height... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000033><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ubazban.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bazban</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/skull15-2.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadow Guard</span><br> <font color=#ffffcc>(8/6/01 10:13:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=59.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/Troll.jpg border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Entering the Keep, the hard way</span><hr size=1> Something in Nektulos stank.  Bazban was sure some enemy was afoot, but stood fast at his post, above the single entryway into Shadow Keep.  A pecular alcove which seemed to have had the shadow bent around it, concealing it to any onlooker, and accessable only by a single flight of stairs which were hidden behind an illusionary wall in the gateroom below.  He enjoyed overseeing this post, with the company of the abyss below, and the solitude and time to dwell upon each days passing, all was endlessly discomforting; always much enjoyed.  Still, this disturbance, he hoped, would prove an amusing diversion from the tormenting wails, from outside and within.<br>
<br>
Time passed slowly, while Bazban's grotesque nose did his work.  Following shifts of the wind... the real wind... combined with the potency of the stink, he came to a revalation.  This Elf was inbound to the Keep!  A dark grin and moaning growl of coming satisfaction passed the Troll's maw for a short moment, until his eye caught movement in the distance.  It had moved quickly!  Bazban was struck thoughtless seeing the little figure move hastily toward the Keep, onto the bridge, and toward the gates!  "Unfullfilling prey... but one fewer druid!" Bazban muttered, noting the Elf's unfit hide armor and recognizing the stench of woodland filth.  Bazban lurched quickly down onto the lower level, the Ogreish knight he posted there snoring as usual; tonight he woke to a plated fist across the face and Bazban's wretched scowl.  "Raise the abyss, if you call yourself a dread knight!", Bazban snarled, and the Ogre quickly began chanting the once familiar incantation, and Bazban bounded again up the stair, and out to his overlook... just in time to see the pathetic Elf buckle under the darkness welling up from below, the cascading again down upon him.  He paused for a moment to enjoy the sight, knowing that would seal this intruder's fate, but first he would ensure that the Elf knew it as well.<br>
<br>
Seeing the relatively tiny figure trying to regain it's composure, Bazban waited just an instant, so as to allow the Elf to see him leaping from the shadows above.  Seeing this was surely horrifying, and the victim had to be given the chance to see it, and their impending doom, for this child of Cazic to be satisfied with giving an enemy death.  The Trollish knight landed feet from the Elf, with a mind shattering crash of metal plate and chain, and bent his naturally contorted face into what he imagined was even more dreadful.  Alas, through his squinted eyelids, he saw the Elf paid no heed!  Emitting a gutteral growl which quickly became harmonic to the increasing wails of the abyss flowing all around them both, again Bazban halted a moment, awaiting... needing... a reaction!  The filth covered hands of the Elf broke away from it's even more dirtied face.  Bazban's eyes widened, awaiting the glee of seeing the horror of his presense at work.  Upon seeing the eyes of his prey, he held out no more hope of furthering this lesson in fear.  In those eyes shown nothing but madness, often a the final breaking point of one who is exposed to the realities of Thule, a breaking point he had passed himself a time or twenty.  There was no more hope to be had of terrorizing this Elf, and Bazban's entertainment was over before he felt he had even begun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#330000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ubazban.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bazban</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/skull15-2.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadow Guard</span><br> <font color=#ffffcc>(8/6/01 10:25:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=59.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/Troll.jpg border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Entering the Keep, by whose will?</span><hr size=1> Relaxing his face, posture, and conniving heart; he snatched the Elf by the arm... or would have, had it not quickly dodged his grasp!  "Ah!!  So the body's instinct has outlived the mind's!" Bazban laughed, as he watched the frail Elf be knocked again to the stone bridge by the swirling abyss.  He heard the prey utter some nonsenseical word, before he lunged toward it again.  The Elf again quickly lept back, now so close to the edge that Bazban had hoped he would overpass, but instead landed gracefully, inches from certain doom.  Fortunately for the Troll the doom of the Shadow Keep was mobile, and once again tore down upon the maddened and bewildered Elf, this time knocking him into the claws of the Troll.  Seizing the lightweight Elf by the throat, Bazban lifted the creature up to and above his head, then out above the chaotic abyss, still swirling wildly out of control.  "What on Norrath do you think you're doing here, little Elf!?"<br>
<br>
"N`dek clausse vhuss sumbre," replied the mad Elf.  Bazban guessed that the tounge was Elven, knowing that the Tier'Dal language had some similar sounds, which would explain the familiarity of some sounds and intonations.<br>
<br>
A hint of menace crossed the Troll's face, and he wheeled around with the Elf in claw, slamming it to the stone behind him.  He then said in the language he so hated, "Sed whut yew tinkun commun heer, Elf!?"<br>
<br>
"Saggas noos!" the Elf choked out, and his crazed eyes made it clear this was going nowhere.<br>
<br>
"I shur we kin find a trunslaaa... traansszuul... langige speekur fer yew, Elf.  Mak yer brokkin mind keep yer tounge loose!" Bazban boldly exclaimed, hoping the thing could at least understand the common Human words.  Dragging the Elf toward the Keep's gate, he slammed hard upon it once to have it raised, and stole a glace at the creature he dragged behind him, which hardly seemed to struggle, save to keep up and half on it's own feet.  Bazban had hoped to see some sign of the Elf's understanding, and dread, of what was to come, he instead saw something most disturbing.  Under the dirt, under the incomprehension, under the madness; the Elf shown a smile upon entering the Shadow Keep. <p><i>Behold the face of fear...<br><br>
