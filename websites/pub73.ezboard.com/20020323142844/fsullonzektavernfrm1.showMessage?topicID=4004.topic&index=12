Gayrage does not = WhooDatt</span><hr size=1> You're my hero Aoii. Someone that can respect other people and keep confidential shit just that. WTF happened to you? You seemed like a decent guy ealier in the server. Did DB truely make you this way, or were you always an asshole just waiting to bloom?<br>
<br>
I am Gayrage. I thought I would add some tongue in cheek humor to this board, which at times so desperately needed some. I would do some by poking some fun at my favorite person to tease on SZ, Grunter. <br>
<br>
WhooDatt happens to be someone I have met in the last few weeks and work with at division. He is an EQ player who doesn't have any SZ experience other than talking to me and looking over my shoulder. He found some people here on the boards to be really amusing, and thought he would make a screenname and get to meet a few, Toab in particular. So he has used my laptop while I am on duty, and has enjoyed himself<br>
<br>
So, if you are so offended by Gayrage's &quot;23429&quot; posts, blame me, not WhooDatt. He may be guilty of trolling, but not of being Gayrage. Oh btw, Gayrage made exactly 4 posts. At least you had one of the digits right, ya over reacting childish ass.<br>
<br>
Aoii, for all the people on this board that have made second, even 3rd and 4th account screen names, you have to break confidentiality with the one making fun of your Guild leader? Good thing you stayed impartial and unbias'd, huh?<br>
This server and board will apparently be much better off without you. Good luck in your RL pursuits, enjoy, you won't be missed here.<br>
<br>
I hope the new admins will at least show some maturity and tact when handling such things.<br>
<br>
What are the rules for easy board? Is this breaking administrator privledges and power? I really don't know, as I never had a reason to learn them before. <br>

I can't remember the last time you said anything positive on these boards, about anything that did not serve your own interest. Sad really. Bye<br>

If you think for a second (and you obviously do) that i care more than a passing glance what your posts say (gayrage or not) you are delusional.<br>
<br>
Throughout my life i have had people such as yourself seek out my attention.  You are merely another one.  <br>
<br>
I am sorta like the lottery to people like you.  People who play the lottery buy their tickets mostly for the dream and fantasy of what they will buy if they win.  They have VERY little chance of actually winning...so if the lottery actually had some sort of intellect as a living thing it would not even notice single pathetic losers who play and dream of winning.<br>
<br>
I am the lottery...who fails to notice u...and you are the loser who keeps trying to win me...but has no chance, because you are mearly one in a million losers who seek my attention.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your brief moments of conversation with such as I...it will always be your only only chance of speaking to someone far greater than yourself.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, if you are wondering why I even bother to reply to such as yourself, it's because i am bored while being driven home and it makes the time pass.  I get enjoyment out of reading such worship as little peasants like yourself show me.   Feel free to continue....I will reply when i feel like it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umarqussz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marqus SZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/01 2:44:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4004.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No, no it's not.

Gray, *that* is the reason you have posts written about you, and will continue to. Not a single person on this server worships you, lol.<br>
<br>
You are a joke. The reason being is that you really believe the stuff you write. You get so much attention because I am lazy, and don't want to put the effort into a real challenge, searching for some worthy. If I had more free time on my hands, maybe I would. You are just simply the easiest target I have ever encountered in on line gaming. <br>
<br>
*note* &quot;being driven home'?  I didn't think the lil yellow bus ran on saturdays... your therapy must be more rigorous than I imagined.  /comfort<br>
<br>
Marqus, always a grin. yeah, ya did make me smile.<br>
<br>
Vigg, did you mean *I* was over reacting? I was trying to do the right thing, and stepped forward to protect someone that had a finger pointed at them injustly. I suppose I could have just ignored it and let Whoo take the heat, no one would have known the difference. I'm not like that tho. <br>
I suppose I could have translated into NBH speak, but shouting things like &quot;cum guzzling, ass sucker&quot; is more along your lines. That's not a slam, to each there own.  I just find it a bit humorous for one like you to leave NBH and come out here and act all offended and shocked.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't even particularly like DB, but I would rather have 50 DB than one bitter bitch. You might claim whatever you want, but it is customary that people that try to impersonate other posters on messageboards are revealed for who they really are. I can't even begin to fathom how you thought you would be any different.<br>
<br>
Have you ever heard of the term 'trolling'? Go look it up, because that's exactly what you were doing and it just gets very annoying after a while. It's sad that you have to resort to impersination and spreading false information to manipulate public opinion when people just don't cared no matter how much you complained. Don't give me that trash about 'joke' either, you have done it multiple times and there has never been anything remotely humoristic about it, you just keep badmouthing them. <br>
<br>
Fucking pathetic if you ask me, you have whined about DB and posed 'innocent' leading questions ever since you got here. Why so bitter, have they touched your life so deeply that you must spend all your days posting hateful messages? The joke isn't on them you know, because they don't care, it's on you.<br>
<br>
You bluffed and got called on it, accept it and move on. Personally I would have banned you, because your sole purpose on this board is to stir up some flamewars against DB and the other 'evil griefers'. <p><b>Velox Argentum</b><BR>

Whatever. Someone from your boards was mocking someone else from your boards. Have a fucking aneurism over it. What she did was OBVIOUSLY much worse than the bullshit posted everyday, huh?<br>
<br>
Ya know what, it's funny as hell. I bet groaners boys were laughing their asses off too. Some anyways. So take the butt plug out, loosen up, and get with the program shitstain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=chowder>Chowder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/01 11:46:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4004.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/Subrime/fullsize/Hedy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No, no it's not.

Your words sting. I am crying on the inside. Seriously. The fact that you think I have a penis burns me on the inside and brings forth an urge deep inside of me! An urge that says &quot;Kill yourself! An anonymous cocksucker has figured your ploy out! Jump, before it's too late.<br>

You honestly shouldn't call anyone a troll. Wait, you don't even play on the fucking server, do you? No, so shut the fuck up and take your myopic opinions back to a blue server.

I would usually have dignified you with a proper flame at this point, but seeing as yours was so pitiful I think it speaks for itself. Work on that creativity.<br>
<br>
Now, as for your (false) claims, where did I say that I &quot;found it out&quot;, were did I claim 'we' anything? I just wanted made it clear that the reason I asked for her personal info to be revealed wasn't because of any bias towards DB, it was because she was being fucking annoying. The only people that would still think it fun at this point are just more bitter mindless people.<br>
<br>
If anybody is throwing a fit about this it is you two, maybe you should take a step back and think about it before mindlessly trying to protect your whiny bitch? <p><b>Velox Argentum</b><BR>

You, Mrs IT, are a troll wannabe. You may develope intelligent banter at somepoint in your life. Upgrade yourself to calvin and hobbes books and you will be on your way to articulate communication. <br>

Now, fuktard ( &lt;--- has already read the whole Calvin series), if you somehow have deluded your constipated self into thinking that these boards are SZ exclusive topics, please go stick your dick in a queasenart.  <br>

Really, the entire mangina theme is overplayed. You should try something original.<br>
<br>
As for you posting on the messageboard, my point was that this revolves around a Sullon Zek issue. Guess what? You know <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> jack shit</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about it, so you can take your second-hand bullshit, and you can walk back to your gay server, or Dark Age of Care-A-Lot.. wherever the fuck your gimp ass plays, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> shut the fuck up</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. By the way, dissing the server on it's messageboard isn't a good way to get public support. It's a way to get more people reaming your abused, swolen, anus.

HEY, BOARD OWNER, Velox is being annoying, please post all his info here about him. Start with name and address.<br>
<br>
How long has this board been up?<br>
<br>
How many &quot;annoying&quot; posts have there been?<br>
<br>
How many people have had their info posted? incorrectly I might add.<br>
<br>
<br>
*I* had nothin to do with your fucking Dark guild bashing. I would love to, thay sound like pricks, you included.  <br>
Fact of the matter is, what Kiana did was goddamn funny. You find it annoying. Big fucking deal. Write a reply, flame her, or go cry about it. None of that matters.<br>
<br>
Board owner guy stepped way over his boundry. It wasn't 'net info' lurking out there insecure that someone hacked, it was info devulged to the privledges of the tavern owner. On some network sites that constitutes a violation of privacy and is a legal offense. I have no idea about sleazyboard's policy.<br>
<br>
So, how about you take your own advice peguin fucker, and step back and look at the big picture... not just that 'you were annoyed at a post'.... fucking christ that is weak. This whole goddamn site is 90% annoying, you included hemroid boy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=chowder>Chowder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/7/01 12:20:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4004.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/Subrime/fullsize/Hedy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No, no it's not.
