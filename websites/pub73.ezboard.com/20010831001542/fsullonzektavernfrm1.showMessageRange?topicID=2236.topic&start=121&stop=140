As far as rules go on this server, there's really only one rule, the LAW OF THE JUNGLE, survival of the fittest.  Any tactic short of changing the game code is valid as far as I'm concerned.   As for experience loss as a result of PvP, I treat every PvP encounter as if I was fighting a mob.  If it's red and hostile I go the other way.  If it's white and hostile, I think about my chances.  If it's green and hostile, I crush it like an annoying bug.  Any questions?<br>
If someone uses this tactic on me, fine.  I'll just get someone even higher to beat that red unconscious then I'll come in and poke him to death.<br>

That would clear up both types of tactics of either weakening or just rooting/slowing.<br>
I'm a warrior and with Those tactics I'm just screwed, and it's happened.<br>
As far as exp loss i agree, I've been less than 1 bub from 29 three times, and after the last raid which the newts CC'd I now have to start again from 1 bub. So far it's something we have to deal with, but it gets old real quick.<br>

<br>
This is a lame tactic.  Perhaps I am a tad bitter because it was pulled on me today.  2 40+ and a 21 Iskar Pk'd in EF.  The 40's would weaken you, and the 21 would kill and loot.<br>
Oh well, that's the law of this server for right now.<br>
<br>
For all the Evil members who are adamant about the &quot;no rules&quot; aspect, and &quot;it's a red server so deal with it&quot;, let me ask one question.<br>
<br>
How is this tactic any less an exploit than a Level 5 Bard training SG's around the Oasis?  Can we, the ganked, do anything about it?  Not really.  Is there a PvP solution to the problem?  Not when the 21 is whisked out of the zone once we figured out who to target in the group.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if we whine enough, they will come up with a solution to our problem as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uviktrol.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Viktrol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/01 4:20:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting a high level to weaken, and then a lower level k</span><hr size=1> See the difference is a lvl 5 bard cant be touched in anyway pvp wise, at the time at least. <br>

Yet more deaths to the Red-White combo from Evil in EF last night.  I think 5 out of 6 died in our group which were recuperating from a fight...   But that's not what killed us.  1 nuke (only 1) did about 350-400 Dmg while I was medding...  Before I could do anything (running came through my mind).. I get killed.<br>
<br>
Well, a 45+ Ogre and another Deep red Evil were cutting us down to peaces and Deakil picked us up for our money and coins...<br>
<br>
Well, we weren't angry about our deaths...   We weren't angry about our money...  We really weren't angry about the Red/White tactic...  But the Exp loss using this Tactic is getting a bit much.  If anything I'd like to see fix, is the Exp loss from those tactics...  I don't care for losing money, or dying...  but if a Red does 90% of the damage, I would like to see the Exp loss to be cancelled.<br>
<br>
Well... the way Verant has been listening on what's happening on SZ...  Tough chance of this ever happening.  Oh well... <p><b>Diako Kronanta<br>

<br>
&lt;Heres my take. When verent set up the no level limit to kill someone server(this is the biggest diffrence from other zeks), i thought it would either be the biggest griefer server or one of the best teamwork servers.<br>
So far its a little bit of both. I am mostly a blue player who has tried rallos a bit now and then. I thought the Race war servers sounded gay, yet i liked the idea of diety war server.<br>
<br>
Oh well, maybe i would like a diety war server with the tallon ruleset. I like the fact that red cons can kill you because it makes real zonecontrol possible. However i just relized that will probably have to join a bigger guild to enjoy the game better at higher levels. Small guilds won't cut it at high levels.<br>
Probably most will merge as the see how difficult it is.<br>
<br>
The other problem is i take leveling a leisurely pace and that does hinder you. I promised my self i would suck up the red con kills, and the even con kills. However the popular teaming of red con/even con xp loss pking is getting annoying.<br>
<br>
Read my lips: i am not saying anything is wrong with it, its strategy. I just saw it hapening more as a method of zone control. Mostly its a method of hit and run point farming.<br>
Look at all the best pkers, they hit a zone kill one or two peeps then leave, next zone pls. This is not zone control.<br>
Ok it might be population control, you know the drill. Keep the other team from leveling, make someone quit. Ok i'l give you that one. Basically it's a rough team servver that is very fun and rewarding , but can quickly turn into hell!<br>
<br>
<br>
I would still love the day when they made a level restricted server where we can all concentrate on PvP.<br>
Already listed those ideas elswhere so i'll shut up now&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey i am starting to think that mabe they should get rid of the  Xp loss.<br>
Remember they will still have the most important aspects of sullon still here, the fact that any level can kill any level, which means real zone control. An you will stil have insignias and points. People will still suffer some. I mean the coin loss, corpse camping and the fact that i lost points insignias are enough for me.<br>
Remember verent really did not want people to lose xp from someone higher then them, of course players found a wqay around this and wether you think its good strategy or not it really sucks when it happens to much. <p><IMG SRC ="http://ravagers.50megs.com/images/sigbanner.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umalkar25.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malkar25</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/01 10:55:12 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting a high level to weaken, and then a lower level k</span><hr size=1> Getting rid of exp loss is the worst damn idea I have heard yet.

She's also an Agent...  and I do Photography on the side to help on the cost.   Her agency's name is called Inner Reflection Model &amp; Agent.  <br>

Me, Bull shitting...  hehe...  My Real life is way too good to start doing that... but hey, I don't give a rats ass what most Losers on this site think.  I'm coming on EQ to have fun, most of them can't stand their Real Life and come here to make all others suffer...  hehe  Hey, whatever makes those loser's have fun...   Complaining about the Lame Red-White tactic isn't a whine, it is an issue...  Evil/Newt don't see it anywhere near as often as Good sees it.  So they puff their chest and think they're all that...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Losers<br>

God if feels good to see losers making themselves look stupid... and others ganking me... knowing fair well, that I got nothing to worry when I get out of EQ.  I got a life... or I'd be 50 by now...   Hehe I'm half way there with the little time I've got...  And still got someone to go to when I'm done...   Gotta feel sad for the losers in here that can only trash talk...   hope you get out of that pit hole you're in and start seeing what RL is all about.  :roll <p><b>Diako Kronanta<br>
