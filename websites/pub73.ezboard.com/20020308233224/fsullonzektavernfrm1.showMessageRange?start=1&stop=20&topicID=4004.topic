<br>
DB had a meeting and talks things over tonight. We made such GOOD friends with so MANY of the TDC peeps, that we think we are going to follow them to DaoC. It has NOTHING to do with lack of remaining newt power, so I don't EVEN wanna hear that shit.<br>
<br>
We made some new friends here on SZ and hopefully we will get the chance to kill you again in DaoC  /hehe<br>
<br>
So, like has been said someplace else, another thread, the medals for teams on SZ..  the evils I guess get the gold for PvE.. Ruin did do alot in that area.. they was/is too poosae to come look for us for a fight /grin<br>
<br>
For pvp and points and such, all other remaining areas, newts kicked ass all the way around. Less people and more points. don't take a genus to figure it out. DB really dominated, along with TDC and Inkara brining up a close second. <br>
<br>
I.E., althought they tried to compete with us, they never manged to do what we did: dominate PVP. If they woulda cut that fat Nafgar out maybe they would have done better, hehe.<br>
<br>
So, DB gonna go to DaoC. You all can finally BREATHE a sigh of relief. You don't have to log on and be SCARED everyday. /grin.  DB would stay and keep up 0wnzing SZ, but EQ kinda sux0rs next to DAOC.  <br>

<br>
A GM showed up and inspected this supposed &quot;bug.&quot;<br>
<br>
Guess how many warnings were handed out?<br>
<br>
If you selected the square marked, &quot;Morons, apply he-,&quot; err, I mean, &quot;0,&quot; you are correct!<br>
<br>
Tell me now, if performing a worthwhile quest multiple times is such a grievous exploit of Everquest's system, why did the GM just show up and effectively say, &quot;Now now, no more of that.  Run along and play our hack n' slash,&quot; as opposed to handing out warnings to all those ub3r r33t b@st@rd 3xpl0iters?<br>

You seemed like a decent guy ealier in the server. Did DB truely make you this way, or were you always an asshole just waiting to bloom?<br>
<br>
I am Gayrage. I thought I would add some tongue in cheek humor to this board, which at times so desperately needed some. I would do some by poking some fun at my favorite person to tease on SZ, Grunter. <br>
<br>
WhooDatt happens to be someone I have met in the last few weeks and work with at division. He is an EQ player who doesn't have any SZ experience other than talking to me and looking over my shoulder. He found some people here on the boards to be really amusing, and thought he would make a screenname and get to meet a few, Toab in particular. So he has used my laptop while I am on duty, and has enjoyed himself<br>
<br>
So, if you are so offended by Gayrage's &quot;23429&quot; posts, blame me, not WhooDatt. He may be guilty of trolling, but not of being Gayrage. Oh btw, Gayrage made exactly 4 posts. At least you had one of the digits right, ya over reacting childish ass.<br>
<br>
Aoii, for all the people on this board that have made second, even 3rd and 4th account screen names, you have to break confidentiality with the one making fun of your Guild leader? Good thing you stayed impartial and unbias'd, huh?<br>
This server and board will apparently be much better off without you. Good luck in your RL pursuits, enjoy, you won't be missed here.<br>
<br>
I hope the new admins will at least show some maturity and tact when handling such things.<br>
<br>
What are the rules for easy board? Is this breaking administrator privledges and power? I really don't know, as I never had a reason to learn them before. <br>

If you think for a second (and you obviously do) that i care more than a passing glance what your posts say (gayrage or not) you are delusional.<br>
<br>
Throughout my life i have had people such as yourself seek out my attention.  You are merely another one.  <br>
<br>
I am sorta like the lottery to people like you.  People who play the lottery buy their tickets mostly for the dream and fantasy of what they will buy if they win.  They have VERY little chance of actually winning...so if the lottery actually had some sort of intellect as a living thing it would not even notice single pathetic losers who play and dream of winning.<br>
<br>
I am the lottery...who fails to notice u...and you are the loser who keeps trying to win me...but has no chance, because you are mearly one in a million losers who seek my attention.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your brief moments of conversation with such as I...it will always be your only only chance of speaking to someone far greater than yourself.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, if you are wondering why I even bother to reply to such as yourself, it's because i am bored while being driven home and it makes the time pass.  I get enjoyment out of reading such worship as little peasants like yourself show me.   Feel free to continue....I will reply when i feel like it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umarqussz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marqus SZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/01 2:44:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4004.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No, no it's not.

Gray, *that* is the reason you have posts written about you, and will continue to. Not a single person on this server worships you, lol.<br>
<br>
You are a joke. The reason being is that you really believe the stuff you write. You get so much attention because I am lazy, and don't want to put the effort into a real challenge, searching for some worthy. If I had more free time on my hands, maybe I would. You are just simply the easiest target I have ever encountered in on line gaming. <br>
<br>
*note* &quot;being driven home'?  I didn't think the lil yellow bus ran on saturdays... your therapy must be more rigorous than I imagined.  /comfort<br>
<br>
Marqus, always a grin. yeah, ya did make me smile.<br>
<br>
Vigg, did you mean *I* was over reacting? I was trying to do the right thing, and stepped forward to protect someone that had a finger pointed at them injustly. I suppose I could have just ignored it and let Whoo take the heat, no one would have known the difference. I'm not like that tho. <br>
I suppose I could have translated into NBH speak, but shouting things like &quot;cum guzzling, ass sucker&quot; is more along your lines. That's not a slam, to each there own.  I just find it a bit humorous for one like you to leave NBH and come out here and act all offended and shocked.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, that's all for me on this. I be checking in as often as I can, assured that the board is in better hands and it can only improve. I wish Toten and Carn the best of luck and success.<br>
