<br>
        A sweet tenor voice lifts as the sun slowly sinks into the night. A voice filled with emotions, she loses herself in the song, unaware as a Visitor listens on..<br>
<br>
Cool breeze and autumn leaves, slow motion daylight<br>
A loan pair of watchful eyes oversee the living<br>
Fell the presence all around<br>
The tortured soul, a wound unhealing<br>
No regrets or promises, the past is gone<br>
But you can still be free………..<br>
If time will set you free………..<br>
Time now to spread your wings<br>
To take to flight the life endeavored<br>
Aim for the burning sun, you’re trapped inside<br>
But you can still be free……….<br>
If time will set you free……….<br>
But it’s a long long way to go<br>
Keep moving way up high, you see the light, it shines forever<br>
Sail through the crimson skies, the purest light<br>
The light that sets you free………..<br>
If time will set you free………<br>
Sail through the wind and rain tonight, you’re free to fly tonight<br>
You can still be free……….<br>
If time will set you free………<br>
And go high up on the mountaintop<br>
And go high like the wind don’t stop<br>
And go high……..<br>
Free to fly tonight………<br>
Free to fly tonight……..<br>
<br>
<br>
        The Visitor shields himself well; his emotions that the child unlocked kept in check.  He begins to leave, his presence never felt by the young girl.  She turns, looking for a presence felt perhaps, but not seen.  Her eyes catch the dying light, mesmerizing the Visitor… He reads her soul in her eyes….<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
         The High Assassin stood in the deep shadows, watching the child and the Visitor unnoticed.  Blue eye's peirced the gloom of night. &quot;And so this is how it begins.&quot; Whispered the Assassin softly.  <br>
<br>
          With the grace of an agile cat, the High Assassin crept away....<br>

Seeing, and feeling that no one was around, she closed her eyes, and stepped forward….<br>
<br>
        When she opened her eyes she was no longer in Neriak, she was in the home of the gods.  He sat upon a blackened throne, idly toying with a trapped soul.  She shook her head softly, such a child He was.  <br>
<br>
        “It is done.” Was all the child said. <br>
<br>
        He looked up from his amusement noticing the child. “Does he suspect?”  The imminence voice flowed through her.  <br>
<br>
        “He does not.”  She replied.  <br>
<br>
        “Good..” He purred, rubbing his hands together in pleasure.  “Will I succeed?” He wondered out loud. <br>
<br>
        “No, he will see through you like glass… but I expect it will be great fun to watch.”  She smiled at the God seated before her.  <br>
<br>
        “Child! If I did not need you I would destroy you!”  He bellowed at her, sending spirits to torment her and winds to chill her.<br>
<br>
        “But you DO need me… and I need you.. such a pleasant relationship isn’t it?”  She replied smugly.  “Don’t you think it’s about time I grew up? I do have to work with these people you know…  and being in a child’s body is most uncomfortable after a century or so.”  <br>
<br>
        “So be it.” Declared the God, and as he laid his hand upon her head her form changed…  Instead of the child, she now was a young woman, full in her beauty and youth.  Her glowing eyes and gleaming hair were the same, she was tall for a woman and her lithe limbs were long and supple.  She stood glancing at her body.<br>
<br>
        “That will do.  I better get back… and join the other Shadow Guardians.”  She turned to leave, hesitating.  “When this is all over, will you destroy me? Or allow me live?”  She asked boldly.<br>
<br>
        “I have not decided yet…” Was his flippant reply.<br>
<br>
        “Gods!” She sighed under her breath, then closing her eyes, she stepped forward.  When she opened them again, she was back in Neriak.  It was time to find her family…<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
          By chance the High Assassin was nearby, when again the strange child came into sight.  She was peering into the shadows, looking for any persons who might see her.  The High Assassin smiled softly, she could not see the Assassin. <br>
<br>
         But even the composure of the High Assassin was shaken when in a moments time, the child dissappeared, and in her place stood a stunning woman.  The Assassin had been trained to notice things and people, the Assassin knew that the woman who stood there, was the same child who was there but moments before.... This needed to be reported... <br>

     She wandered the streets, looking for those she knew were here.. The Shadow Guards.  She had seen Ninnin once in the streets, he smelled of sulfur and other acrid chemicals, and the brief moment she delved into his thoughts were enough to drive her to her knees.  Most of it was incoherent; pain, death, laughter… other horrid images.. but most prominent was fire..  his mind shrieked out in agony and the smell of burning flesh and hair. Cherrish backed away from him, not risking her sanity to listen anymore. <br>
<br>
     She had also seen Krintek, his great robes were fancy and set him apart from all.  He seemed to carry with him a dark aura wherever he went.  It was unusual….  He was a mystery she would later unravel.<br>
<br>
      She saw another member of the great Order making his way from a small shop.  He was mumbling something about jasper, no, now it was onyx… he was confused.. and it had to do with some magic.  She decided to approach him.<br>
<br>
      She had stepped out from the alley and directly in his path, when he showed no signs of slowing or even acknowledging her presence she spoke. “A friend said you would help me.”<br>
<br>
      The young man started, not realizing anyone was near.  His eyes fell on the beautiful young woman in front of him, her glowing green eyes were amazing. She held out in her palm Lord Maugrim’s House Symbol.  His surprise showed on his youthful face.<br>
<br>
       “How.. How did you get that?” He asked her. “No, nevermind, I probably don’t want to know.”  He smiled at her. “Follow me, I can show you people who can help, whatever your needs.”  And he started back the way he came.  <br>
<br>
        He led her down streets and through crowds of people to a small room in the back of an Inn.  There was Ninnin, the befuddled wizard. His eyes were dark and far away, she avoided sending her thoughts his way… least she be drawn into the fire again. Krintek she had seen before, but was cautious of approaching him, he had either been taught or was just a natural at shielding his thoughts.  A fellow Priest she had seen in her training sat in the corner.<br>
<br>
        “Hail brothers!  I found this woman in the street, she says she needs help.”  Said the young man, then promptly began casting a spell and reaching for a pouch at his side.<br>
<br>
        “And what, pray tell, makes you think we would help a foundling like yourself?” Asked Krintek in a superior voice.<br>
<br>
        Cherrish had feared this moment, she hated this awkward stage.  She carefully pulled out her broach that the Stranger had given her.  She held it in her palm so all in the room could see.  “Because a friend said you would.” Was all she said.<br>
<br>
        Krintek’s eyes widened in surprise, and Ninnin whistled softly.  “So, you’ve seen Maugrim? And he vouches for you.  You are correct, we will help you. Come child, let us teach you some skills.”<br>
<br>
        And so began her friendship with the three.  Ninnin, though absentminded at times had the humor of the three, Krintek was the elder in all things it seemed, and Mezz, the young man who brought her to them was just like her, learning all he could and training as much as he could at this point.  They all awaited the return of Maugrim.  They introduced her to the others in the Shadow Guard; a woman was in and out of the back room where training was held.  She was a silent, soft-spoken woman, who was hardened by battle and knowledgeable of the unpleasant side of town. Though her name was never given, Cherrish enjoyed her company, being the only other woman around.  They introduced her to Umbrac, a great Troll who’s calling was a Shaman. She immediately felt a friendship with the great brute.  He moderated his boisterous voice in her presence and tried to help her in any way he could. She was making friends... and learning...<br>

      Cherrish was struggling with a bundle over her shoulder towards the Guildhouse, panting and sweating all the way.  Earlier she had found a foolish woodelf bard singing by the dark forest surrounding Neriak.  She had sent her magic into her, stunning her momentarily, giving her enough time to pull the stave from its common place: strapped across her back.  One good rap behind the ear and the Elf lay unconscious.  She wrapped up the Elf in her bedroll and dragged, carried and yes rolled the heavy burden towards home.  <br>
She lied to the guards at the front gate saying it was a new rug for the Guildhouse.<br>
<br>
     “I don’t know, maybe we should see if they are expecting you..” Said the guard, not wanting to get in trouble.<br>
<br>
     “That’s up to you, but I wouldn’t want to disturb the Shadow Guard if I didn’t have to..”  Replied Cherrish, knowing that the guard would fear the wrath of the Guard.<br>
<br>
     “Carry on!” He commanded hurriedly.  Cherrish nodded, hiding her smile as she lifted her heavy burden.<br>
<br>
     She finally got the Elf up to her small room, using the ropes she tied the Elves hands and feet to the bedposts and she ripped a length of cloth from a blanket, making an impromptu gag.  She closed the door and ran down the hall to her friend’s room.  Without even bothering to knock she bounced in. There in deep concentration was Mezz, studying the latest in his crafting. She was careful to wait until he was no longer in his studies; she had made that mistake once and watched as his precious silver bars had crumbled because she had interrupted his spell.  When Mezz looked up at her, she smiled. <br>
<br>
     “I have a present for you Mezz!”  She said not even bothering to contain her glee.    <br>
<br>
     “What is it Cherrish, its late and I have an early class tomorrow.”  He replied tiredly. <br>
<br>
     “Bah, follow me.. it's worth it!”  And she rushed over and grabbed his hand, pulling him to his feet and out the door.<br>
<br>
     “Close your eyes.” She commanded wickedly.  He sighed but did as he was told, knowing that she could get finicky if not amused when she was in this mood.  She opened the door, and led him into the room, closing the door behind him.<br>
<br>
     “Ok open them!” She said with humor tingeing her musical voice.  And there, bound and helpless was the Feir’dal she had captured.  She was awake now, and her big doe eyes were filled with fear and tears.  Cherrish chuckled evilly. <br>
<br>
     “I thought that you could use her to get a jump on that nasty old professor of yours, show him that you could learn faster than those other fussy students.  She can be your model for an illusion.” She hesitated, “Aren’t you happy Mezz?”<br>
<br>
     Mezz stood there shocked that she actually got the Feir’dal into the Guildhouse unchallenged. Then again, Cherrish did things a little odd all the time.  He shook his head in wonder.<br>
<br>
     “No, no, I’m very happy Cherrish… just a little stunned is all… I could use her to form my illusion, it won’t take very long at all, I mastered human in an hour.  But what are we going to do with her when I’m done?” He asked his friend.<br>
<br>
     “Well, we could kill her… or let her go…” She smiled mischievously.  “Or we could give her to Krintek for sport.” <br>
<br>
     “Shhhh don’t say his name! Don’t you know he has ways of seeing and hearing you if you say his name!  And I don’t think he would approve of this at all!”  He reprimanded her sternly.<br>
<br>
     “Oh bother!” She dismissed his warning, then smiled wickedly, “Besides, what if I want his eyes on me.” She purred softly.  Mezz looked at her in surprise and shock. <br>
<br>
     “Lets get back to the reason we are here Mezz, the Feir’dal tied to my bed.” She gestured to the helpless Elf.  Mezz’s attention focused on the Elf and he forgot all about her silly statement… he had work to do…..<br>
