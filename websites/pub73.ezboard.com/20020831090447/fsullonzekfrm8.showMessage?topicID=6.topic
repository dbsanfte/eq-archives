You are ignorant, no doubt, but<br>
as I'd rather light a candle than curse the darkness, I'm going to give you some helpful hints on <br>
killing goodies and keeping yourself healthy.<br>
<br>
1)  Try not to pk alone.  Alone, you are weak, at least take on friend with you when you hunt , it's<br>
rude to be outnumbered all the time.<br>
<br>
2)  Try not to pick a melee type.  Yeah, yeah, sure warriors and monks can pk, but mostly, they suck<br>
at it.  Actually, at least pick a warrior, a monk can't even wear the boss resist gear, so he/she ends up<br>
being owned by every tom-dick&amp;harry in the game.  Mobs != Players.  Monks == Pusses. The other<br>
thing is, melee's NEED gear to work.  Caster's do not.  Yeah, I know, you uber-guild loot whores think<br>
you need 200 int to work your char.  Guess what?  You don't!  You are 80-90% effective totally naked.<br>
A melee type, on the other hand, is dead weight naked.  Get it?  Good.  Don't make the mistake I made<br>
and pick a warrior.<br>
<br>
3)  If you violate rule 2, then you need magic resist lewt.  You do not need ac against a caster, and <br>
in fact snares, roots, stuns, mez's etc.... all are 10x more dangerous than dd's and dot's.  Get snared <br>
by a drewd and you are cooked.  However, most decent magic resist crap is reletively cheap and <br>
easy to get.  Go to allakazam's and look it up, my old melee type had a mob suit for leveling, and a<br>
mr suit for pk'ing, and the pk suit was cheap and effective, with mr ~= 80.  At that level, no bs snare,<br>
root, mez will ever stick.  Then, at least, you have some decent chance to beat a caster.<br>
<br>
4)  Killing people is all about doing as much damage as possible in as short a time as possible.  That's<br>
why Wizzy's, Necro's, and Shammys are really the better classes to play.  Have a threesome like that<br>
light you up, and you are so dead it's not even funny.  Catch a clue, ok, bards are not offensive; pet classes<br>
suck from one spell, fear; enchanters are so nerfed that mr gear makes them useless;  Clerics are great<br>
defense, but again, nobody is that scared of them.  On the other hand, I've had a solo necro take out my<br>
party of 4 and we know how to pk.  Write this down, ok?  If you really want to kill players, be a wizard or<br>
a necro or a shaman.<br>
<br>
5)  Sure, your evil, I got that.  However, I would really, really think twice about being a total dick on Sullen <br>
Zek.  I've seen @#%$ players duped into joining parties, suddenly bound in the middle of a dungeon, then<br>
ganked and party removed. I've seen some really awe inspiring revenge in my time, complete characters <br>
ruined, it can and will happen.  Generally speaking, give a little bit of sympathy to every victim, I guarentee<br>
you that if you screw over too many people, you will be chased off the server.  I would not camp a guys corpse,<br>
or camp a zone exit, and generally speaking, leave the area if you get killed.  Punks that cc, or ce, or don't<br>
loot and scoot will get punished to the point that the game isn't fun anymore. <p>---------------------------------------

<br>
    First of all, you are ONLY considering the PvP combat side.  High level warriors and rogues / monks are always needed for raids (the more the better).  This server isn't going to be all about PvP.<br>
<br>
    Another thing, this server is hard coded so you cant PK with anyone on your own team (the only people you could group with).   Duh...there won't be as many problems as there were with the other PvP servers (they are becomign hardcoded too)<br>

<br>
Is this supposed to mean anything to me?<br>
<br>
I don't recall commenting on hard coded teams (a good idea), but I will say that you are a crackhead if <br>
you don't think there &quot;won't be as many problems as there were with the other PvP servers.&quot;  Guess that<br>
depends on what you call &quot;problems&quot;, since you can't take anything to a GM, in Verants eyes, there are<br>
no problems.  To players being incredibly griefed, I foresee massive &quot;problems&quot;. <br>
<br>
The long and the short of it is this:  There are no pk'ing rules.  Trains, corpse camping, zone camping,<br>
any nasty little jerkoff tactic you can think of is fair game.  So, imagine, if you can, Blac Fyre, that your<br>
punky little melee, in his gleaming bronze armor and Bastard Sword of the Mediocre, is joining a raid <br>
to an enemy land.  <br>
<br>
Now, sooner or later your warrior/ranger/monk/shadowpunk is going to die, just playing by the law of<br>
averages.  Guess what ? Now you got to run, naked, through hostile territory to get your junk.<br>
<br>
That sound like fun to you?   <p>---------------------------------------

<br>
Like you said, don't PK by yourself, but in groups. On a new server, who has the dmg output of a monk superceded in PvP, with spell limitations? maybe a wizard, but a wizards looking at 500hps, and that's a couple rounds to a group.<br>

1) with good resist Gear (a rooted Melee class is a dead one...also have you ever tried to Melee someone while blinded??)<br>
2) when played very agressively (Nothing worse than being chased by a troll/ogre SK wealding a weighted Axe...at lvl 35 with their HT they can pop you for over 600dmg within seconds( At lvl 35 I was hit twice(one was a crit) with a Weighted Axe for a total of 450ish....luckly it was a friend!!)<br>
<br>
If a Melee class has bad resist gear after about lvl 16 they are dead in the water in PvP...unless the Caster that they are against is very poor.<br>
Though one thing....if outdoors Melee classes are at a big disadvantage, but indoors and confined spaces (especially places like Sol A/Guk) they are nastie especially Ogres and Trolls that can use their size to stop you escaping. (this works great in the Sol A and B entrances which can be completely blocked by trolls and ogres)<br>
