<br>
       Wrong heh.   Do you even pay attention to politics?    Did you consider Clinton right-wing?<br>
<br>
- 97.5% of your population isn't even aware of anything going on outside America's borders.<br>
<br>
    That is a blatant stereotype.   Not even worthy of a comment.<br>
<br>
- You call football 'soccer' and American football(which is rugby for pussys but with padding and stoppages every 10 seconds)<br>
<br>
    Im assuming this is another joke, since we are different countries with somewhat different languages.   This means nothing<br>
<br>
- Your current president had no qualms about having an innocent-ish executed to get into power.<br>
<br>
   Innocent according to you I assume.    I havent heard anything in the news with any proof some innocent got the death penalty from Bush.<br>
<br>
- You have the death penalty.<br>
 <br>
   Okay, so the death penalty is bad.    This is a moral judgement on your part.    Frankly the majority of US citizens disagree.<br>
<br>
- America disregards all other countries.<br>
<br>
   I can only take tihs to mean that you dont think we agree with everything you do.   Since we often agree with europe on so many things, again this argument doesnt hold water.<br>
<br>
- A lot of American citizens are annoying Nationalistic with a 'in yo face, we kick yo ass' attitude. Which is why Canada &gt; America<br>
  <br>
   AH, okay, here we see your prejudice.    YOUR nationalism is fine and dandy, but american nationalism is bad.   lol.<br>
<br>
- You have an awful education system.<br>
<br>
   Your opinion.    While I agree that our public school system needs work, our higher education system is the envy of ALL countries, and why we see so many european students.   My campus has immense numbers of people from other countries.   If it was so bad, they wouldnt be here.<br>
<br>
- You have no National health service.<br>
<br>
   In this country you have to work for it.   Still, I do agree that we need a national health service.<br>
<br>
- Your constitution is badly written and is given such 'god given' status that very little gets changed, even when it's logical to change something.<br>
<br>
   Sorry we stand by our constitution, its what it was written for afterall.    However, please take a look at all the amendments that are added.    It can be changed when necessary.    The US constition is a model to the world, and Im very proud of it.<br>
<br>
- You pollute more than any other country in the world and yet refuse to take any action about it.<br>
<br>
    I agree that the US should work more for the environment.    <br>
<br>
- You destroy your own enviorment in favour of more mining spots, and at the same time is goverment backed<br>
<br>
    All governments, everywhere, ruin some of the environment for mining.    After all, you do have to get resources.     We do it less than some european coutntries, and more than others.   Are you implying that any form of mining that would hurt the environment is bad?    If so, then maybe you should consider living in a tent, because we do need resources.<br>
<br>
- You get upset every time the EU refuses to buy something from you and throw a tantarum<br>
 <br>
   Europe holds a temper tantrum when the US doesnt buy something from them.    All countries want people to buy from them.<br>
<br>
- Asylum seekers are punished/sent back to where they came from rather than helped, despite the fact America is a very big country with a lot of space. <br>
  <br>
   Considering the massive numbers of immigrants we take in every year, I think we do a pretty good job.    Its a sign of how great the US is, that we have so many people wishing to come here.   All countries struggle with how many people to let in, and how it will effect their infrastructure.    I believe australia had a rather big issue about this a few weeks ago that is still going on ;p<br>

A little bit of an exaggeration - but not far off, really.<br>

I consider it immoral to execute someone with the mental age of 5 for killing someone. Bush evidently does not.<br>

Agree with Europe? No. European leaders suck up - due to America having money, which sickens me. Especially France of all countries.<br>

I'm not Nationalistic in the slightest. Perhaps a bit prejudice towards America, though....and with good reason.<br>

You do it more than most countries in the world. I can assure you of this.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Europe holds a temper tantrum when the US doesnt buy something from them. All countries want people to buy from them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, an example...Europe once refused to buy a load of drugged up beef from America. America wasn't happy about this - so they selected one product from every country in the EU and refused to buy it from them. <br>
<br>

The immigration numbers in America very small in comparison to Britain and many are turned away.<br>

   You calling clinton a right-win really indicates your political bias.   Man, you REALLY should move to a communist country and live the ideals.    You know, the bastions of liberty and greatness, like China and North Korea.<br>
