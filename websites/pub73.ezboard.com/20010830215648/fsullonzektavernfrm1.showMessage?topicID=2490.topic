<br>
Maybe even bottom feeding would become less common, because bottom feeders would risk becoming estranged from their own team.<br>
<br>
Anything to encourage players to seek out more even cons would improve game play for the entire server.  Greens would still be ganked, but maybe it wouldn't be so many people's primary focus.<br>
<br>
However, sadly I don't see the points ever having any real significance, because changing number 2 would actually take some thoughtful planning and effort from VI, which I'm not holding my breath on. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umorganti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morganti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/17/01 10:16:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why the points system means shit...</span><hr size=1> for real. die<br>

<br>
Maybe you define victory as starting out on the easiest, largest team with the most zones controlled initially, and not taking over a single zone since (temporary zone controls aren't counted in my book - you do it permanently or it was a successful raid, not zone control), but I know I don't.<br>
<br>
I don't see where the inane need to bash what other players consider a gauge, unless of course you wish to have yours insulted as well.<br>
<br>
Personally, I find teams to be too large and unwieldy to rank.. guilds are far more manageable, and I'll judge whom is winning by how well guild 1 has done against guilds 2, 3, and 4, as opposed to whom has the most points, who started with the most zones, who temporarily took over the most zones, whom is the most active in PvP, or what have you.<br>

<br>
This applies to all 3 teams.  Goods and neutrals will also kill greens if they want to.  But evils get screwed the most because of their huge level advantage, hence the negative points.  Don't dismiss the points system now that bottomfeeding has been eliminated.<br>
<br>
&gt;2 - Points have no ingame value&lt;<br>
<br>
True, but why do evils all of a sudden dislike the points system?  When it started, and evils were dominating, you praised the system because it showed your apparent dominance.  Now the system has turned against you, and it's now flawed based on your point of view /shrug.<br>
<br>
Someone posted that evils don't have it easier than neutrals.  Well, I wouldn't call it having it easier either, but you have to understand Kunark has the best leveling grounds out there.<br>
<br>
Kunark  lvl 1-60 (Evil)<br>
<br>
Velious lvl 27-60 (Neutral)<br>
<br>
This is the reason why the evils have so many players over level 50, and you can probably count with one hand the number of lvl 50+ on the neutral team.  You also have to consider that we've had to share our starting cities with the good team, and that slows down our leveling considerably due to PvP between the 2 teams. Until the neutrals/goods catch up in levels, your points will continue to be in the negatives when you go on those PKing sprees in Antonica.  Don't blame it on the points system.<br>

<br>
No, let's go into the debate again, since you decided to bring it up.<br>
<br>
Evil is easIER than Neutral because:<br>
<br>
1.  Kunark.  You started on Kunark.  You had a exclusive access and the ability to spread out over the continent before *anyone* else.<br>
<br>
2.  Level advantage, mostly due to Kunark and your large population at the beginning of the server (I won't go into populations now, because we don't have any hard data on that).  On average, Evil is higher level than Neutral because of said advantages.. and therefore easier.<br>
<br>
3.  Evils can hunt in *MORE* spots than Neutral can hunt in.  We're not discussing whether team Neutral is a difficult path or not, we're comparing it to Evil.  At least Neutral had to expand to take Velious, eh?<br>
<br>
4.  Faction issues are trivial.  If faction issues are the best thing you can bring forward as making Neutrals &quot;easier&quot; than Evils, you really are reaching.<br>
<br>
5.  All three teams have access to all important classes - it's a non-issue.<br>

Evils will never own NK or EK for instance, its just too annoying to hunt around those npcs.  Faction issues make evil trade skills a pain in the butt, this certainly effects gameplay.  Faction issues make it hard for evils to do a lot of their quests, including temple of solusek ro quests.<br>
<br>
The kunark advantage was about a 3 day advantage while good/newt sorted zones out.  After that there was plenty of territory for newts to level up in.  When I started my newt the 2nd week of the server I was never once kicked out of a zone by a good/evil, I hunted all the way up to the 30's with absolutely no problems finding places.<br>
<br>
Numbers dont' really mean much.  They do make it a bit easier for group dependant classes to find a group but thats about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Neutral=evil in difficulty.  I've seen at least 6 different non-evils post the same thing on this message board alone.  Just because a few Neutrals(who have never tried evil) disagree doesn't mean its true.  Good is the only team that can say they were disadvantaged on the server.<br>

<br>
Actually, most evils did not start in kunark.  I only know one other person in my guild that started in kunark.<br>
<br>
Most of us started throughout the world.  A few started in Quenos and owned the goods/nuets throughout the start of the server.  Others started in steamfont others in halas.  Some fought in unrest fending off attacks from the goods/neuts.  Others near freeport constantly getting ambushed from the raiders from rivervale.  Most high level evils didnt hunt in kunark til 50 and some continue now to.  There are better spots throughout the world. <br>
<br>
If Evils want a zone they take it.  Thats just the way things work on SZ.<br>
<br>
Wants the nuets catch up in levels they will be the easier to play.<br>

They may have to contend with some evil Guilds storming through their territory sometimes but otherwise they have the run of SoV to level in.<br>
