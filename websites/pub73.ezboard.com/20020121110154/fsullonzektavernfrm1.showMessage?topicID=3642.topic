Evil guilds on sullon zek are actually NUETRAL guilds with names like Darkenbane.<br>
<br>
Good guilds on sullon zek are actually EVIL guilds with names like Malignant.<br>
<br>
Confused guilds on sullon zek are actually GOOD guilds with names like Sanctus Lumen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit....   this is just humor.........<br>
<br>

<br>
By the way i think the original poster thinks that only guilds on the evil team are the only ones that actually act, uh ...evil.<br>

<br>
Ruin - Power-levelers - Kill anyone they can (Check out Mezzerable's points total for affirmation, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) - Forte:  PvE.<br>
<br>
Infernal Elite - Gradual Levelers - Not sure whether they aim for evens or anyone.. been too long since I've run into them raiding anywhere, unless Vital in Innothule counts =P - Forte:  None.  Roughly equal between PvP and PvE.<br>
<br>
Hate - Power-levelers - Sort of a mix between the above two.  Less PvP-oriented than IE, less PvE-oriented than Ruin.  I honestly haven't seen them outside of Evil territory since the Skyshrine Graveyard, so I, again, don't feel informed enough to judge which targets they aim for.  I hear Mezmoriah frequents Thurgadin (Haven't seen it myself - being KoS there makes that difficult, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and seems to have quite a few Insig's.. so I suppose at least one person within their ranks gnabs a fair amount of evens per day.<br>

<br>
I hardly ever see two or three man groups of evils purely dedicated to points. <br>
I see many skilled two or three man teams on newt hitting up any zones with targets.<br>
<br>
Good and evil seem to hunt in either full groups or solo  for some reason.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would say go evil, but good needs peeps.<br>
<br>
There are many evil guilds so choosing one would be difficult, that assumes you would be asked by them.<br>
<br>
Goods have a few well known guilds , so it would be an easy choice.<br>

4 people in zone.  Myself, a lvl 11 necro and Nygil (bard of Hate, rough guess at 50th lvl) and an unanon rogue of Hate (50th lvl).  i won't say my level (duh) but the differences between our lvls more than doubles my lvl by a good deal.<br>
<br>
bards are fast, easily outrunning my sow (roughly twice as fast) and he had track ina big open area.  i am the paranoid tpye who constantly checks /who  of zone so i said what's up in /ooc but was not prepared for how quickly they were upon me.  they had a lot of factors on their side, the critical missing one was PvP skill.<br>
<br>
after getting spammed with messages of how i resist Selos chain or whatever their snare song is called .. i actually run them back and forth in zone.  nygil is only good for debuffing my sow.<br>
<br>
i landed 2 snares out of 4 attempts on a bard no less.  have you even HEARD of resist songs?<br>
<br>
conclusion:  inkara ranger &gt; hate<br>
hate is not a pvp guild, though they will say otherwise<br>
<br>
.. note:  hehe after all my bragging in guildchat, i logged back on in oasis and was killed by no less than 10 people, including 2 shaman pets, 1 red, 1 blue.  almost made it out.. ah  guildies were laughin at that for a while haha <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ufokyooz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fokyooz</A> at: 9/23/01 9:41:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umilt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/23/01 9:38:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3642.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> points</span><hr size=1> Anybody who refuses to kill a member of another team because he might lose points is a bloob.<br>

Coming from a power-leveling Shaman, that's a pretty biased response - but I do partially agree.<br>
<br>
I'd also say that anyone in an area where 90% of their victims are low enough to give them negative points is a bottom-feeder and every bit as blue as those that avoid killing every green that might cause points-loss.<br>
<br>
&quot;People in Hate, Ruin, and IE who refuse to kill non-even cons as you put it do not exist&quot;<br>

There's a difference between refusing to kill non-evens and actively searching for evens as opposed to greens.<br>

Da Bashin' Iggles: these guys are cool, old school people from VZ. They have recently begun to pk - and we are seeing them on the points boards alot more often now.<br>
<br>
Malignant (woot): We are definately not big, but we have been able to achieve 7th overrall on the points boards while not having a single member of lvl 45 and having a relatively small player base. I think that the fact that we can achieve that has to say something about us as a guild.<br>

You are lvl 40ish if I'm not mistaken.  Velael said you are even to him I believe.  I killed you in Inny Swamp.  A bunch of newts were in UGuk and swamp at the time, you were with them if I'm not mistaken.  You were probably the lowest of them all and still virtually everyone who hunts in UGuk and ofcoarse Inny swamp is green to you.  I believe that meets your criteria of 90% of the victims being low enough to give negative points.<br>
<br>
Infact, the only reason you wouldn't get negative points from most of the people who were in the swamp trying to assist in killing you is because they are below lvl 20 so provide no points.<br>

Yup.  You got the kill-shot, though I lend the credit to the Enchanter (Chameleon) that perma-mezzed me.<br>

<br>
Um?  We weren't aiming for UGuk - We know even con Evils hunt in Lguk, and therefore should have found plenty of evens to kill.  If the 7500 points we netted that day wasn't proof enough - we found plenty of people close to our level.<br>

&quot;Infact, the only reason you wouldn't get negative points from most of the people who were in the swamp trying to assist in killing you is because they are below lvl 20 so provide no points.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can honestly say I wasn't thinking about the lowbies in Innothule.  If they're low enough to give negative points, chances are they can do nearly nil damage to me as well - I can safely ignore them and concentrate on the copious amount of points / challenge-offering players we did discover.<br>
<br>
&quot;Care to explain?&quot;<br>
<br>
Certainly.  We knew there would be plenty of players there that would give us a decent fight, and had the people on hand - so we attacked.  I'm sure plenty of lowbies jumped in from Innothule swamp - but that's hardly 90% of our enemies, considering the amount of players we fought that were certainly not level 6.<br>
<br>
If a player stations themself in an area they feel will provide nearly all negative-points-providing Greenies, they're every bit as blue as the person that avoids greens for fear of points-loss.<br>
<br>
One actively seeks out PvP with 0 challenge; the other actively avoids PvP that could harm his or her score.<br>

There are far more crowded places.  The vast majority of the lvl 30-40 people on the evil team hunt OT because they are panzies that think lguk is a lvl 45+ zone.  I have heard many say that infact hehe.  (Note: there are some people who hunt OT who are not wusses and would like to be in lguk or solb but cannot find others to go with them, end disclaimer).<br>
<br>
When I arrived on the scene, just after iggles, before ruin or IE, with my group the newts were in inny swamp and uguk.  If any had been to lguk they had already left.  The report I heard and the reason I came was they were corpse camping iggles and others in UGuk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uagrul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agrul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Message Board Warrior</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/23/01 10:18:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3642.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lguk</span><hr size=1> &quot;You are quite misinformed if you believe many evils hunt in lguk&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, the battle there is a pretty bad example.<br>
<br>
We didn't go there for PvP at first, heh.<br>
<br>
We were planning to head on to Lguk and farm items - we know it's usually not infested with players.<br>
<br>
Finding players worth fighting was a pleasant surprise.. but purely coincidental.  As far as I can tell, what we're discussing refers to players situating themselves in a place to find PvP, not heading to a place for PvE and finding PvP - meaning the Guk battle doesn't really apply to our dicussion, =/ .<br>

Bottom line.  I have a hotkey social that does the following:<br>
<br>
/who Malignant<br>
/who Hate<br>
/who Ruin<br>
/who Infernal<br>
/who all friend<br>
<br>
And I evidently need to move Malignant down to just above the friends line so I don't have to keep scrolling up to see what went by...cuz I see them alot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
O btw, that hotkey is named &quot;Menu&quot;  mwahaha<br>
<br>
Ruin is always (99% of the time) somewhere like Sebilis or the Planes where they can xp in peace.  They *will* kill you if they stumble across you though.  But never fear, it will be a quick xp-less death in most cases as they are all reaching the upper 50's.<br>
<br>
I only see IE or Hate in the zone if there are 5 times as many Malignants first, *generally*.  Not sure exactly *what* that means.  I'll leave that up to you.<br>
<br>
If you want PvP though, join Goods.  We are forced into it by circumstance more than the other 2 teams.  *And*, joining evil or newt right now would be a truly cowardly thing to do =)<br>
