I can remember back on TZ when Tulli was only 25, that i was in a HHK warrior group, and over 20 pieces of bronze dropped, and out of the 6 of us, i rolled 1-30 every time.  Finally the group gave me a piece out of sympathy.  I remember that night that i was really depressed.<br>
<br>
On sullon, lots of items have dropped.  FS weapons (back in befallen when FS was GOOD AS HELL), Knoll hide boots, Sarnak Taberds (3), and lots of other stuff.<br>
<br>
I have only won about 20 or so rolls on my WHOLE time that i have been playing EQ (for items) and VERY VERY few of those were good items. (I remember winning the Sheild in High Pass and being excited as hell) But tonight pushed me over the edge.<br>
<br>
I got a tell about 30 minutes ago, from a shaman who was hunting Bloodgills in LOIO.  The Shaman told me to come a specific loc, and to come quick.  I didn't know what was going on, so i told the shaman that she/he was probably going to pk me or something.  The shaman told me that there was a Harpoon of the Depths on a Bloodgill it had killed.  And the shaman wanted me to loot it!!!!  I asked the Shaman why she/he didn't loot it her/himself.  The Shaman told me that she/he already had one, and it was a lore item.  Immediately i ran, but i was encumbered BADLY.  So i dropped about 800 SP. (8pp, which is quite alot) and that took off about 20 pounds or so.  Then i kept on running.  Just my luck that the Harpoon rotted before i got there.<br>
<br>
This is amazingly frustrating, and is why when i am in groups, I hate it when a rare item drops, cause i never get it.<br>
<br>
I am aware that SOME people do hack their clients, and make set numbers of which they can roll.  But not every person that has ever rolled against me has hacked their EQclient.  It's impossible.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this sounds like a whine, but it is just really frustrating when i know i have not won one roll on the Sullon Zek Server, and about 20 rolls out of maybe 5000 or so on TZ. <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

If you are in a good mood, allow groupmates to keep any coin they loot, even though it really is a need of yours so you can buy food and pumice.  Let them keep the coin they loot, but be sure to keep it in the back of your head and call that favor in at a later date, especially clerics and wizzies with their rezzes and teleports.  Many's the time I've reminded a wizzie about coin I allowed him to keep when we were grouped, and asked him to repay the favor by picking me up in Qeynos Hills for a port to West Karana (a long run).  Be careful though that useless classes like warriors don't loot too much coin, as they have no special skills to repay you with at a later date. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umalkar25.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malkar25</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/01 8:16:38 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Matrim STFU and quit posting your whiny bitch ass threads.   <p><b>Malkar<br>

<br>
I don't want to nitpick, but isn't Need before Greed really Greed before Greed?  I mean, what is 'need' in EQ?   I 'need' a quest item so I can get item X.  Ok.  I 'need' it.  There is no possible way for me to finish the quest without the item.  But for all other cases, it's not 'need'.  It's 'I need it more than you'.  Now if that isn't greed, I don't know what is.<br>
<br>
There is no requirement that anyone posess item X or Y or Z for anything (besides quests).  You can get to the Planes without item X, you can kill Naggy without Y.  Oh, sure the item might give you some bonus or some proc, but is there anything inherently NEEDED for anyone to become a great EQ player?  No.  It's all greed disguised with higher and pure motives.   Oh, sure, Joe Caster can use Robe Q, but who is to say I don't 'need' the trade in value of that item for something I 'need'?<br>
<br>
I sit there like a dummy for six hours in a group and hope something valuable drops.  Then when it does, someone goes apeshit cause THEIR class can get the most use from it.   I can't wear or use it, so OBVIOUSLY I should not roll on it.   What pure bullshit.  I can take that item and trade it for something I want three hours down the road.   <br>
<br>
Now, I'm not against whatever looting rules are decided upon.  If I don't like em, I quit the group.  No problem.  If some guild wants to divide up the loot according to height or weight, I got no problem with that.  Do whatever you like within the confines of your guild or tight knit group.  But whenever I get into some pick-up group and someone starts with the NBG bullshit, they're nothing but the worst kind of loot whore:  Someone who uses people's sympathy to further their own ends.<br>

I remember camping a SMR for my Necro, it took me 5 months to finally win it due to groups like this. I never onced complained when tanks were rewarded over me time and time again. I also refused to ever camp the FBSS with my necro because I couldn't put a tank through what I had gone through for months waiting for my SMR. When I played my warrior the same thing happened, I camped (back when it was uber) a exe axe for 3 months and lost TONS of times to farming casters. One guy accually had won the roll 4 diff times of me grouping with him and was using it to sell. Then he offers to sell to me for 3k while I was in his group! Anyhow, I got fed up with groups that greed before need. I don't care who you are, I will always let you loot something if I cannot use it and you can. The stress of camping items already sucks for alot of people, expecially those with limited time. Why the hell make it worse on yourself and others? The main reason you are camping a item to trade is so you can get something you were unable to camp for yourself due to lame gimp groups like the ones you promote.

A Warrior with a crafted BP won a Sarnak Talberd roll over this rogue with a banded Tunic on.  Come to think of it, the war had full crafted.).<br>
<br>
I understand what you mean Slow, but it's not like I'm in Malignant or anything (although i hope to be soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I can't tell the group that since i need the item the most that I should roll on it.  Hell, most groups i have been in have said that if a bracer of the hidden drops, EVERYONE rolls on it, since it is all/all.  I believe that this is super-greedy, because all they have to do is sit down and go /book x, mem see invis and then go along their way.  Every class gets see invis (minus rogues, warriors, and monks).  But they always argue that it &quot;frees up a spell slot&quot; and is &quot;insta-cast&quot; which i personally believe is a piss-poor argument for why a caster should have a BoH as opposed to a pure melee.  And i can guarantee you that any caster that got that bracer of the hidden would eventually sell it.  A Melee would never sell his bracer of the hidden, unless a better item that gave see invis as an insta cast came out.<br>
<br>
Carnifex- Me and you both know that that is bullshit.  Someone would post it here, and then I would be &quot;The lamer of SZ&quot;.  And it would be a rightly deserved title.  I would never take it unfairly.<br>
<br>
Sorry guys, but my main point was that all this time i have been unlucky.  I FINALLY get a break and get one of the best 20-40 piercing weapons, and then with MY fucking luck, it rots off the corpse before i get to it.  Very depressing.<br>

<br>
as to bad rolls... You need to find a better crew of peeps to group with. My groups are Need befre Greed. Also, if nice items are dropping semi-regularly, then we make sure everyone gets one (ie - if you get a sweet item, you are out of rolling to everyone who can use has gotten one).<br>
<br>
If somethig Uber falls, then the guild council decides who gets it, looking at how the item can be the most useful to the guild.<br>
<br>
To me it is a team/guild game. those that want to play for themsleves can do just that... go play with themselves.<br>
