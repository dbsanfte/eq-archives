<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> Introduction <br>
<br>
From the ground up EQOA was designed to be a different kind of adventure to EQPC. The console gamer tends to have a shorter attention span, require better gratification for their gaming time and tends to play in 30 to 60 minute blocks. There were numerous design decisions based around this, for example the removal of corpses, smaller groups and the class ‘type’ system to allow easier gameplay. <br>
<br>
The grouping system <br>
<br>
EQOA has a 4 person group system. There are experience bonuses for being in a group meaning that fastest advancement occurs when grouped. There are also four ‘types’ of character in EQOA, Healer, Magic Damage Dealers (casters), Melee Damage Dealers and Melee Damage Absorbers (Tanks). The 4 person group allows for one of each type to be included for optimum group play, but players can certainly form a group with any class types they choose. <br>
<br>
One difference in EQOA to EQPC is that you can’t see how much damage another player is dealing in your group. This means that there is less of the ‘underpowered/overpowered’ argument between classes as it is more difficult to see the difference in simple DPS a class does. There are some programs which can sniff packets for EQOA to gather some information that would rather not be displayed but these do violate the EULA. <br>
<br>
The growing world <br>
<br>
The size of the world is limited currently to what shipped with the DVD. However there are a number of zones, models, and items which are ‘locked’ and invisible to players currently. Future expansions could also utilize these models and art resources so that existing players would not need to purchase the expansion to be able to see the new models and art. As the story continues to unfold however some of the locked off areas will be opened up to players to allow them to access new areas. <br>
<br>
When asked if a box expansion is in the works (i.e. one you buy off the shelf) they said that time will tell. The teams hoping it will be possible since it would mean the game was doing well if it warranted one to be made. <br>
<br>
There is a depth to the world of EverQuest both in the PC game and the PS2 version that people don’t often take time to notice. We spoke with one of the EQOA story designers who gave us a brief insight into the world of Tunaria (Norrath 500 years before EQPC), in just a few moments he recited the tale of how the Dwarves came to be in Moradhim in the game, something which isn’t readily apparent to the average gamer. <br>
<br>
In Game Events <br>
<br>
So can players in EQOA expect the same type of dynamic events in EQPC? The answer is yes! Events will come in two forms. There will be CS Driven events handled by the server GM’s. These won’t essentially be tied to any story, but rather be more to spice up the game play for the few who encounter them. Secondly there will be story driven events that are based on unlocking the content currently hidden on the DVD. The first of these will center on the Erudite race as they work towards their exodus to the Isle of Odus. <br>
<br>
So how’s it going? <br>
<br>
SOE would only say they are ‘happy’ with the current subscription levels. They said that retailers are very happy with the current sell rate of the title. With the recent announcement of an additional server it would appear the title is setting up to do very well over the course of the next 12 months as it achieves a more thorough penetration of the PS2 market. <br>
<br>
But… <br>
<br>
<br>
Some existing players have been concerned about the lack of items or unique looks in EQOA. That problem can be put to rest. Right now most players just haven’t discovered enough items to really have any variety of choice. In the time we had to play the game none of the characters looked alike, they all had unique looking weapons, armors and clothing. As the economy matures and players gain a sense of wealth with their hoards of Tunar more items will begin to trickle down to lower level characters enabling players a larger variety in the visual appearance of their characters. <br>
<br>
One key to keeping a mobile item economy was the choice to only restrict trading on very rare or quest items. The majority of items players discover in EQOA will be tradable to other players so that a solid item economy can flourish over time. The game balance has also been protected by having level limits on items from day one. This helps to prevent twinking and makes it easier for the designers to provide balanced content for players. <br>
<br>
So about these items… <br>
<br>
Items in EQOA come in four types: Ultra Rare, Rare, Uncommon and Common. For the most part any monster can drop one of these four items. Named monsters or Rare spawns will generally always drop a Rare or Ultra Rare item. Items in EQOA are not limited to specific mobs in many instances. This means that players do not need to always camp specific spawns in order to get an item. The loot tables for NPCs are generated from three sources. <br>
<br>
There is a world-region table where any NPCs anywhere in the game world of that Level can drop a certain item. <br>
<br>
There is a terrain-region table which means that in the north, south, east or west, or in the snow, desert etc items specific to that terrain region can drop from any NPC of that level. <br>
<br>
Lastly there are NPC specific tables which ensure specific items drop from a specific NPC. <br>
<br>
Many players are only now discovering that there is plenty of reward in exploration as they can get the same loot out in the quieter areas with more plentiful spawn than in the crowded safety of the town fringes. <br>
<br>
The dev team also made specific mention that dungeon-region loots are particularly worthwhile and that players who take the challenge to enter the fast spawning dungeons of EQOA are not only in for fast paced fighting with good experience, but an increased chance to get the more rare loots of Tunaria. <br>
<br>
Can I make my own stuff though? <br>
<br>
Tradeskills are becoming an important element of MMOG’s as players look for diversity and change from the hack and slash which is so often associated with them. There are currently no tradeskills in EQOA but Daniel Enright (formerly lead Tradeskill designer for EQPC) has been brought onto the EQOA team to develop from the ground up a solid tradeskill system. <br>
<br>
The first tradeskill (while not exactly a trade) will be released within 2 months. It has been announced to be a Fishing Skill which will provide players with a free way to obtain food and drink, the system for health and power regeneration in the game. The most interesting thing about the fishing skill is that the fish will change with the real life northern hemisphere seasons. Winter fish for winter, Summer fish in summer, etc. The fishing system won’t be your typical ‘click and wait’ tradeskill either. The system is designed to provide a mini-game where you actually cast your rod and then use the analog controls of the PS2 to reel in and adjust your line. <br>
<br>
The EQOA tradeskill system is not being designed to be a grind however. Expect tradeskills which are fun and are more experiemental in nature to be implemented. <br>
<br>
One tradeskill which has been ruled out at this time is a smithing/repair skill for repairing items while out in the field. It was announced that the current system planned will reward players who do their skills in towns by providing them with chances to make higher quality items or to have a higher success rate when they use their tradeskill near a focus object within the city. <br>
<br>
On average tradeskill items will be better than the equivalent level equipment purchased in stores. This is being done to encourage players to not only work up tradeskills but to also encourage people to purchase off other players and stimulate the economy. <br>
<br>
Hail! <br>
<br>
EverQuest Online Adventures is trying hard to live up to it’s name: EverQuest. There are already a great number of quests available in game and a focus point of the development team is to continue working on adding more quests for players. There will be a lot more quests added over the next few weeks, particularly in the outlying regions of Tunaria to help encourage players to explore the world more. Ben Bell, the producer for EQOA, explained that there is still a lot of the world left for players to see and that does not include the hidden regions currently locked away. <br>
<br>
And all this on 32 MB? <br>
<br>
EQPC has been accused of being one of the worst memory hogs of all time in online gaming. On a good day you might be able to get away with 256 MB RAM to play it. Most players use between 512MB and 1 Gig. However the PS2 only supports 32MB of RAM and the patch file on the memory card is just under 4MB. So was it hard to do? The Dev Team didn’t even know if it would be possible to make EQOA for the first 8 months of development (the title took over 30 months to produce), but once the memory limitations and patching systems were complete the game moved forward at a very fast pace. <br>
<br>
There is a lot which can be done using that small area of patch memory too. The team say they can unlock new areas, activate new artwork, even modify the User Interface all through just a small amount of tweaking in the patch file. It’s a very tight and very solid piece of engineering which has brought the scope of EverQuest to the PS2. <br>
<br>
So we can patch, but can we protect from the GameShark? <br>
<br>
The PS2 has a number of utilities to help players ‘cheat’ in traditional games by altering the memory of the PS2. With EQOA this simply won’t be possible. Firstly, the majority of the data is stored on the server side. Like most MMOG developers the assumption must be made that the client is in the hands of the enemy as far as hacking or cheating is concerned. Furthermore, players caught cheating will be banned. At UJS$49.95 a throw for a registration key it’s going to be an expensive hobby to start cheating with EQOA. <br>
<br>
So can anyone play? <br>
<br>
Currently EQOA is specific to North American based PS2’s. The European/Australian version should hit the shelves sometime in May to June (when the Network adaptors launch in Europe) with the Asian and other versions 12 – 18 months away. Players who live overseas but have a North American NTSC PS2 could order EQOA from the USA and play it if they wished. <br>
<br>
Servers in foreign countries will be localized where possible in order to keep latency at a minimum. This will already include Europe, Korea and China. <br>
<br>
What’s in the pipe-line? <br>
<br>
So what can we expect from EQOA in the coming months? <br>
<br>
Expect to see auto attack very soon. Auto Loot systems are also planned to give players options on how to have loot automatically distributed to their group members if they choose. An ability to cancel spells already being cast will also be added (i.e. Return Home). <br>
<br>
Summary <br>
<br>
EQOA is revolutionizing the PS2 gaming experience. It’s the first true player in the MMOG genre for consoles. The dev team have done an excellent job bringing the PC classic to the PS2 and are committed to making it a lasting title. <br>
<br>
The game has a lot of content (something many PC games even fail to have at launch), as well as diversity and interest. It has a good fast pace and enough story and quest elements to give players things to do besides killing critters all the time. <br>
<br>
With the quest system expanding, new zones being unlocked over time, tradeskills being added and the CS team beginning to run more in-game events the world of Tunaria is going to be a very interesting place to be over the next few years. How many games can you keep playing for more than a week let alone a year or two? <br>
<br>
The graphics might not be the most compelling but they are still pretty decent and more than enough to keep you happy as you experience the true gaming experience – interaction with other real people on a massive scale. That’s the real beauty of this game and the others like it on the PC Platform: You get to play with real people and make real friendships while kicking back on your couch and exploring another world. <br>
<br>
If you have been looking for that RPG which only gets better with time and doesn’t have to end just because you max out your character then this is the game for you. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
