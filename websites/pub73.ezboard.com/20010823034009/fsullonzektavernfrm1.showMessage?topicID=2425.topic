I'm level 32, I have had a character since the first hour and I hove both killed greens and been smoked by reds. That is how this server should be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'm a semi-casual player, I have played the same character the entire time and haven't re-rolled.<br>
<br>
MR should not be set at the same number no matter what level. AC isn't, why should MR be any different? 1k AC = 1k AC at any level, you just show me a way to get 1k AC at level 10. Since AC rises with defense skill increases, AC rises with level naturaly. Good, MR should do the same thing. The fact that after this patch a level 20 melee would absolutely own my ass is completely wrong. Now I'm the first to admit that EQ is buggy and stuff needs to be tweaked, and MR probably does need a slight tweak. NOT this badly, and certainly not at the expense of fixing the Cancel Magic bug, which is WAY, WAY worse.<br>
<br>
Look I'm sorry you hate being killed by reds, deal with it. It's easy to fix, level up. If you can't make it to level 30 as a casual player, you belong on another server. This is not the newbie hold your hand server, we all came here because we wanted hard core PK action. Well, this is rapidly turning into the n00b PK server at the rate we are going. Damnit VI, don't you see that there is a demand for some hard core, serious content in EQ? You seem to always promise it, and never do it. Fix these stupid resists, and FIX THE DAMN CANCEL MAGIC BUG. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ualekzandervalcarde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alekzander Valcarde</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 9:16:52 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/dragonknyt/sigpic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why this new patch sucks, and why MR should be level based</span><hr size=1> One small problem:<br>

MR does not rise with level. (Except for Warriors).<br>

Now, in order for this to work, all resistances would have to rise just like AC does.  I see a small problem with that, anyone else?<br>

the ac is a great arguement.<br>

for some reason people that realize they have to run from the red mob, do not want to have to run from the red player.<br>

at a big lvl difference a zergling rush, just does not work.  I think we need to all go to a blue server, make a lvl 1 and see how many people it would take to bring down a lvl 25 mob.<br>

Now you will have what (I guess) you want: a reasonably predictable estimation of whether your spells will 'stick' or not.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way for Verant.  they insist that there be some randomness involved in casting any spell whether due to resistance or fizzling or whatever.  <br>
<br>
  If everything is level based as you say, then enormous advantage is given to those who can afford to spend the most time in relatively safe exp'ing areas.  As it is, even now with this patch ( I should say the intent of the MR change in this patch) this game is a gawd awful race to equivalence (read 60).  The natural evolution of this server will be for people to ealise that their best chance for success is to level rapidly, avoiding pvp until they are at a relatively high level (50+).  Once 75% of the server reaches that plateau, then thngs will 'appear' more balanced.  Problem is, this server won't live long enough for that to happen.  <br>

<br>
AC used to be entirely skill based. Now its partly level based, you cant have AC higher than 2 levels from your current level. Reason being assholes with lots of time on their hands would get to 50+, get planar gear and equipment and rogues would ge their ragebringers. Then they would DELEVEL, which would mean they would have stuff like 1k AC, 1k ATK and if they were a rogue they'd be backstabbing for 1k damage at level 20.<br>
<br>
Now its not really fair using very low level zerg-rushes as an example (IE. Level 1's vs Level 25 mob). Simply because they dont have the HP to take more than one hit, now take a group of level 20's and pit them against a low to mid 40's mob and they'll win with a good deal of casualties though.<br>
<br>
Either way the resists make it so that higher level players will pick higher level targets now rather than just blowing away high-greens, if you still wanna pick on high-greens well go ahead and try but they're gonna resist you a bit more than normal. Think of it as a melee going up against a higher level melee, skill determines who wins not who has the bigger, badder weapon. Ofcourse weapon selection does help in most cases. (IE. Weighted Axe vs FS 2h sword). Right tool for the right job, you wouldnt take a sledgehammer to take a screw out of your wall now would you. <p><HR>

<br>
Secondly, MR does rise with level, we just don't see it on the client screen. Obviously there has always been some server side code that gave an invisible bonus to higher levels for resists. Same way a level 29 can't stick spells to a sabertooth tiger in OT, but a level 34 hits for full. In PvE you see no problem with this, and take it for granted. This is the way EQ has always been. <br>
<br>
This game isn't quake. I have time invested in my character and want to feel that my invested time equals something of value in the game. Instead, what I have now is the exact same thing someone with less skill and less playing time has. I have quake where everyone is the same. I don't play EQ for that, I like to think that as I put in time I become more powerful and more capable. If a bunch of level 20's could zerg rush every mob in the game, what would be the point of the game as a whole? Without some reward and advancement, EQ is nothing more than a poor FPS with a more complex combat system. Get your newb ass up and go level, its not that hard to get to 30 guys, if you can't get there you don't need to be on this server. <br>
<br>
I'm not a green farmer, hell I haven't had the time to PK nearly as much as I even wanted to and most of it has been white on white. You know what though? My most fun moment on this server was when I looked up in OT and saw Frok levving over my head, and knowing he could completely own me. On VZ, I saw a red con and ignored him and maybe even talked smack and this got real old...I wanted a server where he could lay the smack down, I got it, and now VI is nerfing it again. Hell, the twink problem may even begin....give a 20 warrior some resist gear and decent armor and go out smoking people 10-15 levels higher and watch yourself on the points board.

That was a STUPID change.<br>

<br>
and here's the basic flaw in your argument:  They didn't remove the innate resistance due to level altogether, just evened it up some.  It was believed that each level difference gave a +/- 10 bonus or hindrance in resists...they lowered it, maybe its closer to 7 now, or 5, who knows.  They said they reduced it SLIGHTLY... even if they cut it in half, a 10 level difference is still plus or minus 50 to each resist, not insignificant by any stretch of the imagination.  So presuming +5 per level now, a naked dwarf rogue getting casted on by a necro 10 levels lower has an effective MR of 80, not too bad for not having a single piece of gear (30 dwarf base + 5 MR per level).<br>
<br>
Did you not read this part of the patch message, or do you just *NEED* something to complain about? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nobs>Nobs</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 10:40:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why this new patch sucks, and why MR should be level based</span><hr size=1> Anyone who ever played any other rpg's, computer or otherwise, when they came to EQ thought EQ was totally screwed up.  Consider, in most other rpg's, you have a somewhat linear progression of resists (saving throws) and a.c..  As has been already noted, the a.c. *number* in EQ is somewhat like this.  Given the same gear, the difference in a level 20's a.c. number and a level 30's a.c. number  is the difference in the defensive 'skill'.  However, it doesn't really end there.  Verant did what no other game had done by throwing in some kind of wierd 'level buffs' for mobs.  I don't know of any other way to put it.  But, the end result was that fighting something even one level above you one on one became difficult. 2 levels above you very difficult, more than that virtually impossible to solo.  I believe the same enhancements are in place to some degree with players.<br>
<br>
So, my point is that even if you make MR level based, to be fair you still have to do something about these 'level buffs' that are so ridiculous.  A level 26, in the old system, fighting a level 20 could just sleep his way through combat because of these level buffs.  So, you should make combat just based on  the flat a.c. and MR *number*.  Thus, in a 60 level game, a level 26 fighting a level 20 would be about, um, what? 13 percent more effective? Also, this doesn't take into account any skills or spells or items the level 26 might have gained.  (I freely admit I am not a math type person).  But, I think you see my point.  <br>
<br>
I understand that some people who are used to the old system will believe that things should revert back to the old system. They recieved their lumps coming up, so should everyone else.  However, let me point something out.  On a server, you are going to have a natural progression of people gaining levels.  So, what this means is that as the server matures, the number of higher levels will increase and the number of lumps being dished out by these higher levels and the consequent ability of 'lowbies' to level is impacted to a much greater degree than when the high levels were coming up.  Just something to keep in mind before anyone totally advocates going back to the old system or something even remotely like it.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umalkar25.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malkar25</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 10:44:11 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why this new patch sucks, and why MR should be level based</span><hr size=1> I'm actually gonna agree with Skarwolf here.

This doesn't DRASTICALLY change the server... It just puts less of a focus on EXP points in particular. High level PKers will still have an advantage if they are smart and should adapt pretty easily.

Yes, I read that part of the patch message. And you know what? It isn't true. Unlike you, I actually play this game and I decided to do some testing. I dueled several lower levels characters (15-20....I'm 32) and they resisted darn near everything with there standard resists (avg. of 37ish)<br>

Inferno Shock? Did an average of a pathetic 50 or so damage...huge partial resist<br>
Thundershock? Resisted half of the time.....<br>
<br>
In other words, I now cannot snare a green to keep from beating on my ass and interupting and it doesn't matter anyway since I don't have enough mana to kill him due to the huge partial resists. In other words, a level 20 melee is way, way better in PvP than a 30 wizzy...and that is FUCKED up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uaenrune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AenRune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 10:55:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why this new patch sucks, and why MR should be level based</span><hr size=1> THAT is what I am talking about, and worried about as well.

This is the best thing for the game and will actually make skill and magic resist gear more of a part of pvp.  I was pretty tired of having 130 magic resist and having a red druid snare me.  Nobody should easily be able to easily land a snare or root with 130 resist. <p><b>Malkar<br>

<br>
Now you people are saying you don't like reds killing green cons and you like a rule change that helps put an end to it?  WTF?  Hi, wrong fuckin' server.<br>
<br>
I'm a 4-time reroll, I've got a nice amount of cash and some decent resist gear.  What is my resist gear for?  To stop even cons from landing spells on me, not to protect me from someone 20+ levels over me.  That's just fucking stupid.  There's no reason I should resist (or be able to land a spell on) someone 20+ levels over me.  I can't run around at level 20 and expect to resist frogs in LGuk, I shouldn't be able to resist players that much higher either.<br>
<br>
I know people are going to come in with some bullshit about how if something is broke then Verant should fix it, but fuck, this wasn't broke.  Cancel magic is broke, a red con killing a green con with ease is NOT FUCKING BROKE.  Did you think that someone 20+ levels over you wasn't going to kick your bitch ass across the zone?  Did you expect to be able to land spells on someone 20+ levels over you?  If so you're a fucking idiot anyway, so I'm not going to bother arguing.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this:  Sullon Zek was opened up with no level limit on PvP.  If you didn't expect red cons to beat the fucking piss out of green cons at will (and weren't willing to accept it) then you came to the wrong god damn server.  It's the fact that arguments like this arise that make it so blatantly obvious how pussy EQ players (PvPers) are.  You would cry like a bitch and quit DT within 5 minutes if you ever tried it, I promise.  Bunch of carebear sluts trying to turn a somewhat-hardcore PvP server into a little girl server.  0.o<br>
<br>
And yes, dammit, that gives me the redass.<br>
<br>
kthxbye. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uaenrune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AenRune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 11:07:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why this new patch sucks, and why MR should be level based</span><hr size=1> I can do that too, but the same thing has to apply to twinks as to twisting bards (which doesn't make up a huge population).<br>
