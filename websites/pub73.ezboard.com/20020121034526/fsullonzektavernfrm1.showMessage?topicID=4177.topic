<br>
While going out into the world and exping and/or pvping is a blast, sometimes it is plain old fun to spend a few hours in a town, to experience the trading atmosphere and work on trade skills and all around meet and interact with other players you otherwise might not ever see.  If you are low level it is always fun to see the big dogs come into town, to check out there gear and nice robes/armor.  If you are high level it is refreshing to see the lowbies and interact with them.<br>
<br>
Which towns do you like the most and why?<br>
Kelethin - I always liked this town as it is out in the open, being a town of itself and also allowing you to hear and talk to those in Gfay also.  The tree thing is pretty cool.<br>
<br>
Felwithe - Never played an elf but have taken my other light chars there.  Pretty cool town, although I think the layout is wierd, making people just want to go take care of their business and then leave.  No one hangs out at the bank and/or anywhere else in town.  The main hangout is right outside the front gates.<br>
<br>
Akanon - Never stepped foot inside this one.<br>
<br>
Ogguk - Never stepped foot inside this one either.<br>
<br>
Grobb - Used this town to bank in when hitting Guk and stuff.  Not many hang out here, it kinda sucks IMO.<br>
<br>
Freeport - I don't like this town either, too much a pain in the ass to go to the bank and I never saw any commerce here but noobs hovering around the west gates.  The east gate was always barren.<br>
<br>
Qeynos - I like this town.  It's got an 'on the other side of the world' feel to it, and I liked the music that played in the zones.  The bank has a little commerce going on, and the docks and the bars there are pretty cool to hang in.  A great town for a Human.<br>
<br>
Erudin - Barren!  Not a bad town, but it is, or used to be, very far away from any good hunting spots.  No one is ever in this town that I know of.  No one hangs out here for even a second.  I love being Erudites when I played a caster (they make the best), but this town was always a drag to start in and belong to.<br>
<br>
Kaladim - Been in there a few times, but not much.  I don't know what this town has to offer, but to my knowledge non dwarven types very rarely ever stop there.<br>
<br>
Neriak - My personal favorite.  So much so that I would make a decision to play a dark race just so I could get to use this town and hang out in it.  Very cool dark feel to it, nice layout, and alot of people hang here to make trades and such.  It just seemed to me that every time I was in there, stuff was happening and the zones were full.  Love it.<br>
<br>
I also like HighKeep alot.  I know this is not a starting town, but it is close and a very cool haven for non kos folks to hang out, bank, shop, auction and even exp for many levels in the same zone.  That rocks, and most of my good/newt chars have made this there home for the bulk of levels 12-35.<br>
<br>
How do you rate the towns?? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ublerx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blerx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/11/01 10:47:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4177.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rank the Towns.....</span><hr size=1> Only *really* familiar with neriak as I've only ever played darkelf.<br>

Levitate is a must for those fighting in this city in the trees.<br>
<br>
Qeynos - A little on the large side, but this town has a lot to offer.  Too bad so few use the boat to Odus, or the city would be a bit more populated.  Its distance from higher level hunting grounds also makes it a bit empty at times.<br>
<br>
Freeport - One of the most tradeskill friendly towns on the map.  Wish the bank wasn't so far from the newbie hunting areas.<br>
<br>
Grobb - The city isn't the greatest, but one of the better areas for newbies to start.  You can get a ton of exp doing the bone chip quest, but building faction for kos races here is quite difficult.<br>
<br>
Kaladim - Great town for smiths, and other tradeskillers.  Some good quests available here too.<br>
<br>
Ogguk - Tradeskills are available to larger races here, but not as readily as other towns.  A bit difficult to learn at first, but pretty easy once you get used to it.  Best thing, don't have to duck to go anywhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Freeport - One of the most tradeskill friendly towns on the map.  Wish the bank wasn't so far from the newbie hunting areas.<br>

<br>
Felwithe - Always wondered why you have to go North from northern Felwithe to get to Southern Felwithe...  Other than that, lots of spells available here (unless you're a necro).<br>
<br>
Erudin - A must for most INT casters, as there are many spells available here.  Other than that, its location leaves its potential untapped.<br>
<br>
Neriak - Though I have used this town from time to time, I mostly just know how to get to the bank.  Wish I knew more about it.<br>

Bank, shop and train in one place.  Next to the best Newbie Zone in the game, Misty Thicket.  Can fight and sell in the same zone in bordering Misty.  Faction can be make by killing many, many orcs in EC.<br>
<br>
Freeport - Great City.  Excellent support of most Trade Skills.  Newbie grounds Require no zoning for selling.  Borders the Commons, excellent place for farming Tailoring and xp/faction hunting (Orc camps for faction in RV and FP).  Auctions in EC make it a good home base to bank, resupply and sell loot.  Faction can be make killing orcs, then turning in belts and doing the note quest.<br>
<br>
All of Faydwere - Sucks.  Huge  zones full of 12 year-old chatter.  Tree city is worse to navigate than Neriak (before you learn the layout).  Newbs helplessly lost.  Ask the Goods how good hunting is in the area.<br>
<br>
Neriak - Coolest theme in the game.   Beautiful city.  Three zones in a series makes runs to town a pain.  Nek is lousy lowbie hunting ground.  Easiest faction, with cash and someone to invis you.  Get the alcoholic in the library hammered.  Biggest complaints:  Most trainers in Third Gate (too many LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...)  and tradeskill issues: Molds in FQ-Forge in NC, Metal in FQ-Gems in TG, Patterns in TG instead of closer zone to hunting grounds, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
Qeynos / Surefall Glade - Greatest value is access to bowyer supplies without having to go to Faydwere.<br>
<br>
No strong opinions on other cities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ujphive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JPhive</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Message Board Warrior</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/11/01 12:11:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4177.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Towns!</span><hr size=1> cab is da best i hate de town too many fucking zone and too many ways to go <p><img src="http://colorsprays.netfirms.com/pldecals/number1.jpg">
