Religion has been one of the most fought over topics in the history of mankind. Since the dawn of human civilization, our minds have seemed to hold an inborn impulse of sorts causing most or all humans to arrive to the conclusion that there is another world out there beyond our natural senses, a world that exists beyond the threshold of our existence. Humans have used religion to attempt to define this other world and other things they could not understand or sense. Such was the case in our earlier years. <br>
<br>
As far back as the ‘teen’ and later centuries when our scientific and medical knowledge was extremely limited, religions and settled beliefs (dogma) were rising. Famous ones nowadays include Catholicism, a derivative of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Taoism, and the Protestants. Christianity is arguably the most disputed religion at the current moment. It's attacked the most along with polytheism (the belief in many gods) and monotheism (the belief in one god). But first, what is god? <br>
<br>
God, to many humans, is the omniscient and omnipotent doyen of the spiritual world. The very essence of all that is good, evil, and everything in between. The friend who is there when others are not, the one person who will listen when others will not. These are just a few example of why a god or gods would be created. Someone who could help others through personal tribulations or problems when others will not or can not help. The Romans had a god for practically every purpose - war, commerce, crops, etc. The Egyptians, too, had their own set of gods. Ra, the sun god, Isis, the mother goddess, Geb, the god of the earth, and Anubis, the god of the dead. According to Egyptian mythology, Anubis would weigh the heart of the dead against Maat's (daughter of Ra, symbol of laws of existence) Feather of Truth. If the heart was heavy with sin, the scales would be tipped and if they weighed the same the person was free of sin. <br>
<br>
All this is very good and fine, however the question of the reasoning behind creation of these gods has not yet been addressed. The logic in the creation of these supernatural entities were to inspire people to abide by the laws put fourth by the leaders (Kings, Caesars, or otherwise) and live without violence or causing other's harm. <br>
<br>
Anubis was created to practically scare the people into living a good life so they would have no fear when they would meet him to be judged. Mercury - the Roman god of commerce, eloquence, travel, cunning, and theft who served as a herald to the other gods - was created so people could pray that their trading would go well or they would probably pray to him before embarking on a journey in which they would have to cover a considerable amount of distance. Mars - the Roman god of war - was created for the Roman legionnaires before they would get into battle or for Roman citizens to pray for the armies during warfare. All very logical reasons, and they believed so strongly in their false deity it put them in a state of mind that nothing bad would happen. And karma, as Eastern belief would define it, made certain it wouldn't because the mind was put into an optimistic state almost as if induced by a drug. If it did, then it would be regarded as fate's hand. <br>
<br>
However, through the ages when our scientific knowledge gradually augmented with technological break-throughs and enhancements that changed our way of life and our society (not to mention how we think), people eventually dropped the polytheistic belief and developed into a monotheistic age of religion such as the Islamic faith and Judaism. Now we are in an age where Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are among the top ten of the most popular religions. Mind you, polytheistic religions still exist but are now more common in tribal religions and Eastern dogma such as Hinduism and Buddhism. <br>
<br>
Christianity is what happens when idiots take a good idea and turn it into something it is not. In my personal opinion, Christianity was first developed to preach compassion and unity. Christianity was preached by mouth for over a decade before the Bible was written. That's when, in my opinion, it all fell apart. The message of the Bible was misinterpreted by idiots, the meaning tarnished. People began delving too deep into the dogma. With the separation of the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox church, Christianity was forever doomed to become the idiot's religion. <br>
<br>
Christianity is also the most often taken advantage of. When we turn on the TV, we see people preaching the bible and their interpretation of it, their own experiences, their revelations and thoughts. Comforting and babying the people with what they want to hear while coaxing them to leave their auditorium with a light heart . . . and a light wallet. I can guarantee you only about 10 to 20% of that money goes to the Pope. These are the people that deface religions such as Christianity, but unfortunately it had all ready lost its credibility. Catholicism clings too much to the bible and the foundation of the church, and in the following paragraph I will illustrate the logical reasons why. <br>
<br>
At one point in history, the Pope had reign over practically the entire known world. The Bible was constantly rewritten and revised with all original copies having been destroyed by the Romans or extensive warfare throughout Europe. It had been modified and edited so the Pope could maintain his seat of power and give him practically unlimited power. Consumed by greed, such as the politicians of the Soviet Empire and modern Russian Federation era. The Communist manifesto was revised by Stalin so he and his Soviet cohorts could maintain their position of power and wealth - and it worked. For over seventy years, the Soviet Union was the root of the worldwide paranoia and fear. To this day, Russia's government remains corrupted by the men in power. The country is stricken with poverty, run by the mafia and a breeding ground for corruption. Anyone who was not corrupted was charged with it for fear they would get too close to something they were not supposed to see. <br>
<br>
But what is greed? Greed is avarice, and it's a common human trait. An oversimplification would be this example. A man with $75 in his pocket is content. The man with $750,000 wants more. Why? For his own personal satisfaction and out of fear so he does not end up like the man with only $75. Once they taste the sweet fruits of wealth and power their egos are augmented and they end up only thinking for themselves while incapable to care for anyone else's needs. By this train of thought, egos are dangerous. Egos have ruined lives before, this is why most dogma shuns greed and egos and promote sharing and modesty. Personally, I concur. <br>
<br>
However, the Pope lost his power and he is now a mere public figure but with an enormous amount of influence. And simple influence can go a long way, but it is getting to the point where even the Pope himself will lose all common ground he had ever held and become a figure of history. At the time this is being written, there is warfare raging in the Middle East with U.S. forces clashing with terrorist factions. The world is falling apart as fast as people can arrange it and all we can do is sit on the sidelines and watch the game that will either by some twisted hand of fate improve our world or spell out the final destruction of the human race. And perhaps for the better. <br>
<br>
The Catholic religion exists now as a mere money-making organization playing people like pawns in a game of chest in which they are out for the &quot;big money&quot;. People cling to it because it tells them what they want to hear and quells their fears of not knowing what exists beyond our threshold on life and in the spiritual world. By piecing together the information provided within this article, you can being to see a pattern developing. Religions can be honest, but they all seem to follow the same highway only perhaps on different lines. They change the way people think, act, and conduct themselves. But all in all, they all seem to stem from the same branch of providing order and control in this mad world of chaos. And people get suckered into it because they like their illusions and while they may not be conscious they are being lead on, they do not care or want to hear it because it is their own savior. This is why atheism is responded to so negatively because people are trying to force others into believing the truth. <br>
<br>
To put things in perspective, it's like a child with a fear of the dark. If you try to tell them to go sit in the dark, they will refuse. But if you start getting angry and yell at them, they'll respond and become emotionally shook up because they are being faced with a decision they would rather not make. They refuse to face their fears. They would rather live in fear than face the grim reality of their situation. And this is understandable, however often regarded as a sign of weak minds. People who are unable or unwilling to be freed because they are either not ready or simple refuse to subject themselves to a vulnerable, open-minded state in which anything is possible. They become close-minded, and the mind becomes clinically dead. Close-mindedness makes you a drone - a social automaton and a suckered pawn. Played by their own beliefs, mocked for their stupidity.  <p><center><img src=http://www.mcsweetie.com/tests/button9.jpg border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=121.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=121.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic><img src=http://www.shadowbane.ws/forum/forumadd.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=121.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1.threadControl?topicID=121.topic><img src=http://www.shadowbane.ws/forum/modonly.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=121.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=121.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sullonzekfrm1">Word on the Street<option value="sullonzekfrm3">Black Market<option value="sullonzekfrm7">Guilds<option value="sullonzekfrm8">The Art of the Kill<option value="sullonzekfrm9">Roleplaying<option value="sullonzekfrm10">Picture Perfect<option value="sullonzekfrm11">Hit List<option value="sullonzekfrm12">Take it Outside</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#939393>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzek>Sullon Zek Dark Community</a><font color=#939393> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzekfrm1>Word on the Street</a> <font color=#939393> - </font><a href="http://www.sullonzek.net">SullonZek.net</a><font color=#939393> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top">
