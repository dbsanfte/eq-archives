Remember seeing those nature films of how a lioness would capture a prey and then after wounding it would sick her cubs on it for experience and meat.  Well on this &quot;no-rules&quot; server, this is exactly what is happening.  As I see it, it is a legit tactic as someone said it earlier, they can do it to you, BUT you also can do it to them.<br>
<br>
As far a pvp experience loss, I agree it should be lessened or done away with to encourage more pvping. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udigits.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Digits</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/01 2:46:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.stratagand.freeservers.com/digits.jpg height=159 width=101></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting a high level to weaken, and then a lower level k</span><hr size=1> From what I understand, it's difficult because currently they use the hate list to determine XP/looting rights for mob kills.<br>
<br>
Now, I've not seen the code or anything, but this is what I've surmised from the information that has been provided:<br>
<br>
<br>
For every NPC wandering in Norrath, there is a table called the hate list.  In this table there are several fields including character names, current hate associated with that character, and total damage done.  This table was pretty large to begin with back when it had a limit of like 20 PCs, but then they went and expanded the hate lists of mobs as more raid encounters were added to the game.  This is a pretty fricken huge table to keep a copy of for every mob in the game.<br>
<br>
However, it's important that they keep this table.  It's used not only for calculating XP/looting rights, but for attacking decisions based on weighted agro and proximity, as well as agro logic for mobs 'assisting' their allies.  It's an integral part to NPC actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, what would spending server space on keeping a table like this for PCs get you?  More accurate looting/insignia rights...and not much else.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, the code is probably there, and it's probably viable and not TOO tough to do, but it would mean adding quite a bit of space and processing requirements for the already stressed servers.  I think that's the reason why they won't implement it.  Minimal returns for a significant investment...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
...or I could just be smoking the crack again... <p><center>

I'll just say first off that I do think it's a lame tactic and I don't have any intentions of going out with someone lower (or higher) to cause people exp loss.  PvP is a good time, if someone loses exp so be it, but that's not the whole point of it.<br>
<br>
That said, STFU.  God dammit, the server has no fucking rules in regards to PvP and it's been what.. a month and a half since opening?  And you people are still fucking griping about &quot;lame&quot; or &quot;honorless&quot; tactics.  Yes, we fucking know already.  We know they suck, we know they're there, we know people use them, we know you cry yourself to sleep.  Fucking deal with it.  FUCK.  It gets so god damn old hearing the same bullshit every day.  If you want a pussy server go play on one.  <br>
<br>
Let me offer you a Sullon Zek bootcamp.  Go buy Asheron's Call and try playing on Darktide.  If you can survive there you will come back a better man.  Right now you are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bitches</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  (And AC is pretty damn fun for the first 40 levels or so, so if you've never tried it it's a serious suggestion.)<br>
<br>
Sullon = No rules, no holds barred, STFU and deal.<br>
<br>
Server's been up since June 26th, get it through your fucking heads already.<br>

If a red gets me to nothin and has a green kill me then it's strategy.  We can do the same to them.  Those that complain and want them to change things are just gonna get the server made into a weakened state.  If you dont want to die and lose exp then don't play here.  Stop crying on the boards trying to change the rules when you knew damn well what the rules were going to be when you started.  This server is not an easy life and im my opinion the more chaotic and ruthless the better.  This is not a flame this is me expressing an opinion. thanks<br>

It was pretty funny fighting with Pumpkin in Blackburrow the other day.  Having all her green buddies actually try to damage me while she tried to root/blind me.  Course any melees that got close when I was rooted got ae feared away.  It was fun anyway Pumpkin.  Maybe I'll see you again sometime. <p><b>Malkar<br>

<br>
Remove levels' effects on resistances.<br>
<br>
Add in exp. gain for PvP kills.  Leave exp-loss the way it is.<br>
<br>
Code-in Loot and Scoot.. for instance, get rid of this Corpse Run crap (only in PvP - PvE deaths still result in a Corpse Run), and substitute exp-loss in its place.  When a player dies in PvP said player should respawn in a bordering zone (chosen at random by the system) at one of a bunch of pre-selected &quot;safe points.&quot;<br>

This would get rid of:<br>

That is the WHOLE fucking point of my whole post dude.  I am NOT bitching about the fact that i was killed like this.  Hell, i'm not bitching at all.  My whole point is that i would like some suggestions about how this should work.  And i encourage everyone to /feedback when you get back in the game.  Posting on a messageboard isn't going to do jack shit about the situation.  But /feedbacking sure as hell will.<br>
<br>
P.S.-  Arcanist, you can be our resident angry black man (Just trying to make a point =\.  Not trying to be racist.  I'm black myself.), who doesn't listen to any of the posts and just speaks his mind.  OK?  The play nice policy does NOT include having a red con do lots of damage and then an even wax them off.  This is an exploit of the system.  Zone plugging is NOT a tactic.  This is an exploit of the system.<br>
<br>
Do you fucking honestly think that if Verant could fix these problems by paying 1 buck that they would do it?  Hell yes they would.  Would they fix Training and Corpse camping?  NO.  Why?  Because THEY ARE NOT EXPLOITS OF THE GAME MECHANICS. <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

<br>
For one, the game was programmed in the beginning to allow corpse camping bind rushing ect ect.  These are actions that are NOT hardcoded against and there are no rules to stop them (in fact, the rules encourage them).<br>
<br>
Zone plugging makes the everquest system believe that upon zoning, you are an NPC.  NPC's CANNOT zone (not 98% of them anyway) and are not made to zone.  So when the game realizes that you are an NPC, it IMMEDIATELY stops the zoning process.  This is an exploit.  You are fooling the server into believing that you are doing something that you are not.  Similar to a speed hack.<br>
<br>
Having a higher player take you to 20% and then having a lower level finish you off is also an exploit, but on a much lower scale.  The game's mechanics on Sullon Zek are set up so when a higher level kills a target, he does not earn the reward that a lower level would earn.  And it SHOULD be that way.<br>
<br>
But having a higher level do most of the damage, and then the lower level finishes you off is NOT going along with the game mechanics (or the Vision(TM) if you will).  The game is programmed so higher level players do NOT earn a reward from hurting lower levels.  When a higher level does the most damage, and then a lower level kills (especially in my situation, where these two were traveling together, and were there for the purpose of griefing) is an exploit of the game mechanics.<br>
<br>
If the game is not meant to work like that, and you get around it, you ARE performing an exploit.<br>
<br>
Care to make a counter Grimjaw?  Or will you just ramble mindlessly about how Zone Plugging is such a great tactic because you can do it and because it is not currently punishable?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Look you little prissy-assed, cum-guzzling son of a bitch she-male.  THIS FUCKING SERVER IS NOT &quot;No rules&quot; THIS SERVER IS PLAYER GOVERNED YOU ASSMUNCHER.   Learn the god dammed mother fucking difference you piss-faced bastard.  If your faggot ass wants to stay in Tranvestite Nex that's your fucking problem, but don't post stupid ass shit.  Since this fucking server is &quot;No rules&quot; what if someone used a time hack to speed up the time on your corpse by oh say, 6 days and 23 hours?  Without your fucking ass knowing it.  What if all your gay assed equip got lost because of a hack?  OH FUCKING WELL, IT&quot;S A &quot;No Rules&quot; SERVER ISN&quot;T IT?  DON&quot;T WHINE BITCH, TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.  THAT'S WHY YOU CAME TO THIS SERVER RIGHT?  CAUSE IT'S NO RULES??<br>

<br>
<br>
Yes...there are no GM-implemented rules, at least where gameplay is concerned.  I came here because there would be &lt;b&gt;player-enforced&lt;/b&gt; rules.  These are never set in stone, but always changing, always developing, always adapting to suit the current need.  On this server, they've given us the freedom, and the means, to govern ourselves, for the most part.<br>
<br>
One way or another, we all have expectations, we all have our own &quot;vision [TM]&quot; of how the system should be.  Whatever the majority of the society agrees upon is the set of &quot;rules&quot; that will be implemented...given that they have the determination to enforce them.<br>
<br>
<br>
This isn't anarchy.  Whether we like it or not, we have an online society here, and every society has rules, even if they are unwritten.<br>
<br>
If you want no rules, no consequences, and no societal patterns, go play quake...cause that's not what this game is about...<br>
<br>
[EDIT]<br>
Heh...it amuses me to look at the difference of style in approaching this topic between Matrim and myself, when, in essence, we're saying pretty much the same thing.<br>

<br>
You constantly said, &quot;when a higher level kills a target, he does not earn the reward that a lower level would earn,&quot; which, as per your examples, is still the case.<br>
<br>
In the situation at hand, a higher level player doesn't kill a lower level one, and doesn't gain any sort of reward out of it - therefore, your post makes very little sense.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you have some sort of evidence proving that the system is created to avoid allowing lower level players low-risk points due to &quot;power-PKing&quot; (as it's roughly the flip side of power-leveling).. then you'd have something worthy of the tag, &quot;Counter.&quot;<br>

<br>
ok, tell me another faire tale when it is my bed time.<br>
////////<br>
last hit gets the kill.  any questions?<br>
<br>
is it fair? YES, anyone can do it.  If it can be done to you, it can be done to them.  The risk is the same, exp loss.<br>
<br>
is it smart game play?  HELL YES<br>
<br>
is it good game play? i would rather be smart first, being good comes after that.<br>
///////<br>
not a single person addressed having to let a PC get back to 51% health, if they had just finished killing a mob.<br>
<br>
not a single person addressed having a shaman canabalize 51% of his own health, and the consequences of killing him then.<br>
///////<br>
training is legal. isn't rooting then training?  if you are going to lose exp anyway, what difference does it make if it is the lowbie that gets the death blow or a sand giant?  you got yourself in that position, live with it.<br>
/////<br>
spells sticking is based on lvls.  any questions?<br>
<br>
get any resist up to 200, go and try a magic casting mob.  go try a  evil eye that out lvls you by 20, with 110 MR.  do you think you won't get charmed??<br>
<br>
get your Cold up to huge, and go in Perma with the casters, you don't think your skin won't freeze if they are tombstone red?<br>
<br>
once again, it is fair because it is the same.  if someone does it to your team, someone on your team can do it to them.<br>
/////<br>
lastly, is it the best Verant can do?  i don't know; but with the dropping population that we already have, don't expect much help from Verant.  I am surprised we ever got this server to begin with.<br>
