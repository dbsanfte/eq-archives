<br>
Exploits:<br>
- Fixed a bug that allowed people to trade no-drop items.<br>
- Fixed a dupe exploit involving banks.<br>
- Fixed the exploit involving the runspeed debuff nano program.<br>
<br>
Stability:<br>
- Fixed several bugs to improve server stability.<br>
- Fixed a server crash caused by a failure to complete a certain type of teleport.<br>
- Fixed the most common client crash reported. It happened due to a bug in the animation-system.<br>
- Fixed a client crash caused by the highlighting (&quot;flashing&quot;) of people's heads when chatting.<br>
- Fixed a number of crashes in the rendering-engine.<br>
- Fixed a client crash, caused by certain visual effects.<br>
- Fixed a memory leak that occurred whenever other characters enter/leave view-range.<br>
- Improved playfield shifting into dungeons. This will be noticeable as an improved probability of your character to shift playfields.<br>
<br>
<br>
RPG Tweaks, Bugs and Changes:<br>
- Several broken Insurance Terminals are fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
- A redefinition of the way monsters fight have been implemented:<br>
1. Ranged combat monsters will no longer attack with close combat attacks when you melee them. The effect of this is that monsters close and far away deal the same amount of damage.<br>
2. High-level monsters have more hit points.<br>
3. Monsters lower than you in level, fight slower, and higher than you faster. This should make soloing green monsters more accessible to professions that deal less damage. <br>
4. The experience points earned when killing a monster have been increased. This has been done to make killing monsters an alternative to doing missions on higher levels. <br>
5. Monsters have had their Minimum Damage reduced, and Maximum Damage increased. The overall damage output is somewhat lower than before. This change will also make armor more effective. <br>
<br>
<br>
- The Martial Arts Skill attack has had its damage output increased somewhat above 200 in skill. Also the damage range is increased, and the critical minimally increased. This was done to fix a problem where people attacking with unarmed skill only did minimum damage.<br>
- The mystical line of skills locking Martial Arts, like Attack of the Snake, has been remade. They have higher damage output, but all locks the Martial Arts skill. Several bugs have also been fixed. <br>
- Flurry of Blows no longer locks the Fast Attack skill. It has had its effectiveness somewhat improved and some bugs removed.<br>
- The Adventurer Ranged Multiple Skill increase cost has been reduced.<br>
- Some armor has been tweaked. Note: Omni-Tek labeled armor is now for OT employees only. If you're wearing the armor now, you will not be forced to remove it if you are clan / neutral. But if you do, you cannot put it back on. <br>
- Changed character movement rules: You will now move slower when you are seriously injured.<br>
- Fixed a bug in the skill locked timer system. This made some special attacks and other items locking your skill recycle too slowly. You should see First Aid and special attacks respond more rapidly.<br>
- Effect of Aggression Enhancer increased, making it easier to &quot;taunt&quot;. Please remember that you must allocate points to your Psychology skill to use &quot;higher quality&quot; Aggression Enhancers. Do not expect your quality level 4 AE to be good enough when you have reached level 15.<br>
- Several new valuables should be found in treasure-chests.<br>
- Trade-skill items for melee weapons are now available. <br>
- Several new melee weapons and some new distance weapons<br>
- The Breathing Space weapon-line has been fixed. No more Long Range Energy skill is required there (Energy Melee weapon skill instead).<br>
- The Seburo weapon-line has been fixed. No more Mechanical Engineering needed for use.<br>
- Some unique monsters with unique items have been added to some playfields. <br>
- Rebalanced some weapons. Most quality level 50+, one-handed weapons have had their Multi-Ranged skill requirement increased.<br>
- Some lower-quality weapons have had their Dual Wield skill somewhat increased.<br>
<br>
Trader nano-programs:<br>
- Added a new &quot;mind-control&quot; line of Nano Programs for the Trader. <br>
- Lowered the credit cost of the nano-drain line.<br>
- Lowered the execution time of the health-drains a little.<br>
- Increased the execution time of the skill-drains a little.<br>
- Changed resist-rates on skill-drains.<br>
<br>
Doctor, Agent, Nanotechnician nano programs:<br>
- Damage Over Time (DOT) nano-programs no longer do a range of damage. The result of this is that the damage output has been slightly increased for some of the programs, while others remain the same.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nanotechnician nano-programs:<br>
- Fixed the effects on the humidity extractors.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enforcer nano-programs:<br>
- The Rage line of nano-programs now use Material Metamorphoses instead of Time &amp; Space for its criteria check.<br>
- Extended the duration of the Mongo buff by 2x at the low end, and 3x at the high end.<br>
- Extended the duration of the Challenger line of nano programs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Martial Artist nano-programs:<br>
- Extended the duration of the super damage buffs by approximately 10 seconds each.<br>
<br>
<br>
Adventurer nano-programs:<br>
- Added several new nano-programs for the Adventurer, increasing his ability to heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Soldier nano-programs:<br>
- Soldier Mirror Shields have had their &quot;damage returned&quot; aspect changed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Grid Access nano-programs:<br>
- Added for Fixer, Doctor and Trader <br>

Our weapon buffs are only a bit better then the general ones. Health buffs are a waste of IP. AC buffs are decent. Taunts are not as good as Enforcers. Haste... umm what haste are you talking about? Damage buffs are same as general ones until you pile a bucket-load of IP for the good one which is a while a way.<br>

<br>
Soldiers aren't the only ones that have a huge advantage in PvP. Another thing though, depending how you PvP, anyone can beat a Soldier. Is PvP the only reason why Full Auto and Burst should be nerfed? There are other ways to solve these problems, but Funcom likes to do them differently it seems.<br>

Haste, as in Init Buffs... you know, make you go faster?<br>
<br>
Taunts, so you don't have the BESTEST ones... more than the none that I have. (And before you say I have a bunch of stuff that you dont have, its only pets. Apart from that, I have AC and DamageReflect/DamageShield buffs)<br>
<br>
Health Buffs, and everything else you consider a waste of IP. Thats your choice, doesnt change the fact you do have them if you want them.<br>
<br>
Burst/FA. I am mainly talking about PvP here, yes. Because that is where it gives a huge advantage over other players. And yes, some other classes also have a large advantage. And incase we aren't clear, they havent actually done anything to them yet, apart from make them faster.<br>
<br>
By saying you think there are other ways to fix it (other, as in different to the nothing they have done so far?) you admit that there is a problem with them as they currently stand.<br>

Alot of shit needs to be fixed and alot of classes need work. Breaking a class as a quick fix isn't the answer...  It's obvious you don't care how it effects gameplay and as soon as all you crybabies knock the soldiers down  and another class is the more powerful you'll start all over again.<br>

<br>
Who's the crybaby?<br>
<br>
Mirror shield needed a nerfin, just like FA's it was obvious it was coming.  I laugh at all the people that invested 10's of thousands of IP into pistol just because FA's were the uber weapon of the time when it was so obvious they'd get fixed.  <br>
I don't necessarily like the way they changed the mirror shield, but something had to be done.  I'd much rather that than have them say you can't get xp for red mobs anymore or you can't even hit mobs 8 levels higher like some games.<br>
<br>
Full auto/burst could also use some 'tuning' for PvP.  Nobody should be able to PK with a single shot.  I don't think AC is being taken into account for each bullet that hits out of the full auto, it seems to be making just one check for all or nothing.<br>
Switching guns mid-fight (to pull out your big full auto/burst weapon for a quick blast) also seems like an exploit.  Don't be surprised when they put a huge 15 second timer on switching guns.<br>
<br>

Get a grip dude, Soldiers have alot going for them and you chuck a hissy fit when one thing is changed... I can't believe your calling everyone ELSE a crybaby.<br>
<br>
This was a matter of game balance. When I first saw the mirror exploit being used in Lush Hills, some guy shouted out &quot;Oh great, does this mean we all have to reroll as soldiers now?&quot;. Its people who flock to a class that is considered the most powerful, then bitch and moan when whatever sparkly toy is changed or removed that really get on my nerves.<br>
<br>
What you don't seem to get is that noone wants Soldiers knocked down, they want them balanced, so they are equal to other classes, not greater or less than. You, on the other hand, seem to want your class to be better than everyone else, and if they aren't you have a tantrum and quit :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udraelyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Draelyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#778899>(8/28/01 2:42:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/faoemarrfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Patch</span><hr size=1> I've gotta go with Virral and everyone else on this matter who took two minutes to think about the implications, including soldiers. I'm not a soldier, so this issue doesn't hit so close to home, however I'm a competing class, an enforcer. I don't mind the soldiers being a stronger class than mine, exploit or no. But going into Lush to see 40th+ soldiers killing slayer droids that are, I've been told, as old as 95, and soloing them to boot, thats just wrong.

Yeah they chose a simple one, who cares? Its fixed now, it wasnt before.<br>
<br>
I like to point out the obvious. <br>
<br>
Also, the nerf with the MK Shield was a bit drastic, but something had to be done(yes I agree it should be nerfed, but there are different lvls of nerfing anything. example: Everquest). I knew it was powerful, and I like using the Shield since it reduces the damage to where it can be useful. The reflected part was just a bonus for me... I thought most Soldiers felt the same...<br>

Taunts, so you don't have the BESTEST ones... more than the none that I have. (And before you say I have a bunch of stuff that you dont have, its only pets. Apart from that, I have AC and DamageReflect/DamageShield buffs)<br>
<br>
Health Buffs, and everything else you consider a waste of IP. Thats your choice, doesnt change the fact you do have them if you want them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry, never really considered it as a haste. It's a bit better then the general ones. <br>
<br>
I'm not complaining about the Taunt buffs, just stating the facts. <br>
<br>
Yes, you are right about the Health Buffs - they are available. If you look closely, we have only 3 different versions of the health buffs which are only a small upgrade to the general ones. If Funcom wants, they should give this health buff to every class so they may benefit as much as Soldiers do. <br>

Burst/FA. I am mainly talking about PvP here, yes. Because that is where it gives a huge advantage over other players. And yes, some other classes also have a large advantage. And incase we aren't clear, they havent actually done anything to them yet, apart from make them faster.<br>
<br>
I completely agree with you here(Pvp Wise). Something needs to be done, I already suggested something to Funcom, but they never respond back.<br>
<br>
Here's a good thread talking about the Burst/Full Auto nerf: <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchylore.com/MB_SHOW.asp?FID=39&FN=Anarchy+Hall&SID=9&SN=Anarchy+Online&TID=1086251&TN=&CAT=General&SURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eanarchylore%2Ecom&PL=3">www.anarchylore.com/MB_SH...2Ecom&PL=3</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

On another note, look at the Nano-Tech's, they are Soldiers that use those high dmg nano's as their weapon instead of guns.<br>

By saying you think there are other ways to fix it (other, as in different to the nothing they have done so far?) you admit that there is a problem with them as they currently stand.<br>

How would YOU fix it? <br>
<br>
Yes, I do admit it - there are problems with Soldiers, big or small that needs to be dealth with. Even though, they shouldn't 'nerf' us to the point of people quiting with disgust.<br>
<br>
How would I fix it? I have to find my e-mail I sent, but there is a small list. Which problems do you want an answer from?<br>

<br>
Dude, are we talking about your level 10 buffs or what? Look at the big picture for a second, your not going to have huge buffs at low levels, noone does!<br>
<br>
Soldiers do get large weapon buffs, including one that boosts every ranged skill by 50 at once. You get a buff that increases all inits by 133, a 400ish health buff, around 500 in free ac, along with lots of other things.<br>
<br>
Don't go telling me the nano's you get are only alittle better than the general ones, because thats total bull. Not to mention, the ones you have will probably all STACK with the general ones, lol.<br>
<br>
As for the FA/Burst thing, it was news to me that there was a change on test (For those who don't know, currently on test if you use a special such as flingshot, you cannot use another untill flingshot has refreshed.) But I would like to remind you that not everything that goes onto test will make it live, and if they want to TEST a change, to see how it works, it goes to TEST.<br>
<br>
I will admit, that the change would be welcome in PvP situations, but I have to say as it stands now it is very extreme, and removes alot of the tactical decision from using weapons. Who is going to fling when they could burst? And who is going to use FullAuto, when Burst will refresh alot faster?<br>
<br>
A better solution would probably be to put a timer between using specials... say 20 seconds, so you can't just Fling/Burst/FA all at once, they are alittle more spread out to even things up alittle.<br>
<br>
How Funcom will eventually change things, remains to be seen. But what I don't think needs debating, is that SOMETHING has to change.<br>
<br>

These same people all know something had to be done about the mirror exploit.. Hell i have never solo'd anything close to red and i only used it in PvP once when i zoned out of a mission in a political zone at 1/4 HPs. What i was saying is what they did to the spell was very harsh.. It sure as hell isn't close to being &quot;a soldiers best friend&quot; as the spell was advertised.<br>
<br>
And the way they are going Soldiers will most likely be close to worthless in PvE which is where probably 90% of the game is played for the vast majority<br>

<br>
Alright, I think we all know no one will have superior buffs at lower lvl's. The point and fact still remains, even though we have it, doesn't mean we will use all the buffs Funcom gives to us.<br>
<br>
For instance, if a Trader recieved a good portion of the Doctor's nano's would they use it? It would depend what lvl the Trader would be and how much IP he has remaining.<br>
<br>
My point: For people higher lvl's, they got screwd by Funcom and have to find a way to go around how they planned everything.<br>
<br>
The buffs you've just described are the extreme high lvls, like around at least 200+(won't even add how much skill it is to use even one of the nano's). Will anyone even achieve that lvl with how Funcom deals with issues lately?<br>
<br>
Ok ok, just about all our low lvl(around 28 and lower) Soldier nano's are a tad bit better then the General ones(to be more specific).<br>
<br>
Test Server? Test-Test-Test. It's just an experimentation. Most things they've touched on seems to go live, maybe luck will turn up once more for us!<br>
<br>
Yeah, I agree with the PvP issue once again. I prefer not choosing over to flingshot, burst or full-auto.<br>
