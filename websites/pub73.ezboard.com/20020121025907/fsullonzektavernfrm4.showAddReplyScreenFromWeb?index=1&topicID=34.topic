<br>
The Tephysian Guard Charter (Sullon Zek)<br>
<br>
Four figures sat about a table in a private room, the oil lamps casting flickering shadows across their faces, illuminating the finery of their clothing that matched the opulent furniture, as this was the best lodging offered in High Pass Keep. On the table was a finely drawn map of Norrath, a few details lacking from the newly discovered continents, but otherwise accurate for the state of cartography available. <br>
<br>
"Here is the center of our realms gentlemen...where all the trade routes in Antonica meet and pass through, those not haunted by Trolls, Ogres, or the vile Tier'dal that is." The tall erudite spoke smoothly, his gloved finger pointing out the point on the map that marked High Pass, "And even just beyond this guarded valley our lands are not safe...due to the vile evil the dark ones have unleashed, the forces of Innoruuk nightly assail travelers through Kithicor forest! Daily the strength of the dark ones grow, encroaching upon our borders and trade routes, interfering with our explorers and emissaries in the new lands." His brows furrowed as he stared about the table, "Milords..we are the heads of our local governments..the rulers of Men, Erudites, Elves, and Barbarians. We owe it to our people to make the lands we claim safe throughout...to show our justice and presence beyond the lands patrolled by our individual city guards." <br>
<br>
Each of the four nodded, pondering the situation, their gazes on the map and the lands detailed on the parchment. The silence was unbroken until the human with the insignia of Qeynos spoke, looking up at the erudite from beneath his bristling black eyebrows, "So you said when you sent word asking to meet with us here. What then, do you have in mind?" <br>
<br>
The erudite smiled, beckoning to the barbarian sitting at the table, "Well...long ago, in the final battle of Kithicor, a Knight of Tunare named Tephys led our armies.  Even though he fell there, foiling Innoruuk's full incursion into Norrath, his standard and arms were preserved, taken to Halas for safekeeping until time of need.  I propose we create an order of Champions in his name, giving them the badge of Tephys, so that Evil will see those who carry it and know that we will defend our lands.  We should make this Tephysian Guard warders of our laws, representatives of our people to fight back the evil that threatens us all." <br>
<br>
At his words, the tall barbarian placed an ancient wooden chest on the table, the worn carvings upon it showing the symbol of a silver, eight pointed star. He spoke, his voice booming about the suddenly quiet room, his eyes stern upon the others, "In this chest are the badges worn by Tephys' honor guard fashioned onto baldricks.  One heirloom remains, also within, the circlet of the Head of the Order, said to give insight to the one that led the Knight's, allowing his gaze to see far and through any veils which would cloud men's minds. Whether it retains its power, none can say." <br>
<br>
Clearing his throat, the elvish lord gestured at the box, "Since it seems we all agree that the need is upon us to form this Order once more, who then shall lead the Guard and wear the Circlet...whom shall they be..and where shall they meet?" <br>
<br>
The erudite tapped the map again, "The city of Qeynos, near the Western Seas shall be the home of their order, as it is near the seat of our councils.  As to whom shall lead..."  He glanced at each of the lords in turn, his eyes glittering keenly, "I propose we gather the finest of our warriors and mages alike...to hold a choosing in Qeynos...surely one may be chosen by the Gods of Light who will lead our Guard."  He lowered his voice, gesturing at the door, "They shall roam the world, enforcing justice and protecting our people...so we must choose them carefully. Each of them can ask aid at any of our cities and their symbol shall be a sign of the nobility and honor of our races." <br>
<br>
Reaching in the box, the erudite took forth a black baldric, an eight pointed star of silver metal fashioned as the shoulder clasp, "This will be the badge of the Tephysian Guard one all of them will wear." <br>
<br>
Wiping his fingers on a satin napkin, the elven lord put his goblet of wine on the table, "Well then, what of the neutrals, such as dwarves and the like?  They are not a threat to our ways such as those who follow the Evil Gods are, but they have been known to mercenary themselves off to one side or the other...or withdrawing into the wilds such as the Followers of Karana are wont to do.  Will be allowed in the Guard of our people...? Or are they our enemies like the Evil ones are?"<br>
<br>
A babble of voices rose about the table as each of the lords argued, quieting as the erudite cleared his throat, "Certainly milords..we can't have any of our races that dabble in the dark arts as members of the Guard, that much is true, they are our enemies.  It is also certain, that no matter how 'good' any individual of the dark races presents themselves to be, they can not represent our peoples...so they are also prohibited from joining the Guard."<br>
<br>
The elf nodded slightly, his thin eyebrows arched, "How does the Guard stand on the neutrals then?  Each of our kingdoms have those that follow the Grey Gods, professing to neither Light or Dark."<br>
<br>
The erudite nodded, expecting this question, "Well...even those that have not joined the light are of our own kind...thus, the Guard will not attack those who do not oppose them, they will not hesitate to bring to justice those that attack the Light or side with Evil.  The Guard's foremost cause will be to champion and defend light, and protect our lands as well." <br>
<br>
"Now then.." he sat, steepling his fingers, "Shall we discuss what we want their code to be? What duties and responsibilities are?" <br>
<br>
And so, for long hours, the discussion went on, the seeds of a noble order planted once more, one that would perhaps change the face of Norrath. <p>Aerick Northstar, Knight Errant of Tunare</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern>Sullon Zek Tavern</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm4>Guilds of Sullon Zek</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Sullon Zek PvP Stats !!</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-groccouons&BL=groc>PRINT FREE GROCERY COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
