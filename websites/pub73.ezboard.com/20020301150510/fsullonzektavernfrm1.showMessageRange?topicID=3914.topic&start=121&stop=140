<br>
The people that came from bluebie land and choosed to do PvE to the max while having absolutely no skill in PvP, never lived with the fear of losing anything, these people will have a very hard time to adapt. Because you never learned to die at lower level on a PvP server, you are taking it as an extreme injustice now.<br>
<br>
Now for Pino's case.... He seems a cool guy, but well... it's war, sorry. When i joined the server, my VZ friends told me, and especially Milt, i'd get trained, bind camped, AFK camped and the life would be hell sometimes. I took the challenge, i died a ton, i knew i would and i don't complain about it. <br>
<br>
Did Pino complain ? No. Did he accept the *rules&quot; ? Yes, so why you go up arguing like that almost talking for him ?<br>
<br>
Would i do it to someone like DB did to Pino ? Probably not. Will that protect me from suffering the same by Evils ? No.<br>
Will DB continue to do it ? Yes. Will Ruin ever learn ? Dunno<br>
Will we have big griefing battles in TOV/WW/ST ? OMG YES!<br>

It's not because I wouldn't AFK camp people, but FOUR POST 50 LVLS!  That's ALOT.<br>
<br>
Yes, I train people.  Yes, I root people who are green to me and train them rather than kill them so I cause them XP loss.  Yes I corpse camp.  Yes I kill people who are very green to me.  Yes I use my pet to attempt to cause XP loss.  Yes I zoneplug.<br>
<br>
When the same happens to me, I accept it.  When I get trained, as long as the person doesn't talk smack about how much he pwend me, I say nothing about it.  When I die and lose XP, I accept.  When people zoneplug against me, I generally wait a few mins then give up, and accept.<br>
<br>
Would I camp some guy for FOUR post 50 lvls?  I don't think so.  There's a vision we all had when we came here about how this server would be.  I envisioned training, corpse camping, bind camping, and the like.  I never envisioned some guy with narcalepsy getting fucked over because of it.  I find that very difficult to accept.<br>

<br>
It's just a game.  He is high level because he obviously likes PvE.  Well, now he gets a little more of it then he bargained for.  But, what in real-life has he really lost?  <br>
<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
He could stay 54 for the rest of his EQ career and have a blast at PKing.  Or, he can do some more of the PvE stuff he cleary enjoys, and he'll be right back where he was soon enough.<br>

It blows to lose that much XP, sure, but that's the risk of Sullon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=egosmasher>Egosmasher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/4/01 5:21:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3914.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IE Defeats DB &amp; TDC, Ruin monk comments on PvP and D</span><hr size=1> /agree Frosthound, You dont have to be 60 to have fun, that would be plain lame.Just had to add to this cause everyone else did and you guys were all pretty much attacking my guild,ALL YOU EVIL PANSIES GRIEF!ALL YOU WHINY ASS GOODS GRIEF!

<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
I don't run around doing /guildstat on everyone, I assume they're part of the people they're hanging around with.  This is generally the case.  Kinda like Frawg training people in TOV on Vallon.  He ported over with SS, went in with SS, left with SS.  That pretty well defined it for me.<br>
<br>
And yes, the reason I didn't train people on Vallon was because causing XP loss was against the rules.  I don't see causing XP loss to be &quot;assholeish&quot; any more than I see shooting someone in the foot with a Quake rocketlauncher to be &quot;assholeish&quot;.  On Vallon I ddn't do it because it was against the rules, on Sullon it's just part of the game.  Pino himself didn't seem to be upset at all by it, so I hardly see what the fuss is about.  It's only &quot;griefing&quot; if the person you're doing it to feels grief, and Pino obviously doesn't.<br>
<br>
I dare say if the same thing happened to me, I wouldn't feel griefed either.  I knew the rules.  In Quake you have to accept spawncampers and guncampers, even though it's a type of gameplay designed to give them points at the expense of your gameplay, it's just part of the game.<br>
<br>
Are you going to let someone grab the rocketlauncher when you could stop them?  Just going to let them have it to be polite?  Are you going to let someone be level 59 when you have it in your power to make them level 54?<br>
<br>
I see it as the same thing.  It's a legal opportunity to weaken the enemy.  Pino died again last night, because someone landed snare on him.  The reason snare landed, no doubt, is because he was not level 59 anymore.<br>
<br>
This is just the way I play all games: to win.  &quot;Winning&quot; in EQ is a poorly defined term, but I dare say wiping 5 levels off of someone is a step in that direction.  Is it nice?  No.  Do you play games to be nice?  No.  If we're playing chess and I make a dumbass move that lets you take my queen, I expect you to take my queen, I would be vaguely irritated if you made another move just to be nice to me.<br>
<br>
I expect people to play to win, and to do things within the rules to accomplish that.<br>

I agree, it's a game.  I know he's another human being.<br>

However, in a game, what I do doesn't effect his real life unless he allows it to.<br>
<br>
If he allows it to, it's his own fuckin' fault.<br>
<br>
This is a virtual war; his avatar was a virtual victim.<br>
<br>
Get a life and quit getting so worked up over losing levels on a videogame, eh? (And before anyone points out the insulting nature of this statement - I'm simply mocking his &quot;Get a life k thxs^^&quot; post).<br>
<br>
&quot;but FOUR POST 50 LVLS! That's ALOT.&quot;<br>
<br>
That's the whole fuckin' point.<br>
<br>
The more it hurts the enemy the better.<br>
<br>
&quot;I never envisioned some guy with narcalepsy getting ------ over because of it. I find that very difficult to accept.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was sort of hoping that those people unfortunate enough to have such disorders would either:<br>
<br>
A)   Choose a different server.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
B)  Deal with it.<br>
<br>
Pino seems to be doing the second option, and I'm cool with that.  However, he chose his server for himself; no one else did.  When he created a characterf on Sullon Zek he ran the risk, and knew something like this might happen.  He had every chance in the world to pick a more merciful server.<br>

If we're gonna play, let's play.  I don't play games hoping the other person gives me &quot;breaks&quot; to be &quot;nice&quot;.  I expect mistakes to be taken full advantage of, I look for them to make mistakes that I can take advantage of.  That's the very definition of a game.<br>
<br>
As it turns out, EQ is one of the most drawn out games ever made, one that you'll spend months working on.  It's easy to come overly attached to it.  People have become so attached that minor setbacks like 3 unrezzable deaths in a row in POF makes them quit, or the server crashes and they lose a valuable and ultrarare piece of equipment that had just dropped 2 minutes prior, etc.<br>
<br>
As they say, it's just a game.  If you're so attached to the social aspect that you're willing to intentionally avoid trying to win, then why bother playing?  That's like suggesting the quarterback not try to fake a handoff, because the last time he did it they scored a touchdown and the other team was depressed they didn't get to tackle anyone.<br>
<br>
(You might play with intentional handicaps if you want a competitive game with someone who is simply not up to your skill level, e.g., as in golf, but I don't think that really applies here.)<br>

&quot;Agrul, learn how to lose a fucking arguement, huh? Being an apologist for the most unattractive excess of DB to date is pretty spineless.&quot;<br>
<br>
Apologizing?  Mistaken on your part.<br>
<br>
I don't apologize for it; in fact, I've spent most of my posts on this thread explaining why exactly we don't have to (apologize for it).<br>
<br>
&quot;Get a few weeks of hard work (However you choose to define leveling 55-59) chewed up and see how bloody sanguine you are about the fierce beauty of war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I don't have narcalepsy, nor do I have any intention of playing in enemy territory when I know I may fall asleep (or become otherwise disabled).<br>
<br>
&quot;La la, shouldn't fall asleep playing EQ, especially SZ, you should know that, blah blah.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said that.  I claimed that he chose his server for himself; the rules don't bend for you if you chose such a harsh gaming environment.<br>
<br>
&quot;But if one day Agrul came to at his keyboard and saw his GM-booted character sitting there at level 18, I don't think he'd be chuckling about it with the guys.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chuckling?<br>
<br>
Hell no.  I'd be pissed.<br>
<br>
But I'd be pissed at myself for being fucking stupid, and not go on and on about how horribly inhumane it was of my enemy to take advantage of my vulnerability.<br>

<br>
I play poker, I play a LOT of poker.<br>
<br>
In poker you have nice players, mean players, good players, bad players, drunk players, etc etc...  In poker, the object is always to win, to take the other guy's money.  I like to equate this to what PvP is all about.  You can be as nice and gentile as you want, but the goal is to take the other guy's money, or, to kill him for exp loss and insigs.  The more the other guy loses, the more you win.  Pino just got his whole bankroll wiped out.  It happens.<br>
<br>
The nature of this game is to hurt the other guy.  Deal with it.  Nice poker players typically lose.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.<br>
