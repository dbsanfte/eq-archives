<br>
One thing I find suprising: the poster is very, very specific (in terms of data and numbers) about the changes to Complete Heal and the Mod Rod thing, but fairly vague when explaining the &quot;corrections&quot; to the defensive abilities of monks.<br>
<br>
In any case, it seems likely that these changes will have a measurable impact (forgive the understatement) on many facets of gameplay, from hunting for xp to higher-level raiding.<br>

So....  they put a bunch of items in the game with Luclin that make the players &quot;overpowered&quot; while at the same time they put in a bunch of things that need to be killed that are insanely hard to kill.<br>
<br>
Let's recap the stuff they've nerfed with &quot;Planes of Power on the horizon&quot;<br>
<br>
- Resists: now pc's don't resist npc spells as much, but npc resist our spells more.<br>
<br>
- Line of sight:  if a speck of dust gets in your way, you aren't hitting that mob, but still, once the mob starts casting, you're getting hit no matter what.<br>
<br>
- Tradeskills: this one was unintentional on VI's part, but now there is no way in hell I'm going to tradeskill up to 250 in anything.  The trivials on things that are reasonably difficult to make have been dropped, and the supplies to make the stuff with high trivial are now incredibly difficult to come by.  The only thing half way close to get to reasonable to 250 in is baking anymore.<br>
<br>
- Clerics: We get a new &quot;pet&quot; hammer which is great for soloing, but at the same time they add a heal (which don't get me wrong, I'm happy for the Druids and Shaman out there) makes the Cleric go the way of the dinosaur.  We &quot;used&quot; to have a better heal, now we have the same friggin heal.  How is that balanced? When the only thing a Cleric can do well is heal and nuke undead (how many mobs do you kill on a regular basis that are undead?), how is making the one heal they need less effective ever going to balance it more?  I'm stinky mad about this one.  I have loved playing Ladnia ever since the day she was rolled up, now I'm considering shelving her.  A lot of time wasted.  I might as well dust off the druid I've had on my account forever and play her.  She has more viability in this game than a cleric will ever have.  They add equipment with Luclin (and I'm sure with Planes of Power too) that will bring a fully raid buffed warrior dang close to 10k hp, and now I can't even heal that effectively.  GRRRR!!!<br>
<br>
- Manaburn:  I can't say for sure, but has team manaburn truly ever taken down anything of big importance that a couple of groups couldn't take down on their own?  Sure they've dropped Gorenaire, Trakanon, Venril Sathir and the like, but have they single handedly cleared a wing of ToV? no, they haven't, because they simply can't.  Whoopdie doo if they can kill those middle of the range encounters, the only things that are of big importance on those mobs are epic drops, which if you have the money and you want to hire team manaburn rather than rallying your friends, what does it hurt?<br>
<br>
The only thing I can think of right now that really was in the player's favor is dot stacking.  Big friggin whoop!!<br>
<br>
I ramble on because I'm pissed off...  Maige isn't the only one who considered cancelling...  I'm on the verge myself.  <br>
<br>
What's next? Rangers get dual weild yanked because we deal too much damage? Chanters better watch out too, KEI is up for a big nerf if this is how they're doing things.<br>

I don't mean high end like on Vazaelle.  It seems like half the problem is trying to &quot;challenge&quot; Fires of Heaven, Triton, Afterlife....  I think at least a few of the recent changes occurred because one of the &quot;I want the EQ neural interface&quot; guilds are quick to find ways of doing things the folks at Verant/SoE can't seem to even conceive of what they would try to do.  Additionally, customer support seems to be too much of a bother for them now - rumors abound of it being a pay service and well what we get as part of subscription is just really lacking, they can't even use the volunteer guides in helpful ways - everything has to be done by a GM (ie SOE employee).   From the look of planes it looks like it is to just add even more high end uber conflicts.  If they come through and make it more content based and enjoyable I will be very happily surprised, but I am not expecting it.  <br>
<br>
I wish they would realize that all of the effort they seem to be making is for a very small part of the player base and that they will lose customers by the focus of their actions.  Instead of trying to pretend that the game is open ended at the top, just adopt the idea that someone can win the game.  Fansy did it at level 5, Fires of Heaven have done it enough times, so give them a prize and let the rest of us have fun. <br>
<br>
Oh I also don't see why every mob needs to be mortal so to speak.  No one needs to kill a god, goddess, or an ancient dragon - just make them invulnerable and let them eat the players who try. Or make them die the way we usually do - ubermobs should suffer from LD, if they are so old they are probably only on slow PC's with slow connections so they should go LD regularly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Forget manaburn lets start attacking things with lag!  <br>
<br>
Thought about this a bit more and understand why I get irked.  I actually would love to see changing content and rich content that would be both challenging and fun.  What I see instead is a game that seems to be designed by spiteful gamemasters who act like they are opponents to the players.  So when a persistent and talented group of players like the uberduberguilds come along the game is changed so that they have an even harder time giving us all fits one way or the other.  My fun in the game comes from completing quests, helping folks, making stuff and exploring.  Well even at lvl 51 now there are a lot of places I can't go, and even if I get to lvl 60 I doubt I will ever see Plane of Mischief.  Why make all that content in 99.5% of players never get to even see it unless it is to challenge the 0.5% to show them they aren't good enough to win.<br>
<br>
This will probably get longer as I vent more.  But it comes down to right now SOE/Verant seems antagonistic and shortsighted when they add content and needs to learn to grow up. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ufronithunderpaws.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fronithunderpaws</A> at: 10/9/02 2:10:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/usonnasgoldenwine01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SonnasGoldenwine 01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(10/9/02 3:18:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fjinxedguildfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Massive rebalance</span><hr size=1> Depending on how they implement these changes, they could either be great... or be horrible... MB nerf? No big deal, like they did with Nagafen and Vox, opened them to the people that should be killing them for the challenge, not people looking for fast profit. CHeal nerf? ATM this will hardly change anything, seeing as how very few people support 8k+ tanks. Monk nerf? Didn't know there was a problem.. so I can't comment on that.<br>
<br>
The major issue is of course the mod rods. My first impression was OMG nothing will be able to be killed, then I read they would tune the encounters accordingly... which of course means 2 months after the patch things will be mostly correct... And that mages would be able to do more than pump rods all day long, and actually use the rest of their skills.<br>
<br>
But.. what had not occurred to me at the time, was that mages could still be placed in charge of feeding their mana to the raid, except at a great inconvience of /rt ing and not being able to stock pile, meaning they won't even really get a chance to deal finishing nukes because the mana will be needed to keep the tanks alive. And I didn't notice that, according to Maige, its relatively easy to stock enough rods before a fight that the mage can use his mana for nukes and what not, which would not be able to be done now if rods are no-drop. Or they will just become of no use for mana except in emergancies, making their rods of limited use, and making them become less wanted on raids because alot of people have the same attitude towards classes based on one ability.. IE:<br>
Melee: Mostly fixed up pretty well here.. but people still think that paladins and shadow knights aren't worth a dime, and would rather have rogues or warriors.. and people think rangers are rogue wannabes<br>
Necro: Give me mana, don't dot or use pets.. crazy necro<br>
Mage: Rods rods rods please thx<br>
Enc: Buff me... come back when they wear off to refresh<br>
Druid: 2nd best nukes, 2nd best heals? rather just use wizards and clerics... ignore the fact your versitlity can come of great value<br>
<br>
A good number of people think that the whole game could be narrowed down to warriors, clerics, wizards, rogues, and monks. And if they continue to lower the usefulness of the fun-to-play (Disclaimer: not saying the above aren't fun...) support classes, then who's to say they aren't right?<br>
<br>
I think the new changes have great potential, if they are impleted correctly. And after reading more into it.. I have the sinking filling that it won't happen.. Today's major issue is mage mod rods, which they have yet to show compensation to make the mage continue to be a very valueable assest.. instead of &quot;just another dmg dealer&quot;, but what does the future hold? I really want to know how they are going to make battles more require more strategy when the whole game is programmed to have things stand there are melee/aoe you until they die. They've already exhausted most the strategies that the game seems to allow for... straight melee, melee with unbeatable aoe kill it really fast, melee with the mob running away and summoning, melee with aoe that you hide from... that's about it.. you don't see mobs &quot;kite&quot; players, or choose their targets logically, they just hit whoever presses the taunt button the hardest. I really don't know what they will do..<br>
<br>
Which brings me back to my first point, it's all in how its implemented. They are going to seriously rescale the system if they want this battles of tactics rather than endurance, and still have them beatable, but not super easy. I don't think the first month or two after the change will much resemble the end product, at least it won't if they still want to have a player base $$.. or if they get it right the first time... *laugh* [sarcasm] that's happening <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  [/sarcasm]. <br>
<br>
Well I think I've rambled enough.. hope I didn't bounce between points so much that its unreadable.. but those are my current thoughts on the matter, who knows what they will be a month down the road. Which is why we shouldn't jump to conclusions, the change could be wonderful for all we know /shrug. <p>Venerable <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=141142">Sonnas Goldenwine</A><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ulitterrboxxe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Litterr Boxxe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#330000>(10/9/02 4:17:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fjinxedguildfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Massive rebalance</span><hr size=1> Hiyas,<br>
<br>
Hmmmm, lots of negative things being said bout the changes. I for onr dont see any problems except that they waited so long to put them in.<br>
<br>
The wizard manaburn should be turned down some. Making some encounters Harder than what they are at this moment. I know plenty of manaburners and have to say they are  overpowered as a group, just by what i hear and see, like the Big mob in burning woods(forget name) being ran around til the manaburn team gets set up, then being pulled to zone to die in 10 secs.<br>
<br>
Cleric CH change will not make any difference in the game right now as it is. A 7,500 hp heal is still way over the hp's of most of the tanks out there.<br>
<br>
If monks are able to &quot;tank&quot; right along with warriors then I think they should be altered so the true damage takers can have their place.<br>
<br>
Mages mod rods(that i love so much). Guess i'll the first to say I think the change is a good thing. I mean come on a person with x amount of mod rods at their feet and a cleric there to heal them seems overpowering to me. And yes, in some guilds casters have their own clerics to heal them as they mod up and cast and then mod back up.<br>
<br>
Anyway thats my thoughts, and yes life in the middle is very nice. #8^)... <p><html>

The thing that I am fearing is their retuning of the encounters.  So far the SOE track record has not been one to level the playing field, but to roll everyone back to have a steeper climb.  I am fully expecting that they will retune things in such a way that it is much harder to do things as a group or as a non-uberduber guild to get anything done.  They already made things harder with the resists and line of sight problems not to mention the smithing skill difficulty.  Focus items and DoT stacking are the only beneficial things I have seen in quite a while - every other thing that gets changed just makes the climb a lot harder.<br>
