It's not levels, or epics, or any of those other pissant excuses.  It's simply this:  <br>
 <br>
You don't know how to work together as a team.  You're a bunch of fuckin' chiefs, and none of you know how to act like indians.  Without a lot of planning, you can't do a successful major pvp battle, because it's not reflex for you guys to work together.  YOU DON'T KNOW HOW.  You can pvp just fine one on one, and most of the major newt names out there have experience in that category, but very few of you know how to work together as a team, and react quick enough.  You don't know your roles, or what you're supposed to do if so-and-so happens.  You can react fast enough to pumice a splurt, because you've learned that, but what about those big battles? Those epic battles the &quot;bluebies&quot; do day in and day out?  Damn... I'd love to see the shouting that's going on in your guildchats during those battles.  Maybe if you shouted shit in capslock less and used guildchat for more useful information, you'd get something accomplished.<br>
<br>
I thought the same thing a lot of newts did when the server came up.  The bluebie bitches would get owned by the more experienced pvper's.  Well, I've come to a new understanding.  The &quot;bluebie bitches&quot; are learning how to pvp.  They're getting better at it.  What about you guys? Are you getting any better at working together as a unit, and reacting to a big-war situation, or is it just a bunch of individuals running around with their own agendas?<br>
<br>
You can still use whatever excuses you want, whether it be loot, levels, or whatever.  The simple fact is that guilds like ruin know how to work together, and have spent their time VERY well since server up.  Newts have done nothing but further their own personal agendas, and you haven't accomplished much of anything as a team.  I don't know what makes newts think that time is going to HELP them, when they don't seem to be using their time HALF as efficiently as evil is.  Do you really think that things are magically gonna change?  That guilds like ruin will stop getting ubar loots long enough for you to come even CLOSE?  <br>
<br>
Excuses... all excuses.  Any way you cut it, you have the same, if not better, resources that evil has.  You have better lands, with better xp spots (complete with exploitable quests), and better loots.  Way to put all that to use.  So keep complaining and pointing the finger at evil.  Obviously, evil's methods are proving a hell of a lot more effective in pvp than yours are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uharpeyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>harpeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/28/01 8:01:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3798.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Evil vs. Newt: Evil's Biggest Advantage</span><hr size=1> /agree<br>
<br>
Newt team was pretty disorganised in big battles when I was there - small groups worked well - but didnt know overall roles. Bohn is the best at trying to get this organisation and TDC is best at executing it - apart from that .....a lot of chaos....<br>
<br>
Wont change - every 'expert' from other Zeks appears to be on Newt team - the number of times I was told 'I was the best xxxx on xxxZek' astounds me )<br>

They move as one.<br>
<br>
During one of my raids in the Karanas whereby 6 of us had North Karana and South Karana totally cleared out, I continually made sure all members were close to me as I was leading the attacks. I would stop and wait if anyone was a bit behind. We then headed to Faydark and continued the slaughter in a very tight military style attacks. <br>
<br>
The fact is this: Players begin logging or refuse to go to hostile areas (whether it's pvp or pve) if they die. Groups MUST be run military style in order for them to be successful.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udarckone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darckone </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/28/01 8:14:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3798.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Evil vs. Newt: Evil's Biggest Advantage</span><hr size=1> Just because someone came from a &quot;Blue&quot; server doesn't mean they don't know how to PvP.  Alot of PvP takes place on a &quot;Blue&quot; server by the way of duels or Arena fights.  Especially on the Evil races of the &quot;Blue&quot; server waiting for boats.  Alot of people duel.  Yes I came from a blue server, but I also dueled very often, and so did alot of other peeps that came from &quot;Blue&quot; servers and have stayed on this server.  This group PvP is alot different thatn 1 on 1 that the &quot;Zekers&quot; are used to.<br>
<br>
Oh, and dueling on a &quot;Blue&quot; server means you can Fear your oponents.  Something you can't do with a Necro or SK on the &quot;Zeks&quot;.  But Bards can?????<br>
<br>
So far on the Sullon, there has been a lot more &quot;Ganking&quot; and &quot;Griefing&quot; then there has been real PvPing.  Not that it isn't a valid tactic, but it isn't true PvP.<br>
<br>
Let's see, Dharma, Greg, Patrick, Bagen, and Marqus use to sit in LOIO and wait for the people to take on a Mob, after said person is down to half health or whatever, then they strike the person.   Totally valid tactic, and without trackers, and levitation to chase them over the lake where they sat and medded, they were safe to do so.  But for all those &quot;Zekers&quot; out there that claim that look at the points and how awesome team newt is because we PvP, we are l33t, whatever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ugrumples.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grumples</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/28/01 8:38:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3798.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Evil vs. Newt: Evil's Biggest Advantage</span><hr size=1> Oh, I dunno.<br>
<br>
Defenders are ALWAYS more organized.<br>
<br>
Evil's advantage is they usually turn themselves into the defenders wherever they go, and wait for the neuts to make the first move.  If we have any fault, say that we're impatient, that we don't like to stand in one spot for 2 hours waiting for the other side to zone in and attack us.<br>
<br>
I understand it was like that in the Guk war.  Evils piled up at the entrance to Guk, waiting for neuts to attack.  And again in Thurgadin.  Evils piled up at the IK zoneline, waiting for neuts to attack.<br>
<br>
If neuts didn't keep attacking you, you'd never see any PvP action as an evil.  You'd just stand there for 3 hours wondering why nobody is showing up.<br>
<br>
<br>
So yes, evils appear more organized, but this is largely because they don't actually move.<br>

I'm talking about that open warfare rapeage a bunch of you experienced in iceclad.  I'd hardly say that Evil didn't &quot;move&quot; that day.... They moved in, and they conquered repeatedly.

Zone over and all the evils are, contrary to what they've suggested, standing at the zoneline waiting on the neuts.  (They say they were working on faction.  lol.  What, the 2 people who weren't standing at the zoneline were working on faction?  They had the hall packed so tight we were having a hard time getting greencon shorties by to train them!)<br>
<br>
In the end, even though evils had the advantage of levels and gear, neuts attacked and eventually drove them off with trains, leaving some un-looted and un-rezzed evil corpses as evidence their departure wasn't voluntary.<br>
<br>
<br>
So if by &quot;organized&quot; you mean &quot;stand in one place for literally 2 hours hoping someone will attack them, too afraid to make an attack of their own and too busy watching the zoneline to farm any faction&quot; then yes, evils are awfully organized.<br>

I love when idiots talk about something when they were not even there.<br>
<br>
Here is what happen chump.<br>
<br>
1.  We evaced out of ToFS from a train and see Lod is up.<br>
<br>
2.  IE zones in and sees 10 of us in the zone and puts out the call to Ruin.<br>
<br>
3. Ruin starts to port in, holding the tp and AoEing any newt poting in.  Leaving us with about 10-12 ppl in IC and others that have to run to IC instead of port.<br>
<br>
4.  Ruin pulls Lod.  So we have no choice but to follow them and attack when they were rdy and most of the ppl  from DB in IC were below 50+ since the only ppl that were close enuff to help were the ppl xping in EW.<br>
<br>
5.  We attacked but all the casters are fighting us while their 3 tanks and clrs fight Lod.  TDC ports in but it was too late.  Multible ICs, lures &gt; Jotok(for now)<br>
<br>
6.  Ruin tps to thurg to go faction in IW.  I don't see how they did alot of factioning with all their tanks blocking the zone.  We kill most of the stragglers execpt Bothi who thought he was l337 for using the hill warp to escape.  <br>
<br>
7.  We get tired of waiting for them to zone out after 2 hours and rush the zone.  We get owned by tanks blocking the zoneline and AoEs.  End of story.<br>
<br>
Next time you open your mouth Cronik,  please be there for what happen.<br>
<br>
And post your ingame name wimp.  Nothing worse then a messageboard warrior that hides.<br>

Obviously, I wasn't there, so I only have the information that ruin posted and your own fucking guildleader confirmed, you fucking dumbass.  He admitted you got owned in Iceclad &quot;because you weren't organized&quot;, and other newts admitted they handled the entire situation poorly.  There's nothing worse than a message board warrior who lies thru his fucking teeth.  For your sake, I hope that you yourself don't believe the shit that spews from your mouth. <br>
<br>
Gray, if levels and gear make such a diff in pvp, why don't you stop bitching and whining about it and do something about it?  We all know how good DB is at leveling. Oh, that's right, nevr mind, they took away your exploit.  Maybe you'll find another one soon enough that can help you &quot;close the gap&quot;.  I still can't believe you fucks didn't get banned, or at least reverted, for that bullshit. <br>
<br>
As par usual, you ignore the basic message of the post to flame the wrong things.  You can't act as a group, and it's gonna get you killed more and more because there's 10 people shouting &quot;WHAT THE FUCK! WHY ISN'T SOMEONE KILLING THOSE FUCKING CLERICS?!&quot; in guildchat.  <br>
<br>
/pissing contest on<br>

I'm out. I'm not gonna argue with you anymore.  The people who understand the point got it, and you're too busy arguing to even consider anything i'm saying, so no point in bothering.  Peace out, and good luck thinking up another excuse for getting owned, boys.  It's just so bloody unfair.... /sniffle  For the bunch of hardass motherfuckers that you make yourselves out to sound, you all whine and bitch an awful fucking lot on the message boards. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xaen>Xaen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/28/01 12:00:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3798.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/philipv1/iz.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: whatever</span><hr size=1> The blue people are USED to working with 30-40 person groups. They are USED to knowing their jobs. A lot of the blue players are using the intense PvE where grouping and working side by side with dozens of people is more common than anything else they've ever done. Now they're here on the PvP servers, and they're used to being totally organized. They're used to porting in somewhere and being fully buffed within 5 minutes noticed. Something the hard core PvP'rs may have never had a chance to do simply because they were too busy running around solo or with 2-3 other people trying to just gank people. And trying to get all the other people like that to work together is something that's going to take a lot of practice, just like the blues who are so perfect at grouping up buffing and porting in massive waves will have to learn the PvP. <br>

<br>
PVP battles usually follow this pattern.<br>
<br>
1. Initiative.  The dividing Grps or grp kills players along path and at destination.<br>
<br>
2. Reaction.  The attacked team rallies and depending on how close reinforcements are the Invaders are repulsed.<br>
<br>
3.  Aftermath.  Cr and secondary killing with both sides losing or adding additional players.  One side gates/ports/runs off and the original inhabitants are left to go back to business as usual.<br>
<br>
From a team perspective.<br>
<br>
Initiative:<br>
<br>
Multi-porters such as druids and wizards are the main source of Initiative.  They can bring in muliple grps in a short notice.  Neutrals also have more sow capable players per capita then evils..not sure about goods.  Mobility is much greater on the newt team.<br>
<br>
Concentration:<br>
<br>
Here Evils have an advantage in that they are based around some of the better dungeons and can amass a reaction force faster to respond to a major invasion.  Take Guk as an example.  Nootz and Goodz have to port in and walk to the dungeon one zone away from the Landing zone (LZ)..  Evils have a home town in and one one zone away from GUK.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fighting in zones where CR has to go thru hostile territories is BAD.  CR across held zonelines is ....well ..suicidal.<br>
<br>
Zonelines can be watched,  For those of you who routinely Zoneplug, you know that and Iggle may be waiting for quite sometime for your return ( ogres are easily amused I guess ).<br>
<br>
There is no substitute for good planning and execution.  But no plan survives contact with the enemy.<br>
