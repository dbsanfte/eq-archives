<br>
Your little detective work was entirely false, and it was only by coincidence that you were correct.<br>
<br>
As for your accusation that being good at EQ is about playtime and not skills, my response to you is you've never been in the high end game, where there are two kinds of people who have playtime. The skillful and the skilless.<br>
<br>
Skills aside, the game is about levels. Levels make power, and if I can play more then you, I am more powerful.<br>
<br>
You want to see my skills? Come spend a day with me while I play 3 characters at once. Come on a raid with Ruin as we kill the overking with 24 people, none of which are 60 and most of which are 50-55. <br>
<br>
You don't get into a guild like Ruin by simply playing alot. You get into it by playing alot and having skills.<br>
<br>
If you want to see skills, look at Ruin.<br>
<br>
And as somebody said earlier on the thread, a skilled PvEr, and just as easily be a skilled PvPer.<br>

We brought the fight to a group of people who were 20 levels above us, and lost.  You won, but decided to talk shit anyway.  For that, you and Ruin suck ass.<br>
<br>
We regrouped, went to OT, and had a lot of fun.  There were around 120 people in the zone?  This was the most fun of the whole night.  I had a lot of fun working my way up the hill by the WW zone, farther and farther...until I hit some reds.  I think I was slowed and dotted by about 50 of the 120 people in the zone...oh yeah, and 1 guy was meleeing me.  LOL  Still, it was a noble death.  I wreaked as much havoc as I could in the time that I had, but when it was my time to go, &quot;Oy Vey!&quot; there was no stopping it.<br>
<br>
I look forward to many more PVP battles in the near future. <p><IMG SRC="http://home1.gte.net/nwcorner/paramsig.bmp">

This quote pretty much sums up most of the complaints the veteran PvP community has with EQ. I just found it amusing, you may now go back to flaming each other.<br>

Good lord.  He denied that Zanshin are traitors, and explained that by Darkenbane's screwed up little standards, GF was &quot;too veak for ze neutral team&quot; as well.<br>
<br>
DB has no case.  Senior GF people treat it like it does.  There is NOTHING, NOTHING in RC's post to disagree with, and yet Coraan presumes to lecture him condescendingly?  There's nothing quite like misplaced condescension.  Noone ever said that GF has accused Zanshin directly, but you sure as heck give the impression of agreeing with your allies.  Nor does RC say that you are obliged to behave exactly as DB does, he simply points out that your behavior seems to be incompatible.  <br>
<br>
In short, he made none of the &quot;assumptions&quot; you so confidently attributed to him.<br>
 <br>
As for the DB representative's well thought out rebuttal...  Heh.  GF's association with that bunch of teenaged fascist wannabes is an embarrassment to them.  I count my blessings that they rolled neutral for their precious dr00ds.<br>

<br>
I'm the former guild leader of Divine Essence, now merged into Zanshin. I am one of the 8 officers and although some carry unique responsibilities and all have influence on Zanshin's policies through conference with Shame, I suppose I am more pro-active in this role than some of the others.<br>
<br>
Of course our guild's leadership and members are aware of everything stated here. Some have commented themselves on other threads. I have been posting links to our private forums to these discussions for weeks. Our members are very aware of the &quot;Grey Pact&quot; politics and I make certain they keep informed via discussions in our forums. Every bit of new information I find, I will digest and peruse. As long as your &quot;Pact&quot; members continue their McCarthy-esque smear campaign, I will scrutinize everything said and done by your members for elements of hypocrisy, outright lies, and contradictions. Every time you slip, I'll be there. Trust.<br>
<br>
GF may deny responsibility for it's fellow alliance members' conduct all it wants, but the rest of the neutral community and Zanshin will judge for ourselves how to view and react to an organization that seems to choose shady bedfellows, and worse yet, condones shameful ethics through its silence. Birds of a feather, as the saying goes... <br>
<br>
As for &quot;burning bridges&quot;, Zanshin builds its own bridges. We are a guild striving towards self-reliance not inter-dependence. That is the difference between us and the &quot;Grey Pact&quot;.<br>

Draston has a problem called &quot;lewtitis&quot;.  This is a common sickness through out EQ.  And Draston's has this disease bad.  Sure he is dumb for saying it in /ooc, but please, I think your arguement of us being hypocritcal is weak at best.  <br>
<br>
And here is why we think Zanshin is in it only for themselves and are traitors to the newt team.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, why not comment on you guildmate's quote?  I think I have seen 3 stories on what happen in TOFS. Magruda said you guys were afraid that he would train you(cowards).  Some coward(no ingame name) on our MB said that you guys were 2 floors above him.  And Nick_RZ said he was there helping you guys out with a train.  So which is it?<br>
<br>
Second the defense of SoV.  Everybody knows that if there are bogies in the zone, you traitors will either disappear or make some deal with the enemy to leave you alone.  i.e Sect in EW last nite and you guys jumping Honorbound's spawn when they went to fight them.  i.e TOFS helping Firble get his student homework and key so you could lvl. <br>
<br>
Third.  Not attacking any high lvl evils in exchange of a non -aggression pact.  i.e the numerous reports of Shame sitting by and letting Ruin kill our newbies. i.e. Shame dragging Ruin's bodies after they were killed.<br>
<br>
You traitors can dissect this post all you like. Us having &quot;penis envy&quot; of Shame is laughable.  We didn't come here to get items, planes or xp.  We came to kill.  Bottom line is that you are cowards and traitors.  I feel bad for the good ppl that are in your guild.<br>
<br>
Feel free to quote me again on this.<br>
<br>
Zanshin are traitors.<br>
<br>
Jotok <br>
Halfee BADASS<br>
DARKENBANE<br>
<br>
Also I didn't see you answer Coraan either.  I wonder why.<br>
