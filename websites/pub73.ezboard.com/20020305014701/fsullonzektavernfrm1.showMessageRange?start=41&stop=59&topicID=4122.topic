<br>
We where talking about this the other day, don't necros and mages make the best greenie farmers? I mean /pet attack and then go to sleep. A 44 fire pet, or a necro's 44 pet should be able to solo the entire zone of crushbone/bb/qhills at the same fucking time. What is the challenge in that? Wizards kinda suck at it...we are the most mana dependant class, and well, I only have so much mana <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><font color = ff0000>Velael regards you indifferently - He appears to be a taxi</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucaulfield.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caulfield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/01 12:42:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4122.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My evening with the goods (and how dumb some lowbies can</span><hr size=1> Hrmmm... Several points mentioned here...<br>
<br>
1. Goods shouldn't whine.<br>
<br>
AGREED! This only works to give merit to the actions of your enemy. If 90% of the whining would cease completely, then maybe 80% of the griefing would become 99% less fun and 75% of it would cease out of pure boredom.<br>
<br>
2. People should not feel pity/sympathy for the goods.<br>
<br>
AGREED! However... Being killed/griefed by the goods should be viewed as the same as by any other team. Any goods who have read the posts on these boards and have played for more than a month know this is simply not the case. Being killed/attacked/griefed by goods especially to those who once felt pity/sympathy for them or those who feel the goods are pathetic is seen as something almost personal. There is almost always a &quot;How dare you!&quot; atitude while comes about immediately.<br>
<br>
3. The goods bring their misery upon themselves.<br>
<br>
I'll give you this one, but only in addition to that which Verant has already provided us with. The evils at times complain that the goods have several advantages (positive faction, a second port class, trackers, etc), but remember one thing... Neutrals too have those same advantages, and they are our more immediate enemies (neighbors). One thing we as a team really need to work on is becoming less fragmented. We simply do not have the option that the other teams have of accomodating for a diverse range of goals and social groups. The large guilds who say they have enough people and the small guilds who say they want a more personal environment BOTH need to realize that these luxuries may not be avaliable to us.<br>
<br>
4. Only a fellow goodie has any right to speak about the conditions of the good team.<br>
<br>
Reluctantly agreed, but on the condition that the same apply for the other teams as well. While only a goodie has any real right to say that we are all pathetic lazy whiners and are doomed, likewise, opposing teams are not justified in calling the neutral team greifers and the evil team bluebies. Smacktalking aside, I wish more people would agree with me on this.<br>
<br>
(and then more specifically...)<br>
<br>
5. You got what you deserved man!<br>
<br>
Yes and no. Getting killed was probably an expected possibility. Getting CC'ed, though unfortunate, is also somewhat expected on Sullon. You didn't deserve to be called a greenie farmer, if thats your big issue. That's not so appropriate in this particular case. However, you don't have much of a cause to take it personally. Its just one of those things.<br>
<br>
When I was in Paineel once with some goods, we started camping the falling corpses (AND telling people to loot them later on) because people weren't LnS'ing and kept coming back a  minute later to fight us again. We weren't really griefing for griefing's sake and thus people were not right to call us griefers, but considering that many evils were being griefed on Odus prior to that day, I guess its understandable and I didn't let it get to me.<br>
<br>
Another time, a group of goods were killing lowbie evils in Odus and telling them to leave. Some evils started up calling the goods hypocrites and saying to just leave newbies alone and let them hunt. Lowbies were agreeing and saying they had no choice but to hunt there until they could find a way off. We started defending ourselves saying that what we were doing wasn't outright griefing because we were not killing everyone and those we did we let loot then just advised that they leave. Several goods added that we got killed in our hunting grounds all the time and didn't see the big deal about it and also remarked that evils should be the last people to be complaining about lowbie terrorizing and hunting areas.<br>
<br>
Some evil must have just entered and caught only the last point, because he immediately started up with &quot;awwww! are the goods whining again? oh poor goods! waaahhhh! waaaah!&quot; No, we weren't whining, we were defending ourselves AGAINST whiners. Despite this, other evils followed suit. Like I said though, its just one of those things. Stuff like this is far too commonplace to take personally (unless I am eager to get an ulcer).<br>
<br>
Seems its easier to take it the wrong way when its coming from goods, because our team is so small and so easily generalized.<br>

*Nothing* parallels tricking 30 newbies into following you around and clicking Supernova.<br>

Shamans or Shadowknights or Druids are if you want to cause exp-loss.<br>

Necromancers or Mages are if you want to simply kill a lot of people.<br>

If you're talking about me, yes I'm a Mage. I really don't think mages make the best greenie farmers, because we have no root/snare type spells.  If my pet dies, I'm in biiig trouble ;)<br>

I think wizards/shamans make good greenie farmers.  <br>

Takes too damn much mana to kill people, and greenies don't do anything but run away if you are fighting evils (and newts have no one below 30 on their team, heh, I swear it), so no pet =(<br>

<br>
this had nothing to do with Good rage or revenge or junk like that. we felt like pvping and velael didnt, its that simple.<br>
<br>
Sudara is right, the monks zoned in and starting fighting, zoned out, and zoned back in full health. some of us should have immediately gated out and trained the healer. it would have been a much different fight.<br>
<br>
we did not corpse camp velael. he did not come back just to loot and scoot he also came back with a group of friends to fight. if he had asked for a CR when he zoned into everfrost i would have shouted down my whole team to let him do it.<br>
<br>
he came back the second time to fight, so we fought back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/upretentiousdarkelven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pretentious DarkElven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Message Board Warrior</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/11/01 12:57:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4122.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My evening with the goods (and how dumb some lowbies can</span><hr size=1> Vigg stfu n00b. <p><img src="http://a1259.g.akamai.net/f/1259/5586/1d/www.art.com/images/products/small/10022000/10022513.jpg">  "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world - It is the opium of the people." --- Karl Marx </p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=4122.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=4122.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=4122.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=4122.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4122.topic&index=59><img src=http://home.att.net/~neoleo/reply2.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.threadControl?topicID=4122.topic><img src= border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4122.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=4122.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sullonzektavernfrm1">General Discussion<option value="sullonzektavernfrm2">Marketplace<option value="sullonzektavernfrm3">No Holds Barred<option value="sullonzektavernfrm4">Guilds of Sullon Zek<option value="sullonzektavernfrm5">Roleplay<option value="sullonzektavernfrm6">Testing Grounds<option value="sullonzektavernfrm7">Administration Station</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern>Sullon Zek Tavern</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Sullon Zek PvP Stats !!</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-groccouons&BL=groc>PRINT FREE GROCERY COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
