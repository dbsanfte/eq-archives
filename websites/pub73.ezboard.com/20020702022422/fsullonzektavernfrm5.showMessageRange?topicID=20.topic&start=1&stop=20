The multitude that had gathered to hear the Council fell silent at the announcement, for they knew that unless the augry showed victory, there would be great trials ahead.  Slowly the elder Scaled Mystics gathered near the ritual platform.  Among hissing from the crowd, the captive Sarnak was brought forth, bound in the middle of the dais, and was swiftly eviscerated with a quick stroke from the High Trooper Executioner, and then decapitated with the next swing of the blade.<br><br>   The Mystics then approached the slumped carcass, and examined the entrails.  I could feel a wave of anticipation run through the crowd.  The Mystics were taking too long.  What would the augry show?  Was there something wrong?  The crowd was now getting restless, some were glancing about nervously.  I could smell the thick stench of fear wash over the masses.<br><br>   Slowly the Grand Mystic turned from the battered Sarnak.  His hands bloody down to his elbows, now slowly raised to calm the crowd, to make them silent.  He examined us, looking at the assembled throng, his head slowly turning from side to side.<br><br>   "Iksar!" - his loud shout reverbrated within the caves of Cabilis.  The crowd was as still as the dead. "Cazic Thule promises us...VICTORY !!!"<br><br>   Never before have I seen such frenzy among our people.  The Mystics and the assembled luminaries were quickly taken to a safe area by their trooper escort, as the maddened crowd surged forward toward the dais.  I too was in the front, and through a skillful jump I clawed my way to the top of the platform, and I lunged at the dead Sarnak.  I buried my claws in it's abdomen and ripped out a handful of innards.  Oh how sweet was the taste of the victory!  The Sarnak blood ran down my throat as I ripped into the flesh.  Besides me, hundreds of eager Iksar were passing around what remained of the Sarnak.  It is said that to partake in the flesh of the fortunate augry brings great luck, and therefore I must be the luckiest of them all, for I was completely covered with its blood.  I stood on the dais, my bloody visage for all to see, and roared.<br><br>   I remember nothing else of that night. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:31:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/01 11:13:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1>    Today I awoke with a pounding in my skull.  I could barely remember the last few days of the Festival.  After the night of the augry, the Council declared four sundowns of celebration, and I threw myself headlong into it.  I suspect that for many of us, this will be the last celebration for a long time to come.<br><br>   Something troubles me though. Weaponmaster Srrok, a grizzled warrior whose proficiency with the blades is only matched by his desire to raise hell, was noticeably absent from the celebrations.  After I noticed that, I became aware that many of the veterans were not at the Festival.  I wondered what this meant, but my head was full of drink and my friend Myrdukk arrived in the company of several fertile females, and once the scent hit me I could not concentrate. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:31:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/01 11:14:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> I received a summons to the Temple of Terror today for an audience with Lord Gikzik.  There, one of many in the crowd, we were told that we were being chosen to train as Crusaders.  I could barely contain my pride.  For years I have trained in the various Schools, and competed in contests with all the other young ones.  I had not known which order I would be called upon to serve, for the Ancient Masters in their great wisdom are better fit to decide our future paths. I hold a special place in my heart for the Crusaders of Cazic, for my own grandfather belonged to that sacred order, and left me with many tales of glory that I treasure to this day.<br><br>My head was spinning from it all, and shamefully I can not recount the details of Lord Gikzik's speech.  My mind was racing ahead to the future.  The training I would have to undergo, the trials of combat, and hopfully great glory on the battlefield was all that was on my mind.  <br><br>I soon learned the perils of not paying attention.  The great and powerful Arch Duke Xog strode into the crowd suddenly, apparently from nowhere.  His passing parted the masses, and most scrambled out of the way.  Once in the middle, the great Arch Duke slowly surveyed the crowd, and shook his head, almost in disdain.<br>"So this is what they send us?" His voice carried scorn. "This...trash?"<br><br>The Arch Duke was a body's length from me when he spoke, and I could feel the powerful mystic energies emanating from him, even though I had not been formally trained to do so yet.  Suddenly he turned and peered intently into the eyes of the trainee beside me.  I made sure to be as still as possible, and to not show an ounce of fear.  My neighbor, however, was not as disciplined and could not properly hide his terror.  I smelt first, then saw down by my feet, a spreading pool of waste coming from the frightened wretch beside me.<br><br>It was all over in an instant.  The Arch Duke's image shimmered, and I thought I saw him move, but it happened so quick that I doubt my eyes even now.  I saw out of the corner of my eye my neighbor's now headless body crumple to the ground. The head itself hit the ground a couple of moments later, it's neck shorn off with deadly precision.<br><br>"I trust your incompetence and fear will not task me," the Arch Duke spoke once he finished wiping blood from his blade "any more than it already has."<br><br>Mercifully our audience was brief after that.  I was told to report to Lord Gikzik for training and provisioning.  There I received my first weapon, the Kukhri.  I swung blades all my life, but to actually hold the Kukhri, and to feel the power and legacy of the thousands of Crusaders flowing into me, was almost more than I could stand.  I sheathed my weapon quickly, afraid that Lord Gikzik would catch me staring at it like a fool.<br><br>The Lord then told me that as my first test I would be required to find the hatchlings of our ancient enemy, the Sarnaks, and cleave unto them until I had four of their brains in my posession.  I left quickly after that, knowing that my nervousness would betray me if I stayed. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:32:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/01 11:58:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> Today I ventured forth into the wild.  I trust my feeble skills as much as I trust a beggar in the bank, so I decided to get some swordplay under my belt before slaying the hatchling Sarnaks.  I first travelled to the Bonefield, but saw it crowded beyond belief.  Never before have I seen so many of my bretheren running amok, tearing into anything that moved.  <br><br>There were some on their knees even, ripping apart the very earth with their bare claws in order to unearth the hidden wolf pup dens.  I saw quickly that it would be impossible to get any training done, for the din of the slaughter proved too distracting.  I went back to the city, travelled to the Western Quarter, and exited out through Warslik's Gate.  Once in the woods, I saw that there were only a few of my fellows around, and I got down to some serious work.<br><br>I spent many hours in the woods.  After a while it seemed to me that I entered into some kind of mystic trance.  I felt detached, almost like a sleepwalker.  Completely covered in blood and guts, I swung my blade again and again, felling foes to slow to escape my dance of death.  It was only when my arms gave out, too sore to raise the blade once more, that I stopped to rest and collect myself.<br>I looked inside my packs to see what my foes had given me with their parting breaths.  There were myriad weapons; sheer blades and shan'toks galore, along with several shields, and scores of bone chips.  I laughed.  No wonder I was moving like a slug towards the end of the day, overburdened that I was.  <br><br>My muscles sore, I trudged back to town, to see if I could find a fair and friendly merchant.  After the haggling, I found myself with a princely sum of a dozen pieces of platinum.  This was more money than I have ever had in my hands, but I resisted the urge to spend wildly, and instead bought some leather armor; a breastplate and some leggings.  I also purchased a hunting bow, and a backpack full of arrows, as well as some low grade armor to cover the still-exposed parts.  I then found Trooper Mozo, and delivered the bone chips to him like he requested.  He seemed to be happy at first when he learned I had over a hundred, but he insulted me over and over again as I gave them to him.  He also cheated me on the payment, giving me but a fraction of what he promised.  I didn't argue, for anything is better than nothing, and I didn't hold it against him, as I know how tedious the gate posting is.  <br><br>When sundown came, I reported to Lord Gikzik, who appraised my efforts and informed me that my progress was almost satisfactory, and that I would now be trained how to use my shield to deliver blows to my enemies.  I kept silent and lowered my eyes when asked about the Sarnak hatchlings.  I departed as soon as practicable, with the vow on my lips to make the Sarnaks bleed at sunup. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:33:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/01 1:08:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> I have become the walking dead.  I hold within myself a secret so dreadful, so terrible, that I fear Cazic himself will send one of his minions to collect me.  I fear to write this in my journal, even encoded as it is.  Oh, where to begin...<br><br>After my audience with Lord Gikzik, I decided to wander the halls of the Temple of Terror for a little while, perhaps to reflect upon my day before heading to my sleeping quarters.  I wandered the endless hallways, musing to myself before the statues of great heroes, and soon I found that I was lost.  I only knew that I was somewhere underneath the Temple, in one of the myriad passageways that comprise it's lower workings.  I was attempting to retrace my steps, following a hallway that looked familiar, when I heard voices approaching.<br><br>To this moment I do not know why, but my mind became filled with terror and panic, and I pressed myself behind a statue into the darkness of a nearby alcove.  I soon recognized the elder Scaled Mystic, the one who performed the augry, and the Arch Duke Xog, as they passed within an arm's length of my hiding spot.  The shaman led the way, and looked noticeably angry.  The Arch Duke followed, also with a harsh expression, muttering to himself.  I let them both pass, and slipped out of the alcove to follow them.  I lost them for a minute, but I noticed a line of disturbed dust near one of the walls, and upon closer examination I was able to open the secret door and slip inside.<br><br>I saw a large, dimly lit room.  The Mystic and the Arch Duke were settling into the two remaining open spots at a large table that dominated the room.  All the other chairs were filled with various personages I recognized as most of the Council of Cabilis.  All the leaders of the various guilds were there, as well as the head of the Merchant Guild.  I also noticed a small figure sitting at the end of the table, but I could not see him in detail because he was completely covered with a dark cloak.<br>"Tell us again of the augry, Mystic." The voice came from the cloaked figure.  It had an accent I could not place, but even I could tell this was no Iksar.<br><br>"The augry went well, what is there to tell?" said Hrosst, the head of the Merchant Guild. "We were all there."<br><br>Hrosst looked around for confirmation, first at the Mystics, who would not meet his eye, then at others.<br><br>"Zand, tell them." The elder Mystic made a gesture at the one to his right.<br><br>"Very well." Hierophant Zand rose and took a deep breath before continuing <br>further. "The augry that you saw was a show for the crowd.  The real augry was performed hours before, in this very room".<br><br>There were gasps from around the table, but not enough, which made me think that this was not news to at least some present. <br><br>"We did this because we have always done this."  Explained Zand. "The real augry takes many hours and intense concentration, which is impossible before a large and impatient crowd."<br><br>"Well, what did the augry show?" A voice from back of the room spoke.<br><br>Zand did not reply immediately.  He seemed to be fighting within himself.<br><br>"Tell us!" Several voices rose in unison and pounding could be heard on the table surface.<br><br>"Very well." Zand seemed resigned now, almost glad to share the burden.<br><br>"We saw death.  We saw the proud city of Cabilis ruined and in flames.  We saw our people slaughtered, our birthing pens destroyed, our walls breached, and our lands despoiled.  We saw great armies arrayed against us, and we saw them victorious. We saw the cities of our allies razed and their farms ruined and salted."<br>Suddenly there were a dozen voices, all shouting and arguing. The din quieted as soon as it began. The Arch Duke brought his mailed fist down on the table with such force that it almost split the tabletop in half.<br><br>"Silence!" He roared. "Zand, continue".<br><br>"There is nothing more to add, great Arch Duke" Zand let his breath out and sat down, clearly relieved of the burden.<br><br>"I can now see why you deceived your people."  The cloaked figure spoke softly.  "This kind of news can cause all sorts of...problems."<br><br>There were several nods around the table.<br><br>"Our seers have seen the same thing.  I have news from the southern cities of similar tales as well, although it's hard to understand our slow-witted allies sometimes."<br><br>"So we have been given visions of our destruction." These were the first words from Grandmaster Glox. "The trouble is now that we know, what do we do about it?"<br><br>"The augries have never been wrong before!"<br><br>"In that case, honorable War Baron Eator, it seems the only choice we have is to whether accept our destiny meekly, or to fight against the will of the gods, and mayhaps prevail? Eh, Eator?  What say you?"  Glox was incensed now.<br><br>"Stop this." The Arch Duke glowered. "We must not complicate this with useless arguing.  Ambassador, what is the opinion of your people?"<br><br>"Ambassador?"<br><br>It was at this point that I noticed that the cloaked figure was staring at me.  I could not see his eyes, but I felt the presence of his sight upon me as surely as I know anything.  Fear washed over me. He can't see me, I repeated to myself, trembling.  It's a dark room, he's at the other end, and I'm hiding in the shadows.  Nevertheless, I knew the cloaked man knew exactly where I was.<br><br>"Ambassador?"<br><br>I could take it no more.  As silently as I could I crept back throught the secret door, and once clear, I ran down the hallway as if demons were chasing me.  I ran for know not how long, but in the end I managed to find a series of small caverns which led me to the Western Quarter, by the Arena.<br><br>The last thing I remember from that room is a pair of very pale eyes staring at me from underneath that cloak.  <br> <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:52:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(6/28/01 5:37:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> Today I retrieved the hatchling heads and gave them to the Lord.

Whereas once I would have been excited by the news, I know that I am doomed by my knowledge, and could not even muster passing interest in the matter.  I ventured forth into the woods again, to train and to mayhaps forget my sorry state.  Due to my internal turmoil, I was lacking in concentration, and was overwhelmed by a large gang of goblins.  I was holding my own, cleaving the crowd wide, but more and more kept arriving to replace their fallen comrades.  <br><br>Common sense should have taught me to maneuver closer to the protection of the troopers, but in my haze I forgot it all.  I kept at it, madly and singlemindedly, until the piles of the dead grew high enough to block my vision.  It was then that a rather large and imposing goblin launched himself at me and knocked my sword arm aside.  Seizing the opportunity, the others leapt at me and brought me down.  I felt myself crushed from the weight of my assailants, especially the large goblin, who was right on top of me.  With my left hand I brought out my phalange from my boot sheath, and cut his throat wide open just as he leaned towards me, his fangs bared and ready for a fatal bite.  I was drenched by his blood, and choked on it as it poured all over my face and down my throat.  It was then I suffered a terrible blow to my head, and descended into darkness, surely never to return.<br><br>I woke what must have been many hours later.  I could make out the faces of two troopers looking down at me.  I recognized Walrun as one.<br><br>"What?" my raspy throat was barely able to force this one syllable.  I felt a great jolt of pain in my right temple.<br><br>"Shut up." Walrun snapped. "Every effort brings you closer to death. You must rest."<br><br>I passed out right afterwards, coming to again in a disoriented state much later.  I looked around very slowly, with the slightest turn of my head bringing back twinges of pain, and threatening to throw me back into that black void I had just emereged from.  <br><br>Apparently I was in a troopers barracks, probably still near the Woods Gate.  I was stripped bare, except for the multitude of bandages.  I could not see my armor or my weapons anywhere.<br><br>"So, you live." I now recognized Kroniz, the other trooper. "Heh."<br><br>"How did I get here?" I spoke slowly, forming my words with care so that I would not slur.  My face was still quite swollen.<br><br>"Blast me if I know.  You were lucky Walrun was feeling a litte...err...indisposed, and decided to take a short walk to clear his head.  He found you right outside, lying near that thicket"  Kroniz pointed to some vague point outside the window.<br><br>"But..." I tried to remember "My last memory if of fighting a goblin horde, but...not near here.  I was in the western valleys."<br><br>"Cazic is looking over you then."  Kroniz cocked his head "Or maybe you had a little too much to drink, eh?"<br><br>I stayed quiet, searching my memory for any clue.  I had a vague feeling that I was missing something, but could not remember anything specific.<br><br>"Where is my gear?" <br><br>"Walrun has it.  He found it piled next to your body. He said you should be beaten for the care you give your weapons and armor.  You'll get it back when you're ready."<br><br>The trooper examined my wounds, lifting some bandages and re-arranging others.  A few moments later I heard a noise; it was Walrun.  He was carrying my gear, which he dropped near me.<br><br>"You must rest still.  When I found you, your braincase was exposed.  We thought you surely would die."<br><br>I slowly brought my hand up to my throbbing temple, and gently felt the bandages.  Walrun knelt and leaned closer to me.<br><br>"There is something strange about you." He whispered, his eyes never leaving mine. "There are signs of unnatural healing about you.  You can't see it from here, but the edges of your wounds are distended, as if a force strove to close your wounds somewhat."<br><br>"Perhaps we should have let him be."<br><br>Walrun looked up.<br><br>"He carries a stink about him.  Like he is already dead."<br><br>"What's done is done.  Stop talking foolishness, Kron." Walrun looked mildly annoyed.  He turned to me.  "You will rest now.  In a couple of days you will be strong enough to leave.  Until then, cause us no more problems than you already have."<br><br>I fell into a black sleep shortly afterwards, tortured by visions I could not explain.  I saw a grinning skull, cackling madly as it plied a deadly whirlwind among the goblin horde.  I saw blades hurtling through the air, and bodies falling by the scores.  I tried to search the void for a pair of pale eyes, but my strange dreams did not let me linger, but plunged me deeper into madness. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:55:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/01 12:33:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> I was brought before Harbinger Glosk along with the other Crusader trainees who were deemed ready to receive instruction in the dark arts.  For three days and nights we toiled on our new spellbooks, learning to scribe and memorize the spells which would become but one more tool in our arsenal.  After the lessons, we were taken to the Arena for practical training.<br><br>When my turn came, I remembered what my friend Hyrus told me about the weakness of our summoned skeletal companion, and forewent it's creation.  Instead, at the moment the Harbinger started the match, while my opponent was still concentrating on his summoning, I quickly stole my opponent's strength and leapt forward with my sword and smashed the blade against the skeletal head the moment it solidified.  Two or three more such blows and the construct came apart in a shower of bone chips.  Knowing I had an advantage, I pressed on, pausing for but a moment to tap my quarry's life several times and add it to my own.  Having brought my opponent to his knees, I was about to make use of the primal power given all Crusaders when the Harbinger stopped the match.  My head cleared and I congratulated the other Crusader on his fight.<br><br>In my battle rage I was but a moment from taking his life.  This probably would have wrought ill on my further training.  I still remember what happened to Velkorik, who on the second day mistakenly ordered his summoned companion to attack the Harbinger.  Glosk's image shimmered, and the construct's blows were repelled by what seemed to be a magical skin of force.  Suddenly from behind Glosk a large dark skeleton leapt forward and in one blow smote Velkorik's proud pet into dust.  Before the Harbinger could form the recall command, the dark minion of Glosk tore into Velkorik, whose attempt to run can still be traced by the bloodstains leading from the training area. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:56:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/2/01 12:54:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> I write this while I rest from my wound.  Earlier today I was taken to train my combat skills, specifically to dodge blows and missles.  At first I was engaged with a single opponent, whose blows I was able to avoid fairly well.  Soon however a row of spearmen advanced, and I was forced to dodge thrown spears while engaged in melee.  Several came close, but I gained confidence and was able to maintain myself without suffering any injury.<br><br>Suddenly I heard the stinging sound of an arrow, and it was only through the grace of Cazic that I was able to rotate and bring up my shield arm just enough to cover my throat.  The deadly missle impaled itself with force into my shield, with the tip barely penetrating the wrought iron surface.  I parried the next blow, and quickly swung my head around to survey this new danger.  Above me on the walkways were several troopers, each armed with a bow.  Another spear came at me, and I cleaved it in flight with my sword.  I could now see the troopers drawing their bows, and the deadly missiles were launched in quick order.   I quickly contorted myself and was able to dodge the first three, but the fourth one found it's mark, and I fell to the ground with an arrow protruding from my shoulder. <br><br>I got to my feet and ripped the arrow out of my arm, ignoring the pain.  I was shamed at my failure, and was told to leave the training area to see the medic.  After the poultice was applied, I headed over to the barracks to rest and let the herbs do their healing.  It was only when I got to my bedroll that I noticed something wrong.  After further examination, I was doubly sure someone had disturbed my belongings.  Nothing appeared to be missing, but I was sure this journal was opened, as the hidden marks were broken.   I write this in code known only to me, but yet I worry still.   <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:57:53 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/5/01 2:52:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> The last few days were spent retrieving the Tome for Lord Gikzik.  I collected Myrdukk and Zarkis and we travelled to the Swamp to look for the raider camp.  Rzilk insisted on coming along too, and although he is a little slow of mind we took him with us.  After a long day's march Myrdukk picked up the raider's track.  Soon we crept up on their encampment, a dirty collection of shacks along the water's edge in the north edge of the swamp.<br><br>Rzilk wanted to rush in right away and almost revealed us with his noise and excitement, but I would have none of it.  I pushed him down to the ground and exposed his throat, along which I pressed my dagger.<br><br>"Make one more noise and I will spill your blood and make you quiet forever!"  I hissed in his ear, pressing the tip of the dagger into his flesh.  "I will be damned if I let you get us killed through your stupidity."<br><br>There was fear in his eyes, and I held him down until he gave his submission before releasing my grip.  <br><br>We waited for three days and nights, observing the raiders and learning their patterns.  On the third night, we spied a rather large party of raiders departing southwards.  We guessed a raid was forthcoming and decided that this would be our best chance to act. <br><br>As soon as the raiding party departed, we made ready.  Waiting until Luclin was obsurred by clouds, I snuck into the camp with my three compatriots following closely.  The frogs failed to post watch, and were all sleeping in and around the camp.  Silently, using signs, I directed the others to spread out.  I pointed to a sleeping raider, and slowly drew my dagger along my throat for the others to see.  Myrdukk gave me a grim nod, and we got down to work.  The frogs never knew what hit them.  We made our way from one sleeping raider to the next, cutting their throats and watching their life's blood seep into the ground.  Several minutes later we were done.  Eight frogs lay dead or dying on the ground. <br><br>We spent an hour searching the camp, and found several pages from the Tome, but it was not enough.  We assumed that the remaining raiders would have the balance, and proceeded to set up an ambush.<br><br>It was the morning when we heard the other frogs coming back to the camp.  By then we had cleaned all traces of our bloodletting, and had the corpses hidden under blankets to look like they were sleeping.  We had each hidden ourselves in separate huts, weapons ready.<br><br>Through a crack in the hut wall I was able to observe the returning raiders.  I counted ten, one less than when they departed, and silently prayed he was a casualty of the raid, not merely a straggler who could give us trouble with his untimely arrival.  I wanted to wait until the frogs were in the center of the camp before setting upon them, but Rzilk beat me to it.  With a shout he leapt out of his hut and unleashed his Harm Touch on the biggest frog.  With a scream of pain the raider fell to the ground, a gaping smoking hole in his abdomen.  He was not dead yet, however, as Rzilk's primal power was too weak to kill him outright.<br><br>The other raiders were stunned by this for only a moment.  With a loud cry they launched themselves upon Rzilk, who smote one down with a cruel blow to the temple, but was rapidly pulled to the ground by the rest.  Within seconds he was covered by a pile of angry frogs.  It was then that Myrdukk, Zarkis and I charged out of our hiding places and fell upon the raiders.  Rzilk's idiocy actually helped gather the frogs in one tight clump for us, which was fortunate for us and not so fortunate for Rzilk, or rather for Rzilk's corpse.<br><br>We battled the frogloks for several minutes but they were no match for us, and soon all were dead.  I noticed some movement in the pile of dead, and was set to send another frog to meet his god, but then I recognized the gloved hand.  It was Rzilk, somehow still alive.  We pulled the grinning idiot to his feet.  Amazingly, except for being completely covered in frog guts, he was relatively unharmed.  <br>"He must have Cazic's favor."  Myrdukk turned to me and smiled. "Would be a shame to kill one so blessed, no?"<br><br>"Search the bodies and gather the pages.  Can you not muck that up, please?" I spoke to Rzilk and turned away, Myrdukk snickering softly behind me.<br><br>Zarkis lit a torch after we gathered all the scrolls and tossed it into the encampment.  Soon the entire rank place was on fire, and we held the glow at our backs as we made our way back to Cabilis. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 1:59:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>not a poon ~</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/6/01 4:25:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> After I received my new Khukri from Lord Gikzik, I was instructed to talk to Lord Korzin at once.  When I arrived, Lord Korzin fixed me with his gaze and cocked his head to one side.  It seemed that he was debating whether to tell me something, as several times he opened his mouth as if to begin speaking but changed his mind at the last moment. Finally he spoke.<br><br>"You have done well retrieving the Tome for Gikzik.  He seems to think you are ready for the next test."<br><br>"This servant of Cazic humbly awaits his instructions."  I bowed before the Lord, knowing that whatever else Korzin wanted to tell me, it would have to wait until he was ready to reveal it.<br><br>"You must find and retrieve the Skull of Torture, an artifact of Cazic-Thule that is lost to us."<br><br>"I am ready, Lord Korzin."<br><br>"You are not." Korzin snapped.<br><br>"Sir?"<br><br>"I see that finding the Tome had made you brave and reckless.  To find the Skull you will have to plumb the very depths of the Tower of Kurn and I can see your abilities are no match for the keepers of the Tower."  Kurzin's sneer was very wide now. "I suggest a little more training before you venture forth."<br><br>"My Lord, I am..."<br><br>"Dismissed!"<br><br>"Yes, my Lord."<br><br>I backed out of the chamber and made haste to the training grounds, as per Korzin's suggestion.  Halfway there however I was seized by a curiosity I could not overcome.  I needed to see this Tower now.<br><br>I was to be alone in this, as I could not find my companions.  Declining to waste any more time, I headed out through the Field Gate, and marched through the Great Pit northwards toward the imposing tower.  Soon enough the dark and foreboding structure grew to dominate my view.  We had all heard tales of Kurn the Torturer, but discounted most as myths or broodling fables used to scare the young.  Besides, he had been dead for a very long time now.  The last credible tale we had heard was that a race of Giants whom Kurn particularly enjoyed putting through his infamous Machina Tortura had sent a raiding party into the Tower in the hope of desacrating Kurn's tomb and carrying off his remains.  What became of these Giants is unknown, as no one had seen them emerge from the tower.<br><br>My musings came to an end when I reached the base of the tower and embarked up the long ramp leading to the entrance.  At the top I found a rather large gathering of various kinfolk.  Most appeared to be resting, some were binding their wounds, and the rest were cleaning their weapons.<br><br>"Hail, I seek passage into the Tower."  I addressed the group in general.<br><br>"Help yourself." A rather large warrior pointed his pike in the direction of the entrance. "Are you sure this place is for you?"<br><br>"I can handle myself."  I stressed the second word.<br><br>"Doesn't look it.  Have you reached your second rank yet?" This came from a Crusader.<br><br>"Thanks for your concern."  I was barely able to hide my anger. I unsheathed my Khukri and with the most self assured gait I could muster I stepped into the darkness.  <br><br>The blow caught me square on the side of my head and I tumbled against the wall, bruising my shoulder.  Another blow knocked my shield aside and then a vicious kick bent me over and left me gasping for breath.  I struggled with the pain for a moment, then I lunged onto my assailant while swinging my weapon, hoping for any contact.<br><br>My blade drove deep into flesh, and a stench of musk and rot filled my nostrils.  Now that my eyes had somewhat adjusted to the darkness I could see a large lumbering shape blocking my further progress.  The creature was taller than me by a head, and four times as wide.  It was completely covered with fur, mostly black with white stripes. The snout was long and full of pointed teeth, and the dark beady eyes seemed full of mad hatred.<br><br>I had heard tales of the Burynai, but now I was face to face with one.  The creature snorted and charged, it's massive bulk forcing me against the wall and pinning my sword arm against the wall making me unable to strike back effectively.  I felt the air being forced from my lungs by the terrific pressure.  I dropped the shield and drew my dagger from my waist and stabbed at the creature with my left hand.  The blade penetrated several times, but the Burynai took no notice. Apparently the creature's abundant fat supply was preventing the blade from reaching the vital organs.  I could see no neck to speak of, so getting to the throat was out of the question.  I was running out of options.  Already the creature had delivered a nasty bite to my shoulder, which was starting to bleed profusely.<br><br>I seized upon an idea.  I waited for the Burynai to open it's jaws again, and was promptly accomodated when the Burynai swung it's massive head at me, it's mouth wide open and teeth bared.  Instantly I gathered as much remaining strength as I could, and threw my head forward into it's gaping maw.  The Burynai snorted in surprise and clamped down on my helmet.  I was praying Shestar made a quality helm for me, and that the creature's massive jaws would not crush it and consequently my skull as well.  I was close to passing out, more so from the foul breath than my wounds.<br><br>With what seemed to be my last conscious effort, I jammed the dagger I was holding in my left hand deep into the creature's maw.  I stabbed and stabbed again only to be rewarded by tremendous amound of blood which rushed into my face and nearly choked me.  I felt the Burynai's grip on me weaken, and seized the opportunity to brace myself against the wall and kick the foul creature off me.<br>It staggered back a couple of paces, swaying unsurely on it's feet, a torrent of blood rushing out of it's gaping orifice.  I stared at it for a couple of seconds, then calmly removed the bow from my back, notched an arrow, aimed and let loose.  The missle flew true and sank into the Burynai's left eye.  I readied another, but by the time I had began to raise the bow, the Burynai fell backwards into the darkness.  I slowly approached the head of the stairs and saw the evil creature lying lifeless on the next landing.<br><br>I had no time to celebrate, as my blood loss was threatening me with the same fate as the unlucky badger.  It took me a while to bind my shoulder, and so deep were the bites that I had to use my entire collection of bandages.<br><br>"So this is the best Kurn can send against me?"  I shouted into the darkness below. "I will have you all!"<br><br>No one replied, which is just as well since reagrdless of my bravado I was sure I would have ran off if something else did come up the stairs.  I was worn out and wounded, and I had barely just penetrated the Tower's myriad depths.<br><br>I descended down the stairs, marking my way upon the walls with a sharp stone.  This place was a maze and I wanted to be sure I could make my way out again.  <br>After a while I came to rather large chamber, with columns supporting the vaulted ceiling.  There was but one way out of the chamber besides the one I came in, and I could see it was guarded.  Two rather imposing skeletal constructs were positioned beside the way further down.  Even from here I could feel the cold emanating from these guardians, and I could see the faint glimmer of ice crystals on their skeletal frames.<br><br>"Icebones!" I hissed to myself, and took a step back.<br><br>The other Crusader was right.  I could not hope to defeat them with the spells of the first rank.  My determination to accomplish something was overriding my fear though.  I did not struggle with the Burynai only to be stopped here.<br><br>I gathered myself and strove to unleash the mystic powers I had recently been trained in.  Using the utmost concentration I attempted to weave a shield around me, a mystical barrier which would shield me from the eyes of the undead guardians.<br><br>My casting done, I slowly moved forward toward the Icebones.  My heart rose in my throat knowing very well that if the Icebones saw through my spell I would be doomed.  I was sure they could make short work of me before I could even make it out of the chamber.<br><br>The cold was intense now.  I could hear the ice crystals hit the floor every time one of the Icebones shifted it's stance.  I drew a breath and stepped between them, expecting a cold icy fist to smite me down at any second.  It was only after a couple of moments that I realized the spell worked and I was safe.  I let my breath out slowly, and without looking back at the Icebones I descended further.<br><br>I passed many rooms and passageways but except for the various undead guardians I was unable to locate anything even remotely like what I was searching for.  I was getting tired and decided to head back before my protective spell broke or I got lost here in this subterrenean hole.  I started back, following the marks I had made, when I noticed a glimmer of light from a passageway I had not previously explored.  Creeping further, I recognized individual voices, and my spirits rose when I recognized my language being spoken.<br><br>"Hail!" I declared myself from a distance so as not to surprise the others. "I am Carnifex of the Crusaders."<br><br>"Come forward and be identified!" a voice called out.<br><br>Slowly I advanced, and came upon a group of six Iksar resting in the middle of a hallway.  I recognized one as Rossorik, a warrior with whom I had trained last summer.<br><br>"Heh, aren't you a little out of your league here?" Rossorik smiled at me.<br><br>"Maybe you would be too, if you did not have your companions to back you up." I tried to give as good as I got.<br><br>"I doubt that." Rossorik was obviously amused. "Come sit down and tell us what you are doing here."<br><br>I made my way to the group and sat down.  I grunted as a sharp bolt of pain travelled through my shoulder.  I closed my eyes for a moment, trying to hide my shame at having revealed myself as weak and injured.<br><br>"Let me look at that".<br><br>"I will be all right".<br><br>"Let him check it."  Rossorik spoke in a tone which prohibited further argument. "Kurobis is a good shaman, he can help you.  Sit still and let him work."<br><br>I gritted my teeth but said nothing as Kurobis unravelled my bandages.  <br><br>"Badgers do nice work." he spoke to the group, grinning at my helplesness. "You bound it well, but you did not take into account the disease.  Soon your arm will turn rot and you will be one-armed.  A fine warrior you will be. Maybe they'll let you work in the broodling pens." Kurobis threw his head back and laughed.<br><br>I did not find this amusing at all.<br><br>"Here, drink this." Kurobis uncorked a bottle of the most foul smelling concoction that ever had the honor of assaulting my nose. "It will heal your disease and drive it out."<br><br>"Or kill me."  I made a face but took the bottle.<br><br>To say it was vile would be an understatement.  I was actually surprised I did not throw it all up right away.<br><br>"Now, what are you doing here?"<br><br>"I seek the Skull of Torture for Lord Korzin.  They say it glows brightly, but I have not seen any such in my travels here."<br><br>"Oh." Rossorik seemed surprised."A glowing skull?"<br><br>He turned to another in the party.<br><br>"Markiss?"<br><br>The one I assumed was Markiss shrugged his shoulders and reached into a rawhide backpack lying between his feet.  After a couple of seconds of fumbling within he brought out a white object.  It was a skull, pure white, but even from here I could see tiny little flames dancing inside it's cavities.<br><br>"The fire within glows, but does not burn." explained Markiss.<br><br>"Yes, it is an illusion." added Rossorik.<br><br>Markiss causually threw the skull at me, and I was so surprised I was barely able to catch it.<br><br>"Take it, it's yours."<br><br>"I do not deserve it, Lord Korzin told me I must collect it on my own."<br><br>"Don't be stupid, it's worthless to us, and how is that windbag Korzin supposed to know how you acquired it?"<br><br>I was shocked at how easily Rossorik slandered Lord Korzin.  I knew Troopers were a rowdy lot, and here was proof.<br><br>"Put it away."<br><br>I did as was told and inserted the precious skull into my bag.  I had mixed feelings about it but I would certainly not refuse the gift, at least not in front of them.<br><br>Suddenly Markiss got to his feet and fixed his gaze down the hallway.<br><br>"They're coming!" he cried as he unsheathed his weapon.<br><br>The whole party was on their feet, forming a battle wedge formation facing toward the approaching unknown.<br><br>"You must go."  Rossorik suddenly turned to me.<br><br>"I can help" I snorted back. "I am no coward!"<br><br>"You will go now!  The bones always attack the weakest.  You will merely throw them into a greater frenzy.  Your presence here endangers us all.  Go! Now!"  <br><br>Rossorik pushed me towards the hallway from which I came.<br><br>I was powerless to argue with the seasoned trooper, and I could see some logic to his ways. I quickly found one of my marks on the wall and began to run towards the exit, pausing for but a second to renew my spell of protection.  I still had a partial view of the hallway where Rossorik and the rest were getting ready to fight. Out of curiosity I risked a glance back and saw a sight most impressive to behold.  Rossorik and his party were standing in a circle, facing outwards, repelling multiple attacks from a horde of skeletons.  There were already several crushed piles of bones lying at their feet.<br><br>These were not the simple Icebones I had seen before.  These skeletons were wielding weapons and moving with a purpose.  I saw one swing it's hammer and almost land a deadly blow on Markiss, who parried and struck back.  Markiss' blow, while mighty, failed to destroy it and merely bounced off the very thick bones this particular construct was made of.  Another skeleton, this one with curiously long fingers, was swinging a scimitar with some accuracy if Rossorik's grim expression was any gauge.<br><br>Suddenly I felt a presence behind me and I spun around, my hand on my weapon.  It was another skeleton, and it was moving towards the fighting.  Apparently my spell hid me from it and it ignored me, continuing to move towards the din.  I noticed that in it's right hand it held a war club, the most intricate and beautiful instrument of crushing I had ever seen.  There were strange runes inscribed on the surface, and it's metal tips were polished and sharp.  <br><br>The new skeleton had now reached the fighting, and it lept into the fray.  I saw a flash of blue light emanate from the skeletons club, and then everything was lost in the melee.<br><br>Apparently I had allowed my spell of hiding lapse, a fact of which I was reminded of when I felt a sharp pain in my back.  The scalebone behind readied another strike, but I was quicker and unleashed my Touch.  I knew it was not enough to kill it, but the couple of seconds it took the skeleton to recover would be all I needed.  I plunged down the hallways, madly scrambling and hoping I would not lose my way.  I tried to follow my marks as best I could, all the while running from an ever growing horde of pursuers. Once I thought I was lost when I reached a dead end, but I quickly backtracked before the posse could catch up and found the right way again.<br><br>After running through what seemed to be entire tower and back again, I tripped against a large mass on the floor and stumbled before coming to a rest.  I smiled in recognition; it was my Burynai friend from before.  I knew I was really close now, and bounded up the stairs toward freedom.<br><br>"Had enough?" it was the same Crusader who mocked me before. <br><br>I looked like a bloody mess, and as tired and winded as I was I surely did not present the image of a victor.  I strode over to where he was sitting with his comrades.<br><br>"Maybe you had better leave this place to some that can handle it?"  There was a round of guffaws at my expense.<br><br>I said nothing.  With my right hand I reached back into my pack and took out the glowing skull.  I held it out in front of the sitting Crusader, and could see that he was startled.<br><br>"Maybe we can let Lord Korzin decide just who can handle what, no?" I sneered. "Have you received your Knight's Khukri yet?"<br><br>"N-n-no, not yet" he stammered, clearly taken aback.<br><br>"Good luck with that then. Let me know if you need any help."<br><br>I didn't wait for his reply.  Instead I strode down the ramp, cradling my precious skull in my hands, and made my way back to Cabilis to receive my prize. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/17/01 12:44:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uoboe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oboe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/9/01 2:54:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crusader</span><hr size=1> Very well written. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/10/01 11:01:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> I write this with a muddled mind, my thoughts still being invaded by the strange visions from the last few days.  Three nights ago I along with some others were judged ready to begin more intensive training in the mystic arts.  Late in the evening we were collected from the barracks and taken deep below the Temple of Terror.  I recognized the way and thought for a moment we would be taken to that secret room where the Ambassador gazed upon my hidden self, but I was wrong (and relieved), as we marched past that place even lower into the crypts.<br>Soon we came upon a short antechamber that opened into a larger room.  We were marched inside and told to find a place to sit on one of the mats scattered about in a large crescent.  As soon as we were all seated a figure strode out of the darkness and ascended a small dais.  I recognized Hierophant Oxyn, one of the more well known of the Scaled Mystics.<br><br>"For some time now you have been trained in the mystic arts."  Oxyn's voice reverbrated clearly within the huge chamber.<br><br>"You are all familiar with using the magical energy, and some of you are a lot more proficient at it than others."<br><br>He paused and looked around the room.  I could see him pause his gaze on some of the trainees and nod his head slightly, as if acknowledging their progress.  When Oxyn's gaze fell on me however, no such gesture came.  Instead Oxyn just stared at me for what seemed like eternity.  I could read nothing from his eyes and soon became very uncomfortable under the scrutiny.<br><br>"You are all rank amateurs at managing that energy." Oxyn finally spoke.<br><br>I was very glad that Oxyn took his gaze from me and was addressing the trainees in general.<br><br>"Tonight you will receive training on how to reach an intense meditative trance.  Once you reach this state you will be able to reach out and gather this energy in a more efficient manner.  You will find your mystic energy will replenish itself much faster this way."<br><br>Oxyn made a signal with his hand, and two attendants emerged from the back carrying a heavy pot, which they set down in the middle of the room.  They then retreated and came back carrying an assortment of bowls, which they handed out to us.<br><br>"The key to achieving success with this technique is clarity of mind."  Oxyn spoke again once the attendants retreated into the darkness.<br><br>"Once you are trained properly and have experience, you will be able to slip in and out of this trance at will.  At first you will be able to regain your energy by concentrating on your spellbook.  At greater levels of proficiency you will be able to achieve the maximum effect merely by sitting down and clearing your mind.  Right now however you can not do it by yourself for you do not know enough of your own minds yet."<br><br>Oxyn paused here and pointed to the pot standing in the middle of the room.<br><br>"Inside that vessel is a potent mix of herbs and fungi gathered by our masters and prepared specially for you to help you achieve that which your unaltered mind alone cannot.  You will now take your bowls and fill them from the pot.  Do not drink of the extract yet."<br><br>We did as we were told, lining up to take our share.  When my turn came I filled the bowl dutifully, noticing the very strong bitter odor emanating from within, and returned to my place.<br><br>"You will now drink all that you have, and signify you are done by placing the empty bowl beside you."<br><br>I drank deeply of the extract, trying as hard as I could to ignore the extremely bitter taste.  I was hoping it would not come up and embarass me in front of the others.  I glanced at Myrdukk a few rows over and our eyes met.  He stuck out his tongue slightly and shook his head.  I almost laughed out loud.  Apparently others loved the taste as much as I did.<br><br>"Good.  Now as we wait for the effect I will begin your instruction."  Oxyn spoke once we were all done. <br><br>As he was speaking, the attendants came out and cleared the pot and the empty bowls.  They soon came back, bringing what looked like a large collection of drums on a wheeled podium.  They both assumed positions within the contraption, and began to drum softly along to Oxyn's speech.<br><br>Oxyn spoke in a slow cadence, explaining to us how to clear one's mind from all thoughts.  He began by explaining a simple technique, how to slowly count down from one hundred down to zero, all the while staring at one spot in space and trying to not focus on any one particular thought.  He said that by the time our count ended we would have reached what was a weak meditative trance.<br>He went on and on, all the while the drums slowly keeping beat with his words.  I tried to keep attentive and follow the exercises, but I noticed a particular feeling in my stomach, like a soft pressure was being applied from without.  Soon after this strange sensation spread to most of my torso and I also began to see that the potent mixture was having an effect on my eyes as well.  I saw that all movement left a multicolored trail behind it and if I stared at any particular place for any length it became like the sea, with waves and currents undulating on what should have been a firm surface.  I looked to my right, where Rzilk was grinning like an idiot while slowly waving his hand back and forth in front of his face.  He seemed to be entranced by this simple movement.<br><br>The drums went on and on, and even though I still heard Oxyn's words I no longer understood them.  I heard individual words clearly, but could not keep them together.  I also lost track of all time.  I had no idea how long we were here, or how much time was remaining.  Soon after it became an effort to keep even an individual thought entertained longer than ten seconds, and I reclined on my mat and closed my eyes, giving in to the ocean within.<br><br>I floated in the blackness for eternity.  I was at peace and felt safe, safer even than the feeling I had in the broodling pens of so long ago.  After an indeterminate time I became aware of a soft blue light.  I concentrated and could now discern individual strands of this strange blue light floating about me.  Like fog spilling into a valley, or dye slowly swirling in the water, these blue strands were slowly twisting and turning, combining and giving birth to new wisps of blue.<br><br>This was the mystical energy!  This was the 'mana' that Oxyn spoke of before.  I tried to remember what he said, how he instructed us to reach out and gather this energy.  Slowly I cleared my mind again, using the counting trick that Oxyn taught us.  This time I reached the empty state much faster, even before I finished half the count.  I could see that the strands of blue were now floating towards me, and when they reached my body they were sucked inside, as if my body was thirsty and they were water.  <br><br>I do not know how long I stayed in that state.  I would take turns releasing all my mana, spending it in one burst and then absorbing it back from the void.  After a while I became quite proficient at this.  I found that the returning mana came back in pulses, and if I could time a release of mana between these pulses, then my re-absorbtion would be uninterrupted.  <br><br>I was interested to see if this mana had any other properties, but my gentle trance was interrupted from within.  The blue mana was now gone, replaced by the blackness, and I sensed another presence in the void beside me.  Suddenly there was a flash of blinding light, and the void was gone.  I was standing on a flat grassy plain, stretching out endlessly in all directions.  The sky was blue, without any clouds.  I tried to find the sun, but could not.  The sky itself was the source of light, gently diffusing the brightness onto the endless plain. <br><br>"So, we meet again."<br><br>I whirled around, surprised to find the voice coming from directly behind me.  I recognized the voice before I saw him, but even that did not prepare me for his awesome force of presence.  I knelt before the Ambassador, unable to raise my gaze upward.<br><br>"Stand." His command was sharp, but without malice. "Look at me.  I mean you no harm."<br><br>Rapidly he removed his cloak, and for the first time I was able to gaze upon the the Ambassador clearly.<br><br>He was a blueskin, but that I had already guessed.  He was shorter than me by a head, but there was no doubt who the master was here.  I had seen blueskins before, but none so regal and imposing.  His white hair was slightly curly, which was unusual for one of his kind.  He had a broad forehead, and a slightly hooked nose, set on top of a pair of thin lips.  His most memorable feature however were his piercing pale eyes, which almost seemed to glow as they appraised me.<br><br>"My lord," I began with a trembling voice "I stand ready to pay the price for my forbidden knowledge."<br><br>"You are?" His laugh was loud and mocking. "It is precisely what you will do. Pay. But not in the way that you think."<br><br>My puzzled look surely amused him even more for he let out another laugh.<br><br>"No, no, no, my scaled minion, you should not fear death at our hand.  Not yet, anyway."<br><br>"Sire?"<br><br>"You have the full knowledge, having overheard the entire meeting, so I will not have to explain to you what we face.  You know the augry, and what it foretold."<br><br>I nodded gravely at this.<br><br>"What you don't know is that the future can be changed.  The augry shows the most likely outcome providing nothing else changes, that no one takes steps to alter the coming doom."<br><br>"My lord, I do not know how I can help, I am only..."<br><br>"Be silent and do not interrupt.  I can not maintain this much longer."<br><br>I bowed my head and vowed silently not to anger the Ambassador any more.<br><br>"There are some things that can be done to avert this calamity.  Even as I stand here measures are being taken and grand plans are being laid.  I will be very busy in the near future doing my part to bring about a favorable ending to this whole mess.  However, there are some things I cannot do myself.  Unfortunately I am too well known in some places to accomplish the things I need to do with speed and secrecy.  For this end, I will need a reliable minion to carry these tasks to their conclusion."<br><br>And so my destiny was being laid bare before me.  I was to be the tool of the Ambassador, working against fate.<br><br>"I understand." I nodded gravely.<br><br>This prompted another laugh from the blueskin.<br><br>"If you did you would have run trembling and tried to find the deepest hole to hide in.  Count yourself fortunate to be so ignorant."<br><br>The Ambassador paused here and looked at me again.<br><br>"I now must go.  Train diligently and be ready.  I will call upon your services very soon."<br><br>I began to answer but the Ambassador was gone.  I was alone in the void.<br><br>My dream trance slowly began to unravel, and I became awake, lying on the mat in the chamber below the Temple.  I slowly stretched, each of my muscles complaining of disuse.  I felt as if I had been lying there on the mat for days instead of hours.<br><br>I looked around and noticed I was alone in the room.  All the other trainees were gone, their mats furled and stacked against the wall.  I slowly rose to my feet, unsteady at first.  I cast my gaze upon the dais, and saw Oxyn sitting there, his head cradled in his hands.  Seeing me rise, he slowly stretched, rose, and walked over to me.<br><br>I thought he was going to say something but instead he just stared at me with a quizzical expression.  After a short while he pointed at my mat, and then at the rolled up mats along the wall, which I took to be my cue.  I folded my mat and placed it alongside the others.<br><br>"Follow."  This was the only word Oxyn spoke to me that night.  <br><br>I obeyed dutifully and we ascended toward the surface.  When we reached the main temple area, Oxyn pointed toward the doors, and I exited the Temple and headed toward the barracks, where a surprised Myrdukk explained to me that I was gone for three nights and that no one expected to see me alive again. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 2:05:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/12/01 3:40:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> After the meditation exercises I threw myself headlong into arms training and combat practice, seeking to forget my troublesome visions in the glint of a bloody blade.  Soon enough I gained my second spell rank, and then went through more combat training, specifically learning to parry.  Afterwards, I decided to put my new skills to use.<br><br>Loaded like a pack animal, I headed further into the wilderness then ever before.  After a treacherous journey through the Woods, I came upon a small valley that led me out of the forest and opened up into a gigantic treeless expanse.  There were small undulating hillocks dotting the countryside as far as the eye could see.  I could see a tremendous statue of an Iksar warrior down below, his sword raised defiantly to the heavens.  Bowing slightly to pay homage to this great unknown hero, I descended down the slope and headed out onto the plain.<br><br>After a long trek I came upon a giant rift in the earth.  I knew I could not descend safely for the rope I brought would have covered but a fraction of the cliff face, and the canyon walls streched in both directions as far as the eye could see.  I could go no farther, and judging this great tear in the earth to be able to provide me with protection from surprise attack at least from one side, I proceeded to make my shelter.<br><br>For one week I remained there, hunting during the day and practicing my meditations by night.  I would occassionally cull my growing pile of loot; stuff I had hoped to sell when I came back to Cabilis.  I had dozens of sabertooth fangs, cockatrice beaks, and various succulent parts, all promising to fetch a pretty price back home.  I gave up on the hides as I would have no room to carry them, and being untreated they became quite rank after a while.  I tossed them all into the canyon, watching them plummet until they hit the ground down below.  I thought I saw movement there, a whitish pale thing with many legs scurring about, but could discern no greater detail.<br><br>On the ninth day of my stay I packed up my camp and headed north, leaving my bulky belongings for pick up on the way back.  After a day's travel I reached the sea and refilled my water jugs from a small stream which emptied into the brackish ocean.  Following the shore, I trekked westward for two days.  At the end of my second day I crested a small hill, and saw in the distance before me the stone fortifications of a seaside fortress.<br><br>I was sure this was the blueskin outpost I had been told about.  I stripped myself of all but the most necessary gear and concealed the rest.  I waited until the night fell, then slipped into the salty water and began to swim west toward the fortress.  It was not necessary for me to get closer as I had no real mission to accomplish there, but I could not ignore my powerful curiosity.  My conversations with the Ambassador only served to stoke thirst for knowledge of the blueskins and now I was on my way to meet them.<br><br>I swam most of the way under the water, coming to the surface only very briefly to draw a fresh breath.  I did not want to risk being seen by the pickets as I had no way of judging what their reaction would be to me if I was detected.<br>After several dives I reached the outpost wall.  It came out far into the water, forming an artifical jetty which I assumed sheltered the blueskin harbor from the ocean waves. I swam around it, this time not daring to come close to surface in case there were sentries about.  I felt the sea bottom sloping up and knew the shoreline was near. This was quite fortunate since my lungs were close to bursting as even an accomplished swimmer like myself cannot stay under water more than a couple of minutes, and it did take me considerable time to navigate around the sea wall. I gave a quick prayer to Cazic and surfaced a few feet from the shore, hoping the surf would disguise my appearance.<br><br>I stayed mostly submerged for several minutes, surveying the area and watching to see if any patrols came nearby as part of their regular route.  After I was satisfied I came completely out of the water and crept slowly along the wall, deeper into the outpost.<br><br>I was only able to make a short distance as voices and movement nearby betrayed the location of several armed blueskins.  I flattened myself out along the wall, hoping to avoid detection as I observed them closer.  There were six total, each armored and armed in identical gear.  Soon a seventh blueskin joined them, and I could tell from the deferential way the others treated him that he must be their leader.  Ever though I could not understand their language, I could plainly see that they were getting ready for an extended patrol.  They inspected each other's gear and finally mustered into formation only after their leader was satisfied they were ready.  Soon after they headed south out into the plains.  I made a mental note of the position of the stars.  It would be a good thing to know the frequency of the blueskin patrols in case they proved less than friendly.<br><br>Assuming the oupost lightly guarded now that the patrols were out, I crept further in.  I could see that this was no military outpost, but more of a provisioning station and a marketplace.  Apparently the blueskins did not fear an attack here in these remote reaches, for I only saw a few more guards, and many many more civilians.  I was starting to become brazen in my exploration, and in doing so almost lost my life.<br><br>As I turned one corner I saw a large brown column in front of me.  I was of mind to disregard it until it moved.  Surprised I looked up, only to behold a sight most terrible.  The column was but one leg of a gigantic beast, a creature taller than any living thing I had ever seen.  <br><br>"A Golem." I whispered to myself out loud.<br><br>I knew of these magical beings from my grandfather's tales but always dismissed them as just that. Tales.  What powerful magic could create such a being?  And what power was needed to keep them under thrall?  I now knew why the blueskins did not assign a large number of troops to this place. Just one of these creatures could demolish a whole army.<br><br>I heard a dull creaking sound from above me and looked up only to see a giant brown fist descending upon me.  With all my quickness I leapt sideways, narrowly avoiding being flattened.<br><br>The fist lifted and the mighty golem let out a roar.  Seconds later the roar was answered by another, and I could sense the earth tremble with the approaching footsteps of yet another giant.  I was in full flight at the time, running for my life as both giants came after me.  For a split second I thought of running towards Cabilis, where the woods would shelter me from my pursuers, but I gave that idea up once I realized the distance involved.  <br><br>Changing my direction quickly, I ran toward the water, hoping that my swimming skills would put some distance between me and the relentless golems.  I dove into the water and swam like mad out into the harbor.  I was hoping that the golem guardians would take aversion to the sea, but I was quickly dissuaded from that notion when a giant fist slammed into the water beside me.  The shock from the impact drove me under the water and disoriented me.  I dove down towards the bottom hoping for a hiding place, but the golem would have none of it.  Swimming down after me with a skill that belied it's bulk, it launched another attack upon me.  I waited until the the blow came, then kicked up as hard as I could toward the surface, hoping to confuse the giant.<br><br>The water was very murky and I thought I could see a dark shape on the water's surface above me.  It was too late to avoid it and I slammed my head forcefully into a hard surface.  Disoriented, I flailed about, my air running low.  I felt something pass quickly in front of me and instinctively I reached out and grabbed it, nearly dislocating my arms in the process.  It was a plank, a shaped piece of wood, and it was carrying me through the water faster than any being could swim.  I could barely hold on.  Apparently this wooden plank was part of larger vessel plying it's way across the harbor toward the open ocean.<br><br>I slowly made my way to the surface clawing my way underneath the vessel.  Just before I thought my lungs would burst, my head broke surface.  Using my Khukri's curved edge to anchor myself, I looked around for my pursuers.  The two golems were still swimming after me as I could see the huge wake being made by their grotesque bodies, but they were no match for the speed of this vessel and quickly fell behind.  I was lost, hurt, and being carried into the unknown by a strange ship, but at least I was out of immediate danger. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 2:06:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/01 9:11:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> I stayed on the ship for about two weeks.  I am being generous when I call it that, for I have never seen a pile of junk such as this remain afloat longer than a minute.  It was in essesnce a giant raft, held together with rusty nails and rotten ropes.  The deck structures were obviously cannibalized from other vessels, and the mainsail was composed more of stitching and patches rather than actual sail material.<br><br>I was the only passanger.  The crew consisted of several paleskins, obviously brigands and lowlife drunks.  I stayed out of their way by hiding amongst the cargo and never had a problem with any of them.  They seemed to be totally preoccupied with alcohol and dice games, and I gave them no reason to be vigilant.  <br><br>I figured that this vessel was on a regular route, returning to the blueskin outpost occasionally.  I decided to bide my time here and wait until the ship returned.  I had food aplenty, as I discovered that a school of large fish-like animals liked to keep pace ahead of the ship.  I would wait underneath the bowsprit, hanging from a rope seat I fashioned myself, until one of these animals would come up to vent air and then I would spear it and haul it in.  Each kill provided enough food for a day. The meat was tender and sweet while the blood I drank kept my thirst in check.<br><br>We passed several islands but we were not close enough for me to discern details.  Finally on the sixth day we approached a larger island and I saw the crew make ready for docking.  I did not want to risk being seen, so I took no unnecessary chances and instead observed from my hiding place.  <br><br>There were several structures visible past the dock; huge, crude huts with oversized doorways.  I thought I could make out a couple of large shapes moving therein, but from this distance I could not be sure.  I had not much time for the paleskins soon made ready to be underway.  There was no cargo transfer and I could see their leader was disappointed no passangers were embarking.<br><br>For seven days we sailed without incident, and then on the morning of the eight day I recognized in the distance the walls of the blueskin outpost.  Supremely happy at seeing the familiar shores and sick and tired of eating fish, I didn't wait for the ship to dock, instead I lept into the water while the shore was still about a mile away and proceeded to swim to the shore.<br><br>It was strange to have beneath my feet a solid surface of a friendly shore at long last instead of the swaying deck of the floating wreck, but I did not allow time for sentimentalities and instead gathered my gear from my hiding spot and set off back to the canyon campsite.<br><br>Collecting my hidden stash of loot, I packed up the rest of the gear and headed east towards the woods.  The trek to the city was uneventful, albeit slow paced due to the weight of all I carried.<br><br>Once in Cabilis, I unloaded my wares at the marketplace and feeling my purse to be a bit heavy in coin I sought Viich the blacksmith and placed an order for a full suit of banded armor.  The smithing would take a day, so I headed over to the Temple to give a report of my travels.  The scribes were particularly interested in the layout and the patrol routes of the blueskin outpost as well as the comings and goings of the supply vessel, details which I was only too happy to provide.  <br><br>I know the blueskins are allies in the war, but you never can tell what bit of information might be useful. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0> at: 7/16/01 2:11:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uaoii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoii</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://space4aoii.homestead.com/Files/images/icon.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Board Administrator</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/13/01 11:42:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://space4aoii.homestead.com/Files/images/sig.jpg width=173 height=131></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Crusader</span><hr size=1> good stuff.  :)<br><br>probably doesnt get many reads becuase you dont use any<br>paragraph brakes.  people dont read becuase they're lazy,<br>they dont read becuase the text lay out hurts their eyes. <p><br><br><font face="tahoma"><font size="+2">@</font><font size="+1"></font></font><br><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ucarnifexrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carnifex Rex</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://guildhome.org/g/tinyskull.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/16/01 3:38:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://guildhome.org/tz/carnifex.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Crusader</span><hr size=1> My first dealings with the Giants.  The Kromdul tribe inhabiting the crude wooden fort in the middle of the woods received a little nightime visit from us yesterday.  We were in and out in classic fashion, leaving nothing behind except a couple of rotting corpses.<br><br>I was tasked with picking up a diagram of the giant fort from one of our spies but this simple mission got complicated when the recalcitrant spy told me I could not have the diagram unless I found some spells that were stolen from him by the giant.<br>Barely keeping my anger in check, I told him that it wasn't my fault he lost his damned spells but he was adamant about it.  I resolved to finish this task for Lord Qyzar and then deal with this fool afterwards.<br><br>I collected Myrdukk and Sorla and we headed out into the woods, waiting for nightfall before the final approach. We found the fort without a problem; it was just down the road past the stream like the spy told us.  We were hoping for a bit of lax security on the part of the stupid brutes but were disappointed at finding the gate guarded.  Good thing we were prepared.<br><br>We swung over to the western fort wall, where the spy told us the giants patrolled least.  After several heaves Myrdukk was finally able to secure the grapple across the parapet and we hauled ourselves over.  Rapelling down into the fort we spread out to scout the area.  <br><br>Apparently the giants entrusted their gate guards with the security of the place as we found no roving patrols within.  Sorla was the first to report good news.  She had found a house on the northern edge which contained some of the smaller giants the spy told us about; the saplings which "stole" his scrolls.<br><br>We made a final plan then slowly and carefully entered the house.  The stink was incredible.  I thought the Burynai breath was bad, but it was nothing compared to a pile of sleeping giants.  Did these beings eat only rotten meat?<br><br>Our initial plan was to dispatch the giants one by one, but their proximity to each other would entail the chance of one being woken by the wounded cries of another, so we quickly decided to dispatch them all at once, there being one for each of us.<br><br>I picked my victim from the three and crept up until I was beside it's head.  For this task I left my Khukri sheathed; it was a potent weapon but a little too short for this work.  Instead I had a longsword ready and I slowly raised it until the tip was very close to the sleeping giant's head.  I looked around at the others who each gave me an affirmative nod.<br><br>I gave a nod back and with all my strength pushed the blade of the longsword as hard as I could into the giant's ear.  It slid in easily.  The sleeping giant opened it's eyes and drew it's breath sharply as if to scream in pain, but instead the air escaped slowly from it's now lifeless chest.<br><br>Myrdukk's blade must have glanced off a bone as his giant sat up suddenly, a bloody blade embedded in it's ear, throwing Myrdukk to the ground.  Luckily Sorla was done with hers and leapt at the sitting giant and cleaved it's neck with her blade.  The giant turned it's head to look at this new source of torment but then fell lifeless among the others.<br><br>"Quickly!" I hissed "Search them and we go!"<br><br>We fell upon the dead giants, rifling through their rank clothing until we found what we were after.  Two battered scrolls both being used as wrappings for foraged roots were on the giant Sorla had dispatched.  I spied outside and seeing the way clear bade the others to follow.  We made the wall in good order then quickly climbed the rope we had left behind and exited the foul place.<br><br>I returned to the spy and gave him the scrolls for which he gave me the diagram in return.  One look at the diagram and I was livid with rage.<br><br>"This...this..scribbling!" I stammered in disbelief. "This child's drawing?  This is what we risked our lives to obtain?"<br><br>"But it took me days to draw this map." He was clearly surprised.<br><br>"You incompetent idiot!  I could draw a map ten times better than this and all I have is one nighttime visit to the place!" I was waving his ugly little drawing in front of his face.<br><br>I turned to my companions to show them the drawing.  Instead of looking at it Sorla let out a laugh and pointed behind me.  Seizing this opportunity the spy had hightailed it out of the building.<br><br>"Probably for the best." I spoke. "It could have turned a bit bloody if he stayed.  Heh."<br><br>It took Myrdukk, Sorla, and I about an hour to draw a much better map of the giant fort, which we then presented to Lord Qyzar.  For our troubles we each received our new Khukris of the Zealot. <p><hr><center><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Carnifex</font></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Cazic's Crusader</font> - <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern">Sullon   Zek</a></b><br><b><font color="#008000">Scaled Mystic</font> - <a href="http://pub43.ezboard.com/btallonzektimes4735">Tallon   Zek</a></b><br><hr></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uguri007.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Guri007</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(7/17/01 2:17:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> WOW</span><hr size=1> This is the absolute best game related role play I've ever read.

This would make me quite happy by itself, but unfortunately this only means I am still twelve hundred short.<br><br>Several nights I spoke to the Scarscales, the master Crusader blacksmiths.  I had heard a rumor of a new type of armor that they were developing and sought to query them.  I was received politely enough, but I noticed both of them became rather short with me after I disclosed I was quite broke.<br><br>"Tis true.  We can make you the Dreadscale armor but we require rare components in order to fashion it." Sarth Scarscale informed me.  "Also, each piece will require a gem or two to be ground and the powder combined with the metal in the forge.  We estimate the gems alone will cost you over thirteen hundred platinum pieces."<br><br>I looked over the list of components required.  Bloodgill scales?  The head of Grachnist?  Ugh. <br><br>"Since we are in the smithing business, not the charity business, I am afraid you are wasting our time here."<br><br>Dismissed thusly, I wandered around thinking as to how I was going to come upon these riches.  I remembered Rossorik and what he told me several weeks after our meeting in the Tower of Kurn.  He said that he and his party made some nice cash selling the fine steel weapons they had acquired in the tower.  He mentioned that there was one area of the tower which seemed to be frequented by armed bones, and that some of them gave greater treasures still.<br><br>I had not been to Kurn's in quite a while but I still remembered my first encounter with the smelly Burynai.  I was sure that now that I have had my extensive training and experience the denizens of the tower would fall before me.  Emboldened, I made preparations to enter the tower.<br><br>For this trip I decided to go in alone.  As this would be a money making proposition I was loath to share my spoils.  I crossed the Bonefield and climbed the ramp.  Once in the tower, I made myself invisible to the bones and followed the directions Rossorik gave me; hug the right wall, down the double stairs, hug the left wall, down the curving stairs, then forward to the end and make a right.  <br><br>I had little trouble making it down and soon recognized the area where I first came upon Rossorik and his crew.  I made my camp there and got to work.<br><br>I stayed there for two weeks, sneaking out occasionally to refill my supplies and get rid of the accumulated loot.  I fought the undead and the badgers, all falling equally to my skilled strokes.  It wasn't glorious and it wasn't heroic, but it was very profitable.  Some of the bones wielded weapons made of fine steel, and this was my prime objective.  I also accumulated backpacks of hide and ruined scale armor, bronze weapons, gems, and other items which swelled my bank account.<br><br>One night while getting ready to rest for the evening I spied a strange light from down the hallway.  I got up to investigate and followed the source of the light.  It was a new bone, one I had never seen before.  While this bone was altogether unremarkable, I saw that it was armed with a shield.  It was this shield that was the source of the light.<br><br>There were two other bones in the room, but I knew that bones were quite stupid and was able to slay them once I enticed them singly out of the room, whereupon I set upon the shielded bone and smote it easily.  <br><br>I took my new prize and examined it.  I could see it was of higher quality than my current shield, and it was scribed with runes on the edges.  It was an ancient script, but after a time I was able to comprehend the nature of the magic.  In addition to the glowing light, the shield also provided some protection against spells.  This was good news indeed.<br><br>I noticed that on some days my little hunting ground got quite crowded.  Either Rossorik was loose with his tongue or there were more intrepid explorers than I thought, but either way some nights I had competition from over dozens of my fellows, all looking for the same thing; riches.<br><br>Unwilling to share the spoils, I approached none of them.  Instead I moved a little farther inwards where no one hunted.  Armed with the knowledge of the timing of the bone patrols, I was able to run in at a designated time and virtually pluck the patrolling bones from the grasp of the other hunters.  If the others were more observant, they would have noticed the bone patrols returning every seventeen and a half minutes.  As it were, I was the only one keeping time (apparently only I had the patience to count to one thousand and fifty), and I was able to move in just at the right time.
