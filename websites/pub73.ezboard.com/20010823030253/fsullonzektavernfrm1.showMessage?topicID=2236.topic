Someone shouts it out, so i begin to run lol.  Anyway, the druid and wizzy eventually catch me.  The wizzy roots me, and then nukes me for 381 a pop (meaning that he is 34+).  I am only 25, and have lost my level multiple times (just haven't been able to get out of 25 lol).  So, after the wizzy has taken me to 20 or 30% health, the druid starts to nuke me for 77 damage a pop (this is fucking pitiful, and if the druid had been alone, i would have poped on my resist gear, and gave his ass a whuppin)  and kills me.  I lose another 3 blues, thus taking me even further from my level (and i only needed one more kill or so to level up).<br>
<br>
I didn't report them, because I'm not a pussy, and because right now this IS a valid tactic.  I did however /feedback the situation.  I spoke with a GM and he informed me that the GM's of Sullon have been getting similar reports of red cons taking greens down to 20% health and letting evens finish the green off.  He said that this is valid, but is a major exploit of the system, and that as soon as Verant figures out some way to combat this, they will.<br>
<br>
My basic argument is, would YOU like this tactic to be coded someway to not be posisble?  I know that i do NOT want the tactic to be able to be used but illegal.  That only gets ignorant people banned, and is never fun.  But i would like to see it be coded to not happen some way.<br>
<br>
Also, do you believe that the experience loss in PvP is too high?  I do.  Currently it is the same as dying to a MOB.  I can guarantee EVERYONE that this will result in NON-PVP at higher levels.  Because when a level 60 dies, it takes him about 10 hours to get his experience back.  Depending on which class it is.  I also /feedbacked for this to be changed.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate comments on the subject.  This is NOT a fucking whine, and if you can't distinguish yhe difference between a whine and an actual request, then you have a problem. <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

<br>
As far as exp loss, they should make it to where you GAIN exp on killing evens or reds PC's.  Just make it to where you gain full exp on the first kill of a PC, 3/4 on the 2nd kill, 1/2 exp on the 3rd kill, and 1/4 on the 4th kill, no exp after that.  This would promote people killing people who are within their range or above.  It would give &quot;goods&quot; something to hunt for exp, since the mobs are in short supply, they could exp hunt newts or evils, hehe (and vice versa).  It would keep people from wanting to corpse camp, because you are getting less and less exp per kill, so you would want to move on to new prey for the better exp.  <br>
<br>
I know that they have said they would NEVER give exp for killing others, but WHY NOT in a fashion such as this?  This is supposed to be a hardcore server, jesus, seems you should get some benefit (other than stupid points) from being hardcore.  You could brag that you got from lvl 25-50 on pk'ing. Heh, what level would Dharma be now if she could get exp from kills?<br>

<br>
Once something like this is in place, people will just have a higher-level player debuff/root/snare while the even-con kills you, leading to the same outcome: a really shitty way to lose XP. Still, something needs to be done to at least make it difficult/time-consuming to do, in order to deter this kind of thing.<br>

<br>
One way or another, Verant has decided that lower levels should suffer little-to-no consequences (other than a CR) when killed by a red con.  This is why they coded it as such.<br>
<br>
However, when this happens, while I may not get *killed* per se by the red con, he is by far the *reason* why I died, and not that even con with the lucky last shot.  Should not these two circumstances be treated the same way?<br>
<br>
I've been complaining about this PL-esque approach to PvP for quite some time.  It's just as lame as invulnerable healers...ok...maybe not quite...but damn close...and here the consequences are far greater... <p><center>

<br>
With a rule of most Dmg... you can have a wizard there waiting for the other one to get you down to 50% or lower... and the he finishes you off.  You still lose exp, coins and other things.<br>
<br>
This would change the strategie, but will not change the game plan of those doing this.   Dunno if there is anything that will ever be done on this.  Nicen in BB was fearing everyone (lvl 29), I was one of the higests at the time there at 20...  everyone that died lost exp, cause while Feared... we were getting hit by greens and whites.  I was one of the few that escaped death a few times.  It sucks, but knowing it can be done to us...   we need to be very cautious...   All I can say... I'm happy to be a wizard, I can gate around the world to escape some trouble makers... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

UR NUTS<br>
read my whole post<br>
<br>
To avoid shiznick like this, what VI COULD do is put a &quot;Damaged By&quot; counter on a player every time a player is damaged.  this counter would last for.. 2 mins?  If a player dies and has a Damaged By counter from somone who is red to them, no XP death.  All other rules still apply.  I have no idea how easy/difficult this would be to code.  just a suggestion.<br>

If they went to &quot;most damage gets the kill&quot; It would resolve this and also allow &quot;support&quot; melees like bards monks and warriors who do most of the damage while the wizard gets the big finishing killshot to be rewarded appropriately for the work they do as well.<br>

<br>
But these two were in a GROUP and were TRAVELING together.  It wasn't just a random encounter where a wizzy was going to pk me and then a druid comes up and gets the kill.  They had this planned out.  And i feel it is a lame tactic and an exploit of the system.<br>
<br>
What i really want is for experience loss to be lowered to about 10 or 20% of a normal exp death.  Because i would bet every dime I have that if it isn't changed, there won't be much PvP on Sullon Zek level 50+.  Not solo PvP anyway.<br>
<br>
Btw, i'm kind of suprised that i didn't get flamed up the ass... <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

There they have very good code in place where &quot;realm points&quot; are given to everyone who helps on the PvP kill, even healers.<br>
<br>
So far it works much better than this &quot;last hit&quot; crap.<br>
<br>
FYI though this practice is fine when in acceptable levels.<br>
<br>
If I travel with a wizard who is 2 levels under me, and I let him get all the even con kills that are green to me, that's acceptable in my book (HI DUNE!). <br>

Corann, didn't address this in my last post, but what was i supposed to do?  I was TOLD that there were two newts in zone.  I was TOLD that the wiz was 39+ and that the druid was about 20.  What the fuck did you want me to do Corann?  Go looking for them?  yeah I'm sure you would have done the same thing Mr. Honorbound <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
If the druid had been alone i would have been able to kill him.  I'm not a fucking blubie from running from a level 39 and a level 20+ that are running after me.<br>
<br>
If in order for me to be &quot;red&quot;  i have to attack a level 39, and a level 20+.  I'll just be blue (that isn't what red means, but I'm trying to make a point.) <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

<br>
pvp is designed around 'risk vs reward'.  and even risk of exp loss is better than the old item loot.<br>
<br>
add those to together and you get one person burning you down, so another person can kill you, cause you exp loss, and get points for his own team.  then they can split the money.<br>
<br>
it sounds like a great tactic to me.<br>
<br>
sure some pvp is solo, but most of it is group.  if you are not going to group, expect to die for exp loss.<br>
<br>
and i don't want 'most damage'.  if i come up on a wounded player who just got done with a mob, are you thinking i am going to sit around while he gets to 51% health before i start in on him??<br>
<br>
later on, what about shaman canabalize?  in big groups, shaman will chew the arm to the nub, and then when they die they did more than 50% damage to themselves??<br>
<br>
the best thing about exp loss and damage now, is that it is even across the teams.  they can do it to you, you can do it to them.  that sounds fair to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uvachir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vachir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/01 2:13:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting a high level to weaken, and then a lower level kills</span><hr size=1> To link this to another topic, if resists were not level dependant you could have at least resisted the root of the higher level wizard and escaped.  The connection to invunlerable healing is quite correct, basicly because of the way resists work if someone is 10+ levels above you none of your spells will land on them and all of their spells will land on you making them basicly invulnerable.  <br>
<br>
It has already been said more than once that kill credit based on damage is not possible for pvp, suggesting impossible solutions is not helpful.  As to xp loss, I would still rather see xp gain of 50% of the xp loss inflicted for killing even cons than just reducing the ammount of xp lost, we'll see how much feedback VI gets as more players hit endgame and start taking pvp deaths. <p>--------------------<BR>
