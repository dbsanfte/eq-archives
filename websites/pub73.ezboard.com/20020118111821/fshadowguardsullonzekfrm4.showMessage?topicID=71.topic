I spent many of my younger years with an old and powerful alchemist who told me of my past.  I still, to this date, do not know if he did this to be kind, or to fear me into submission.<br>
<br>
This Alchemist informed me that I had a brother, and a powerful brother at that.  Before he told me who and where I would find him, he gave me a light history on our family.   Our parents where not married, our mother was from the lower class, and fell for the “charms” of a popular, powerful, and well respected Trooper.   Having been born without our parents being bonded together, we were outcasts.  Everyone knew our mother had done something out of the ordinary, and we paid the price for it.   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  From our births Silrassis was always stronger that me, much more stronger.  When things would not be going well, and a traveling Froglok or Sarnak would attack me, Silrassis always had to protect me.  However, he did not command the ability to harness fear into magic, or project that out to a target.   Other than being shunned by most of the Iksar that lived around us, and only having ourselves for amusement, our early lives were pretty normal.<br>
<br>
One day, while basking under the bright kunark sun (a favorite past time of young Iksar).  We heard a horrible screech nearby.  Looking up we were just in time to see a majority of our village burst into flames.  Being a village of poor, unpopular and relatively weak group of Iksar, the Troopers, Crusaders, Dead, and Mystics of Sebilis did not come to our aid.   The “Ring of Scale” quickly laid a majority of our town to waste.   Running as fast as we could into town, we reached our home.  The smell of burning flesh and death was everywhere.   Looking around what was once our home, the screech was heard once again.  The noise of something leaking was so loud I thought it would crush my skull.   Looking to my brother for help, I saw him turn and his eyes widen in horror.  Just then, the green gas filled my lungs, I felt sick, and fell to the ground dizzy.  The last thing I remember was seeing my brother beside me, and the lifeless form of our mother crushed under the weight of our fallen ho</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->[/i]<br>
<br>
These are the memories that I was able to recover after spending much time under the influence of potions from the alchemist.  Until recently I had no memory or knowledge of my brother.  Now that we are finally together, I feel like we have never parted sides.  I want for my brother to tell me of his life.  When and where did he make his decisions.  When did he come to the conclusion that he was to be one of the stronger and more feared Troopers of  New Sebilis, or Cabilis as it is referred to.  Was it at the same time I was going through my trials as the Tower of Terror, to become a Scaled Mystic?<br>
<br>
So many things I have ask from him.  Things that I want to be documented in my Journal.  Things I would have liked to share with my Mentor.  Unfortunately, my last trial to become a mystic was to end his life, as he was maddening, and seeing  things that were not there, putting many a young broodling in danger.<br>
<br>
Powerful indeed, has my brother become, and together we will spread a wave of fear across all the lesser races of Norrath.  Together, with the aid of our new friends, Shadow Guard, we will grow more powerful and bond with those of like minds.  Together we will grow strong enough to crush the Ring of Scale and pay back the pain that has been delt to us….<br>
