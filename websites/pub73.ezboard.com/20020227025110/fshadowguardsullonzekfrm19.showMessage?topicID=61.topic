(IC Long)</span><hr size=1>      <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> It is a stormy Norrathian night when a stranger approaches the Tavern of Shadow Keep.  Although the sheeting rain drenches the cloaked figure, a hint of a smile glimmers upon his lips for only a second.  Reaching the heavy wooden door, the figure enters into the commotion of the tavern.  The room is filled with Tier'Dal drinking besides their comrads and sharing stories of their valour in persuit of Innoruuk's glory, Ogres and Trolls joking in the booming voices of the Cabal, and the Iksar's hissing curses towards those that favour light over darkness.  <br>
     In one fluid motion, the figure sweeps the hood from his face, causing it to make an audable (swoosh) as it fell perfectly around his shoulders.  The visage revealed is one of a young Teir'Dal.  His hair is arranged with a perfect part in the center, moving with a seeming fluidity as the last reminients of wind brush across it.  He is definately a youth, having not blemish nor scar upon the indigo skin of his face, but his eyes betray his true nature. A deep crystalline blue, they are filled with a frigidity that indicate the darkness of his soul.  They are eyes that suggest an amazing duplicity for such a young Elf.  It is apparent he has been the victor of many battles with a cruelty that would have made Innoruuk proud.  The gleam of his eyes demonstrates nobility and honor.  At his side hung a variety of expertly forged weapons, as well as the sigil of The Dead etched upon his belt, indicating to all that he was a Knight of Innoruuk, one of the Elite of Neriak. <br>
     The youth began to walk slowly toward the bar, taking in the sights around him.  Upon reaching the bar, he gazed into the eyes of a beautiful Dark Elven barmaid.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>
     &quot;Vendui, M'lady&quot; the young Elf said in the smooth tongue of the Teir'Dal language.  &quot;Perchance you could perform a favour for me?&quot;<br>
     The young barmaid was spellbound by the handsomeness of the Knight before her.  There was just something in those eyes that she couldn't force herself to look away.  A soft smile crossed the lips of the Knight as he waited for her reply.<br>
     &quot;Vendui, M'lord&quot; she replied shakingly.  &quot;What...What can I do for you?&quot;  A blush spread across her cheeks as the youth leaned closer.<br>
     &quot;I wish you to take a letter of great importance to the Lord Vizier or the honored Imperator himself.  Can you do that for me?&quot;<br>
     &quot;Yes, M'lord... as you wish,&quot; Was her reply, but despite her trembling heart she continued on &quot;Sir, a moment of your time before I go.  May I ask what that is, pinned to the inside of your cloak?&quot;  Afraid she may be prying, the barmaid leaned away from the Knight after she spoke.<br>
    &quot;This?&quot; He said, drawing the object out, and holding it between his index and middle fingers, &quot;Is a Lady's Mantle, a very special type of Rose&quot;  The delacate blood red petals of the flower moved in the slight draft. <br>
    &quot;Its so beautiful...&quot; she said, gazing upon it.<br>
    &quot;And deadly...A single drop of the oil from those petals under the skin of an enemy will cause his.. liquification in mere moments.  The Ebon Mask uses them for poison, but I choose them for a much more... asthetic reason.  A person can only aquire them two ways from me; given in honor and friendship, or placed upon their slain corpse after my blades and magicks have finished a worthy opponate.&quot;<br>
   The barmaid was stunned by the youth's reply.  It seemed so mature for one who had most likely not even reached his 20th season of training.  Her thoughts were broken as the youth fluidly extended the arm holding the flower to her.<br>
    &quot;Go on,&quot; he said.  &quot;Tis a gift. Take it with my thanks for your service.&quot;<br>
    The lady looked dreamily at the Knight and took both the flower and the letter from him.  &quot;Thank ye M'lord, I shall treasure your gift and deliver your message at once&quot;<br>
    She immediately left the noisy bar, journying down torchlit passages toward the throne room at the center of Shadow Keep.  During the long walk, her curiousity got the best of her and she split the seal upon the letter and read what the young Knight had written in such delacate script<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Vendui, Leaders of the Shadow Guard,<br>
   May this letter find you both in good health.  It is with great pride that I come before you today to pledge my blade and my life to your service.  I have long wandered Norrath seeking others who have shared the values and ideals of Lord Innoruuk. I believe that perhaps, with your blessing, the Guard may be the home for me.  If all has gone well, you shall find me in the Tavern to summon me at your leisure.  <br>
<br>
Aluve,<br>
Tarrant<br>
12th season Teir'Dal Shadow Knight </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
    Noting the sigil of a rose inscribed near the bottom, the barmaid closed her parcel back up and continued her erran to its completion...<br>
