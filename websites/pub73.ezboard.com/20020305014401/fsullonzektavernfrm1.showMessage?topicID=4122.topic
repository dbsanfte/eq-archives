It's getting hard to pull efficiently for quadding without it, so off to perma I go to get my heart of frost. Well, see I kinda like goods, and have been known to be quite generous with them, sitting in gfay and making spells, etc. I have some friends on the good team I like fighting with (Frosthound, Sadadar, Leaha, etc...) and in general enjoy competing with them. So I thought I had 2 options, head to perma and wipe everyone out and hope that dumb heart drops....or give them some good to let me loot it. They get to keep xp'ing, I get to drop some loot on them, and I get the item I need. Well, I find 6 goods in a group in perma and I offer them 2 jacinths to get the heart for me, I thought that was quite the generous offer for a simple item, and you know.....kinda win/win for all. Well, I sit there and chill with them and a few bonk on me, and I chatter back and forth and I think this is all good. Until they get friends and zerg me. I wasn't paying much attention and managed to die to them ( /hang head ) like a noob. Oh well, my fault for trusting another team. /bonk<br><br><br>Well, fuck if I am going to nice and get shit thrown back in my face. So I round up a few friends and we head back to CR and get my damn item. We pop into Perma and wow, there are 20 goods trying to CC me. Well fuck that....we owned them, grats to Quzar for killing several red cons and a ton of good xp was lost all around. What a bunch of morons. So we get my item anyways, kill some more goods.....and some more goods and head out to EF. Well now, the whole zone is going nuts. Fuck you, you had your chance to let me get my item and you get fat loots, instead I got my item and you got one huge CR. Tough, I hate greeny griefing, but you idiots deserved it.<br><br>Hey, I can't complain, this is Sullon Zek....you can do whatever you want. Just the next time a single good whines on these boards about anything, a big FU. You all make your own situation worse with dumb stunts like tonight. Perma was fucked over and closed down for over an hour becuase you were to dumb to take a very generous offer for a simple task. I had no intention to kill a single green, and you ended up with 50+ deaths, good work.<br><br>Oh well, flame on....there are many goods (and Newts) I have friendly competition with, and enjoy playing with. Just never ask me to feel sorry for your whining asses again. That was my first trip to EF, and other than my epic, my last. There is nothing for me there, and I feel for the few intelligent goods that have to level there. I'm sorry if I am not enough of an ass-hole for many of you (I can see the &quot;Bluebie Poon&quot; flame now), but I have no itention of killing every green I can find. If I can pay you to do what I need, I would prefer that.....much less work on my part, and I'm a lazy ass. To all you in perma last night, well, you earned what you got.<br><br>--- edit - And yes I pk a lot, I'm not hiding in some corner of SZ somewhere, and I could care less about dying, I do it a lot. What bugged me is the goods screaming &quot;Greeny Farmer&quot; when I gave them a plenty acceptable alternative to it. <p><font color = ff0000>Velael regards you indifferently - He appears to be a taxi</font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uvelaelsoulrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velael Soulrender</A> at: 10/10/01 12:18:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ufashionetta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fashionetta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>God in Training</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/01 12:15:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4122.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://toolshed.down.net/pix/undertow.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My evening with the goods (and how dumb some lowbies can</span><hr size=1> Well, I'd never give shit to the enemy team when you can easily kill them and get what you want at the same time, but I think you learned an important lesson....and they got what was comin to em <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ublerx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blerx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/01 12:17:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4122.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My evening with the goods (and how dumb some lowbies can</span><hr size=1> damn, that sucks.<br><br>Generally as a rule I just ignore the green cons until they try to start shit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/urosencrants.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rosencrants</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/01 12:18:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4122.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My evening with the goods (and how dumb some lowbies can</span><hr size=1> Dude yer a fucking retard....thank goodness the goodys have some fucking testicles unlike you...stupid fag evil i swear you want this server as blue as possible dont you well tough shit gimp.<br><br>Rahemon DB <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ugrimjawbadflagon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimjaw Badflagon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>God in Training</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/01 12:18:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4122.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My evening with the goods (and how dumb some lowbies can</span><hr size=1> Sooooooo hmmmmmm how does it feel to be a solo player on enemy turf?
