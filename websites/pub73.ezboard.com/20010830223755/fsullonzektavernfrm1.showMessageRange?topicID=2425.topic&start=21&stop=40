As for the comment that levels &gt; skill in EQ pvp.....yeah, and your point is? If you wanted a game where some people didn't have an advantage....I hear Quake calling. I'm not saying that maybe it should as much as it is...but a level 30 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> own a level 20 one on one...it should be not much of fight, and one where the level 20 is glad to live if he can escape.

There is something to saying red mobs land spells on your ass all the time, but there is also the good point that you can run away from red mobs, leave the zone, and be completely safe from them. Red players can follow you all game unless you zoneplug.<br>
<br>
Yes, the rampaging wolf should be able to kill individual villagers one by one, but shouldn't a sufficient number of them be able to take him down (with losses)?<br>
<br>
I don't really care either way myself - I'm a bard, and when reds come to town I can outrun them fairly easily. However, I think that this patch (as intended, not bugged as it is now) would make huge wars and zone contestions more common as dark greens stood in defense of there lands. It'd be an enormous boon for the good team.<br>
<br>
I'm sure no one here actually supports the bugged implementation, just the fine idea behind it. <p>----------------<br>

  All this debate, while bringing out some pretty good posts on boths sides, seems to be pretty useless from a practical standpoint until we find out (assuming we'll be told) what actually went wrong with the patch.  Was the adjustment slightly off from a 'slight' change or was it way off the scale?  Nobody disputes that something is wrong.  Nobody (pretty much anyway) thinks that level should have absolutely no part in determining how effective your pvp is against substantially lower players/mobs.  I'm sure this has been both petitioned and commented on by players in game and in the dev corner.  Whether Alan responds or whether they bring the server down for emrgency patch or wait until next patch I don't know.  What I do know is that as things stand right now, right or wrong, this is a pretty good time for some ppl to get in a little keyboard time with their characters on other servers...<br>

<br>
The difference, here, is that Clerics and Enchanters are SUPPORT classes.. they are not supposed to be offense oriented.  And they do support work VERY well in PvE AND PvP.<br>
<br>
Wizards ARE supposed to be offense oriented, but obviously you have never played a wizard because you would realize that in PvP, wizards suck most of their lives.  It IS a very frustrating class to play, and very frustrating to pvp with especially.   You are not wanted very much in PvP or PvE for groups because you don't really add much other than firepower that takes a LONG time to reload and is resistable.  Melee damage is much better when you can add some melee-friendly support classes.  And as a stand alone pvp class, wizards get a few one shot spells, and then they are at the mercy of the opposition.<br>
<br>
The reason wizards complain about offensive power is because they are an OFFENSE oriented class.  You should fear a wizard.. but most people dont.<br>
<br>
It's pretty obvious that wizards are goign to have better offensive capabillites than enchanters or clerics... they are intended that way. <p><P><html><center><a href="http://angerthas.com/"><center><IMG SRC="http://angerthas.com/horsesig.gif"></center></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uagrul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agrul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 11:59:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards...hah!</span><hr size=1> They fucked up the patch.<br>
<br>
Apparently they over-did the whole thing, and Reds resist less than greens now (as opposed to the proposed implementation, where reds, evens, and greens would simply resist an equal amount, assuming they had approximately identical MR).<br>
<br>
That said, please leave the patch out of this discussion - the patched changes do NOT make the spell-rolls based on resistances, they just fucked it up.<br>
<br>
AC?  AC is not the end-all of PvP.  It can be very important in a melee joust, but it isn't *that* important.  Sv Magic / Poison / Disease / Fire / Cold are insanely important in a PvP battle, and I personally prefer my fights to be based on equipment and skill more than level.  If you prefer to see red cons decimate you because they sat on a kobold longer, good for you; we simply disagree.<br>

<br>
Resistance equipment is far easier to camp than levels are.<br>
<br>
If you can get level 35, you can get 100+ MR.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it works out.  Equipment requires some thought (planning, selecting necessary pieces) to boost your resistances in the correct manner, and is attainable by a fairly &quot;low&quot; level (35).  Levels are simply killing the same AI-based mob over and over again with the same old stale tactics you used on level 5 mobs.  Skill is, well, skill.<br>
<br>
Given a choice, I'd rather the first and last be deciding my PvP encounters than the center.<br>

<br>
<br>
A level 25 melee in full AC gear does a LOT better vs. a level 40 melee character than a level 25 melee does naked.  Sure, he still gets hit a lot, but not quite as often for the max amount, and from time to time he gets a miss.<br>
<br>
Before patch:<br>
A level 25 melee in full resist gear doesn't fare <b>any</b> differently vs. a level 40 caster than a level 25 melee does naked.  His presence or lack of gear has no affect on the outcome of the encounter.<br>
<br>
<br>
One way or another, they're attempting to make the the game more uniform, in treating resists closer to the way they do AC.<br>
<br>
<br>
I go after an awesome weapon, and whether I'm attacking a 10 or a 60, I'm still swinging faster, and connecting for more damage (on average).<br>
I go after some awesome AC gear and whether I'm being beat on by a level 10 or a level 60, I'm still getting hit less often, and for less damage (on average).<br>
I go after some awesome resist gear at 30, and I'm resisting no more than before the level 10s' spells (because I resisted them all before) or the level 60s' spells (because I never resisted any before).<br>
<br>
There was something wrong with the discrepancy described here, and even if they didn't fix it properly in this last patch, the fact that they're taking steps towards fixing it is what matters to me...<br>

100 MR is not really that tough to get as alot of mr gear is droppable.  Also AC is tied to your defense skill.  Mr is not tied to any skills.  MR is STRICTLY gear and buffs, AC is gear buffs and skill.  <br>
As I have said, most of the MR gear is droppable and attainable by twinks.  <br>
Alot of really high AC gear is NOT attainable by twinks and when good AC gears is held by a twink their low defense skill keeps their AC low.  MR does not have this benefit.<br>
now hold on...  lemme think....<br>
<br>
Rather than have your MR go up with levels like AC does, they made it so Higher level ppl have a higher chance of breaking through your MR.  and higher level ppl have a LOWER chance of breaking thru your mr.  Its an artificial change.  Its something that with the current system would just be too difficult to actually show.<br>
<br>
I realize that might not make a whole lot of sense, im not very good at putting my ideas down on paper <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Assuming higher level spells are more powerful and harder to resist, lower level characters with 80mr arn't going to be resisting level 50 magic based spells effectively, however mid level characters who have taken the time to build up mr gear to around 150 might have a shot at resisting them somewhat, and if they really went out of their way to focus on gear rather than leveling and upped their MR to 200+ they should get the benefit of it and be able to have a decent chance of resisting more powerful spells.  Of course they could have just focused on leveling to try and get more powerful spells themself but they would still have very weak resists and be vunlerable to less powerful spells.  <br>
<br>
This would mean that resist gear and levels would be of somewhat equal importance as resists make you harder to kill but levels make it easier to kill others.  If resists worked this way it would be entirely possible for someone who took time away from leveling to build up the right equipment to take down someone who powerleveled up past them by xping constantly and not bothering to pay attention to equipment.  Obviously one would be more offensive and the other more defensive and the higher level char would still have some advantage due to unresistable spells and such but at least it wouldn't be impossible for the lower level with higher resists to fight back. <p>--------------------<BR>

this patch FUCKED casters cause we have shit AC and most likely even if your green you will be able to hit us yet we can stick a god damn spell on you because of your MR has been buffed up and equip.  i feel sorry for mages/wiz/ench but as least necros have lifetap which is unresistable at any lvl.  bitching melees we should just take mage and nec out of the game and replace them with summon/mana bitch <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uelty.showPublicProfile?language=EN>elty</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 12:34:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> whoever argue a lv20 can't land sell on lv40 frog, true.<br>
