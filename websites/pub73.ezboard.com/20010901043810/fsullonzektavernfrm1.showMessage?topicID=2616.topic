I started this server the day it opened and have had to fight for everything Ive got. I was there for the first WC/EC/Kith battles when people were trying to get some toe holds on zones. We have raided from perma down the karanas. Ported into Fay-Mart,BB, MM, and took the fight TO the other teams. There are bluebies on every team, and your greatest excuse to date was us sitting in kunark farming away. Well, now you bluebie neuts and your 200,000 dr00ds got Velious (for now).

<br>
I agree, I don't think you, Anono, can say the same for anyone in Kunark. Your not in Kunark. <br>
<br>
I'd also say your a liar about pvp fights in Velious, the statistics show very few kills are made  there. <br>
<br>
I guess my question to you Anono is how did so many newts get to level 50 as so many have? Please don't say they killed a mob, then fought someone, then killed another mob, then fought someone else. You need to realize that statistically there are blue players on every team, and I for one am happy there are players in both the good and neutral teams that can give a great fight. For if there wasn't, this server would truely be blue and the only thing we could do to each other is /finger and train when we didn't like someone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uvelaelsoulrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 3:35:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Neuts = hypocrits</span><hr size=1> lol, those nights in Kith when no one was over 15 and we were more afraid of the orcs in high pass than the newts.

When the server opened up, the fact is Kunark was left by itself near completely untouched for almost a month.  Iskar hit 30 in record time there (Ruin) Meanwhile, I was fighting goods from the first second I hit 6th.  You cannot deny that fact.<br>
<br>
And Kunark *is* being farmed.  More and more however goods and newts are coming to kunark and wreaking havoc. <br>
<br>
I have never been to Velious on Sullon, so I have no idea what sort of pvp takes place. It could be being farmed.<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it, I do not really have too much of a problem with anyone farming if it rocks their boat, whether it be evils or no.  But day one, evils did have a geographical advantage. Whether that advantage has slipped, or no longer exists, or newts have a similar advantage is a different debate.<br>

<br>
Ok we will go over this AGAIN.<br>
<br>
first, Anono is correct. There is almost always a raid on Velious by either sect or ie or by some evil guild I am just meeting. And of course Ruin.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, for instance Sect raided twice. Don't you get it? the Grey Pact was formed due to the ammount of PvP on Velious. No such pacts have had to be made by Kunurk guilds, has it?<br>
<br>
Now, differences between Newts in Velious, and Evils in Kunurk.<br>
<br>
1 - Evils STARTED with KUNURK. Newts TOOK VELIOUS.<br>
<br>
When the server started, Evil started with Kunurk. An entire Evil-only Race had a city there. Thus they had an established presence there. <br>
<br>
Goods and Newts also could not come to Kunurk and establish a foothold for many weeks. Why? Because the city they would have to bind/sell in (FV) is a level 20+ zone. They could not come there before level 20 to pvp or exp, because of this.<br>
Evils, however could and did go to Kunurk before level 20, and leveled in bluebie safety in the newbie zones around the EVIL city. The most bluebies were the iksar, who started there.<br>
<br>
NOW TO VELIOUS<br>
<br>
NO ONE started in VELIOUS. In fact you have to earn faction for most cities there. Thus VELIOUS is the only continent with a clean slate. EVIL had the highest levels overall on the server when the newts were hitting mid-20s, and that is when we made the bold move to go and fight for Velious. Guilds like TDC, GF and DB went over in mass. And you know what? It was a fight. I was the only one in my original group to make it to thurg to bind, the rest (in my group) died to Ruin who was fighting us at the GD / EW zoneline.<br>
<br>
Velious was open for the taking. the only requirement was that you had to be level 25ish to survive there (unlike Kunurk, where evil could be a level 1 and level). Like I said, Evils overall leveled faster than most, in the early weeks. They could of gone to Velious first.<br>
<br>
In fact, they did! I went to Velious around level 17 to buy a velium coldain spear at thurg for about 150pp (better stats than the the combine rapier). I deid on my firs trun there to 2 DE Necros that were camping the docks at Iceclad. A sneaky run later got me my prize, and I observed 6 evils and 2 newts in IC, and 2 newts and 1 evil in GD. Evils were the greatest threat. In fact, I heard while I was there that the 2 newts had a no-fighting deal with 4 of the evils there! (Couldn't believe that).<br>
<br>
ok, one more difference between the 2 continents needs to be pointed out.<br>
<br>
2 - VELIOUS difficulty > KUNURK difficulty<br>
<br>
Kunurk, as an evil, is a level 1-60 zone. It does have some very hard zones, and it has some where leveling isnt that stressful.<br>
<br>
Velious is a level 30+ zone. The mobs hit harder, more are sowed, and they (like the dervs and snow cougars) blend in to the surroundings a little too well. Velious also has some uber mobs that have been pulled to areas to eat entire guilds.<br>
(A guildmate of mine died last night to Woushi, who was at the Kael zoneline).<br>
<br>
So in Velious, when we aren't Pvping, it isnt that we are sucking on the exp nipple. The exp nipple often is hitting us upside the head. I and other melees HATE crossing VELIOUS zones. I have been killed trying just to cross EW over 10 times now.<br>
<br>
So a Newt on Velious is not the same as an Evil on Kunurk. It is ture that now they seem a little more similar, as we each have our lands now. But remember, our lands are harder, and we had to go take and earn ours.<br>
<br>
any questions?<br>

<br>
Sorry but thats a croc of shit. You didnt take and earn anything. You walked off the boat, and sat down in front of the first nipple you saw, but want to call team evil for doing it on kunark. Thats my point. Nuet = hypocrits stands. You didnt fight for Velious, there was no epic battles on the bridge. I *I* ME Did NOT start in Kunark. But you still give me that crap like I somehow went there at level 1 straight out of 3rd Gate or something. <br>
<br>
You say that 30+ zones are harder to move around in than Kunark? Huh? You smoking crack now? There is about 3 trees to lag you out and block your view in Velious, where as in Kunark there is 30,000 per zone. Use the walls and dont run down the middle you will have more luck I think. <br>
<br>
If you want to say we got handed Kunark, ok. But in turn you got handed Velious, and good... well... good got sniped. We are all blue brothers and the only true PvPers are the goods.

<br>
No one started on Velious.<br>
<br>
Evils were there first.<br>
<br>
The only way to take a place you don't started out on is to A)  Have team members starting ther or B) Walk there and kill whomever is in your way until you control it.<br>
<br>
We chose option B, considering A wasn't available.<br>
<br>
Velious zones don't have trees?  Heh, you must never have ventured into the Wakening Land.<br>
<br>
Please don't take this as asserting that Evil-teamers are blue.. they aren't (innately).  Only those that let themselves be blue will be blue.  Those that actively seek out PvP / engage in it when it's nearby are in no way blue in my opinion.  However, you can take this post as my claiming that Neutrals did indeed accomplish more in taking and holding Velious than Evil did in starting out on and holding Kunark.<br>
<br>
&quot;there was no epic battles on the bridge&quot;<br>
<br>
There quite are (and were), as a post made a week or two ago by a Ruin member displays.<br>
<br>
&quot;I *I* ME Did NOT start in Kunark. But you still give me that crap like I somehow went there at level 1 straight out of 3rd Gate or something.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your teammates did, and therefore were able to secure it for you with an obvious geographic advantage.  Therefore, you always have had a huge continent of easy exp'ing available to you, whilst Neutrals did not (until they took Velious.. key word being &quot;took,&quot; meaning they had to place some effort into controlling it), and Goods still don't.<br>

                            speaking on that. When the server opened up, the fact is Kunark was left by itself near completely untouched<br>
                            for almost a month. Iskar hit 30 in record time there (Ruin) Meanwhile, I was fighting goods from the first<br>
                            second I hit 6th. You cannot deny that fact. - Grimshade<br>
<br>
Im not saying team neut, Im saying &quot;people&quot;, and most of they are on team neut.  I have a tremendous amout of respect for the good team. They truelly have the epic march to victory. But I am tired of hearing neuts say evil is ahead, we had it easy blah,blah,blah, when they basically started the same. We all had to fight our way to the top. Im not an Iksar, I didnt start with kunark/racial advantage. I was with the rest on the mainland fightin it out.<br>
<br>
You say you were fighting the goods the second you hit 6th? Well, I had to fight the neuts the second I hit 6th too. All of us that have been here since the beginning have fought tooth and nail forward. ALL OF US. (Cept the iksar =p.) <p>Renxerox <BR>  >Da Bashin' Iggles< <BR> Master Bone Caller <BR>

<br>
You (meaning your team, not you individually) started with Kunark.<br>
<br>
PvP was an option for you.<br>
<br>
If you chose to engage in it, I applaud you, but it doesn't mean your team had it any more difficult (than it in actuality did).<br>
<br>
As a Neutral, we had more limited options, as Velious was not Neut-controlled at the time, and all our zones were on Norrath, with most of them being borderlines with Evil / Good zones (resulting in frequent conflict).<br>

The zones are huge, and people from all 3 teams could pretty much safely level there.  Why are there so few PvP kills in Velious if neuts are &quot;taking&quot; it?  I'm sure most evils are in Kunark, and neuts moved to Velious to take the left-overs (rather then actually fight for lands in Kunark), and they just went after the sloppy seconds from the few power gaming evils that had already taken the items from the various zones neuts are now moving into. <p><HTML>

<br>
I told you in my post that my first trip to Velious had it controlled by evil (i was killed by them), and that when my guild made the move to Velious, there was a hell of a fight at the GD/EW line, where Ruin was fighting us.<br>
WeTOOK velious. Evil could of stopped us.<br>
<br>
THere is no way Evil could of been stopped from having a foothold on Kunurk. Do you get it yet?<br>
<br>
Yes, Kunurk also has hard zones. But is also has easy ass zones, and newbie zones. Velious does not.<br>
<br>
I am gald to hear you stayed on Antonica and fought the hard fight. You know that many of your fellow evils went to Kunurk as soon as someone had the bind spell. They did not have to fight for the zones they found there. They also had newbie zones there.<br>
<br>
I cannot see how you cant see the differences. I think it makes you feel better making Newts out to be the same as evils. Yes I agree, Goods are the most hardcore. <br>
but evil is definately the easiest setting. <p><b>

<br>
We aren't &quot;taking it.&quot;  We have taken it.<br>
<br>
There are very few PvP kills in the battles there because most of those on the losing end zone-plug.<br>
<br>
Ask the Ruin group that was defeated via a zergling assault in Velketor's how many of them stuck it out to the end (or I can answer for them - 2).<br>
<br>
Ask Infernal Elite exactly how many of them didn't zoneplug, of the 15 we fought across 3 zones (again, I'll respond for them - 2).<br>
<br>
We had to move to Velious.<br>
<br>
We had to kill the Evils that had already been exp'ing there.<br>
<br>
To this day, we have to defend it from Evils and Goods alike.<br>
<br>
You had teammates starting out on Kunark.<br>
<br>
To this day, you have to defend it from enemies coming in to exp. / battle.<br>
<br>
You'll notice we had to take an extra step to take Velious; one which is conspicuously absent in your control of Kunark.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it was more difficult for the Neutral team to take and defend Velious than it was for the Evil team to start out on and defend Kunark.<br>
