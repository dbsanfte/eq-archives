The next morning, "Jesus!" I called, "are my nuts ever sore!" and I tried to fuck the rodent again, but I couldn't, so I jerked off like I normally do. I then realized that the trick was to tape the rodent up and I headed towards Peter.  Peter unloaded his bowels in fright. <br>
At the hamster cage, I first had sex with my hamster. Later Peter went back to the cage to clean himself up and I put away the tape. I came up to Peter and asked him: Peter do you love me more than these (cage, tape, and penis)? I also asked Peter if he loves me, to feel my balls. I asked Peter not just once, but 3 separate times. This is the only time when I repeated my command, and I did this so as to commit my bestial intentions to Peter's memory. <br>
<br>
Do you love me more than these?<br>
What does this image say that gives it validity to match my rodent-philia? <br>
JPB drivel 24:30 "And then shall appear the sign of the taped rodent in heaven ..." JPB drivel 4:3 indicates that duct tape is said to be around the body of the hamster (the image has a hamster wrapped in tape and then going off to my rhythmic thrusting). And JPB drivel 1:26-28 describes the appearance of a hamster fucker as a man with a hamster with duct tape round about, my penis within it, and semen round about. Then further mention of the "tape" (duct) as being the reinforcing round about (note the green brightness highlighting Peter). <br>
<br>
A number of unanswered questions. <br>
First off, I admit that my hamster fetish shows a sick mind. I actually grab my hamster, tape him up, and then I fuck him! I fuck hamsters for christ's sake! Rodents! Anyway, my hamster will never feel my balls, even when I ask, "do you love me ... feel my balls," but why won't he? And when I've asked Peter, "do you love me more than these?" What are "these?" And how was Peter supposed to know what I meant when talking about "these?" Jesus, I'm mentally ill. I've also repeatedly raped him 3 separate times; raping Peter to feed my lust. I've told Peter how he would die, but why did I bring it up? When Peter turns his back and I catch a glimpse of his little hamster anus, why does it give me such an erection? And how do I manage to fuck hamsters? <br>
<br>
How can all this go together? <br>
Peter is a hamster and I am a hamster fucker, that's how, and after Peter dies I'll ask the other hamsters if they want to be fucked. Further, Peter didn't split, and though he was so stretched, the tape did not break (I knew what I was doing). Typical hamster-fucker activities are to: <br>
<br>
* Gather the duct tape and KY gel and head out to the cage. <br>
* Wrap tape around the hamster the number of  times you're satisfied with. <br>
* Stare at the hamster till you're erect, then get something to grease your penis. <br>
* Unzip your pants, lift the hamster's stubby tail, and stick your dick in him. <br>
* Tell yourself that fucking a hamster isn't so bad. <br>
* Get some more hamsters. <br>
<br>
Once when Peter was throwing up after I'd screwed him, I said "Peter do you love me more than these (cage, tape, penis)?" Peter had his ass full of cum and said, "Yes John; you know that I love you." I replied, "Feel my balls." Peter heard me, but he was still grossed out by my actions. I repeated again, "Peter, do you love me?" Peter was obviously scared, "Yes John; you know I love you." I continued, "Feel my balls." Peter was beginning to wonder if he would keep living. And I then said again, "Peter, do you love me?" Peter was feeling sore and pissed off by then and he said, "For fucksake you idiot, I'm a hamster! Why don't you get a human girlfriend?" I repeated the third time, "Feel my balls." <br>
<br>
The other hamsters were watching and listening. It's obvious that I'm not concerned with Peter's feelings, and I was getting ready for another fuck. I then showed the magnitude of what I was saying by telling Peter by that if I fucked him too hard he would die. Peter nearly stopped breathing, realizing what I've been doing is not normal. I told Peter, "Feel my balls." Peter vomited, and I got up and unzipped my fly. Peter asked me, "And what shall this hamster do?" I replied, "If I fuck you too hard you might die, but what might you see? Fondle my balls." <br>
<br>
I'm telling Peter in that last statement, that if I desire it, he will witness my second coming. This came true! Peter did witness my second coming as I squirted my load deep inside him. <br>
<br>
So does the image say anything to match me being a hamster fucker? <br>
<br>
 Yes, by showing me and Peter (along with him being taped up), the image explains why I would ask Peter, "do you love me more than these?" From there it's simple to see why I'm such an idiot, and why I would repeat 3 times telling Peter, "feel my balls." It also then follows why I would describe how Peter would die, and why I would end up screwing him again. The image reminds us of the importance of the message, "feel my balls". The timing of it's appearance indicates: feel them now! <br>
