I've sent emails, posted feedbacks, talked to GMs, even brought it up to tech support (while calling for other computer problems) about this, but Verant HAS NOT responded on this issue.  They promised us at the creation of the server that we'd get these insignias that would be useful for trade-ins on items.  Yet, they have NOT delivered.  Ok, yes, I like the changes they've made, the FV server seems good (for those who are into that RP stuff), and I look forward to SoL.  But how long would it take to create some quests for these insignias?  At this point, I don't care what we get for them...as long as we have something to do with them other than clutter our inventories.  Heck, turn 10 greaters in for a stack of bonechips...I don't care.  At least I'd know that it was worthless to keep them, and I could make room for other things in my inventory.  Then I wouldn't have to cling on to this hope that these bags full of mysterious coinage would be of some use in the future, other than keeping track of worthless points.  Don't you all agree?<br><br>2.  Speaking of the diety insignias, another thing I've continued to bring to their attention to no avail is the fact that our &quot;1 char per server&quot; only has 16 available slots for bags, etc.  This really limits us to the amount of space we're probably accustomed to with 8 characters to fill up with junk we can just sell later.  Why can't they make an insignia purse...or bank that is capable of holding ALL of these coins?  The few times I've heard any response from a GM about this issue, it's been the same thing...&quot;But they stack and combine, don't they?&quot;  Sure they stack.  Now you can have 4 different stacks of the same thing diety and clutter your bank box even more.  Verant, if you care about this server at all, do something about this.<br><br>3.  My biggest problem with Verant right now regarding how they handle SZ is that they still haven't fixed the coding for zone plugging.  They seem to be so anxious to get rid of every other exploit or advantage anyone has at this game...why not fix this?  Why not make the person zone still...regardless of connection...for say...30 sec?  As I see it, it gives pluggers an unfair advantage compared to those who refuse to plug.  Sure, you may say that plugging is the smart thing to do when you're overwhelmed and about to die...but then...DOH...you're playing on a PVP server.  It's bound to happen sometimes (more for some than others).  Deal with it, or go play on a blue server, leave the game, get a real life, etc.  But plugging is just using an unfair mechanical exploit to solve an in-game problem.  Then you might say...&quot;if you don't like it, then why don't you plug too?&quot;  Why?  Even if my guild didn't allow it, I STILL WOULD NOT PLUG.  It's dishonourable, it's cheating, and it's simply lame.  It says that you can't play the game under normal conditions, so you have to use exploits to survive.  In my opinion, it says that I'm a better player than you are just because you plug and I don't.  I don't care how many kills you get, or how many points you score.  If you do that while plugging all the time, then you're not a talented player...you're a cheat and a fake.  And I hope you'll get tired of living an &quot;in-game lie&quot; and just do us all a favour and quit the game.  You don't deserve to fight people who refuse to plug.<br><br>Other than those things, I'm having a great time on SZ.  Hope to join you (or PK you) in the future!  Good luck! <p><p><img src = "http://members.spree.com/funNgames/ZADESZ/test1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ushattered78.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shattered78</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/8/01 10:16:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4066.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would be nice if they fixed this on SZ.........</span><hr size=1> That should have been &quot;Even if my guild DID allow it (which they DO NOT)&quot;...kinda sleepy.

On SZ I noticed all these big name, big ego players that I knew coming ot the server claiming they were bad ass, and were here to own you.  They'd go out with their guildmates killing people and then brag about who and how they owned them.  Yet when shit hits the fan, they're always the first to zoneplug.  And no, this isn't just on other teams, this goes for my team also.  More then once my guild has been called in to get other guilds and other players out of tight situations where people have zoneplugged to save themselves, asking us to 'go fight and say when it's safe to log in.'<br><br>Of course we'll always help, but still, it makes me chuckle a little.<br><br>Then there's other people that zoneplug to get away from you, using excuses like:<br><br>'I was low on health/mana, you think that I would actually let you kill me?' <br><br>'All your guild does is gank, 6 on 1 isn't fair.'<br><br>And of course my favorite, usually coming from red cons my groups kill, 'Come fight me one on one bitch!!!'<br><br>Jesus, do you have any idea how retarded you people sound and look when you zoneplug, then try to justify it?  Why did you even bother coming to this server when all you do is zoneplug to save your own ass and <u>avoid</u> the risk of death?<br><br>HAHAHA I ROXXORZIRE I ONW ALL YOU DAMN NEWBS!!!!....<font size="1">Oh shit!

I think it would take minimal effort to implement item rewards for turning in insignias.  To keep it balanced, make the rewards potions.  Sow, Invis, Resist, End Breath, Regen, Healing, etc..  With such low value rewards, it wouldn't be worthwhile to farm each other for insignias, and I would be very happy to get some usueable potions for insignias.<br><br>2.  Not much of a problem here.  Realistically you won't fill more then three ten slots.  That leaves 50 bank slots - enough for most peoples personal use.  <br><br>3.  I agree that Verant should code a fix to zone plugging.  As it is the temptation is too high to expect players not to plug.  This is assuming its not a nightmare to make someone zone while LD.  Keep in mind that this game has been patched 1 million times.  I assume the current code is heald together with scotch tape, since it's been stretched to do so much more then originally designed for. <p>Takish <BR>Dwarven Warrior<BR>Khin tells you: Are you high or something?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ushattered78.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shattered78</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/8/01 10:46:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4066.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would be nice if they fixed this on SZ.........</span><hr size=1> Casters have the ability to gate out of trouble, but then also pay a penalty of VERY LOW HP and AC.
