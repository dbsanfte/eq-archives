I am still having major issues with random crashes and total system lockups. Things have gotten a lot better, but I don't know whether they are actually good enough yet.<br>
<br>
There are other issues as well. Grouping seems to be harder to achieve in AO. In EQ I knew where people of my level were likely to be. If I wanted a group I could go to those areas. In AO on the other hand, because you can recieve missions tailored to your tastes, the levels at the booths vary widely. At the same time, heading to a mission zone doesn't help a lot, because the mission owner designed the mission at the booth as a solo mission and doesn't need help. While I love the mission aspect, this seems to be an unwanted side effect.<br>
<br>
So far, without the plot in motion, all I seem to do is do a mission, gain money, search for items inside my tech level range, gain levels, upgrade my equip, etc. There is no driving force behind this game yet, and I am uncertain if there will be anytime soon. I am constantly amazed by the stunning graphics, but I don't think eye candy can overcome the repetitiveness of the game. So is there more that I am missing?<br>
<br>
I need to decide soon, and right now I am leaning towards not continuing my subscription past the free month. That depresses me for some reason. <p>Ziktiny 51 necro EQ<br>

I don't know why exactly but my AO/EQ time ratio has been slipping DRASTICALLY back to EQ.  In fact, I haven't touched AO in a week or so....<br>
<br>
I too am saddened by this mysteriously.  I WANT to keep AO, but EQ has it's roots deep in me (been playing for 2 years 1 month and 27 days... and haven't reached 60 yet..! heheh)<br>
<br>
I think AO is becoming what AC was to me... a &quot;break&quot; from EQ... but doesn't have the community or the general &quot;staying power&quot; to keep me hooked.<br>
<br>
Anyone want to help sway me?  I'm tottering and don't want to let go... but who knows...<br>

  Well, I think the community is actually better in many was than EQ.  For one, keep in mind that everyone is pretty much in the same boat.  That is to say, its a *lot* easier to make new friends in AO than in EQ right now, imho.  When EQ was new, you could find new eager players all over the place.  No more, most low-lvl people in EQ are twinks and befriending someone you dont already know in EQ is as likely to get you scammed as anything else.  I find that a good number of the people I talk to and group up with one day in AO will send me a tell the next day.  I've already got maybe half a dozen people i talk to and group with regularly in AO.  A lot of the people in AO have never played a mmorpg before, so it will take time to have the structure that EQ has.  Otoh im not sure if that is something to look forward to because along with that structure comes the arrogance, greed, and petty contempt that has infected EQ for some time now.<br>
<br>
   My view of AO is that it is much less of a chat engine, and much more of a *game*.  I generally dont spend more than 10 or 15 minutes sitting down chatting in AO, whereas it was easy for me to spend 1 - 2 hours just gabbing about nothing in EQ simply because there was nothing else to do.  No matter what lvl, class, or equipment you have, there is always something to do to advance your character in AO.  In EQ, its more like you play 2 - 3 weeks and maybe youll get something nice, or make a level.  More likely you'll get bored and play a twink.  Worse, you'll spend many hours solo camping some no-xp green mobs for an item you need which never drops, and log out with the feeling you accomplished zip.  I never get that feeling in AO, im always advancing my character whether in a group or alone.<br>

<br>
Do you mean they may have suspended it again?  I remember reading on the offical news website when they first started the free month...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As a result of that, the month included with the purchase of the game will officially start as of today (July 9th). In addition to the free game- time already provided because of our initial problems, all accounts registered as of today will receive an in-game surprise at a later stage as a token of our appreciation for your patience.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If they've suspended it again,, great, if not,, oh well, because the CC I used to open the account has expired and I see no easy way to update the info.  And if my account is closed, I doubt I'll be opening it up again anytime soon, considering that I'm feeling about the same way towards the game... It just doesn't have that addictive quailty that EQ had for me.  Hell, I've been playing Warcraft II in favor or AO lately.  <br>
(Now if only that can keep me occupied until DAOC is realeased and I can commit another 2 years of my life to Mythic again.)<br>
<br>
But I would like a reason to keep playing AO, something at least to build my interest there so that I could give the game a chance.  Maybe that'll happen when the storyline actually starts in Sept, but who knows.<br>
<br>
And where the hell is my surprize?<br>
