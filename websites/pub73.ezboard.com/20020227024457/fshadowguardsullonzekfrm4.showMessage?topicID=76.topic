<br>
“This day bodes ill.  I can feel it.”<br>
<br>
The sleeping form lying next to her grunted and rolled over on his side, oblivious to the light of day.  Reziah smiled down on her husband-to-be then quickly leaned over to kiss his cheek.<br>
<br>
“You see it in your dreams, Sir Knight, I’ve shared them.  This day will bring a monumental change.  I wish I knew…”  Her voice trailed off and she rose from the large bed.  The room was much smaller than her suite in the Palace of Paineel, but the priestess found it quaint and chose to stay in the cabin in the woods whenever she and the Al’Emir were on the mainland of Norrath.  This day, however, she regretted her choice of lodging.<br>
<br>
“Tell me, Cazic, what will happen this day?”  A rushing wind filled her mind and the light that was once beautiful seared her eyes.  Her second sight burned vision upon vision into her head… but this time things were different.  The pain wasn’t stopping and the vision wouldn’t fade.  The man she loved jumped from the bed to run to her side.  He was accustomed to her sight but this time fear was etched on his handsome face.  Reziah screamed.  She tried to tell him to stay away.  To leave her alone.  Something was happening and she couldn’t stop it.  <br>
<br>
Her skin began to glow faintly as the color changed. Her entire body began to morph hideously.  Chevalier reached out for her.  The instant his skin met hers, he began to fade away.  Tears streamed down the once beautiful face of the priestess as the two clung together and together realized that they were dying.  For some unknown reason their time on Norrath had come to an abrupt end.  The couple was enshrouded by a thick mist that slowly dissipated. In the dark cloud, his eyes met hers and then she knew.<br>
<br>
Where once stood two followers of Cazic Thule, there now stood a single creature with eyes of jade and skin of ebony.  White hair cascaded over her shoulders and down her back.  She licked her lips and captured the last drop of blood with her tongue.<br>
<br>
“It worked!  The wizard was much more adept than I thought.”<br>
<br>
The female, a dark elf, looked around the cabin and grinned.  “It was a noble sacrifice Lady Reziah.  Though I wager that Cazic Thule is royally miffed.  My arrival could only have been possible if you were willing to give of yourself and the man you love.  The gods await you.  Quickly now, be gone.”  Kilandra spoke to the spirit that hovered close by.  The room warmed significantly as the spirits of both the priestess and her knight left the room.  To wander aimlessly over the land or return to their god, Kilandra did not know nor did she care, her one thought was to report to the Lodge of the Dead as quickly as possible.<br>
