Lord K'Kidrak's words were smooth and carefully chosen...and, yes, surprising, though Keats hadn't know what to expect from such a meeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your consideraton means a great deal, and speaks well of the Tier'dal.&quot; Keats chuckled softly. &quot;Though the Tier'dal have always been well-received in my eyes. I understand that the boy will no longer be the one I know, though I admit I know him little enough as it is. My travels do not take me often to Qeynos.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling a bit, Keats nodded to himself and fixed his eyes upon those of the dark elven lord before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your receptiveness asks something similar in my turn. You have answered my questions regarding Nic; I shall answer yours as well, and perhaps pay for my wine thusly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slipping the lute from his back, the singer plucked a few strings, tuning it swiftly and expertly. At a knife-like glance from Lord K'Kidrak, he raised a hand and shook his head, assuring him that no magic would be called forth--this was a song, not a Song. With an easy smile that had lulled many an audience in harsh, cold halls to lighter hearts, the bard's voice blended with the notes his lute sang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Long ago in the East Commonlands,<br>
A warrior stood, black blood on his hands,<br>
Calling forth challenge to all who would dare<br>
To face him that sundown in cool evening air.<br>
<br>
The tall human fighter of insolent pride<br>
Held dagger, and longbow, and claws by his side.<br>
A crowd of the dark elves from Neriak's gloom<br>
Surrounded this hothead to see to his doom.<br>
<br>
An unholy knight known as Ryltar Vrinn<br>
Stepped first to the human. Let combat begin!<br>
Slashes were traded, blood mingled in gore<br>
But when the dust settled, the elf was no more.<br>
<br>
A second Tier'dal met the human's cruel rage,<br>
With dagger in hand, Staelth d'Shiv crossed the stage.<br>
The death-dance that followed swirled both all around,<br>
But a blow from the human sent Staelth to the ground.<br>
<br>
The human in triumph roared insults and jeers.<br>
The mixed crowd combined condemnation and cheers,<br>
When a voice from the background cut noise like glass;<br>
The seething mob parted to let the man pass.<br>
<br>
A night-shadow walking, the ghost of death came<br>
Stalking the warrior, Guise d'Shiv was his name;<br>
Brother to Staelth and an Ebon Hand blade,<br>
He mockingly bowed as his challenge was made.<br>
<br>
The like of that battle has never been seen<br>
To equal the dance and the bloodied sweat's sheen<br>
Upon those two faces, one dark and one light,<br>
Attacking and dodging in encroaching night.<br>
<br>
The rogue's perfect balance, his effortless grace<br>
Brought bloodlust to twist the man's furious face.<br>
The human raged after this mocking invention,<br>
Til a voice from the audience drew his attention.<br>
<br>
Guise vanished at last, reappearing to turn<br>
And plunge his sharp dagger, its poison to burn<br>
And race through the blood of the human with glee.<br>
The warrior staggered and dropped to one knee.<br>
<br>
The blow insufficient, bleeding and battered<br>
The rogue could not dodge as the warrior scattered<br>
His last conscious thought to the winds of the land.<br>
The spectators wept for Guise's death at his hand.<br>
<br>
The warrior was thereafter put in his place<br>
By a dark knight named Sheldon defending his race.<br>
The warrior fell, but the watchers recall<br>
The valiant cadre of fighting Tier'dal.<br>
<br>
Sheldon and Ryltar, shadow knights proud<br>
The cold d'Shiv brothers who entranced the crowd...<br>
Though more wins went to the human in shame,<br>
It was not the human immortal in name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Setting his lute aside, the bard lifted his glass again, finishing his wine and taking a bow. He continued more quietly to Lord K'Kidrak.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was the first meeting of myself and the Assassins of Nektulos, a group of dark elves of my land who became as blood brothers to me after this duel. I quite nearly got involved with it myself, being somewhat sensitive to insults against dark elves, as my own liege within my guild of the Sigils is a Tier'dal warrior of Rallos Zek, by the name of Vaerun Breche...a man I have considered my brother since our 13th song...er, season.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling again, Keats continued as he took his first step backward toward the door. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you wish to know which of these heroes your face reminded me of, sir, it was Staelth d'Shiv, leader of the Assassins of Nektulos, and a blackguard of his 56th dagger when last I fought at his side. Of course, this tale took place when he was but of his 21st...But I am sure I bore you by now, as I have been told I ramble.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bowing before Lord K'Kidrak and turning again to the assembled Shadow Guard and guests, Keats performs a more flourished bow and takes his leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take care, Shadow Guard, and if you prefer I keep the blessings of my Twins to myself, I wish then for the muses to inspire you in both word and deed!&quot;<br>
<br>
The bard dons his golden helm once again, slips his lute into its sling upon his back and strides out the door. Outside, a faint ringing is heard and the door closes not quite soon enough to obscure the tiny sparkles thrown off by a sweeping tambourine, nor to silence the magical melody of Selo's as the wanderer rises and vanishes into the distance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showMessage?topicID=12.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm0">The Moat (Public OOC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm4">The Tavern (Public In-Character)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm19">The Gate (Membership Applications)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm12">The Bazaar (Trade Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm14">The Blighted Garden (Allied IC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm10">The Council Chambers (Alliance Discussions)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm11">The Siege Tower (Raid Planning)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm2">The Barracks (Private OOC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm3">Hall of Legend (Private IC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm16">The Cursed Herald (Guild Event Announcements)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm15">The Training Grounds (Strategy Discussion)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm13">Pit of the Damned (The Hunted)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm7">The Armory (Guild Equipment Roster)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm8">The Library (Guild Research)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm18">Allecti Chambers<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm17">Praetor Chambers<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm9">The Throne Room</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffcc>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bshadowguardsullonzek>ShadowGuard - Sullon Zek</a><font color=#ffffcc> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4>The Tavern (Public In-Character)</a> <font color=#ffffcc> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
