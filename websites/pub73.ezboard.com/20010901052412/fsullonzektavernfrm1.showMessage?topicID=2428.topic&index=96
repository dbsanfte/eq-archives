I didn't say evil was winning.  I did say and believe that zone control means more than points.  If that means evil wins by default, then evil wins.  I don't think thats the case, neutral is doing a fine job on the zone control front.  Good is doing very well considering the player base they have to work with.  However, if 6 months from now evil has pushed neutral out of velious and neutral is hiding in kedge keep/karnors to level... well evil won the war, I don't care what a silly point system says.  Doing this requires the evils to grow a backbone, which I think most of us can agree is unlikely.<br>
<br>
The point system favors the smaller teams, of course team neutral and to a lesser extent team good is going to want to judge the server by it.  In 6 months if neutrals are hitting up velious or SoL raid zones and doing planes whenever they want to, then they won in my mind.  A big victory is if they could control sebillis as well, ,or whatever equivalent zone is in SoL. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uagrul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agrul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/17/01 2:51:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: duh</span><hr size=1> &quot;Just in case someone from verant is watching.. let me summarize.. lvl 12's are effective against lvl 40+ with no risk to themselves.. 40+ players have to protect their experiance by fending off hordes of lvl 12's that have nothing to loose.. i am sure that is &quot;working as intended&quot; in VI's world. Conclusion: pls stop fixing things that arent broke&quot;<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with level 12's being effective against level 40's, as long as it bases it off their resists and AC.<br>
<br>
However, I do agree that there is a problem.. negative points in a points system for killing people more than 20 levels below you is stupid.<br>
<br>
The system doesn't check whom was the aggressor, and it isn't in the least logical for the system to instantly assume that the higher up was griefing the lower.<br>
<br>
They should award 0 points per kill more than 20 levels below you, not negative points.<br>
<br>
&quot;-return the resist table to what it was-<br>
<br>
Those of a higher level should enjoy some advantage in PvP. Speak all you want about blue server players who level all day, but the reality is someone will always have more time to play than you do. If someone can rush to 60, good for him.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm afraid we'll have to agree to disagree.  I don't believe in making a person invincible for having more bags of cheetos and cans of soda lying around than me, sustaining them for the umpteen hours a day it took to get level 60 asap; not in a game where PvE requires such little thought, anyways.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something else to consider. Should the resist changes stay in place, think about how it will affect the endgame. How fun will it be for casters when the level 30 warriors that resisted every root turn level 60? How balanced will it be when everyone plays a melee class out of frustration?&quot;<br>
<br>
If the *proposed* resist changes stay in place, fighting that level 60 warrior at level 60 will be the exact same as fighting a level 60 warrior with equal gear, resists, and skill as on Tallon Zek, and you had no problem with it there.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you're mistaking the fux0red patch changes w/ the intended ones, or if you simply misunderstand the theory behind it.. but negating the effect levels have on resists has *very* little effect on even con PvP.<br>
<br>
&quot;I face as many red cons as I do green cons. There are tactics that let either side survive or prevail. The EQ PvP system is not without flaws, but this short-sighted change, though it might seem fun now, will wreck casters and balance long term.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it won't wreck casters and balance in the long term.  I refer you to my above response, as you seem to have missed something in the proposed changes (again, the changes that were made are not the proposed changes).<br>
<br>
&quot;-allow players to dispell the enemy-<br>
<br>
Want green cons to have a chance against red cons without harming late game balance? Then allow people to dispell the enemy. Pumice and cancel magic are not the end all to beating a red con, but the opportunity to dispell a 200 HP buff or SoW might give a crew of greens the chance they need to topple the red druid chasing them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, allowing dispell would make very little difference in lowbie vs. highbie PvP, as the vast level difference tends to make pumice / dispells not strip even one buff.  Yet another change I've been rooting for since the days of TZ:  Negate the effect levels have on dispelling DoTs / buffs, and make dispells more concrete and less luck-of-the-roll type situations.<br>
<br>
&quot;-make zero points the fewest for any PvP kill (non-repetitive)-<br>
<br>
This is a PvP server. Perhaps the 'most' PvP of them all. Why punish someone for engaging in PvP? This server is set up as a war of faith. If the most 'fervent' are actively fighting, it makes no sense to dissuade them and force them back to item_camp8456. All the negative points do is add one more reason not to PvP. There are too many reason not to fight already. Don't add more Verant, don't add more.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clarification. The negative points for repeat kills in an hour should remain. Not so much for bind point deaths (learn to /q), more so for the exploits possible should someone have two accounts or a friend on the other team.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, agreed.<br>
<br>
In case I didn't explain it well enough in the above:<br>
<br>
Verant's proposed changes:<br>
<br>
A level 60 Warrior with 100 MR should resist a level 60 Wizard's Roots (and other spells) the EXACT same way he did when the server opened.  In equal level PvP there is no level difference to negate, and therefore negating the level difference makes no alteration in the actual combat.<br>
<br>
However, a level 30 Warrior will have a *better* (Verant said they would &quot;slightly&quot; lessen the effect levels have on resists, not negate it completely, as I advocate) chance of resisting a level 60 Wizard's Roots than he did at the opening of the server.  At the same time, he would not be able to resist them as often as said level 60 Warrior, giving him a fighting chance, but not quite putting them on even terms resist-wise.<br>
<br>
My proposed changes:<br>
<br>
Negate the effect levels have on PvP completely.<br>
<br>
A level 60 Wizard vs. a level 30 Warrior would result in Roots being resisted as if the Warrior were level 60 (or the Wizard were level 30.. look at it either way).<br>
<br>
A level 45 Necromancer fighting a level 10 Ranger... the level 10 Ranger's resists would not be effected by the level difference, and therefore it would be based solely on his resists, and he would resist as if he were level 45.<br>
<br>
I could come up with more examples, but you seem fairly intelligent, so I'm going to assume you get what I mean by now.<br>
<br>
The Actual Changes:<br>
<br>
Apparently, Verant fucked up (woah!  There's something new..).<br>
<br>
Reds now resist as if they were Greens, and Greens now resist as if they were Reds.<br>
<br>
This is not the proposed patch (neither my proposition nor Verant's), but it was the way they fux0red it up.<br>
