You can take them as you like. I'm going to try not to flame anyone, and would appriciate it if I got some thoughtful responses and the thread didn't degenerate into a flame war. Warning, this is going to be long.<br>
<br>
I like to RP, and am in an RP guild. I've RPed exclusively evil characters on various MUSHes for the last 3 years straight. I still do. Back during the server beta, I played an iksar shaman up to level 7. When the server was wiped, I started a DE cleric, and played him up until level 10 in those days where it was tough to find anything to kill. Then I went through a period where my computer was down, and I didn't have any means to play. I recently got my computer running again, and figured out that I was a little bored with EQ. I didn't log on at all for a week or so. I figured out why I was bored with SZ. It didn't feel any different than playing on Lanys. Neutrals invaded EC occasionally, but I can probably count on one hand how many I saw over level 6. The only good (presumably) I ever saw was the high elf corpse that lay outside Neriak. So when I got back I deleted my DE cleric and made a good cleric. So I have played both sides (apologies to all those newts out there).<br>
<br>
But what somewhat bothers me are those who actively go out and gank newbies, and the ones who make the excuse for them that 'They're evil, that's what evil does.'  It's said in fiction that the measure of great heroes are great villians, and I believe the opposite to be true as well. Great villians don't go out and spend all their time knocking over orphanages and stealing candy from babies. That's what they have underlings for. Sure, they might kill a 'lowbie' that crosses their path every now and then, but all the time? Did Kitiara Uth Matar or Raistlin Majere go out of their way to personally flatten every kender in Kenderhome? Was Professor Moriarty personally sneaking around London cutting the throats of children? Did Megatron personally wade into schoolyards every day and start blasting buildings and stepping on kids? Did the Joker personally spend all his time flattening orphanages? No. All these great villians either viewed that stuff as a waste of time, or let underlings do the job for them. They had better things to do. More evil goals to accomplish. They even *gasp* plotted against the heroes who were their equals, made and carried out great plans of selfishness and destruction that we all love to read and watch. <br>
<br>
Now we have some of the evils here on Sullon. I'm talking about the ones who spend 90% of their time griefing others that have no hope of fighting back. What does that say about a certain person we all know who hangs around Crushbone and who's stated goal is to see how many people he can make quit? He might be 'evil' but there's a difference between an admirable great villian and an underling common street punk more worthy of contempt than admiration. I don't think I have to state what catigory I think these people fall into.<br>
<br>
Once again, thoughtful opinions are welcome. <p>Hesster Shadowscale<br>

A lot of arch-villains target masses of innocent and helpless civilians.  It may not be orphanages, but if you do something like plant a nuclear bomb in the middle of a large city then you're victims are basically a large mass of helpless people.  (Like in the first Batman movie when Joker was going to release poison gas on the city of Gotham.)<br>
<br>
It's usually the heroes that have to come to the rescue of the masses of helpless civilians and foil the villain's plan.  From that perspective, I think Kronar is playing a villain very well, whether he means to or not. <p><font face=Verdana><Font Size = 1><B>If you define cowardice as running away at the first sign of danger, screaming and tripping and begging for mercy, then yes, Mr. Brave man, I guess I'm a coward.

I guess I'm just more of an idealist than anything.<br>
<br>
As for Slooth: I have no idea how many high level goods there are on this server or who they might be. I'm not even sure what the highest level in my own guild is. Everyone is /anon or /roleplay, and  when you're the underdog team, you don't go running around hostile territory (and almost all of it is hostile to us) /shouting &quot;Level 52 good warrior LFG!&quot; <br>
<br>
This was more of a philosophical rant, really. That being said, the goods will not be low level forever. When we get high enough, we will take care of the problem. I myself am looking forward to the day when I can be part of a group that kicks Kronar's bony erudite ass all the way back to Odus, and I'm sure many of the newbies he's been ganking in Crushbone and Butcherblock are whetting their blades as well. But for now, my guild is arranging a raid into evil territory for sometime in the near future, in which I will take part. So we are doing things proactively as well. <p>Hesster Shadowscale<br>

Plus it seems like your implying only evils gank lowbies, whats the excuse for all the newtz an goods that have done the same? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uhesster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hesster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 5:35:40 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.megamanmush.mudservices.com/files/masters/bassCD.gif height=110 width=68></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What evil is (long)</span><hr size=1> Then don't try and excuse it by saying 'We're evil, what do you expect?'. I'm actually more annoyed by those that try and cover up their actions by making lame excuses that they're evil.<br>
<br>
As for neuts and goods ganking lowbies, I'm sure it goes on, but not to the scale that certain evils do it. I don't see the other teams racking up massive negative points. At least in this regard, the point system doesn't lie. Evils are doing much more ganking of lowbies than goods or neuts.<br>
<br>
Have I been PKd by too many reds? Probably. When Kronar and his friends come to play in Crushbone, I don't piss and moan and call them names, I simply leave and find somewhere else to get exp or go match up against evils my own level. But one day he'll feel my mace cracking the back of his skull, and that day will be sweet justice indeed... <p>Hesster Shadowscale<br>
