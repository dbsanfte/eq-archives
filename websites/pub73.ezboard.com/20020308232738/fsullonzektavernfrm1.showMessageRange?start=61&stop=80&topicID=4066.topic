<br>
Hi, I have just rerolled evil from team good.  <br>
<br>
I was previously called a coward for being a man and going to Kunark and Velious!  It made me sad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, I would like to forget what I have learned about Sullon Zek, and join the masses of evil on team blue who don't have a clue!<br>
<br>
Please accept my application to Malignant.  I wish to put down the people who have experienced Sullon Zek in it's finest!  I want to sound like a self-righteous fool, and pretend my ignorant code of honor applies to the people who know better!<br>
<br>
Thank you, <br>

<br>
Second, anyone calling Ranadielz a coward is also full of shit. He is also one of the most hardcore players on this server and deserves recognition for being a badass.<br>
<br>
Third, zone plugging is a viable option until it is removed as a possibility on this server, would I want them to do it? No, because usually when I'm lagged to hell and zone, that's when I go LD. It happens like that for lots of other people too. They won't fix it because bluebies will die in zones like karnors where people train all the time. Live with it. You wanna stop a plugger? Root/Snare/Mez/Blind etc...etc...if they are gunna fight you til they are low on health, then leave the area near the zoneline and they have to run farther to make it to zone and you can kill them.<br>
<br>
Fourth, do people from Malignant, Iggles, or anyone else plug? Hell yes, I've had people from malignant plug on me in MM, Gfay, CB, Perma, EF, BB; and in everyone one of those zones except MM I was fighting them stopping them from killing low greens, the question is, which do you find more dispicable? Plugging or wasting level 8's in CB? You're on Sullon Zek, there are no high horses here.<br>

<br>
I agree with Sad, there are a lot of screwed up things about this server that are unfair or don't work in the spirit of the server.  But they are all harsh realities of SZ.  You can't be a big man about CCing and bind camping then turn around and bitch about plugging.<br>
<br>
Course, people who rely on plugging are screwed if it ever gets coded against...  But that's another issue altogether.<br>

Get a life.  Better yet, grow a pair.<br>
<br>
Katryna, wherever you are, don't think you're so hot and badass just cause you're totally twinked and can kill me while I'm alone, and you're in a full group.  You're a crummy warrior from what I hear from fellow goods who you've grouped with.  Go play DAoC and donate your stuff to someone who really knows how to use it.<br>
<br>
Jennia, hope that's how you spell your name...I have respect for you.  That one night we spent a couple hours trying to find each other...you didn't plug, and even found an interesting way to solve your CC problem.  Congrats.<br>
<br>
Yibino, I can't stand you.  But I can't recall you zone plugging either, so can't say that you do.  I enjoy killing you though, and you've yet to kill me.<br>
<br>
There's this one monk who's name I can't remember...but it seems everytime I see him, he ALWAYS plugs when he's low.  Then he comes back on later and sends me tells about how he owns me and such.  I own you, foo.  You can't even kill me, and when you're about to die, as usual, you plug.<br>
<br>
Lara, you really suck.  You've had me killed several times now with your &quot;nuke Shattered with IC, then let an even con get the few remaining HPs&quot;.  Although I think that sucks for me when you do it, I'm not gonna complain about it.  But you shall die soon.  I will make sure of it.<br>
<br>
Ranadielz, you're the bad boy of our guild posting with all those naughty words.  Tisk Tisk.  I know you wouldn't plug though, and whomever says Malignants plug is more than likely full of it.  If I'm not mistaken, that's one way to get kicked out of the guild...by plugging.  Personally, I've never tried it, and if you're stupid enough to screw up your computer or whatever doing it, then you're just stupid.  Oh Ran...not referring to you now hehe.<br>
<br>
Niznio, let's kill more people like we usually do.  They must be taught a lesson.<br>
<br>
Frosthound, you still suck.<br>
<br>
As for using the excuse of getting bind camped for reason to plug, why don't you just /q out?  Sure, you might die in that 30 seconds, but hey, you die with honour, which is something alot of people on this server don't have cause they're always taking the easy exploitable way out.  BTW, while replacing the battery under the backseat of my car, I found yet another fuse box (there's one under the hood and another behind the glove compartment box) and even more computer components.  One of the fuses was busted, so I replaced it...and now my car doors lock without fail.  I'm so happy now. <p><p><img src = "http://members.spree.com/funNgames/ZADESZ/test1.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=spyder>Spyder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/8/01 6:02:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4066.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would be nice if they fixed this on SZ.........</span><hr size=1> Its easy for you guys in Malignant to say that plugging shouldnt happen.  Last time I remember you guys getting your ass handed to you was in the Odus fight against goods.  And, what option did you have, you called in Ruin/Hate/IE guildmembers to come babysit you and get your corpses and punish the mean old good team who was there for you. <br>
<br>
The point of this is that WE on team good dont have an entire guild of players from Legacy of Steel, who came on to team good to babysit us.  If we get killed by evils (newts are in a similar boat too by the way--not that I want to be in the same boat as newts. . . but I digress), if we get killed by evils, there is NO level 60 guild we can call on and say, &quot;help me get my corpse please, they are camping us&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Now, I have never plugged yet, but I dont condemn those who do.  I dont anticipate plugging, because I have a fairly fast connection and can dance the zone-line with the best of them.  But, if someone has a slow connection, and they KNOW that they take 1-2 minutes to zone, when it takes most people 30 seconds, then I dont blame them. <br>

<br>
Intentional or not (for the love of God, do some of you actually care what in the hell Verant intended for Everquest?  Do you strive to play by their 'Vision' [TM] day in and day out?), it's a part of the game mechanics.  It can be frustrating, but if they zone-plug, I simply treat it as if they've run away / Gated / etc.<br>
<br>
Lastly, *any* player on the Evil team referring to Frosthound as a coward really needs to re-think what exactly they've *ever* done that could possibly be construed as brave.<br>

<br>
Velious? I don't think so, unless you count that day when evils took over the continent and you and your cronies went into ToFS.  Anyways, Frostpoon isn't such a coward, but I still want to translocate him a second time.<br>

My corpse is recoverable.  Getting kicked outa the Malignant is not.<br>
<br>
And BTW, the whole Permafrost thing was a long long long time ago... But I can attest to two things A) We died majorily due to a DA cleric pulling giants (who also died Thankfully) not HOARDS of zerglings B) Ran having a second account is a very useful thing.<br>

That and weapons recycle upon zoning.  Also Frosthound mentioned dying deep in enemy territory, I died in freakin Rivervale and still managed to get my corpse back without help from higher level evils and I'm a KOS Iksar there.  How deep into enemy territory can you get??<br>
<br>
BTW nice raid on Ill Omen the other day Frosthound and company.  Hey Jennia, liked it when I pumiced you and you fell out of the sky?  That was a funny thing to see, I started laughing after I saw that.  Always fun fighting ya Jennia, /wave.  Also Katryna, go after the casters, Shaman AC &gt; Necro AC, you barely scratched me.  Fascinating thing about the fight was my sowed doggie wasn't rooted, snare, or killed during the fight, that was a first.  Also I got my 500 dmg disease dot on 2 robed casters, maybe slow acting, but it actually lasted the entire duration, either draining mana for heals, or actually doing the damage it was supposed to do.  Eventually you guys lost out and started heading for the zone, and had a casualty or 2, and I don't believe anyone zoneplugged as you all made a run to FV town.  Then it was the usual sit at zoneline and wait for them to come back, (or at least til we get bored). And then go back to our XP nipple.<br>
Anyways, long story short, good fight.<br>
<br>
One more thing, zonepluggers = cowards.<br>

Him and a crew hit solb the other day, and even though I wasn't there firsthand to experience it, I was watching Predatory and other guildies from his screen. Was a good fight, but you folks didn't concentrate on the right targets. The cleric was medding half the fight totally undisturbed. The enchanter mez'd you all up nice. Your druid got beat down pretty bad and gated or ran, didn't see where he went. The one guy who did plug (not Frosthound) returned not more than 10 mins later inside Solb with a sliver of health and tried to run to sola zone. Ended up two 30ish point lifetaps from Predatory took him down.<br>
<br>
I'll plug when neccessary as I stated in that lame thread. Since corpse camping has become a daily occurence on this server I have no qualms about it. As I stated there's too many other bugs that people take advantage of. Zonehopping, hill bugs, water bugs, speed hacks, tracking bugs, etc etc etc. Why focus on this one little thing? Why not adjust the resistances to be appropriate? I can't land root of any kind on a green, nor can I land it on any well equipped white con. Reds surprisingly I can land on sometimes. That's just lame. They need to fix it so its either purely resist based, or do a standard adjustment of 2pts per level of resist, up or down depending upon the level of your target. Not this reds are easier to hit, greens are fuggin impossible. <br>
<br>
There's so much about pvp that's off on this and other pvp servers. I don't see them making much of a move to address these bugs. They were there when I played over a year ago on TZ, they're still here. Isn't going to change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uthebigcheeeeese.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Big Cheeeeese</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/9/01 5:28:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4066.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would be nice if they fixed this on SZ.........</span><hr size=1> I guess by zoneplugging you mean going LD while zoning.
