<br>
        The stranger was cloaked, with the hood pulled down over his face. He walked the streets of Neriak with ease.  His feet made no sound on the cobbled streets and he walked with a soft grace.  ‘It is good to be back here’ he thought to himself.<br>
        The child stood in front of him, her clothes in rags, her feet were bare and she was dirty.  He never saw her walk in front of him; she was just there.  From the time it took for him to blink.. she had appeared.  Her big green eyes stared straight at him, almost looking into him.  He stood there, not moving.. just staring at this strange child.  <br>
        She abruptly came to him, and grabbed his hand before the stranger could stop her. She firmly led him down an alley, not saying anything.<br>
        He should be upset, angry, even impatient with this child.  But he wasn’t, he was confused.. the child did not even flinch when she felt the sharp claws or the callused scales of his hand from long sword work.  It was as if she already knew what he was, and it did not bother her.  So he walked, awash in his emotions as this child led him through alleyways and down side streets… <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bshadowguardsullonzek.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cherrish>Cherrish</A> at: 7/7/01 2:54:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000033><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bshadowguardsullonzek.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cherrish>Cherrish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadow Guard</span><br> <font color=#ffffcc>(7/7/01 2:57:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Stranger and the Child...</span><hr size=1> <br>
        They came to a dead end near the underground river, a tiny waterfall was near, and he could hear the soft sound of it.  The small grotto she had led him to was a part of Neriak he had never seen, but of course, the last time he was here he never even went into the slums.. he was revered, he was a leader, and he had no need of beggars and orphans then.  In the corner was a small altar made of wood and mud with a crude idol of Innoruuk made out of clay. She stopped in front of the altar and looked back at him.  <br>
<br>
        He could feel the power coming from the idol, he knew who it was, but how had this mere child called Him, how could she control that much power? He looked down at her, her looking back at him.<br>
<br>
        “He calls your name.”  She said simply, pointing at the idol.<br>
<br>
        Her voice was soft, and musical, but it was not the voice of a child, it was the voice of a woman coming from this tiny child’s lips.<br>
<br>
        “He calls your name.” She said once again, pointing again at the crude idol.<br>
<br>
        “He no longer ssspeaksss to me child.”  He whispered, still looking at the idol.<br>
<br>
        She shook her head softly, as the elder would when confronting a stubborn child  He did not like to think on that.. it was too painful.. gods did not willingly give up one of their own…. He turned.. to go back, to leave this town. But she stopped him, not with a word or a touch, but nevertheless he stopped.  She again shook her head.<br>
<br>
        His eyes grew wide, he had heard her thoughts! Inside his mind, he had heard her thoughts as clearly if she had spoken them!<br>
<br>
        She laughed, a musical sound.. like bells tinkling in the wind. <br>
<br>
        “Of course you heard me.  Can you not do the same?” she asked in a puzzled voice, not understanding.<br>
<br>
        “No my child, it isss your gift. Do not ssshare it alwaysss with ssstrangersss.”  He cautioned her, his voice raspy and dry sounding.<br>
<br>
        She looked into his face, &lt;You must go, the things you have to do here are important. You will come back for me when you are ready; I will be here… I’ve always been here.. waiting for you….&gt; She thought at him, and yes he heard her as clearly as if she had spoken to him. He looked at her, one so small as her was nothing.  He could have crushed the life out of her tiny frail body, her lungs would no longer take in any air, her tiny heart would cease to beat her body would grow cold and her eyes would cease to glow… &lt;But you wont, you could, but you wont.. you want what I have… you want my power… and you shall have it.. when you have need of it&gt; <br>
            He started at how she could read his mind so easily, his surprise registering on her tiny face as a smile of amusement crossed her face.  He scowled at her, though the hood hid his face she knew and she laughed that tinkling laugh of hers.  He had been walking, unbeknownst to himself… and he then realized she had been guiding his steps.. <br>

            He knelt down; he knew what he must do.  He slowly pulled a medallion from his cloak, it was not yet known or feared in this land, but it would be.  It bore the symbol of an intricately carved S and G, and had a rare gem between the two, a white crystal.  It was the symbol of his greatest deed in life, his guild.  He would make this child one of them, and he would come back for her when she had learned and grown and when he needed that power of hers, she would use it in his name.  He did not want to leave her, he wanted to take her with him, but this would be good enough, with this he could speak to her no matter where she was, and she could speak to him. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She laughed again, reading his thoughts she softly said, “Do you not think I can speak to you whenever and where ever I please?  I need no trinket to do so.”  She laughed again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I have no sssuch gift little one, ssso placate me, and wear the trinket… yesss?”  He asked the small child.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She nodded in ascent, knowing forehand what this would do to her, but wondering if he would survive the shock?  She stepped forward and he slipped the chain about her small neck.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As soon as he let go, the amulet started to change…. Her head flung back and in silent agony she screamed.. no sound could be heard in the lands of Neriak, but the sound cut straight into the stranger.  He would feel it till the day he died.. She fell to the ground in pain, her tiny fists pummeling the hard cobblestone streets. The pain wracked her slight body. In agony she was consumed, she saw faces, and knew their names, she saw the guildhouse of before and knew where it was in this land. <br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He was stunned, her scream had cut him like a sword, it was all the pain and hurt in his life played back at him. He stood motionless, till she fell to the ground, the stones biting into her bare knees, he went to pick her up, but as soon as his hands touched her he to was drawn into the maelstrom of memories and places.  He saw Ninnin as before.. before the fire had touched him, he saw Nandayar jumping from roof to roof, Nandayar's Highway the town thieves called it. He saw his friends, his enemies, his lovers, his slaves… and there.. in the deep background his old God….  But standing before Innoruuk was the child…   <br>
<br>
            “He will not let you go Maugrim, no matter the winner or loser…. he will ever have a part of you… for he has Me…”  Said the tiny little girl ….<br>
<br>
            The overwhelming presence of a god is indescribable, and only the strong can survive, the weak crumble and wither away like dust…. The stranger held his ground, teeth clenched, head held high.. He knew his place in life, and knew his own power would sustain him…<br>
<br>
            “You were once mine, and shall I always lay claim to what was mine. Mine brother hath you now, but knoweth this… with her,” He pointed to the small girl, her hair billowing in the chill wind, her fiery green eyes shone in the dim light, “I will always have a say in thine life.. she is mine.. she hath My powers.. and she hath thine blood!  As thou lay dying in thine other form I sent one to fetch thine blood.. and from your blood I commanded her to be.. she hath no father, no mother… she hath only you, and I.. Thou will NOT forget me so easily, thou will always be mine!”  <br>
<br>
            The words of a god are never soft, and Innoruuk was no different.  They beat into the stranger and he crumbled to the ground, he was overwhelmed…As the darkness closed in the tiny child ran to him….<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He awoke in the tiny grotto, his head cushioned, and the small waterfall was a soothing sound to wake unto.  As he stirred the soft cushion stirred as well, the tiny girl child.  His head was in her lap.  He quickly sat up. <br>
<br>
            “What happened?”  He asked bluntly of the child.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She shook her head, “I told you He calls your name, I told you… He is not good at losing you know.  And it rankled in his soul that he should lose you. So he made me.. knowing you would come here one day..  Knowing you could not resist if he gave me power.” <br>
<br>
             She turned and started to make a fire.  “Do you know how long I have been here, in this body?”  She asked, without facing him.  “120 years… I have been here for 120 years waiting, in the body of a child…” She turned to face him, and he looked at her again.  Her long silver hair was matted and dirty, her skin was just as dirty as her hair, smudges on her face, but her eyes, her glowing eyes were stunning… but as he stared deep into the fiery green, he realized they were not the eyes of a child, nor did she speak as a child.  She was a woman, inside a child’s body, for 120 long years… <br>
<br>
            He lowered his eyes, and a flash of light caught his eye.  He grabbed her arms so fast she was startled, and struggled. Her puny efforts to release his harsh grasp made him smile, his cold eyes showed his amusement.  Even with her power she was helpless to him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hush child.” He absently ordered her, she ceased her struggling and obeyed reluctantly. There in the middle of her chest stood a diamond shaped gem, and it pulsed with her heartbeat, he could feel it under his harsh grip on her shoulders, and see it in the gem, it was now blood red, instead of clear as it was on the amulet.  The girl was the amulet; no one could take away her amulet now… unless they killed her. He slowly brought his hand up to it, and lightly touched it, he could feel it pulse, it was mesmerizing.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Did you know that would happen?” He whispered to her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Yes, He told me you would want to bring me into the Guard, and that he would make sure I could never leave. The color will drain away and the pulsing will slowly dwindle when I die…” She turned away from him, going back to the fire.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Why did you let me do that? I know it hurt you.. Hell it hurt me!”  He wondered how such a child could be so strong.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Because He told me to.  And He wanted to see if you were strong enough…” She turned, handing him some break fast. “We must hurry, you must take me to the Cleric’s Guild and enroll me today. You have much to accomplish before you go back to your homelands.” And she turned to her food silently eating.  Her eyes never strayed from her food.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He set his plate down, attracting her attention, she looked at him questioningly but he did not answer.  He reached into his pocket inside his cloak.  He withdrew a small pin, one used to hold a cloak.  “Thisss isss my houssse sssymbol, all who know me, will know what it meansss…  If you ssshow it to an ally, they will asssissst you in any way posssible, show it to an enemy though, and he will kill you or worssse.. just to lay claim to thisss pin.  It isss help, but it isss dangerousss asss well… Be careful who you ssshow it to..”  And he handed her the small pin.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She carefully examined it, it was small but it was made by a master craftsmen, the details where amazing. A crown made from gold with fine rubies and emeralds embedded along the edges lay cloven in two, an ebony two-handed sword the cause of the broken halves shone with an inner darkness.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She attached it to the raged tunic she wore; “I will wear it proudly..”  She said simply.  She began to clean up the grotto, restoring it to how it was before she came here.  She looked around, sadness etched on her features.  “It was the only home I knew… it is hard to leave…”  <br>
<br>
            She shook the sadness from her, head held high, she walked from the grotto.  He wondered what her name was, surely she was called something, by someone.  But then, she had no family, no one to give her a name.  She was cherrished only by her god, and now him.  No one else knew of her, and though Innoruuk was a god, he did not think that He would name the child, He never was one for details..<br>
She looked into his eyes, and smiled, “You just named me, I never had a name before, I think I like Cherrish….” He nodded at her, and then headed to the guild, and her new home.. her new life…<br>
