The trip was a pain in the ass...tons of high lev mobs ....stoping every 5 seconds to make sure everyone stayed invis......dodgeing some dragon...had trouble finding the zone to Firion via cuase all the trees...plus i dont even know most kunark. I was geting horable lag or frame rate..kept warping around it seemd....took an expedition of 6 way to long to get to LOIO.<br>
<br>
We got to LOIO a couple of greens were shouting we were there from the get go so we whacked them fast...went up and killed pungent a lev 40 troll shaman...killed some more peeps. We sat down to med got attacked....2 of ours died the rest gated or zoned. I stayed and meded on a wall cuase i wanted to kill a few peeps. <br>
<br>
My luck Pungent was tracking me with /pet attack Rahemon. I wasnt ready so i used my l33t ninja stealh to evade her. Everyone in zone was talkin shit about me i know there was hunting parties after me. So i run for Firiona couple lizzards are guarding the zone but i blow by them and get to firiona with my head in one peice.<br>
<br>
Kunark is way more difficult than Velious to raid. That rout we took was horable.....coming thru firiona isnt much better. I guess if we want to raid kunark we gotta come strait to the over there via the boat. If your team was worth anything they would alert you of our coming and shit.<br>
<br>
Id much raher defend Velious or pick off your high lev travelers or newb guards whatever they do in WC to Sro. I mean you can port right into GD the capital city of velious for newts and get in the action quick. Kunark has 3 doors and they all suck ass. Add the overwhelming amounts of evils there willing to defend there homeland. it would take the whole guild to go over there and do something and thats not something you can do everyday, we have other guild events that are a bit more meaningful......Ill make a sugestion that we go raid there in full force.<br>

We prefer to level in kunark and when we choose to lvl in velious or antonica we do.<br>

&quot;But they're too busy forming Howling Stones groups to raid the highkeep basement.&quot;<br>

Kronar didn’t die via PvP once that is in the record.<br>
<br>
This doesn’t back up the description of a furious battle across a plugged zone line. He was killing in EF for over an hour with plenty of breaks.<br>

<br>
WRONG - the point system was an afterthought put into place after (weeks after) the server opened.  Using the tired old &quot;you knew the rules&quot; argument is sad to begin with, but it doesn't even apply here.  If you need points to tell you who is winning or who is good at pvp, you're pretty simple minded I'd have to say.  Again I say, if this server is about the teams, the point system has nothing to do with the teams and should go.  If it's about the points, then officially change the name and scope of the server from the deity war server to the high point server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/unonecn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>none CN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 4:39:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Three thoughts.<br>
<br>
-return the resist table to what it was-<br>
<br>
Those of a higher level should enjoy some advantage in PvP.  Speak all you want about blue server players who level all day, but the reality is someone will always have more time to play than you do.  If someone can rush to 60, good for him.  <br>
<br>
Something else to consider.  Should the resist changes stay in place, think about how it will affect the endgame.  How fun will it be for casters when the level 30 warriors that resisted every root turn level 60?  How balanced will it be when everyone plays a melee class out of frustration?  <br>
<br>
I face as many red cons as I do green cons.  There are tactics that let either side survive or prevail.  The EQ PvP system is not without flaws, but this short-sighted change, though it might seem fun now, will wreck casters and balance long term.<br>
<br>
-allow players to dispell the enemy-<br>
<br>
Want green cons to have a chance against red cons without harming late game balance?  Then allow people to dispell the enemy.  Pumice and cancel magic are not the end all to beating a red con, but the opportunity to dispell a 200 HP buff or SoW might give a crew of greens the chance they need to topple the red druid chasing them.<br>
<br>
-make zero points the fewest for any PvP kill (non-repetitive)-<br>
<br>
This is a PvP server.  Perhaps the 'most' PvP of them all.  Why punish someone for engaging in PvP?  This server is set up as a war of faith.  If the most 'fervent' are actively fighting, it makes no sense to dissuade them and force them back to item_camp8456.  All the negative points do is add one more reason not to PvP.  There are too many reason not to fight already.  Don't add more Verant, don't add more.<br>
<br>
Clarification.  The negative points for repeat kills in an hour should remain.  Not so much for bind point deaths (learn to /q), more so for the exploits possible should someone have two accounts or a friend on the other team.<br>

<br>
What?  I remember on the very first post I saw regarding Sullon they were talking about putting up a scoreboard.  What the hell are you talking about? Afterthought my arse.<br>
<br>
And I know how good I am at PvP.  I just like a good measuring stick of how much I am kicking your ass. <br>
<br>
How the hell can you blame the scoreboard when you are losing?<br>
<br>
I don't even understand how that is possible.  What kind of loser does that?  That is the most pathetic thing I have ever heard of.<br>
<br>
Do you blame the thermometer for hot weather too? <br>
<br>
Listen I know the evils are a team to be feared and respected but I am not willing to toss out the only indication that outgunned and outnumbered we are putting up a good fight.<br>
<br>
Jeez.<br>
<br>
And finally again VERANT IS TRYING TO DISCOURAGE GREENIE FARMING NOT PVP BY THE POINT SYSTEM.  I like the fact they are discouraging green farming.  You still have to option to do so, but are punished.  If you choose to go camp mob6544 thats because you dont have the stones to pvp with anyone your level.<br>
<br>
You can find plenty of enemies your level out there.  STFU and find them. <br>

Before this we had absolutely NO way to deal with you fuckers killing us except leaving the area until you got bored or catching you with a train. It's nice to know that now, instead of having to search around for high levels to come deal with you, we can actually work together to eject you.&quot;<br>
<br>
      The way you can deal with high Levels is to level up... you admit in your post that there are high level goods and neutrals.. so it's possible.. wtf is your personal malfunction? The people who spend the time and effort to level up deserve their advantage... otherwise why is there even an experience system? Verant should just lock everyone down at level 1.<br>
<br>
then you grace us with your wisdom, &quot;Ummm, tough shit. Bitch and moan all you want that you're actually eating low level spells, we low levels are cheering because we can now fight you out of our zones without having to resort to training you.&quot;<br>
<br>
      Bind rushing is so much more honorable, eh? You also, hit the nail on the head when you say &quot;we low levels&quot;... you are ecstatic that you have now been GIVEN something that you did not earn. <br>

Hell no. And that's what the point system is: credit.  It is an indication of when folks square off of similar level who comes out on top more often.<br>

I remember on the very first post I saw regarding Sullon they were talking about putting up a scoreboard. What the hell are you talking about? Afterthought my arse.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talked about != implemented.  Points were not in place when the server opened.  The point system was not defined when the server opened.  That makes the point system an afterthought, and also makes it not part of the rules when the server opened.  Therefore to use the argument that you knew the rules when you joined/when the server opened is plainly invalid.  That's what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
As I said before, I don't need to the point system to know who's winning.  I know neutral is winning, it's obvious without the points.  I don't understand what you are saying about using the point system to make excuses - I'm hoping that is directed toward the evil team.  I haven't heard anyone on the good team use points as an excuse. I'm on the good team, we're getting our asses kicked most of the time, I acknowledge that - don't need the point system to realize that either.  We'll keep fighting though.<br>
<br>
My real question is:  Most people have agreed that the point system doesn't really reflect which team is winning.  So what exactly does it do then?  Show us who's best at manipulating an obviously poorly implemented scoring system?  When last I checked this was a PvP server, you don't need a point system to encourage PvP, it's going to happen.  And maybe it's discouraged reds from farming greens directly, but it took manipulators of the point system about 30 seconds to find a way around that via the set up kills for my low level buddy system.  So it hasn't really stopped green farming either.  All the point system has done is take the focus away from the diety war and put it on how many easy point kills can I get today.  That being the case, out it should go, unless Verant explicitly states that the actual focus of the server is collecting points.<br>
<br>
I'll make it simple for you:<br>
If the point system makes it such that there is even one case where someone who would normally blast every green in an enemy's home land does not do so because they are afraid of losing points, then the point system has failed to work in the context of the server, and should be removed.<br>
if the point system makes it such that there is even one case where someone who should be defending their homeland against an incursion of even level oppressors decides to go farm lowbies for points instead because it would be easier to get points that way, then the point system has failed to work in the context of the server, and should be removed.<br>
These are just two situations in which the point system detrimentally affects the advertised dynamic of the server (deity war).  These situations occur multiple times on a daily basis.  Removing the point system would remove these situations.  Removing these situations would help enforce the advertised server dynamic.  Therefore the point system should be removed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uveloxargentum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velox Argentum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 5:15:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> They should NOT return the resist table to what it was, they should make the &quot;slight&quot; adjustments the patchmessage claimed.

Listen when I hit 30, I am going to kill everything I see with two names in evil land. Red white, green or otherwise. (or try)<br>

I like looking to see who I killed on the scoreboard, and who killed me.  Sorry but I do.<br>
<br>
You can not like the point system all you want, but *I* do as is. If you don't like the point system them disregard it.  Fine.<br>
<br>
But to me it is a measure of who is winning. And that is a close race between newt/good with evil in dead last. <br>

 BUT, they should NOT change the lower level's ability to land spells on higher levels that they just implemented.  (Resist gear should be the true determining factor on this, rather than levels - - - higher level people will naturally have higher resist gear and buffs anyway).  <br>

You believe that points accurately indicate who is winning the deity war, I believe they have nothing to do with it and are having a detrimental affect on the server overall.  To you points per capita indicates the winner, and in that case you may be right about good.  Certainly we win battles.  But to me, the fact that we can't get any lands to call our own beyond what we started with, which are poor lands and unwanted, and even those are raided in force multiple times on a daily basis, with widespread slaughter of good people indicates to me that we are losing the war, and losing bad - and all the points in the world, all the good guilds in the top 20 in points, won't make me feel different.

<br>
Your initial statement was that we knew the rules when we started on the server and shouldn't have expected otherwise.  I argued on that basis - the points were not in effect when I signed up, therefore your initial argument was invalid.  Now you have flip flopped and said the rules have changed and we should deal with it.  You've just contradicted your initial postition.  Regardless of your poor debating skills - I do deal with it, I ignore the points.  I don't care about the points, I believe the points have no bearing on who is actually &quot;winning&quot;.  The point system does seem to have had a detrimental effect on some (SOME not ALL) people on the server in relation to their functioning within the advertised dynamic of the server (deity war).  That is what I'm commenting on.  Since the points don't reflect who is winning, and they are detrimental (I believe this to be so, others don't) it is logical to remove the point system.<br>
<br>
As for your others sentance - I have never complained about reds killing greens.  I never will.  I think it's a viable part of the server.  I try to avoid doing so myself, but recognize that to help my team such a thing may be necessary.  What I am against is people doing actions based on how the actions will affect their point total rather than on what is best for their team.  I feel that this is in opposition to the advertised purpose of the server (deity war) - others such as Grim take an opposing view and feel the points give them an idea of how things are shaping up.  This is the nature of our disagreement - understand this and address this if you can, it's not a difficult concept.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2428.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2428.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2428.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2428.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2428.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2428.topic&start=121&stop=128>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2780.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2774.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.threadControl?topicID=2428.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2428.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2428.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sullonzektavernfrm1">General Discussion<option value="sullonzektavernfrm2">Marketplace<option value="sullonzektavernfrm3">No Holds Barred<option value="sullonzektavernfrm4">Guilds of Sullon Zek<option value="sullonzektavernfrm5">Roleplay<option value="sullonzektavernfrm6">Testing Grounds<option value="sullonzektavernfrm7">Administration Station</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern>Sullon Zek Tavern</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Sullon Zek PvP Stats !!</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
