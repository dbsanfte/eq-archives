You go girl. =/<br>
<br>
Anyways here is a log of the fight, I think our problem (other than the fact were a lot higher level) was that no one was keeping clerics busy, someone managed to Complete Heal Keke, that was just stupid, he was pretty dead. Our level 30s tended to die REALLY fast, which sucked, never did get a heal, the cleric in my group was like level 36 he died in like 1 or 2 nukes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Im still laughing at all the DBs who said I wouldnt get my corpse from earlier.<br>

My question is this, DB was there corpse camping Skee and myself.  Zanshin, GF, and TDC were called in to help DB corpse camp us?  Is this correct?<br>

We had actually just gotten to the bridge as you guys zoned in, I didn't get all the buffs I wanted before the fight, it kinda sucked, in my log you can see me bitching for a damage shield having 4 melees on you kinda sucks.<br>
<br>
I'm not gonna make excuses I think I fought ok, though fighting Keke was a bad idea, though disarming him and watching him punch for the entire fight was pretty funny.<br>
<br>
BTW Chaucer was talking about someone fighting a mob, I don't think he joined the fight till a few minutes later. Not everyone came to the bridge like we had requested, I'd say only about half of our force showed up. People at orc fort said they died to an elite train or something I dunno. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/urosencrants.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rosencrants</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/14/01 1:18:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Velious Iceclad/EW bridge battle (8/13-14)</span><hr size=1> DB wasnt there at your first assault....we were fighting the orcs right ...we pulled 2 of em....somehow they didnt stop coming and at the same moment a bunch of Zanshin members apeared around us....we lost alot of people to the orcs....the others zoned and we were scatterd. I dont know if Zanshin was pulling more onto us or what but something fishy was going on...I mean we pull 2 l33ts and a cent and somehow 8 min into the fight comes more l33ts and that Oracle of Ry gorr are still kicking our ass's.<br>
<br>
Anyways alot of us werent given the chance to fight....we made some terrible mistakes and we payed for it...I think if DB was there we could have had a fighting chance....It wont happen again.<br>
<br>
I retreated back to thurg once our scatterd forces were defeated. I knew they would come for thur so i waited and made a pet buffed to all hell. They came and there was only about 5 lev 35ish newts to defend against 6 40-50 peeps. I tryed my best to toss scourge on them i wasnt going to stop. Once they killed my i would canibalise enough for another scourge and throw myself at them...we had some high levels on the way and i did my best to drain there mana and block gates with my fat barbarian ass. I died about 4 times in this effort...non were exp deaths so i didnt care.<br>
<br>
Once the high lev calavry arived Nafgar gated...Abbu got owned by the dwarf guards....gobboruk (er sumthing) got blocked into a tunnel and was killed....skee barely survived and zone danced for about an hour...flab died again somehow and mezmoria used that trusty gate spell she loves so much. <br>
<br>
We had a bad night but we still had a minor victory in the end...Nobody gave up...nobody lost exp.save the ruins and nafgar. <br>
<br>
We totaly owned Nafgar prior to Ruins big raid when Nafgar,skee and mezmoria tryed to take on 20 DB who were ready and didnt have 10 orcs on them. Naf was slain in about 10 seconds ...meanwhile skee was runing around with his head up his ass as my sowed pet would not let mezmoria cast a spell....Mezmoria got to about 50% hp and slamed the gate spell again and Skee got snared and beat to icky goo.<br>
<br>
Also me and axxy were witnessing shame draging ,nafgar and skees corpses....then we saw im siting in the middle of a crowd of trolls and inkys like they were best of frinds....then outside thurg axxy saw ruin attacking shame...shame started runing near the worm cave then they all sat down again.....they did kill him later but its a fucking hoax...Shame is a Ruin...he killed one dude &quot;flab&quot; who was even con to a 43 shaman witch means no exp death...it was all staged...he is a traitior. Anyone dealing with him or his guild will be labeled as traitor.<br>
<br>
We could have done alot better...I think we learned to take any minor ruin incursion more seriously...we still pulled off some victorys so not all is lost.<br>

On one hand, evils dont pvp, when we do, It doesnt matter cuz we were SUPPOSED to win, c'mon, make up your mind, if evil was supposed to win that fight, why'd you stick around to die.<br>

I do know that GF did not participate in any of the CCing. Windom did rez some folks after the bridge battle. <br>
We did have a group that went and defended Kael.<br>
<br>
However, after the bridge battle, we then had some guildmates that were CCed. I accept this as part of the game, so this is not a complaint. <br>
<br>
It is a shift from the war relationship that we had forged with Ruin and IE.<br>
<br>
So RUIN and IE will now CC us. We will change our tactics to reflect this.<br>
<br>
ps - TDC and DB, good fight you put up. Ruin has shown their use of Keke as bait before. I though he was just more bloodthirsty and a faster zoner, as explanation why he always engaged in battle a minute or two before the rest. I have since seen it as a smart tactic, to send him in till he has built up enough 'aggro' on all of us. The difficulty for us is the level/gear he has makes it so he can't be ignored. That will change in time. :)<br>

Since when do you care what the enemy thinks?  Do you want mad props from your enemy?  Why would you expect someone you kill to congratulate you?<br>
<br>
You are right you cannot win.  So stop trying because it falls upon deaf ears.<br>
