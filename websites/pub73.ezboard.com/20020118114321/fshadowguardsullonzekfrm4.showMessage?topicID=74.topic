The dark woods of the Dark Elfs was alit with fire and wind, rain and lightning. The pyramid shook with the impact of a bolt of lightning and a small portal was opened. Out of the portal a small form was thrown forth, landing harshly and rolling down the side of the pyramid. Slowly bringing himself to his feat he tested his strength. It was not as it used to be, nor was his powers with him. He could not sense the elements or the dead. He was no longer a Knight or Mage, he was without mana. Looking about he dropped to a knee and began to pray to Innoruuk. Searching for the answers that he needed, having to find out what has become of him. As if in answer a snap of a stick on the ground startles him. Looking around he notices a small halfling come waling out of the darker shadows of a clump of bushes. Lying down slightly Ashaun tries to hide as much as he can, then as the Halfling walks by him he stops and looks about. Testing the air for anything that might prove something is wrong. Sensing nothing the Druid begins to cast a spell, Then as fast as lightning itself Ashaun leapes forward and neatly and cleanly puts the dagger into his throat. The druid was unable to do anything due to the spell being casted. It jerked and twisted but Ash held him by the throat and pushed the dagger deeper. Crimson liquid poured freely, marking the end of the druid as he gasped for air that would not come. His life force slowly draining away as his blood runs down and splashes to the ground. Dropping the body to the grass Ash looks about, seeing no one else he begins to thank Innrouuk for showing him his skills, for giving him the gift to kill with out remorse and with out being seen. He is a Rogue, assassin by trade and theif by right. Feeling through the clothes of the dead druid he finds a small bit of coin and thanks the body of the fool who came upon him. Looking about his mind is drawn to a familiar feeling, one that it has not felt in a long time. It is the Guard, he can feel it, but he was not aware that it was here, in this realm. Looking down he does not carry his old symbol that he had in his own realm, but the tatto on his chest where his heart is shows that Innoruuk remembers him. And perhaps the Guard will be his home again.<br>

Dark and full of mystery, the Keep rose high into the air. Was full of darkness and yet he could feel the magics within being worked. Looking off into the distance he watched, quietly observing who comes and who goes. Looking for someone he might know, though he was not sure who all would be here. He checked himself over a bit to make sure he was hidden and could not be seen. &quot;Krintek, oh great Krintek who all has come here?&quot;. He mumbled to himself as he watched. Perhaps I should get closer, Perhaps I should try to enter. No that would be foolish, the wards would activate and I would die in great amounts of pain. His thoughts raced through his mind trying to decide how to contact anyone. Perhaps I should go and meet the dargoons that guard here.......... hmmmm perhaps I will. He was thinking of this all, but as he thought more he felt as some though someone was watching him, looking about he knew he was hidden, and could not figure out how anyone could see him. Perhaps it is just his imagination.......... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showMessage?topicID=76.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showMessage?topicID=73.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=74.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.threadControl?topicID=74.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=74.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=74.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm0">The Moat (Public OOC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm4">The Tavern (Public In-Character)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm19">The Gate (Membership Applications)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm12">The Bazaar (Trade Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm14">The Blighted Garden (Allied IC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm10">The Council Chambers (Alliance Discussions)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm11">The Siege Tower (Raid Planning)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm2">The Barracks (Private OOC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm3">Hall of Legend (Private IC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm16">The Cursed Herald (Guild Event Announcements)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm15">The Training Grounds (Strategy Discussion)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm13">Pit of the Damned (The Hunted)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm7">The Armory (Guild Equipment Roster)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm8">The Library (Guild Research)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm18">Allecti Chambers<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm17">Praetor Chambers<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm9">The Throne Room</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffcc>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bshadowguardsullonzek>ShadowGuard - Sullon Zek</a><font color=#ffffcc> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4>The Tavern (Public In-Character)</a> <font color=#ffffcc> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-freecouons&BL=print>PRINT FREE COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
