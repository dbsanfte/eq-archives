<br>
My point is that everything we've been saying about team evil since day one has been, for the most part, right on the money. And is proved by the scoreboard, which is why the evil team is bitching about the point system bein broken.<br>
<br>
At the very beginning, I and many other claimed that evil was going to be mostly if not all completely blue, and only PvP in places like Crushbone when they hit level 45+. We were soundly laughed at and told to wait and see.<br>
<br>
Well, we've waited an we've seen. Evil is doing exactly what they predicted they'd do, and it's showing on the SZ scoreboard to the entire server, as well as to just the people who happen to be on the recieving end of a Ruin HP Gnoll Group Slaughter. <br>
<br>
Now they can't hide it from anyone, because anyone with half a brain can look at the raw data and form the same conclusion. So they now spend all their time bitching about how horrible the point system is (because it shows them for what the majority of their team is made up of) and how points don't really mean anything.<br>
<br>
They're moving the goalpost, and I'm calling them on it, and I'm getting flamed. <p><CENTER>

My work HERE is done.</span><hr size=1> Ahhh, ok I found the stats page. I think I see what you're saying. You're saying that becuase the evil is so far behind the good team that the only reason can be because they evil team is staying in pre 20's zone and killing and the newbies and therefore not getting points? If this is true then that sucks. I for one went to the evil team cause i've always wanted to play an erudite shadow knight and my only option was cazic. Hopefully I'll be able to pull the evil teams standings up some as I level up and we start getting some good kills in to get points. <br>
<br>
I believe I understand your point now and I think the only way this would be corrected would be for some sort of balance between greenie killing and point killing to be accepted by the evil team. Those score points are way out of balance in my opinion. Either there are a lot more good/neutral players than evil or theres a lot of killing of no point players.<br>

If this is what the argument is about I think it's absurd to be targeting the *evil team* when all sides do this. I was in paineel last night and there was a 49 plus enchanter using tashania on people and then frying their asses while they were trying to get into the warrens. These were level 6 to 15 people by the way. Seems like a dead topic to me since all sides do it and it's not against the rules of the server.

<br>
Sorry bro THIS thread is about what a whiny bitch Cal is and how I am sick of hearing his garbage.<br>
<br>
question does 1 to 3 people on evil team farming newbies constitute the whole of evil? nope.<br>
<br>
So other teams members farm newbs? yes<br>
<br>
Do other teams higher memebers farm tons of newbs like evils? nope we are king at that.<br>
<br>
back on topic, Cal My in game name is RAKIL, &lt;------- my name, I am a 26th lvl warrior with 38 MR , I am using mostly FS or FC weapons. right now im in kurns tower top floor trying to get my odd mole head for my uber trooper scale head peice, but I am 100% willing to come to mainland and shove my pike strait up your ass and out your mouth if you want. we can meet in the arena, set a time between you and me. bind there and keep fighting each other till we are sick to death at looking at each other or till you realize your a poosay.<br>
<br>
My whole gripe with you cal is you are not doing a damn thing for you team, you get no points nothing, yet you repeatedly attack the whole of team evil for the actions of a select few of my team. I AM NOBODIES poosay, I went to mainland for 1 week strait lvling in OOT, ask Narc and his druid friend, on gargole island, CT , sola, and various other place including SK. <br>
No I dont have any points, no I dont pvp 24/7 and even if i did solo pvp i probably could not kill anyone near my lvl cause they can gate/ss or just plain run from me.  So my offer stands ill meet you in the arena one to one, anytime of the week any day of the week any month of the year.<br>

He is a dwarf and hangs out in HHK and with the quickness that he levels im sure if you go pking in HHK in about 2 months you will still see him leveling there.  <br>

Really if you can kill him, you should it was just about the funniest 3 hours I have ever spent in any zone, killing him every time he opened his mouth.  *giggles*<br>
