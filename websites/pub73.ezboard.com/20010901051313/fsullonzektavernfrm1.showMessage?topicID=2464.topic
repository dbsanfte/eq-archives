<br>
It's a very detailed post with more evidence and counters being brought throughout the post about the allegations of Guild Zanshin's relationship with the Neutral team...and their foes.<br>
<br>
Darkenbane leadership has looked over all of the info and has made their decision regarding how we will deal with Zanshin in the future in a statement on our Front page as follows:<br>
<br>
We have looked over all of the &quot;evidence&quot; regarding guild Zanshin's association with the Foe and come to the following conclusions: <br>
<br>
- Shame does, in fact, have friends on the evil team and not only talks to them in tells, but has been seen 'hanging out' with them (even when they might make sport of some helpless newby teamates). In his defense, he advises that EQ IS just a game and, although he is friends with (and respects) some of the foe, he will fight them (and then maybe have a chat afterwards). <br>
<br>
- Guild Zanshin has been known to and has admitted to negotiating with the foe when the odds do not seem to be in their favor. When doing PvE or when outleveled this guild's leadership has admitted to and been seen to 'work out deals' of non agression with the enemy. Examples are when Firble a 50th Necro was allowed to get his Student's Homework on the same level in TOFS as a group of Zanshin because &quot;he was red&quot;. <br>
<br>
- It was determined that Guild Zanshin are not activily traitors, but instead have a leadership with cowardly ideals. They will fight, but it seems only when they have the advantage or when THEY are out looking for a fight. When trying to do PvE or when outnumbered and/or outleveled they will very possibly back out of a fight if negotiation will allow it. We also believe the &quot;friendships&quot; of the guild leader may have leaked out info to the foe in the past and that he should not be trusted with sensative information. <br>
<br>
Darkenbane leadership has determined that guild Zanshin's attitude is detrimental to the success of the Neutral Team. We believe including them in on events will possibly yield difficulties with the foe being aware of our activities and must be concerned with whether they will stand and fight when necessary. As such, Darkenbane will not engage in any events where guild Zanshin members are present and will not group/assist their members. We do not wish this type of organization to grow as it will ultimately lead to the downfall of the Neutral Team. A weak guild is a weak link in our armor. We MUST not allow it to continue.<br>
<br>
Gray Rage<br>
AKA Grunter<br>
Darkenbane<br>
<br>
Side note:  We are sure that Zanshin has some good members, if not MANY members.  We just believe that it's course is being directed in a manner that is detrimental to the Neutral team by it's leadership.   If ALL neutral believed and acted like guild Zanshin, we would be overrun by the foe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udurilgreystone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Duril Greystone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/17/01 6:15:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Darkenbane relationship to Zanshin</span><hr size=1> *sniff* <p><img src="http://www.jbark.com/crimson/glinsig.jpg" width="382" height="200"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uaoii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>the Owner</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/17/01 7:15:33 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.att.net/~neoleo/sig.jpg width=173 height=131></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Darkenbane relationship to Zanshin</span><hr size=1> heh, thats a funny sig. ^_^ <p><br><br>

Shame is a different matter, but I am not quick to attack all members of Zanshin. <br>
<br>
I also dont have a problem with many of darkenbane either, for that matter.<br>

I do not like dissention among the team at all if it can be avoided. I don' t think we should have this much politics when we have a recognized enemy and have to bring that enemy down.<br>

You DB people play it your way and let everyone else play it theirs.  I, for one, will never trade with goods or evils.  I do have socially amicable interaction with certain goods because I recognize the valor of their efforts (screw you, Sect).  I salute Angerthas, and hope to meet them on the field of battle some day.  You wanna call me a traitor for admiring someone's efforts which exceed my own and that of my team?  Go ahead and call me a team traitor.  I dare ya.  Just be careful what you accuse me of.  I might actually have to prove you right.<br>
<br>
You back off Shame and his lot, and focus your energies on keeping the evil dogs down or I swear to you, I'll follow your peeps from zone to zone and /tell their loc to the nearest competitive evil guild that will listen to me.  I'll KS and train where I can, use propaganda and demagoguery where nothing else works.  YOU WILL step off Zanshin.<br>

Thicket and Vale declares an end to this episode of civil unrest.  Your charges are trumped, your evidence a cut and paste travesty of falsehoods.  Be on the team or begone from it, I say.  Quit spreading discontent because you and yours died a few times in some failed pvp conflicts en masse!

I have seen Zanshire a lot on Velious, and to be honest, I like them. But in all of the battles to defend the icy land, I have seen DB and TDC come accross zones to lend a hand in the defense. I have not seen Zanshire do this, I have not seen shouts/tells from them saying where eveils aree, where they are attacking evils and the like. I have not seen them as an active PvP force in trying to defend Velious.<br>

I could be wrong, and yes, there are of course the exceptions of one or two fellows that I have seen come to aid individually.<br>

<br>
TDC and DB are guilds worth fighting, as is GF.  The Z-boys, as they are called by most evils, are for the most part lame.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
A few of thier members are shit-talkin Jackals that hover around thier higher level guildiees for quick kills.  They never stick around to fight and always run off or zone plug out.<br>
<br>
They NEVER take on a bigger force than them selves and ONLY commit to PVP when they have a huge advantage in numbers or Levels, which means if there are less than 3 Z-boys in a zone they run at the first sign of trouble and cower at the closest Druid ring waiting for thier &quot;ace&quot; Shame to come in and make everything better.<br>
<br>
I don't fault them for having friends on other teams, thats a good thing.   Not attacking an enemy in a zone cuz he RED is too-bloo.<br>

I've met a couple of Zanshire that I like (Fuzzyfeet is one, if he is still in Zanshire), but for the most part, I do not trust them, and I know first hand that Shame will not do anything if you let him know that 2 or 3 of his members are ninja looting.<br>
<br>
The lucky part is that I learned this when I was around level 14 or so, when the loot was easily replaced.<br>

I think he is being a responsible guild leader by stating the policies of his guild in a public forum for all to see and understand.<br>
<br>
Kidknee, I could be wrong, but that sounds more destructive to team unity than the post by Gray Rage. And besides, I think you running around shouting their loc to other people in the zone will hardly bother them at all. For all of you that did not play on Rallos, I'll let you in on a little secret. People have done far worse to them than shout their locs. In fact, they were griefed so much that I could not take it anymore and had to abandon ship and leave the guild. Anything you do to them I'm sure will be seen as quite ridiculous, and I'm sure they will get a hearty laugh out of it.<br>
<br>
I must say, I am very proud of Darkenbane. To me it seems they have become a real team player. I think that is a great accomplishment since they were the outcasts of RZ and did everything on their own.<br>

I'm not claiming they are because frankly I have no experience in the matter, but not including them on raids is the ONLY sensible thing to do if you can't trust them. A weapon that can turn in your hand is too dangerous to be used.<br>
<br>
I didn't see Gray saying that they would be griefing Zanshin, he simply stated that they wouldn't be viewed as neutrals and simply avoided.<br>
<br>
The only one I saw threatening people in this thread was sadly Kidnee, which is sad because he seemed like a reasonable man. When you make such threats that are by the nature of the server impossible to deliver on it will just shoot the team spirit in the foot imo.<br>
