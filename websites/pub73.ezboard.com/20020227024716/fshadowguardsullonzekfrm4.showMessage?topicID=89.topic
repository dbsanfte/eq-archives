&quot;I am Reziah.  Priestess of Cazic Thule though I serve him here in spirit and not in body&quot;, her ghostly form wavers for a moment.<br>

&quot;I fear I have bad news for you.  Lord Krintek has not been heard from in many ages and the others have disappeared as well.

The shrieks of the souls imprisoned there were not so loud as in ages past, nor was the black luminescence quite as bright in its darkness as before.  Even still, the ominous presence of the Keep pervaded the land about it and gave the perfect setting for the coming of the one who was once its master.<br>
<br>
On the lowered gate of the impregnable fortress that was Shadow Keep, two Teir’Dal ladies--one seeming a shadowed wraith--stood in audience as the darkness about them began to gather and thicken.  Neither of them was a stranger to the sense of doom that immediately pervaded their hearts, but neither did they take note now…perhaps by design.<br>
<br>
The darkness grew ever thicker and the doom became heavier on the bone chilling air surrounding the Keep, but no form was given it this eve.  Even as the wraith-like female vanished into the night, a resonant voice filled the air, a voice known well, but one that seemed far distant despite its strength.  “Lady Xenjinn, I am pleased to see you here.  Your calling has summoned me forth once more, though I cannot come to you as once…”<br>
<br>
Silence held for a moment’s time amidst the raging of the Abyss as the Teir’Dal Lady on the gate stood transfixed by the presence surrounding her.  “Lord Krintek, am I dreaming?  Are you a dream now?”<br>
<br>
“A dream to some…a nightmare to others!  I fear that this world is finished with me, and I with it.  I have been returned to the formless existence from whence I came so long ago.  Worry not, Child, when the time comes, I will yet return to mortality, when Evil again requires my presence.  This is a time for you and those like you; this is your time.”<br>
<br>
A pause was given then as if to await a response to the first words, but when none was given, the phantasmal voice of Krintek continued.<br>
<br>
“Know ye that even as Hatred gave birth to my mortal shell in this world so many centuries ago to serve the will of the Father and the Shadow Guard, a new evil shall call to me when the time comes.  It may not be in this world—there exist worlds numbering as to the grains of sand on all the beaches of all the seas—but in some world, someday, I shall be needed again.  When that need arises—when the time comes for darkness to cover all that is good and pure—I will come again…”<br>
<br>
For a moment the souls raging in the Abyss seemed to rise higher and their tormented wails pierce deeper into the soul.<br>
<br>
“…and with me I <I>will</I> bring the Shadow Guard if it does not already exist in whatever world I should next find myself.”<br>
<br>
The Abyss again grew quiet, so quiet in fact that the ensuing whisper could clearly be heard resounding through the enduring Shadow Keep like the tolling of a great bell.  The darkness dissipated, as Krintek was so inclined to do, and became the substance of the whisper that was his final message—the substance of memory.<br>
<br>
The whisper passed beyond the walls of the Keep and along all of the streets of great Neriak.<br>
<br>
It passed into Nektulos forest and breezed past those on the plains of the Commonlands.<br>
<br>
Across the desert of Ro, and through the tall trees of the Kithicor Forest, the whisper was heard.<br>
<br>
On the high seas of the Ocean of Tears, as far as the lost continent of Velious, across all of Norrath it was heard…for those that still knew how to listen.  Even those that did not would occasionally take note of the mysterious shadow that seemed—just for a moment—to pass before the sun on cloudless days, or the shaded dimness that brought a chilling shiver on warm summer days.<br>
<br>
“Long live the Shadow Guard…Until I come again.” <p>May the Hatred of Innoruuk pervade your hearts...

<br>

...and trouble your dreams.

It was a long walk, but at the end of it Schaard  Ob'Tenebrae came upon scrolls without number.  The memoirs of Krintek K'kidrak.  Here Schaard would sit.  Here he would learn from his master.
