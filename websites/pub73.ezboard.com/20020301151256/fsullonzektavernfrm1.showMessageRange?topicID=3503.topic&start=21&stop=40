Claiming that they are not is a rather naive view.<br>
<br>
Take for a moment the issue of encryption.  The US government has been making mild attempts to remove strong encryption from the hands of US citizens for some time now, but could never find a reason which justified doing so.<br>
<br>
Enter a large and well funded terrorist organization.  That serves as reason, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,46900,00.html">www.wired.com/news/politi...00,00.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Thanks to the terrorist attacks, the US government is attempting to ban any form of strong encryption technology that doesn't include a built in back door for use by government agencies.<br>
<br>
Some people may say that's a good thing.  I mean, that way, the government can always read everyone's communication, and those pesky terrorists can't sneak up on us again.<br>
<br>
Wrong.<br>
<br>
The law would only apply to US citizens.  Most terrorists are not US citizens folks (yes, some are, but I'm talking numbers here).  So the law doesn't really effect terrorists.<br>
<br>
I know!  All good computer technology comes from the US, right?  So if we don't produce strong crypto, then no one in the world will have it, right?<br>
<br>
Wrong.<br>
<br>
PGP was originally produced by a Canadian.  The algorithms and programming involved is so simple that I wrote a program that implemented RSA encryption as a homework assignment back in my college days.  Anyone can do this.<br>
<br>
What are the effects then?<br>
<br>
And encryption scheme that contains a known back door is not an encryption scheme.  Anyone can read it.  Consequently, anyone in the world can suddenly read any information encrypted in the US, but the US can still not read anything encrypted in any other part of the world.<br>
<br>
Now that is certainly an intelligent thing to do.<br>
<br>
So what, you say.  Just because the US as a country just became less secure, what does that have to do with my civil liberties?<br>
<br>
It's the principle of the thing.  The US government just made it illegal for you to have information that they can't have.  There goes your privacy.<br>
<br>
So what, you say.  So what if the government can read all of my email?  <br>
<br>

Not only does it completely defeat the point of encryption, if/when somebody cracks the backdoor key he will have unrestricted access and there is NOTHING you can do about it. Heck, you won't even know that your neighbour might be listening in on your phonecalls and email or monitoring what you download or post over the web.<br>

For once I'm glad I don't live in the US, because this would be a disaster to the digital world. <p><b>Velox Argentum</b><BR>

<br>
Why dont you try telling that to the 5000 dead people. I feel they may have a different opinion than you. If you lack the ability to communicate with the dead, try asking their families.<br>
<br>
Something needs to change. I personally dont want to be on a plane and have it rammed into the white house or some shit. Nothing I say over the phone is really sensitive anyhow. <br>
<br>
However, I appreciate your amazing insightful input Sam. I dont want to go to jail for anything silly. Guys, Sam just added another girl to the list that will never go down on you. Make sure to thank him appropriately.<br>
<br>
Curious though. What if you have phone sex with a guy and say that you are sucking him off. Is that still a crime? What if he paid for the phone call? <br>
