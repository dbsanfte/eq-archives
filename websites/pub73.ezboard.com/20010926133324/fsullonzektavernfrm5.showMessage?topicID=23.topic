The Troll twisted his body and called forth a blinding flash to disorient the hapless orc, causing it to run right into the twisted branch of a nearby tree.  It was a perfect night of raiding so far in the South of Ro --  orc corpses were piled in heaps aside the oracle's camp. Tefnutt's pet skeleton cackled as a new orc warrior appeared and Qwak, shaman of Ogguk, prepared his majick. Akuen, the Tier'dal priest, meditating solemnly beside them, was still in his prayers to Innoruuk as Mezz, the enchanter, had just arrived to aid with his &quot;dark mojo&quot; as the Biguns called it.  They were all members of the Shadow Guard, and had journeyed to this new world together to bring order to evil.  Umbrac was the Chancellor of Cabal, the leader of the Ogres and Trolls in service to the Shadow Guard, and protectors of the evil lands of Norrath.<br>
<br>
Umbrac readied his staff to crack down on the immense head of his foe, when words filled his head from a distant friend. Cherrish, priestess from Neriak, needed his aid.  The journey to Neriak was the first he would make in this new world but one that was necessary. Cherrish had fallen prey to a demented human travelling through the great Oasis of Marr, and Umbrac would assist in her body's recovery.<br>
<br>
Umbrac concentrated and spoke loudly in his mind to Cherrish, as if the booming voice would break through their minds and be heard aloud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Me com naw ledy.  Nat fear fur de spiris guide dis Troll wit speed.&quot;<br>
<br>
As he travelled, strange visions met his eyes. Sand giants thundering on the desert floor, dry bone skeletons moving in zombie-like steps across the planes, and the groups of other Trolls and their Ogre companions joined to battle other creatures.<br>
<br>
Moving to North Ro, Umbrac ran with the spirit of the wolf, a gift he had recently been granted by Cazic. Nearing the tunnel adjoining Ro to Commons, he sensed the presence of danger and heard the sounds of majick near. However, the spirit of travel sped him quickly to the tunnel to meet Cherrish.<br>
<br>
He spotted the dark woman, and they both smiled as a simple gesture of greeting. Casting the spirit on his new companion, Umbrac turned to begin the journey back to the Oasis. Just then, a wood elf hobbled into the Tunnel, apparently hurt from a recent battle. The sight of this Fier'dal was common, as only moments ago, Umbrac was almost attacked by this strange foe while running to meet Cherrish!<br>
<br>
Without delay, Umbrac summoned the spirit of frost as shards of ice spun around his massive body like an angry bee-hive. The ice flew out and struck the wood elf, slicing his body and staggering him back. Blood seeped through many times wounds appearing over the soft skin of the elf.*<br>
<br>
&quot;Please stop,&quot; the wood elf begged.<br>
<br>
* Umbrac did not hesitate but raised his arms again, drawing in the energy around him and called forth the spirit again. this time, the hail of ice crashed even harder against the fleeing Fier'dal, sending the prey to the ground, nearly breathing. Having left his mercy buried deep in the recesses of swamp, Umbrac called forth the ice again, pummeling his victim and finally sending the lesser back home. <br>
<br>
The journey back to South Ro was arduous but the pair of Shadow Guard quickly traversed the way, to join their group by the orc camps, where more bodies had been piled on the heap. * <p><font face="arial" size="-1">
