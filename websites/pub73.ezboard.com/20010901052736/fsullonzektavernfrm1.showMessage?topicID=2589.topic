This was just after my small little band got swamped by marqus and crew in WC (damn my poison resist sucks) and we were regrouping to push back in. I was by far the highest of the evils going in (35) and a lot of the newts were higher levels including Kenshiro from TDC. A lot of shit talking was being done by evils in EC, but nothing to back it up. This one person, a member in one of the 3 biggest evil guilds, unnamed for privacy reason was making shouts to the zone, but when I prompted him to join my group to take it to them, that was his response. How pathetic. Of course, we got owned again (average level for us was around 20....I ended up with 6 on my tail as I circle strafed and SS'ed around...until a damn poison dot finished me).<br>
<br>
Anyways, to nafgar and the res of IE that showed up and helped push the newts out, you all have balls and show up to play every day. The rest of my team is a disgrace for the most part, with a few cases otherwise. I offered to port anyone 30+ in OT who wanted to come...and got one 14 monk, everyone else was stuck on the nipple.<br>
<br>
Kenshiro, I had fun chatting with you the whole time TDC at least is starting to back their talk up and keep bringing it, some of us like a challenge even if 50ish monks hit damn hard. <br>
<br>
Grimjaw you furthered your position as the biggest shit talking do nothing, both here and in game, and your own team was remarking on it. When you do something other than zone plug...then come back here and talk shit. Being in a group with people 20 levels over you to protect you and then talking like you are doing something....laughable.<br>
<br>
And Frok, damnit why am I wizzard if Draught of Fire is going to only hit for 44 against people 15 levels below me....you hit me with both IC and DoF and still didn't kill a wizzy with 600hp....now that is screwed up. I hope they fix that soon, cuz I don't want to be a dickless 50 wizzy who can only port. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uikarishinjisz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ikari Shinji SZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 1:22:13 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It pains me to say this, but a large part of my team is </span><hr size=1> it's true and sad. however, maybe you were looking in the wrong place. send tells to guilds rather than just announce over public channels.<br>

<br>
the moment you say &quot;evils 20+ needed to fight newt invasion in WC/Kith) you get flooded with tells like &quot; what level are newts, how many, what guilds, I am 25 will I die, are there enough to fight undead if we get trained&quot; etc..WTF? I am not a frigging god you nincompoops. There are newts in WC and there are evils fighting..Why dont you get your ass over and find out the details? I even tell you that the newt levels range from 20 to 40. WTF more do you need? A spreadsheet?<br>
<br>
It *is* frustrating to be an evil at times...but the JOY of waxxing a redcon pansy rogue trying to hide/sneak thru EC in priceless ( snare/dot/invis..he panics..zones like 20 times..still dies:P)<br>
<br>
Edit: To Ruin's credit whenever I had sent someone in Ruin a tell about WC Neutral offensives, I have always gotten a response saying why they ca/can't come ( plane raid etc) I would love to know who in other evil guilds to send tells to. ( this is NOT in case some level 19 druid is killing some evils in orc ..this is when there is a real gathering of newts).. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udury.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dury</A> at: 8/21/01 1:28:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uvelaelsoulrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 1:28:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: It pains me to say this, but a large part of my team is </span><hr size=1> This was a single tell to a 35th level evil in the same zone, and in one of the 3 &quot;uber&quot; evil guilds.

but throwing 20s up against 35+ melees is sure gonna get messy.<br>

another thing, it's a lot easier to play offense than it is to play defense. if you're tired of having to respond to another 35+ plus raid when you have no backup, bring your group of 20s and go raid runnyeye or unrest or anything you like. go see first hand what kronar is up to in CB. if anything, it'll make you feel nice and warm that someone other than you gets spanked every once in a while...i know it helps me... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ualienjoes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlienJoes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 2:12:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> heh</span><hr size=1> As my other post suggest, Evil team is nothing but a bunch of bluebie fags who couldn't pk if their life depended on it.

<br>
Val, let me make something very clear to you, I do not think I am the best at pvp or even close.  I am probably average. I have a few moves, can kill some, die to others.  I don't know what you are talking about &quot;my team&quot; commenting on last night, but I am curious who or what they said. (I sorta think you are making this up as you go along)<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;plugging&quot;  I don't give other teams points.  When you, a red, corpse camped me, I am not going to give you the satisfaction of letting you set someone else up and kill me for exp loss.  To put it simply, I respond to being griefed by griefing others.  I do not just &quot;let&quot; people corpse camp me. You can if you want, but to me it displays more of a lack of intellect than a sense of honor. <br>
<br>
Also...what &quot;trash&quot; did I talk last night?  I killed scowl and he he was pissed about it ooc.  I responded, and you backed him despite the fact you really don't know him.  The fact is Scowl has run from me everytime I fought him alone. I have 3-4 levels on him I think, so its understandable, but when I did kill him, I didn't expect him to complain so much.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;I only fight when 20+ people are backing me up bit.&quot; I think my team knows, my guild knows and most importantly *you* know I pvp alot, and to be honest *most* of the time it is alone. I think that was the biggest raid I was a part of in fact.  I am used to pvping alone, and everyone who actually has seen me more than one encounter knows this.<br>
<br>
I thought you had more common sense and tact than this, frankly. I came here after that fight and posted this thread:<br>

<br>
I know my &quot;trash talk&quot; just saturates the thread. <br>

Merkins, I wanted to add to my previous comment. Your in &lt;Ruin&gt; right? I'm sure you are tired of being called &quot;blue&quot; but I think you have moved well past that. You all don't talk shit in OOC/Shout and then run. If someone messes with you guys you come kick their asses and take names. I for one am glad to have you on my team. My point was that the 25-45 evils crowd is a bunch on namby pamby wusses for the most part. Yes, xp deaths hurt. They will hurt even more higher up (unless Skee is around in which case they don't hurt at all =P). This individual was in the same zone, not hunting anything or currently occupied and had that to say. And what is worse is that that seems to be the attitude of many of the 25-45 crowd on my team. Sad really =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thullsa>Thullsa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 8:34:40 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Merkins</span><hr size=1> Valeal i agree completely. As one of the evils who stayed on the mainland cause i purposely wanted to level slowly and engage in occasional pvp i hate kunark(well at the moment i do). Maybe at first i didn't fight but now i run head long into a defense of the homelands. I fight for paineel alot and you can't believe how hard it is to get people to fight. These are poeple that are fighting near there bind points so no corpse runs, and thees are people who can make ther xp back in an hour or less from a death and they still won't fight!<br>
<br>
Geesh! get off your asses and fight people.<br>
I wish we had a team chat we could toggle on. The first thing i would shout is that you generally won't lose xp from a red con so get out there and fight. whenever team evil hears about reds they scatter, when team good and newt hear about red cons they team up and take names!<br>

And grimjaw, just shut up and stop hiding behind  the fact that your team is better then you are. <br>

I don't hide behind the fact that my team sucks and i am a pvp newbie. What people are telling you is all you do in fights is run to the nearest zone and zoneplug. Thats it, thats your legacy you poon!<br>

  It is sad that we have so many bluebies on the Evil team. I recall Goods bitching about being the underdog to the point they nerfed the server.

<br>
i would rather die the lopsided fight, than tell a team mate, 'not now , i am lvling'.

&quot;My team is better than me&quot;  I never claimed the opposite. Frankly no one is better than the team, and I challenge you to find where I said otherwise.  <br>
<br>
Scowl. You died and the first thing you said was something about me zone plugging. Hence...trash talk. I am sorry, I am *not* going to let someone corpse camp me when a guard kills me and you want free points.  Funny, I didn't corpse camp you, and all I get for my courtesy is a lecture on why I should have let myself get ganked naked for some kind of honor trip.  You yourself sent me a tell bragging about how you were going to corpse camp me, and yet I *still* didn't CC you, even though you would not have the same politeness for me. <br>
<br>
Thullsa, I don't even know who you are.  I think you were in the warrens once when I was there.  How the hell do you even know me?<br>
<br>
I am really so hurt that my enemies have such a low opinion of me.<br>

I'm not about to run or plug (ahem....Grim) from anyone. The people I'm talking about are the ones 35+ who still aren't tough enough to take on anyone. Get off your asses when newts are in the zone and go get them. Hell, Flayer and Narc where in OT for how long last night picking off evils? If I go to SK I sure as hell don't last as long in zone as they did. Now I know that Flayer was bound there and just naked rushing people...but still, last night was an all around pathetic display by team Evil. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uvelaelsoulrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>drunken' poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 9:49:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Grim</span><hr size=1> Grim, I'm not arguing this with you.

<br>
That's the levels of the folks that came in and out of my group as we where fighting in EC and WC.  Dont say we where all 30+ and you had no high ups.. I SAW a few EVIL RED CONS but most of them ran or died.  I think the most neutrals we had at the tunnel in EC was 18 of us.  We killed a red con from Hate (I know) and Ruin (I think). <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>

They came in and chased out Kenshiro and most of the higher lvls, but not a singlehanded fight.  Lots of individuals and small guilds showed, a much better response than I've seen previously.   Da Bashin' Iggles took advantage of Calgons free ports to mobilize 18 or so member there.  I know we dropped at least 5 or 6 peoples (Griftrix is hell on druids), and when the newts started to run we helped push them back out of EC/WC/Kith and even held HHP for a bit before being trained out by guards.<br>
  Me personally, I got smacked upside the head by a newt posse (with Kenshiro playing whackem mole on my head), then killed on CR by Kenshiro and Runz.  Was funny to have Kenshiro brag to me about his kungfu skills after killing a naked guy 30 lvls below him hehe, to each their own.  Resist are still buggy, shrugged off 4 or 5 snares before one stuck.  <br>
     Carnivorous won the fast feet award, as well as the high flyer award for most altitude in a levitation to escape from a pvp fight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2589.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2589.topic&start=41&stop=50>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2618.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2624.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.threadControl?topicID=2589.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2589.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2589.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sullonzektavernfrm1">General Discussion<option value="sullonzektavernfrm2">Marketplace<option value="sullonzektavernfrm3">No Holds Barred<option value="sullonzektavernfrm4">Guilds of Sullon Zek<option value="sullonzektavernfrm5">Roleplay<option value="sullonzektavernfrm6">Testing Grounds<option value="sullonzektavernfrm7">Administration Station</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern>Sullon Zek Tavern</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Sullon Zek PvP Stats !!</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
