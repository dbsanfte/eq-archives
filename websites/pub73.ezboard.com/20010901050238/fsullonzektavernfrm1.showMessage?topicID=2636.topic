<br>
I am wondering why the spell damage nerf still exists on EverQuest pvp servers. <br>
<br>
The nerf was enacted in late 1999, long before Kunark and Velious came out. The reason for the spell damage nerf, supposedly, was that Spells were designed for PvE encounters, thus making them too powerful in PvP. A lot has changed since then. <br>
<br>
Kunark and Velious made Melee characters and Hybrids incredibly more powerful. Further, the Level of Resists has seen a phenomenal increase with the introduction of Blue Diamond gear, velium jewelery, and the incredibly powerful new items that drop throughout Kunark, Velious and the revised Planar drops. <br>
<br>
If spell damage was nerfed because it was designed for PvE, why aren't Resists nerfed in accord with that same theory? It it common for high level players (40-60) on PvP servers to have Resists in the 150-200 range. <br>
<br>
I am a level 52 wizard on the Sullon Zek server. Setting aside for a moment the recent PvP resist nerf disaster, the level of resists on the server are already phenomenal. Velious offerse several easy gem quests, and many of my opponents are already wearing full diamond and blue diamond resist gear. <br>
<br>
Root in PvP is a joke. At level 50+, fighting anyone in range or red, Root spells will land about 1 in 500 times. Snare spells (Bonds of Force) are likewise useless. Stun spells (Clash's) are similarly a waste of mana. Now, on top of all of that, Since the wizard is the only pure damage caster without a DoT, a Pet or a Resistance Debuff, the non-lure damage spells are very often doing less than 1:1 Damage:Mana ratio. <br>
<br>
For example, the level 51 wizard nuke, Draught of Fire, Is supposed to do 650+ in PvE for 215 Mana. In PvP, it does a maximum of about 407 damage for 215 mana. Many many many of the Even Con and High Green opponents I fight regularly resist the spell to the tun of taking 51-200 damage. It almost never hits for full. <br>
<br>
Is that really Verant's vision for PvP wizards? Instead of the gods of DD, we are the laughing stock. Not only do our spells get resists often, but we have no Debuff. <br>
<br>
Now, a 51 druid casting their level 49 fire based nuke, accompanied by their massive Fire debuff, can regularly outdamage our level 51 fire nuke. <br>
<br>
At high level pvp, as a wizard with 2.5 years of pvp experience, there is very little I cast besides Lures and Shock of Lightning. <br>
<br>
Are my Roots supposed to be worthless? <br>
Are my snares not supposed to ever land? <br>
Are my Clash spells supposed to be a waste? <br>
Are my non-lure nukes supposed to be doing 10-30 percent of their PvE max for 100percent of the mana cost? <br>
<br>
<br>
Beyond the obvious fact that Resists are completely out of control, and that wizards are the MOST dd dependent and LEAST able to debuff, why on earth is their still a spell damge nerf? <br>
<br>
<br>
Pet HP wasnt nerfed. <br>
Melee AC/HP/ATK/DEF wasnt nerfed. <br>
Heal Spells were not nerfed. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that the useful life of the spell damage nerf has expired. <br>
<br>
Please consider making PvP fair again by eliminating the spell damage nerf. Additionally, a Resist Cap of 120 in any category would likewise be appropriate in making EQ PvP fair. <br>
<br>
Finally, if you are not going to remove the spell damage cap, then please at least be decent enough to similarly nerf the mana cost of the spell. Not only have you knee-capped the Damage per Spell, but the total damage output in a bar of mana by not reducing mana cost on the spells. <br>
<br>
If you wont do any of that, how about making the wizard staff of temperate flux a meaningful debuff tool? It currently reduces FIRE and COLD by SIX, 6. (That is not a typo, 6). What about 60? Or at least 45? Shouldnt the most mana-dependent, DD dependent caster be able to debuff? <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time. <br>

p.s. <br>
<br>
If you wouldn't mind, it would be great of you to eliminate the total immunity you have given druids for that past 2 months by fixing CANCEL MAGIC. You have been aware of the bug for at least 3 months (on test server). Ever GM and Guide I talk to admits that. The spell works on every other PvP server, and even Absor said months ago on these boards that it SHOULD be working. Its not. The code still sees it as a beneficial spell. <br>
<br>

<br>
Yes.  All of those spells should be wasted on an opponent with decent resists.<br>
<br>
It's the same for nearly every class with an equivalent spell line (Root, Snare / Darkness / Etc., Stun).<br>

As a caster, I would hate to face another caster without the spell damage nerf.    If spells did 100% of damage it would take another notch out of the amount of skill needed to pvp and put just that much more into the "i spotted you first so i win" trueism of 50+ pvp.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way,<br>
<br>
A lvl 52 caster would:<br>
<br>
* Die within two waves of the 50+ mage/wiz rain spells<br>
* Die by two draughts (if not partially resisted) which means a 6 second fight<br>
* Die by two lures (pretty hard to resist, 9 second fight)<br>
* Die by three scars (6 second fight + recast time twice)<br>
<br>
And that's just the DD spells of Mages and Wizards, add in the DD of other classes, the Dots, Full Damage from pets... caster vs caster would take hardly any skill at all. <p> <br>

<br>
with the best possible gear a level 60 warrior can get over 4000 hp unbuffed, 100+ in all resists in that same gear, and maintain 1200 attack/1400 ac.<br>
<br>
A Wizard MAY be able to nuke him for 400 damage. Maybe. If hes not running for his life the entire time.<br>
<br>
unnerfing the damage tables simply re-adjusts that fairly broken scenario. Playing with resist tables prolly shifts it in favor of the wizard, breaking it in a totally different way.<br>

Another thing I might suggest is that you not rely so much on solo pvp.  Admittedly, without being able to debuff your opponent first, the caster damage nerf will seem harsh.  However, if grouped appropriately, you might find yourself significantly more successful in landing for full, albeit nerfed, damage.  Wizard class is not a solo PvE class, why should it be a solo PvP class?  <br>
<br>
   I will admit (as Verant pretty much did) that the introduction of very nice resist gearnin Kunark and Velious has made life more difficult for casters, the exception being druids and necros.  However, Verant virtually admitted as much when they buffed beduffs by 50% on all pvp servers.  As I say above, solution: get in a competent group and you will do much better.<br>

Not gonna flame ya cause I was once a decent lvl wizard and know all to well of resists.<br>
But EQ has stated several times that each class has a specific role, some are better at killing then others. In addition if your lvl 50+ you should never be snared/rooted ever, see what you dont realize is any melee stopped is a dead melee, as a caster if you are stopped there is a likely chance you can gate or still fight on. What I have found to be the most effective against melees is SS then DD SS DD rinse repeat.<br>
and yes warriors should be hard to kill, they are designed to soak up damage.<br>

Wizzies are the designated gankers of PvP.  We will never kill folks straight up.  Gonna always have to catch them unaware.  Not sure if that was how Verant wanted them to be or not.  But wizzies are not good duelers.  In big group fights i don;t even waste mana until i see someone low cause one cleric heal will cancel at least half my mana.  I just run around until i see one low and try to get nuke off to finish him before he gets away or gets that heal.  Not the most &quot;honorable&quot; role in PvP, but...well  ....

<br>
Cleric unbuffed has about 1500 hps, and unbuffed means you super pumice bommbed her first, so she got a few moments to understand that something fishy is going on, already enough time to DA or DB whatever is up. Then it's you vs. the cleric. If you use Lure of Ice you're already fighting a lost game:<br>
<br>
Lure of Ice : 519 pvp for 320 mana 4.5 sec<br>
Divine Light: 910 for 350 mana 4.5 sec<br>
<br>
Interrupting with SoL is pretty much useless since<br>
a) you can't kill a level 60 char with SoL, since you do like 5 dmg per shot, so you'll go OOM before the other one is half life<br>
b) even if SoL hit for full you'd need to land about 25 of them without the cleric getting a single heal off, which is pure madness.<br>
<br>
<br>
You could gamble on the cleric not having root memed, and use Flaming sword of Xuzl. (ok so that's 700 mana you're going to be wanting later on, but why not)<br>
<br>
This can cause problems, but it's really an expensive spell to cast, and if your pet does get rooted that's a lot of mana wasted.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, I hear you mentionning rain spells. Well that's all cool, especially if the cleric has a slow computer and graphics turned on max, and is too lagged out to move and gets hit 3x for full while you DD, okay, but once again, real lack of any sort of skill from that cleric.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Only way of killing a cleric with a wiz solo:<br>
<br>
-Cleric is unbuffed (highly improbable)<br>
-You sunstrike (Assume hit for full 1017)<br>
-Ice spear (assume hit for 756 I think) /bye -or- Lure<br>
This also pretty much assumes the cleric doesnùt have good resistances.<br>
<br>
<br>
In either case, if the cleric has good reflexes, she can DB/DA before your second DD lands, and you can't do anything except gate.<br>

I've heard way too many times that melees in general can easily defeat casters at 50+, obviously this was not the case when the nerf was implemented and since things have changed a lot since then the balance is now toward the melee side while casters are somewhat underpowered against them.  <br>
<br>
As to what this would do to pure caster battles, it would probably make things more of who got the first spell off, but it's pretty much like that now, I don't think casters in general would complain about gaining more power to their spells as it wouldn't change the balance much between the different casters (except for maybe giving wizards more of the edge they need), and it would be very benificial against melees. <p>--------------------<BR>

It it common for high level players (40-60) on PvP servers to have Resists in the 150-200 range&quot;<br>
<br>
The reason spell damage was nerfed in PvP had nothing to do with resists, it had to do with HPs. Spells were balanced for use against NPCs, who have far more hitpoints than a PC of the same level.  Spell damage was reduced in PvP because PvP targets have a much fewer hp per level than NPCs. Nothing in the expansions has changed this significantly, the gap between hp totals of NPC and PC has actually grown wider. NPCs in the expansions have way more hps than mobs of comparable level pre-expansion, while player hp totals have not seen a comparable increase.<br>
<br>
Yes, a well equipped player will have higher resists than many NPCs of the same level. To compensate for this, resist reducing spells were improved by 50% when used in PvP. Not every class can cast these spells, but you can always group with someone who can.  Remember that pvp like pve is balanced for group combat not solo. In PvE at high levels wizards must use lures and are dependent on resist debuffing classes to be effective, why should this be different in PvP?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;At high level pvp, as a wizard with 2.5 years of pvp experience, there is very little I cast besides Lures and Shock of Lightning.&quot;<br>
<br>
So most of your spells are not effective unless the target is resist debuffed, every class has this problem at higher levels.  Not every class gets resist debuffs, and those that do not are increasingly dependent on those that do as they level up.  You knew that wizards didn't have resist debuffs from the beginning, just like every cleric and hybrid knows that, the difference is your class has spells specifically designed to alleviate this problem (lures) where they do not.  Cleric and hybrid spells are TOTALLY ineffective at higher level without resist debuffs from a groupmate.<br>
<br>
If you think wizards should get some sort of resistance debuff spell, thats a valid point which I would probably support.  If you want to rebalance the way spell damage and resists work for everyone because you'd rather solo than group with a mage/ench/shaman who can reduce resists for you, I would not agree with that.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Are my Roots supposed to be worthless? <br>
Are my snares not supposed to ever land? <br>
Are my Clash spells supposed to be a waste?&quot;<br>
<br>
Any spell that can stop or slow the movement of a target SHOULD be relatively easy to resist. If they weren't this would tip the balance heavily against melee classes who have no way of causing damage when they can't keep up with their target.  Again, when a target has been resist debuffed these spells are much more effective, and again if you choose to solo rather than group you will find these spells much less effective.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;resists are completely out of control&quot; <br>
many classes can reduce resists, if yours can't then group with one that can<br>
<br>
&quot;wizards are the most DD dependant and least able to debuff&quot; <br>
see above<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Pet HP wasnt nerfed. <br>
Melee AC/HP/ATK/DEF wasnt nerfed. <br>
Heal Spells were not nerfed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Melee damage is a valid issue, which I'll deal with in a moment, the others have little to do with reduced spell damage and the reason behind it.  It just sounds like you're saying &quot;you nerfed me so you must nerf everyone else&quot;. I know I sound like a broken record, but this argument must be kept in the context of the issue being addressed by the damage nerf, that issue is: NPCS HAVE MORE HP THAN PCS.<br>
<br>
Spell damage is balanced vs NPC HP totals not vs PCs.<br>
Heals are already balanced for PC HP totals.<br>
Reducing PC and pet HP totals would aggravate the problem rather than solve it.<br>
<br>
As for melee damage, on the surface it seems like a fair argument that if spell damage is reduced against players, melee damage should be reduced by a similar proportion.  In my opinion, what makes this unnecessary are additional factors which make PvP combat more difficult for melee classes yet do not affect spellcasters.  In melee combat vs a NPC your target is nice enough to stand directly in front of you so you can hit it.  Landing melee attacks on a player target requires the additional effort of constantly chasing to keep them in melee range long enough to land a few hits, add to that graphics glitches (dissapearing on hillsides for example) that make this even more difficult than it should be.  For a spellcaster, PvP combat is essentially the same tactically as PvE combat, easier in fact since your opponent is not on auto-follow and you are not restricted by line of sight.  The fact that a melee must chase the target between melee attacks, jousting instead of standing still with auto-attack turned on, is a de facto melee damage nerf at least as great as the 1/3 reduction on spell damage.  The time spent chasing a PC would be used making additional attacks against an NPCs, leading to a higher damage output.<br>
<br>
Yes, Kunark and Velious resist items have increased resists making things harder for casters. They have also dramatically increased AC making things more difficult for melees.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;if you are not going to remove the spell damage cap, then please at least be decent enough to similarly nerf the mana cost of the spell&quot;<br>
<br>
This defeats the entire purpose of the spell damage nerf.  Whats the point of reducing damage per spell against weaker targets (PCs) if the caster can inflict the same total damage per bar of mana?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;[staff of temperate flux] currently reduces FIRE and COLD by SIX&quot;<br>
<br>
isn't it 9 now with the 50% resist debuff bonus? =)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Shouldnt the most mana-dependent, DD dependent caster be able to debuff?&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe. But adding a debuff to wizards and overhauling the entire pvp balance just to suit you as a solo wizard is a bit different.<br>

While melees have to joust, chase targets and use right click items to keep in the game, casters have to do the same thing.  if I played a wizard and just stood there casting nukes, a melee would beat me to death no problem, you seem to understand that melees have to keep chasing casters around, this is obviously because the casters need to run around and try to stay away from the melees!  This is not the same as PvE, you have to buy yourself enough time to get spells off before that melee runs up and interrupts your casting while dropping your hp bar.  In PvE your target would be rooted, snared or taunted by a tank so you don't have to worry about them meleeing against you, in PvP you can't land snares or roots and theres no way a melee is going to target another melee before a caster.  The bottom line is that in high level pvp melees are far more effective at killing casters than casters are at killing melees, this would be less true if spell damage were restored to full power. <p>--------------------<BR>
