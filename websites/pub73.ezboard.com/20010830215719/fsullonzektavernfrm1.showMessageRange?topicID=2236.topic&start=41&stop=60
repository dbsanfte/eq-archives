<br>
No questions, just a comment:  The way that works currently is extremely stupid.  It rewards those that blow mind-numbing hours into killing a mob based on the same AI a level 1 mob was, as opposed to rewarding those that were creative and spent their time gathering the necessary gear and developing strategies for defeating various classes.  It makes levels the end-all of PvP.  It won't change, but I think it should, and pointing out the obvious isn't going to stop me from saying that the current system leaves vast room for improvement.<br>
<br>
&quot;not a single person addressed having to let a PC get back to 51% health, if they had just finished killing a mob.&quot;<br>
<br>
Write the system so that works off PvP damage and current health, as opposed to both PvE and PvP damage, and full health.<br>
<br>
&quot;not a single person addressed having a shaman canabalize 51% of his own health, and the consequences of killing him then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Program it to ignore damage done to himself by himself.<br>

<br>
I didn't clarify enough, I suppose:  It isn't stupid of Verant to abuse its player-base in any way they can to gain cash; it is a stupid system.  It emphasizes wasted, mind-numbing time on an activity that requires little to no skill, and offers very little to those that value skill, tactics, and planning out the most efficient use of your available gear to boost your stats.<br>

This code is already present in the game, so this would not be a problem.  Have you ever been in a group fighting at the giant fort in FM when some lame kiting dr00d shows up with his 3/4ths dead giant and starts /yelling for help?  Have you been in the situation where your group doesn't act fast enough to save that druid and he ends up taking a dirtnap courtesy of one angry beat-up giant?  Has your group ever finished the kill after that?<br>
<br>
The code is there so that you can get XP/looting rights from a mob regardless of what its starting HP is, be it full or .00001%.  Since you drop off the hate list when you zone (and I'd assume your other traits go with that - total damage done, current hate, etc.) I believe the way they calculate it for mobs currently is:<br>
<br>
1) Group all people on the hate list based upon in-game groupings (ie. if Player1 and Player2 were in the same group, and both on the hate list, then their damage totals are combined)<br>
2) Compare total damage tallies from all groups represented on the hate list.<br>
3) Provide XP/looting rights to the group with the highest damage tally<br>
<br>
<br>
This system would work fine for PvP calculations as well.  It would just mean quite a bit of extra effort in adapting the code, as well as significant system requirements (as I addressed before), but it's not a new approach that would require coding from scratch.<br>
<br>
Digits<br>
<br>
ps.  this is why in a multi-group situation attacking a single mob, if team-members die, the group that did the most damage doesn't necessarily get the kill.  This is because the group loses the damage tally from everyone who died, and are only credited for the damage done by the people left standing....and as we all know, if you're doing the most damage to a mob, there's a good chance you won't be standing when that mob falls :P<br>

It would be possible to do this only for PVP deaths but there are so many ways to get killed by indirectly through PVP that it could be easily exploited and  as such would probably have to apply to all deaths.  The problem with this is that you would still have to leave a corpse, for PVE reasons so you could get a res and for PVP reasons so your corpse could be looted for coin and insignia.  I don't know how tough this would be to do but if you wanted to eliminate CRs this would do it.  I also agree with the XP gain from PVP thing but I guess that will have to wait for SB. <p>--------------------<BR>

I seriously don't understand you people.<br>
<br>
When Verant opened up Sullon Zek, even before it opened for that matter, they stated that there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WOULD BE NO PLAY NICE POLICY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  They stated that aside from rules on foul language, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> THERE WOULD BE NO RULES</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Now, knowing that was the case, why in the fuck are you:<br>
<br>
a.)  Complaining about there being no rules<br>
b.)  Asking for rules to be made<br>
c.)  Asking for a rewrite of the system that was clearly stated<br>
<br>
That's my point.  I have read your posts, I understand what your points are.  You aren't understanding mine, or Verant's.  They were quite clear in what this server was going to be, and yet you people still act like all this stuff is some shocking blow.  Every single day there's another post about &quot;lame&quot; tactics and how people are &quot;exploiting the rules,&quot; when the simple fact, once again, is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> there are no rules</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Do everyone a favor, read that a few times, actually let it sink in, and then get on with your lives.  If you don't like how the server works, it's simple.. don't play on the server.  If you don't like item loot, you don't play on Rallos.  If you don't like crossteaming, you don't play on T/VZ.  If you don't like not having rules, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> don't play on Sullon</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!<br>

<br>
If you ever have played a monk, you know that you can train two mobs on eachother, (sarnak and gob in LOIO) let them beat eachother up, and then when the sarnak kills the gob, you immediately pop up out of FD and kill the sarnak, even if it only takes one hit to kill it, you still get full exp, because the agro was stopped by the sarnak killing the gob.  When agro is erased, the system resets at the mobs CURRENT hps, and gains as the mob gains in health.   If you try to kill the sarnak while he is still fighting the gob, you will find yourself fighting two mobs, and will also find that you will only get exp on one of the two kills, the last one.  <br>
<br>
IF mobs are still fighting eachother, you have to do TWO things to get the kill, over 51% dmg, AND the kill shot.  (I used to do this with my druid, training giants-captain especially, from the giant fort in East Wastes, over to the dwarfs, I would unload enough DD's on it to get it to half health, then train him over the dwarfs and let them do the other half of dmg, then would save enough mana to get the kill shot, viola, I get the exp).  But, if agro with the two mobs has been cleared (including the agro on yourself--ie, FD), by one of them dying, then agro is reset REGARDLESS of the health of the mob, and you only need to kill it regardless of its health to get the exp. <br>
<br>
In other words, you DONT have to wait till a mob gets back up to 51% health to get exp on the kill, so WHY would you have to wait for a PC to get back up to 51%.  <br>

Kulden your damn right just because theres no rules your supposed to accept it. Some of us came here because there are no rules and not because it's just a new server. Accept it and deal with it.<br>

Look you little prissy-assed, cum-guzzling son of a bitch she-male. THIS FUCKING SERVER IS NOT &quot;No rules&quot; THIS SERVER IS PLAYER GOVERNED YOU ASSMUNCHER. Learn the god dammed mother fucking difference you piss-faced bastard. If your faggot ass wants to stay in Tranvestite Nex that's your fucking problem, but don't post stupid ass shit. Since this fucking server is &quot;No rules&quot; what if someone used a time hack to speed up the time on your corpse by oh say, 6 days and 23 hours? Without your fucking ass knowing it. What if all your gay assed equip got lost because of a hack? OH FUCKING WELL, IT&quot;S A &quot;No Rules&quot; SERVER ISN&quot;T IT? DON&quot;T WHINE BITCH, TAKE IT LIKE A MAN. THAT'S WHY YOU CAME TO THIS SERVER RIGHT? CAUSE IT'S NO RULES??<br>

I already adressed the fact that this is NOT a &quot;no rules server&quot;.  And that technical issues such as Zone Plugging and higher levels weakening lower levels to cause intended exp loss are not incorperated in the Vision(TM).<br>
<br>
I spoke with a GM about zone plugging and the higher level weakening lower level syndrome, and he explained to me in detail that these were NOT intended but it would be VERY difficult for Verant to combat this.<br>
<br>
Why do people get suspended / banned every day for cursing and using speed hacks?  because they are technical issues.  This is NOT a &quot;No rules server&quot; and the next time your pansy ass comes and says some stupid shit about it being a &quot;No rules server&quot; Arcanist, i'm going to track you down...quote from Kuai &quot;watch yo back, cause you might get pked in RL negro&quot; (sorry, but when i read that, i DID feel compelled to ask him to stop using the word &quot;negro&quot; but at the same time, the comment was HALARIOUS). <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

<br>
  I really don't know that there's any way to keep XP loss in the game, AND prevent this kind of stuff from happening though.  <br>
<br>
   Aside from the fact that Verant's stated there are technical limitations, I kinda like PvP w/o the aggregate damage thing.  When you're hunting with a group, it's nice for people who spend the whole fight rooting &amp; blinding your opponent to have a chance at an insignia too, instead of just the rogue or whatever.<br>

<br>
But for the love of God Verant, lower the exp loss on PvP!!!!!!<br>
<br>
No no wait...we can't allow that.  That would actually result in a TOTALLY unbalanced system, where if you were killed by a PC, you wouldn't have to spend 10+ hours regaining your exp at 55+.  And it wouldn't go along with the Vision(TM) of course... <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on any PvP server.<br>

that looks to be about as close to 'no rules' as you can get.<br>

<br>
you know that hacking has no relation what so ever, with rules on Sullon.  Hacking is illegal on every server, the same with the language.<br>
<br>
if you go back to your blue server quietly, i promise we will do are best to forget about you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uarcanist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arcanist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/9/01 5:20:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Getting a high level to weaken, and then a lower level k</span><hr size=1> Matrim, your whole issue seems to revolve around the &quot;killshot&quot; thing, which not only has Verant stated that they're aware of, but that they also cannot fix it (or that it would require too much in the way of resources to fix).  So long as the killshot is all that counts, this &quot;problem&quot; is going to exist, and bitching about it is totally fucking pointless.  Consider it part of the server, grow a pair, and deal with it.<br>
<br>
In fact, I think that should be prominently displayed across your screen like the &quot;YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED&quot; message when you select Sullon.  &quot;DEAL WITH IT.&quot;  That would perhaps make the message a bit clearer for some people.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I think it'd be sweet if they coded it so whoever does the most damage gets the kill, but they said it isn't going to happen.  And you know what?  I read that, I said, &quot;Self, it's not going to happen.&quot;  Then me, myself, and I processed that (it took all of 1/4 second maybe), and since then I haven't given it another thought.  It's a Fact of Sullon, much like a Fact of Life (but not like that fatty Trudie{y?}).<br>
<br>
It just doesn't get much clearer.  I will in fact leave your thread now, because I would be as stupid as some of you are to stay here and argue about the obvious.  It's a bit disconcerting that I should even have to.<br>
<br>
Done.<br>
