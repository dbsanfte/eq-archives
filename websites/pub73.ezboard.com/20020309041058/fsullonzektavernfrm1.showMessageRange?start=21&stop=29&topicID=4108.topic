<br>
&quot;Also I will make a personal statement and say that anyone who decides to stay on PvP servers and then buy Sol expansion is pretty much retarded.&quot;<br>
<br>
Really Rallas?<br>
<br>
This summer I spent about $100 on WWII Online and AO. These were new games which showed some promise.<br>
<br>
Pardon me if I don't go running out to buy the next post-Beta offering.<br>
<br>
Right now EQ is functional. It has problems...but it works. It has had 3 years of development. The game you are jumping into may not even work by the end of the week as the servers grind under the stress of 100,000 players.<br>
<br>
1. PvP is not balanced from all reports.<br>
<br>
2. PvP is optional. Good luck getting anyone to fight.<br>
<br>
3. Every report from someone who played a lot of Beta is that the game is BORING. (And anyone from EQ saying another game is boring is enough for me.)<br>
<br>
4. Bugs. There's going to be a lot of them that they find.<br>
<br>
I WANT DAoC to be good. Believe me. I would really love to tell Verant to blow me. But after my experiences this summer the right answer for me is to wait about 6 months and see how the game develops and how many of you fanboys come crawling back to EQ. If the game gets two thumbs up, then I'll come play. Call that retarded if you like. I call it prudent. With limited gaming time I don't feel like wasting it on an unproven product. I tried that and got burned.<br>
<br>
Verant isn't stupid. They're releasing SoL about 2 months after DAoC. By then those that don't like DAoC will be back. For now I'm going to stick with EQ. I'll have fun here and the rest of you can have fun in DAoC. That's what it is all about anyway. <p><br><center><font size = 4><font color=yellow><b>"Aces high, Baby...and you just drew the Death Card!"<b></font><br><center><font size = 2><font color=red><b>"A slap is just a hug that stings."<b></font><br><EMBED src="http://www.tallondirectorate.com/Toten9.swf" quality=high loop=true WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=100 TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"> </EMBED></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uharpeyes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>harpeyes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/10/01 8:28:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4108.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: </span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;1. PvP is not balanced from all reports.<br>
<br>
Odd - we read different reports - most people who have actually *played* DAoC think PvP is pretty well balanced - the comments you may be referring to are possibly from an early Beta (for example melees can now get a damn chance at a ranged attacker) - but solo PvP aint gonna work too well....take some friends.<br>
<br>
No training ..... no wonder DBC aren't going - yipee :-)  It is skills and tactics time....<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;2. PvP is optional. Good luck getting anyone to fight.<br>
<br>
Not really optional - it is just there are areas that are a lot harder for PvPers to get to - and no teleports mean no ganking wizzies bound in the newbies areas<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;3. Every report from someone who played a lot of Beta is <br>
&gt;&gt;that the game is BORING. (And anyone from EQ saying <br>
&gt;&gt;another game is boring is enough for me.)<br>
<br>
Again differing reports - most people say it is the same mob drawl that EQ is, except it has: fun quests, different options for levelling (beyond mobs), better tradeskills, better gameplay, etc<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;4. Bugs. There's going to be a lot of them that they find.<br>
<br>
Yep - theres gonna be bugs. There isn't a piece of softawre on sale that doesn't have bugs. Most opinion is that the bugs that still exists are pretty minor in comparison to EQ's current list - and as you say EQ has had 3 years of development.<br>
<br>
<br>
After all is done, said, and flamed....people will play DAoC and they will make their own decisions. So if you want to try it - don't let the EQ flamers deter you. If you don't want to try it then wait around and see if you hear good things.<br>
<br>
So far the most positive aspect of DAoC to me seems to be that all the 'assholes' want to stay on SZ and the better players are going DAoC .....and after all the important part of any online game is the quality of the people playing it.<br>

Anyone remember EQ's launch? lol<br>

And 2 years to take out hybrid exp penalty? 2 years to be able to buy stacks of things from vendors? <br>

<br>
I would say the important part of any online game is that it is fun to play. I played with a lot of quality people on AO and it still sucked. <br>
<br>
All I have ever said is go have fun. Just don't call me a retard for staying with EQ.<br>
<br>
I WILL go try and play DAoC after you all post-Beta test it for a few months for me. Is there something wrong with that concept? Are you upset that people just aren't flocking to DAoC like you? If it doesn't matter to you why the hell are you still posting on this board?<br>
<br>
By the way, every single post I've made I have made it clear that I have not played the game. You obviously don't read as much as I do because most reports indicate RvR is totally fucked up. That's all I ever said. REPORTS indicate...not PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. If you want to lay $45 on the table to try something out more power to you. As I stated in my post above, I did that twice this summer and got burned.<br>
<br>
I could give a shit what game you play. Go play DAoC if you like...in my case I'll be a little more prudent and wait until the game is out for a while. If you find some flaw in that then I have some bridge property I need to sell.<br>
<br>
It's all about having fun. If you want to have fun there...go ahead.
