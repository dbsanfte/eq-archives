           Cherrish wandered the lonely streets of her beloved home, the night washing the colors and sounds away.  She was distressed about her Surname again.  The seasons passed, as they are wont to do, the snows melting and the leaves falling.  All her friends had their Surnames, passed down from Father to Son, Mother to Daughter.. or chosen for what that person resembled.  Cherrish had no one to pass down a name to her, she did not know what she should do….<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ~Months later~<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Come my children, come listen to a tale.  A tale of a woman-child, a woman with no past, no family, no name. Of how she searched for her identity. The tale is mine, and of my search for a Surname.”  Cherrish beckoned to the children, sitting on a stone near the waterfall of her grotto, she smiled at the young ones.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “The day was like any other day before it. I hunted the lands of the Kunark realm with my friends. Ninnin had taken us to new lands that day, and new threats were met and defeated before our weapons and magic’s.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We journeyed on an on, looking for a good place for camp, when the clouds began to roll in, and the wind started to howl.  Rain fell, soaking our hair, plastering our clothing to our bodies.  Akturus complained of rust on his blacked armor loudly. I smiled at him, chiding him for being vain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I can recall turning from Akturus, a smile on my lips, as a band of goblins fell on Mezz.  His warning cut short as a nasty goblin warrior’s sword ripped threw his tan robes, the crimson stain of his lifeblood spreading in the rain-soaked clothing. As the light faded in his eyes, Jerhalan and Akturus jumped forward, their swift blades dealing damage and revenge.  Ninnin raised his arms, chanting and reciting his spells, blue crackling light spread around the goblins, slowing them.  I called up the power of the ground, roots and grasses clinging to one particularly violent goblin warlord.  Jerhalan had many goblins on him, their tiny swords and daggers taking their toll on him.  I sent my healing arts into his body, but my magic was exhausted before he could slay more than two.  With his last ounce of strength, he bravely raised his mighty sword above his head, and cleaved the goblin warrior’s head from his body.  He turned, his hands losing strength, his sword tumbling to the muddy grass.  He slumped forward, the light in his eyes faded.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Akturus had charged valiantly into battle, his magic and sword finding targets easily, he carved his way to the goblin Warlord.  His wounds numerous, but ignored, he sought his enemy, and deterred not.  I had two on me, and therefore could not concentrate to regain my magic.  Ninnin came to my rescue, his magic sending them to the ground, legs melded into the ground.  I backed away, trying to concentrate to keep those of us alive, alive.  A piercing cry broke my concentration, and as I looked up I saw Akturus, bleeding from his brow, his armor rent and dented, he called out to his god, calling up the power that only a Knight of the Shadows possesses.  He touched the goblin Warlord as he sank to his knees, the power flowing from his hands, into the goblin, and as Akturus fell, he grimly brought down his enemy with him. <br>
<br>
         The goblins left gathered, their target Ninnin, he sent his magical forces into their bodies, killing many, but he was soon swarmed under, and his eyes too faded and dimmed.  I stood alone…<br>
<br>
          I looked at Ninnin, his body bloody, his hand reaching out… and I went berserk.  My hammer crushed skulls, arms, and legs. Anything that I could reach, I vent my rage and hurt out on those viscous goblins.  When I regained control of my mind, they lay dead at my feet.  My hands were numb, my hammer had fallen from my grasp, and I found myself on my knees cradling Ninnin’s head in my lap, tears rolled down my cheeks, mingling with the rain.  I was frustrated, confused, angry.. I had to do something!<br>
<br>
         I used my gift, my mind… I sent it forth, looking for what was Ninnin, his essence, his soul, his spirit.  I was determined to find it and bring him back.  I found his soul; it was confused, and lost.  I called to it, urging it back to his lifeless form, I called and it came…  And when I opened my eyes, Ninnin’s crimson eyes looked back at me, filled with his soul.  I had called his soul back, he was weak and hurt, but alive….  I was the Soul Caller…”  <br>
