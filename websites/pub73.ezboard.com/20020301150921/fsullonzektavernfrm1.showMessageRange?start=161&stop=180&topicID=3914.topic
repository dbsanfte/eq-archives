You know very well that one persons freedom to swing his fist is impinged by the proximity of anothers face.  If you were playing a single player game, of course someone would be an ass for asking you to respect the way they wanted you to play the game.  The issue is MUCH less clear in a multiplayer game.<br>
<br>
Note also that DB people are at least as likely as anyone else on this board to dictate to others how they should play the game, and if we don't want to play their way we can &quot;get the fuck off their server!&quot;.<br>
<br>
All,<br>
<br>
For all those using sport analogies, why is a high school or professional coach considered an asshole for running up the score on another team?  Note: There is always a chance that the other team could come back, so to maximize your chances of winning, you should ALWAYS run up the score as much as possible.  <br>
<br>
The typical &quot;if you don't like the rules get off the server&quot; response holds zero water.  If there was a continuum of rule sets encompassing every possible combination of rules this would make sense.  In fact, SZ is very different then existing servers on a number of dimensions (hard coded teams, no level limits, a point system, xp loss).  It is perfectly natural that some of us would prefer SZ over any other server, but still not be perfectly happy with the environment here, and seek to change it to one we prefered.<br>

What possible dry, shriveled twitch could it give you to win, AT A GAME, dishonorably? <br>
<br>
You clearly have misunderstood.<br>
<br>
You CANNOT play a game dishonorably.<br>
<br>
The only thing dishonorable is cheating, and if you're cheating then you're not really playing.  *tweet* 10 yard penalty, repeat first down.  Tackling you when you are not ready is not dishonorable.  Tackling you from behind is not dishonorable.  Faking a handoff is not dishonorable.  Attacking you when you are engaged with a sarnak is not dishonorable.<br>
<br>
It's just part of the game.<br>
<br>
You are telling me that it's dishonorable to do things that give me an advantage.  I am telling you that we should play poker for money one day, because I would love to win all your cash like this.  Whoa, you can't see my bet and raise by $10 when all you're holding is a hand of crap!  That would make me think you have a good hand, and I might fold, and that would be /dishonorable/ of you!<br>
<br>
And, um, winning IS fun.  If I can play by the same rules you're playing by, and win, that's fun.  If I lose and learn something, that's fun too.  If I have to back off and let you have a fair chance, then we're not really playing the game.  I might do that with my 5 year old nephew here and there, but I won't do it for you.  Why should I?<br>
<br>
At any rate, your comparison to World War II is absurd.  Beating someone in EQ is not comparable to shooting someone in the head with a P-51 Mustang.  The fact that you would even suggest the comparison makes me suspect you've lost all grip on reality.  Perhaps you should stop playing EQ for a while until you regain your ability to distinguish the difference between a game and real life.<br>
<br>
IMO, all games should be played as grand struggles.  The fun is in me pitting my best ability against yours.  There is a time and a place for holding back.  It's called &quot;practice&quot;.  I'm not running Everquest PvP Practice.<br>
<br>
Takish&gt; For all those using sport analogies, why is a high school or professional coach considered an asshole for running up the score on another team? <br>
<br>
A classic example of people who are playing &quot;for fun&quot;, meaning having a close battle, versus people who are playing &quot;for fun&quot;, meaning winning at a contest of skills between two teams.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, a coach who isn't allowed to keep playing and &quot;run up the score&quot; ought to just resign and forfeit the game.  If they're not going to let you play, then why did you bother going on the field?  Were you on the bleachers yelling for Michael Jordan to &quot;quit shooting so accurately&quot; because it wasn't fun to see the other team getting decimated?<br>
<br>
You shouldn't tell people to play a game, but pretend to suck, so that the other person can have their version of fun.  That's what telling a coach to not run up the score is doing.  &quot;Go out there on the field, but tell your boys to trip a lot and fumble and stuff, rather than actually play the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
IMO it's a piss poor coach who, seeing that his players are in the groove, executing good plays and winning, tells them to STOP playing well so the other team has a chance.  A coach should never tell his team to stop doing good.  If you're going to do that, just replace football with WWF wrestling, so the whole thing can be scripted and planned months in advance with an eye towards pleasing the crowd, rather than having any real competitions.<br>
<br>
I want EQ to be like pro football.  You want it to be like WWF wrestling.  We'll just have to agree to disagree on that.<br>
<br>
If I'm playing a game and losing horribly, I will:<br>
A) Resign, and tip my hat to the better player or<br>
B) Play through to the end, even if the score is 200-0, in the hopes that I can learn something valuable for next time.<br>
<br>
I will NEVER:<br>
C) Suggest the other player &quot;take it easy&quot; because I'm losing too bad and am not having sufficient fun.  The thought of someone saying that makes me laugh, that anyone could be that limp, and yet that's exactly what some of you are saying here.  I get the feeling your parents always let you win games as a child, and now that you're forced to play for real with other people who refuse to give you a fair chance to win, you're confused and upset.<br>
<br>
I'm always sorry to hear of people who have grown up with that idea, but it's just as well you get it out of your system now.  In multiplayer games, be they on a field or on a computer, you cannot expect strangers to curtail their own skills so that you feel like you have a chance.  If I played Michael Jordan at a game of basketball, I would be severely disappointed if he didn't make an extreme embarassment out of me, with a score of 800-2 in the first 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, you'd be begging him to miss shots, slow down, don't block, etc.  You might as well be playing someone else.<br>

<br>
It's still perfectly lucid from my lil' window.  This game doesn't hurt you in real life, and therefore you've no right to tell me how to play; live with it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Note also that DB people are at least as likely as anyone else on this board to dictate to others how they should play the game, and if we don't want to play their way we can &quot;get the fuck off their server!&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;get the fuck off our server&quot; responses tend to be in response to attempts to tell us how to play, or &quot;whining,&quot; rather than an honest spiel about how you should or shouldn't play.<br>
<br>
Play however you want.  Just don't tell me how to play.<br>
<br>
&quot;The typical &quot;if you don't like the rules get off the server&quot; response holds zero water.

Tough luck.  You aren't going to tell me how to play, and I don't care what sort of environment you want it changed to.<br>

The totality of the war was your justification; the model demonstrates why this doesn't happen in a total environment.  The stakes are in a sense irrelevant.<br>
<br>
The fact that I hedged this analogy with an acknowledgement that an analogy is not a proof takes the air out of your little &quot;Dude, get a grip on reality&quot; routine.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you seem to argue exclusively in analogies.  EQ is not an extremely abstracted hour long game between 2 players.<br>
<br>
In chess, winning IS the fun, and there is no way to be underhanded.  You seem to understand this capably.  Transferring this logic to EQ makes no sense.  <br>
<br>
1.  You can't challenge a guy to a game of chess while a drake is kicking his ass at a different game of chess.<br>
<br>
2.  You can't train Gary Kasparov on to a guy because he's a better chess player.<br>
<br>
3.  After you beat a guy at chess, you can't prevent him from playing chess for 48 hours.<br>
<br>
For heaven's sake, don't try and take this to mean that I'm some kind of anti-PK fanatic that jousts windmills.  But the analogy between EQ PvP and certain games is extremely loose; quite apart from the fact that analogies are inherently weak arguements.<br>
<br>
If the larger guilds played in the way the Shanks of VZ, the Iggles, etc, do, PVP would be better.  Not softer, or carebear, just less idiotic.  You win, you win.  You lose, you get your corpse and fuck off for a while.  You come back and violate a good CR, you don't get another CR, and things &quot;hardcore&quot; in that situation alone.<br>
<br>
You're saying &quot;it's a hardcore ruleset, play by it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm saying Verant has not made the &quot;war&quot; server some people think it has.  You seem to be saying that abolishing CRs and endorsing CCing in all cases, the server gets it's natural and ideal state. <br>
<br>
It isn't that I'm  unaware of how to do a CR on SZ when certain people corpse me up.  Read a book, yada yada.<br>
<br>
You do a simple deal between the biggest guilds that people will CR, and boom.  CCers and the CCed don't get bored.  Isn't EQ boring enough?<br>
<br>
(For those who'll say &quot;Enforced downtime is a penalty of death in enemy territory, this is a good thing, please consider the downtime of the corpse campers.  Except in certain cases, there is a lot of time wasted by all parties.)<br>

<br>
Every single pro football coach tries to avoid running up the score late in the game.  Thus I am not wanting EQ played like the WWF, but in fact like pro football.  Sure there are blowouts in pro football, but this wasn't because the quaterback was throwing the ball long late in the game, but due to some second stringers making great plays, or a game that got out of hand early on.  <br>
<br>
Here are two very simple facts:<br>
<br>
1) We all have different preferences.<br>
<br>
2) Your playstyle affects others experience.  Note: not out RL experience, but our enjoyment of the game.<br>
<br>
We all recognize 1 and 2.  One way we can react to this is say, &quot;I don't give a shit about anyone else's EQ enjoyment, but my own (or maybe my guildmates), thus other's preferences will have no effect on how I play the game.&quot;  I happen to think a more mature reaction is: &quot;I won't act exactly as others want me to, but am willing to sacrifice a little of my own enjoyment for the enjoyment of others.&quot;<br>
<br>
For example, maybe it would maximize your own enjoyment to camp someone's corpse until it rots.  Some people would like you to attempt this, but others may find the prospect of corpse rot pretty horrible.  Now if you know you are dealing with someone who finds this treatment distinctly unfun, you can A) ignore their preferences or B) camp their corpse less then you would find maximizes your own enjoyment.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't see why compromise is such an aweful thing.<br>
<br>
Here's one final example.  Gruples likes to play to win, and will use any legal means to do so.  He is happy to utterly crush his opponents if he has the skill to.  Assume Grumples knows he is playing against someone who really isn't all the competitive, perhaps someone who is just out to get a little exercise, or maybe someone who is past their prime and doesn't want this fact shoved in their face.  Knowing this, isn't it extremely self centered of Grumples to then utterly crush his opponent?<br>

I do care about the gaming experience of other players.<br>
<br>
To prove this, I selected a server that suited me:  Sullon Zek, the closest thing Everquest has to a no rules server.<br>
<br>
If you selected this server as well, you took your own risk, and it's in no way my responsibility to make the game fun for you.<br>

<br>
It is becoming increasingly clear to me that you choose to twist the words of others, set up a straw man, and beat it down, rather then respond to the obvious intent of the words.  This makes debating you somewhat frustrating and certainly pointless.  Here are a couple examples from page nine of this thread (you do it so frequently I need not search far)<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;Please, try to state why it is good to be the least pleasant you can within the rules?&quot;<br>
<br>
Please, try and grasp the concept that I think bind-camping, de-leveling, CC&quot;ing, and the risk of corpse-rot make this server all the more interesting and exciting, and all the more fun for myself. I don't view them as unpleasant, and therefore can't apply your comment to my actions.<br>
Agrul&quot;<br>
<br>
Now it is very clear to me, and I would guess to you, that the original poster meant why do what is least pleasant to the person being corpse camped, so that the preferences of the person doing the camping are irrelevant in relation to this statement.  Thus, the statement can easily be applied to your actions (or the actions of your guildmates), depsite the fact that you like the risk of corpse-rot.<br>
 <br>
&quot;&quot;You know very well that one persons freedom to swing his fist is impinged by the proximity of anothers face. If you were playing a single player game, of course someone would be an ass for asking you to respect the way they wanted you to play the game. The issue is MUCH less clear in a multiplayer game.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's still perfectly lucid from my lil' window. This game doesn't hurt you in real life, and therefore you've no right to tell me how to play; live with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am 99% sure that you know that this saying is rarely used to refer to actual violence.  Of course, I was not implying that someone corpse camping me in game is remotely like being punched in the face IRL. <br>
<br>
Here's an example of how exceedingly lame this straw man technique can be.  I know that you didn't mean your words above literally, but I could interpret them as such and score some easy debating points.  Often you say I either can't or don't have the right to tell you how to play the game.  Actually I have every right to tell you how to play the game (freedom of speech), you have every right not to listen.  But seriously what is the point of having a debate like that?<br>
<br>
Now I know you are intelligent enough to realize the actual intent, so why do you not respond to the intent? <p>Takish <BR>Dwarven Warrior<BR>Khin tells you: Are you high or something?</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ukansascn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kansas CN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/6/01 10:02:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3914.topic&index=174>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IE Defeats DB &amp; TDC, Ruin monk comments on PvP and D</span><hr size=1> Maybe when Agrul's guild washed up he realized they were failures and underachievers to say the least.

It's the mututal pointlessness of a random CC that makes it so silly.  If I get CCed I'll log off for an hour or two, min.  Which means CCer(s) sit(s) at my corpse for an hour patiently spamming the /who to see if I come into zone.  And I don't, and they leave.  Every CC I know of has ended this way if superior guild force didn't get the corpse right away.<br>
<br>
If it was somehow profitable to CC (apart from one instance which ransom was paid, and that certainly won't reoccur given subsequent events) it would make more sense to hold DBs position.<br>
<br>
As a mutually pointless behavior it doesn't make so much sense.  Let me stress again I'm not attacking anyone's &quot;right&quot; to do this.  <br>
<br>
I'm saying, why CC, ultimately?  One guy got ES Vambs and a few spells out of one spectacular CC, yeah.  And it's (typically) irritating to the victim in a big way, which makes it make some sense to CC in extraordinary situations.  Just randomly not granting corpse recovery on the basis of how hardkore you are doesn't have a rational motivation to it. <br>

The debate concerning &quot;why&quot; someone should / would corpse-camp a player is far too vague for me to respond to without expending more effort than I'm honestly willing to spend on this forum.<br>

Despite the trash talking he always gets and partakes in for &quot;not getting kills&quot; etc, I give him credit for his prolonged stays in OT; if that's a bard's forte, go for it I say.  In his position I would find that fun and rewarding.<br>
<br>
-<br>
<br>
What I mean is in general, un-necessary CCing should be discouraged by guilds.  This goes against a vague and irrational feeling by some players that a no-rules server means that any kind of social convention among players is &quot;gay restrictions on the no limit server.&quot;<br>
<br>
My contention is that this is just sloppy thinking.  Corpse-camping is boring and unproductive, especially the small scale chickenshit corpsecamping that happens at random for fairly short duration.  <br>
<br>
If DB fights with IE in an IE zone and wins, corpse-camping and zone guarding are part of the subsequent fight, that's understood.  Likewise, if DB comes to an IE zone and loses, it's understood that &quot;territorial&quot; feeling, guild dislike, and a desire to discourage similar raids in the future mean there won't be a speedy CR.  <br>
<br>
But in other cases where there is no special reason or bad blood, guilds should just let the loser CR on the understanding that if they fuck it up and don't scoot, we go back to the first scenario where CRs aren't given promptly.<br>
<br>
To a degree, this already happens.  I think it can easily be more widespread without making for &quot;pansification&quot; of SZ or whatever people are concerned about.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Edit: When I say DB and IE, I'm not making value judgements on those guilds.  You can substitute any 2 guilds that have bad-blood and cheerfully punish each other despite a slight cost)<br>
