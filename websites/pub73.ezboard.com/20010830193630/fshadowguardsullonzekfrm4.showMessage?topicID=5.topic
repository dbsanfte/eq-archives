On the contrary, energy seems to set up a near-audible hum and gold armor glints from beneath his cloak as bright green eyes survey the room speculatively, but without guile.<br>
<br>
Scanning the shadows, eyes never resting and making it difficult to tell what he does see and what remains hidden, the half elf moves to the bar, hoping for gypsy wine, but deciding that perhaps his favored refreshment may be too light-hearted for this hall...he settles for red.<br>
<br>
As he enters the room completely and stands at the bar, a graceful-necked lute is visible slung upon his back, a bulge at his right side reveals a pouch beneath his cloak. Turning from the bar, the bard looks again over the room, the odd mix of human and elvish features casting his age into question...eyes glinting with a hint of mischief could belong to a boy of twelve, but the crinkles around them belie that youth...<br>
<br>
Clearing his throat and raising his glass, the singer speaks, a voice hovering between tenor and baritone that wraps around his words with the trained timbre of a master singer. <br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings, Shadow Guard, lords and ladies of this hall. I thank you for your hospitality and this fine wine; a better vintage than I would have expected to be served to first-time guests.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taking an appreciative sip from his glass, he continues.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have heard your names voiced among another group...the Nefastus Deus, with whom I have recently, and quite by chance, come into contact. Your High Assassin quite caught my ear with verse and verbal artistry,&quot; he inclines his head respectfully, though not in any particular direction, &quot;that I am certain he mirrors in blood and blade. I have come to hear more, if there is more to be heard, and perhaps to share a song or two as well, should you wish it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Leaning back a bit and resting his elbow upon the bar, the musician smiles again, cradling the glass in his hand, oddly comfortable in the room...Perhaps his history among the Teir'dal in his own realm would offer sustenance here as well.<br>

To either side of the passage are lightstands pouring forth a mystical illumination that does not flicker like a torch.  At his passing, the lumes grow a good deal dimmer and the deep pools of shadow that he emerged from seem to follow him into the room.  One of the young serving girls immediately approaches, almost rushes to, him and drops into a low curtsey after quickly setting her tray on a table.  The Tall male is wearing a set of the most regal robes and appears to be one of very high position here at Shadow Keep.  He speaks, his words lost in the din of the room and the serving girl moves closer to speak in more hushed tones.  As she speaks she indicates the general direction of the newly arrived musician.  The Teir'Dal looks toward the Bard and his dully glowing eyes of crimson immediately lock onto the wanderer.<br>
<br>
Those sitting at the tables closest to the Half-Elf felt a palpable chill in the air with the attention he had drawn.  The Robed One dismisses the servant with a very slight motion of one hand and begins to make his way towards the table he had chosen.  As he comes closer those that had noticed the chill in the air become aware of an even more disturbing sensation.  This Tier'Dal brings with him a distinctive aura of doom that permeates the souls of those nearby.  He comes to a halt standing over the table occupied only by this Half-Elf musician and pauses for a long moment.<br>
<br>
While he is standing silently at his table, the bard takes a moment to examine him closer.  He takes special note of the Shadow Guard insignia embroidered on the left breast of his fine robes and the odd seal worn around his neck.<br>
<br>
"<i>Human</i>, I am told that you are a singer of songs and maker of music.  I see that you bear the instruments of one such person.  For a long time the Shadow Guard has had no use for your kind, but there have been changes in the world, shifts in divine power.  In all the centuries of my life, I have only fought those that made music that held magical properties.  The Priests and Priestesses of Innoruuk now tell me that the Father may have a use for your art."<br>
<br>
The Tall Teir'Dal looks about the immediate area and seems to come to a decision.  Before speaking again he pulls a chair out and seats himself at the table.<br>
<br>
"I am Krintek K'Kidrak, High Advisor to the Council of Shadow.  I would know from your own mouth just what it is that you can do to serve the purpose of the Shadow Guard, and why we should accept your kind here.  Tell me well and true, for your fate lies in the balance of this moment..."<br>
<br>
Lord K'Kidrak folded his hands onto the table before him and waited for the wanderer to speak. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#330000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ukeatslovesonnet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keats Lovesonnet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br> <font color=#ffffcc>(6/28/01 10:13:21 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Keats offers a bow </span><hr size=1> Inclining his head to the regal figure, Keats offers a courtly bow of respect before speaking. The aura of doom surrounding Lord K'Kidrak sends a brief shudder through his frame, but the bard quells it and assays a smile as he pulls out a chair to sit opposite the Shadow Guard lord.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well met, sir, and greetings from myself, if not from my League. There are indeed many changes taking place in the world at this time, but my offer is the same as any of my ancient tradition.&quot;<br>
<br>
At the lord's expectant silence, Keats continues.<br>
<br>
&quot;I personally come with a simple offer of entertainment and song, but I also come with another offer as well, though not of my own possession. I am not a follower of the darkness myself, as I am sure you have gathered, though I have lived with it, among its people, often enough in my time. A wanderer I am, from a far distant realm named for your own Prince; I cannot myself cross to your realm save through these halls where the barrier between worlds is a little thinner than elsewhere.<br>
<br>
&quot;The greater &quot;offer&quot; I had intended to extend to you is in the person of another young singer, an adopted cousin of mine, who shares my blood and my profession, though not my god, else I would not have considered suggesting him to you. Even now, I have begun to wonder whether he would be accepted...He is not of the Tier'dal, nor is he of Ogrish nor Trollish blood, and I have come under the impression that race means much to this company of darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;Young Nic is half elven, as am I, and has always had a stronger lust for the blood and excitement of combat than I have. He has sworn his allegiance to the Warlord, Rallos Zek...There is something about him that utterly discomfits me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sighing, Keats shrugs a bit and allows his guileless features slide into a charmingly helpless expression.<br>
<br>
&quot;Though I may not find his ways attractive, I have never sought to change him. I have always believed that following one's own instinct, for good or for evil, is the most perfect way of the world...Perhaps that is what has brought me friends fom all sides...&quot;<br>
<br>
The singer's voice drifts off slightly, seeming to fade into musing. Lord K'Kidrak looks sharply to the bard's eyes, senses alert for the possibility of magic being drawn, but sees nothing beyond the green of Keats' elven eyes. Shaking himself from his reverie, Keats smiles apologetically and continues.<br>
<br>
&quot;My apologies, Lord K'Kidrak; your face for a moment reminded me of...but you wouldn't know him. And it's been many years.<br>
<br>
&quot;In any case, you mentioned the possibility of desiring a musician for your hall. I have investigated as much as I have been allowed as a stranger, and have found this place...ah, most impressive indeed; I believe young Nic would also find it much to his liking and may be of use to the Shadow Guard through his journeyman years, perhaps once he leaves his apprenticeship, as I'm fairly certain he will not have learned enough to aid you until that time. He has heard of the Shadow Guard, Lord K'Kidrak, and is quite enamoured with the concepts upon which you base yourselves...reminds me of me, at his age.&quot;<br>
<br>
Grinning slightly, Keats concludes, &quot;But then, he might better be of service while not wearing the insignia of the Shadow Guard. I have known that path as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Taking a sip of his wine, the bard nods respectfully, having spoken his piece. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000033><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ukrintekkkidraksg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krintek KKidrak SG</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/skull15-2.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>High Advisor</span><br> <font color=#ffffcc>(6/28/01 12:37:59 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/Delf.jpg border=0></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Impressions</span><hr size=1> The High Advisor looked deeply into the Bard before him for a very long moment before he spoke again.  "Remind you of someone you once knew, do I?"  Krintek took estimate of the Humans years and asked, "Who might that be?  While 'many years' might be a lengthy amount of time to you, the passing of even decades is not nearly so long to the Teir'Dal."<br>
<br>
Without waiting for an answer, Krintek waved dismissively, and continued. "That can wait for the moment.  You speak very well for one of your race, and your perception exceeds that of your fellows.  I am impressed with you, Human, though I suppose what Elven blood runs through your veins helps in that respect.  It is unfortunate that you are not in your younger years, as you say this kinsman reminds you of yourself.  I would consider making use of the talents of a Human such as yourself.  As an ancient friend of mine used to say, 'Why kill the Lesser, when you can use them first?'"<br>
<br>
Krintek chuckled to himself at the remembrance of the Mage.<br>
<br>
"You further impress me with your attendance here at the Keep.  Few would come here in your situation, but your heart must be strong indeed.  And you bring with you word of one of your own, that is enamoured with the precepts of the Shadow Guard, eh?  I would most like to make contact with the young Nic that you speak of.  In these times of change, I would seek out those that have been fortold of by the Priests and Priestesses of Innoruuk.  One of the changes taking place is the new alignment of the Immortal Prince of Hatred with the Warlord.  Though it is still foreign to me, the Will of the Father demands that I view those worthy who follow the Warlord be considered as allies.  Nic <i>may</i> be one such person.  Go, Keats, find your cousin and bring him to us here at Shadow Keep.  He can learn more here than ever as an apprentice.  But I warn you..."<br>
<br>
Krintek leaned forward placing his face close to the Half-Elf's.<br>
<br>
"...bring Nic to us, and you may never see him again.  We will show him the true path to power and shape him to serve best, as I and all Shadow Guards do.  Even if you do ever meet him again, he will not be recognizable to you as the same person.  All that will befall him with us will be for his betterment, of that you can rest assured.  He will become more powerful than even he believes he can become.  Ponder well on this and do what you think is best for your kin."<br>
<br>
The High Advisor rose from his chair with that last and stood next to the table waiting to see if Keats had anything else to say before he took his leave. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#330000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/ukeatslovesonnet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keats Lovesonnet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Visitor</span><br> <font color=#ffffcc>(6/28/01 2:33:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Farewell...for now</span><hr size=1> Rising too from the table, Keats allowed himself a deep breath before replying. Lord K'Kidrak's words were smooth and carefully chosen...and, yes, surprising, though Keats hadn't know what to expect from such a meeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your consideraton means a great deal, and speaks well of the Tier'dal.&quot; Keats chuckled softly. &quot;Though the Tier'dal have always been well-received in my eyes. I understand that the boy will no longer be the one I know, though I admit I know him little enough as it is. My travels do not take me often to Qeynos.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling a bit, Keats nodded to himself and fixed his eyes upon those of the dark elven lord before him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your receptiveness asks something similar in my turn. You have answered my questions regarding Nic; I shall answer yours as well, and perhaps pay for my wine thusly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slipping the lute from his back, the singer plucked a few strings, tuning it swiftly and expertly. At a knife-like glance from Lord K'Kidrak, he raised a hand and shook his head, assuring him that no magic would be called forth--this was a song, not a Song. With an easy smile that had lulled many an audience in harsh, cold halls to lighter hearts, the bard's voice blended with the notes his lute sang.<br>
<br>
&quot;Long ago in the East Commonlands,<br>
A warrior stood, black blood on his hands,<br>
Calling forth challenge to all who would dare<br>
To face him that sundown in cool evening air.<br>
<br>
The tall human fighter of insolent pride<br>
Held dagger, and longbow, and claws by his side.<br>
A crowd of the dark elves from Neriak's gloom<br>
Surrounded this hothead to see to his doom.<br>
<br>
An unholy knight known as Ryltar Vrinn<br>
Stepped first to the human. Let combat begin!<br>
Slashes were traded, blood mingled in gore<br>
But when the dust settled, the elf was no more.<br>
<br>
A second Tier'dal met the human's cruel rage,<br>
With dagger in hand, Staelth d'Shiv crossed the stage.<br>
The death-dance that followed swirled both all around,<br>
But a blow from the human sent Staelth to the ground.<br>
<br>
The human in triumph roared insults and jeers.<br>
The mixed crowd combined condemnation and cheers,<br>
When a voice from the background cut noise like glass;<br>
The seething mob parted to let the man pass.<br>
<br>
A night-shadow walking, the ghost of death came<br>
Stalking the warrior, Guise d'Shiv was his name;<br>
Brother to Staelth and an Ebon Hand blade,<br>
He mockingly bowed as his challenge was made.<br>
<br>
The like of that battle has never been seen<br>
To equal the dance and the bloodied sweat's sheen<br>
Upon those two faces, one dark and one light,<br>
Attacking and dodging in encroaching night.<br>
<br>
The rogue's perfect balance, his effortless grace<br>
Brought bloodlust to twist the man's furious face.<br>
The human raged after this mocking invention,<br>
Til a voice from the audience drew his attention.<br>
<br>
Guise vanished at last, reappearing to turn<br>
And plunge his sharp dagger, its poison to burn<br>
And race through the blood of the human with glee.<br>
The warrior staggered and dropped to one knee.<br>
<br>
The blow insufficient, bleeding and battered<br>
The rogue could not dodge as the warrior scattered<br>
His last conscious thought to the winds of the land.<br>
The spectators wept for Guise's death at his hand.<br>
<br>
The warrior was thereafter put in his place<br>
By a dark knight named Sheldon defending his race.<br>
The warrior fell, but the watchers recall<br>
The valiant cadre of fighting Tier'dal.<br>
<br>
Sheldon and Ryltar, shadow knights proud<br>
The cold d'Shiv brothers who entranced the crowd...<br>
Though more wins went to the human in shame,<br>
It was not the human immortal in name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Setting his lute aside, the bard lifted his glass again, finishing his wine and taking a bow. He continued more quietly to Lord K'Kidrak.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was the first meeting of myself and the Assassins of Nektulos, a group of dark elves of my land who became as blood brothers to me after this duel. I quite nearly got involved with it myself, being somewhat sensitive to insults against dark elves, as my own liege within my guild of the Sigils is a Tier'dal warrior of Rallos Zek, by the name of Vaerun Breche...a man I have considered my brother since our 13th song...er, season.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling again, Keats continued as he took his first step backward toward the door. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you wish to know which of these heroes your face reminded me of, sir, it was Staelth d'Shiv, leader of the Assassins of Nektulos, and a blackguard of his 56th dagger when last I fought at his side. Of course, this tale took place when he was but of his 21st...But I am sure I bore you by now, as I have been told I ramble.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bowing before Lord K'Kidrak and turning again to the assembled Shadow Guard and guests, Keats performs a more flourished bow and takes his leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take care, Shadow Guard, and if you prefer I keep the blessings of my Twins to myself, I wish then for the muses to inspire you in both word and deed!&quot;<br>
<br>
The bard dons his golden helm once again, slips his lute into its sling upon his back and strides out the door. Outside, a faint ringing is heard and the door closes not quite soon enough to obscure the tiny sparkles thrown off by a sweeping tambourine, nor to silence the magical melody of Selo's as the wanderer rises and vanishes into the distance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showMessage?topicID=12.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.showMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.threadControl?topicID=5.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=5.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm0">The Moat (Public OOC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm4">The Tavern (Public In-Character)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm19">The Gate (Membership Applications)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm12">The Bazaar (Trade Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm14">The Blighted Garden (Allied IC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm10">The Council Chambers (Alliance Discussions)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm11">The Siege Tower (Raid Planning)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm2">The Barracks (Private OOC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm3">Hall of Legend (Private IC Board)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm16">The Cursed Herald (Guild Event Announcements)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm15">The Training Grounds (Strategy Discussion)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm13">Pit of the Damned (The Hunted)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm7">The Armory (Guild Equipment Roster)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm8">The Library (Guild Research)<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm18">Allecti Chambers<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm17">Praetor Chambers<option value="shadowguardsullonzekfrm9">The Throne Room</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffcc>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bshadowguardsullonzek>ShadowGuard - Sullon Zek</a><font color=#ffffcc> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm4>The Tavern (Public In-Character)</a> <font color=#ffffcc> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
