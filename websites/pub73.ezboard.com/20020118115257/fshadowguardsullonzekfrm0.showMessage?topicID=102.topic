Kinda funny that it's coming from Grimshade, a ranger notorious for only fighting when you're already engaged with a MoB.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000033><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/upernicioussz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pernicious SZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shadow Guard</span><br> <font color=#ffffcc>(10/4/01 11:57:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fshadowguardsullonzekfrm0.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=102.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.shadowguard.org/resources/Delf.jpg border=0 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Grimshade</span><hr size=1> I have some respect for Grimshade when it comes to PvP.  He IS a ranger and the only one I have seen in the points list, as a matter of fact he outscored everyone else yesterday with 1200 points.  Now as far as being a CCer or BCer there are very few reasons I can see for ever doing it.  To shut up a loud mouth would really be the only reason I would personally.  <br>
Honor is a subject that I have always had an issue with.  When I was speaking with Maugrim prior to joining the Guard my largest concern was would the Guard have issues when I was pking in a mean, cheap or nasty way.  That is how I play my characters.  The only fair fight is one that should never happen unless it is a formal competition with a physical reward for winning in my eyes.  There is a time to fight and a time to flee knowing when to do each is what makes a PKer good.<br>
One major complaint I had about Tallon and why I came to Sullon was &quot;EXP killing&quot;.  Stupid newbies and bluebies shouting &quot;Fernicious is XP killing me at XYZ&quot; when I was burning them down while engaged in a mob. I was very methodical about it and ALWAYS killed them unless they got stupid and caused there own death.  EXP killing is defined as disrupting combat so as to INTENTIONALLY allow the MOB to get the killing blow.  It got so bad I would sit and watch and wait for them to kill the mob then destroy them.  Then I was called other bad names for not fighting fair.  I killed many a player several time because they wouldn't take it like an adult.<br>
As far as I am concerned Grimshade has it right in one aspect use EVERYTHING you can to get the advantage to get the victory/kill.  In my eyes it serves much higher a purpose than &quot;honor&quot;  you want a duel go to EMarr where I started and left because there was no means to get revenge.  Soon my totals will appear, perhaps then you will seen what I speak about in body count, Innoruuk will guide me.  I might get Grimshade when he is within range, but I will only catch him when HE isn't ready and will flee when I am not.  Fight on YOUR terms not some one else's.  That is the best way to win.<br>
here is a link to one of the BEST PvP posts ever.  Everyone should read it I think.  It was written about Tallon but applies even more so to Sullon.   <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.thehorde-sz.org/pvp101.htm">www.thehorde-sz.org/pvp101.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

He rants that he doesn't CC, BC, etc.  But he isn't honorable in his actions.  He waits for th environment to beat you down and then lands a few hits.  He has a monkey enchanter following him to do his hard work. He camps or runs when any challenge presents itself.  Anytime I would go head to head with him, he'd run.  Anytime anyone goes head to head with him, he runs.  He is an average PKer, not a good PvPer.<br>

And about that 1200 points, you'll notice that he never killed anyone more than once.<br>

But I think he's gone a bit overboard, this is SZ after all. Not to mention Nalir didn't CC.       *shrug*<br>

I have gone pking with Grimshade very very often.  I have never once seen or heard of him CCing or BCing anyone.  I have never seen him kill a naked player.  I have certainly see him attack someone engaged with a MoB, or attack many against few.  BUT as to his running from a challenging fight - this is utter bull!  Just some examples: Grimshade and I attacked a full group (plus adds) of even cons in and around Dalnir (Grimshade didn't run until he was under a bub (and died to a dot).  Grimshade and I attacked a full group of even cons in LoIO, Grimshade ran when he was under 1.5 bubs - leading off four of the six, thus allowing me to coin one of the two remaining.  Grimshade, Gleego, and I attacked two evens and THREE REDS (the reds ran) in WW.  A group of five HB attacked three reds in Oassis.  Grimshade actually got the killing blow on each of these reds, all within four minutes.  I don't think anyone on SZ has ever equaled that last feat - three reds in four minutes, and I doubt anyone ever will.  Note: In each of these fights (save one) NO mobs were involved, and our enemies started at full health.  Each of these fights was VERY close.  <br>
<br>
How many times has your guild invaded an enemy dungeon were the majority of folks conned even to red to you with a full group or less?  Grimshade has done so along side me on numerous occassions.<br>
<br>
Just because someone is willing to attack you when you are at a disadvantage (low on health, engaged with a mob, 6 on 1), doesn't mean they don't have the balls to attack (and press an attack), when they are at what would appear to be a serious disadvantage.<br>

While this post is tad late I'll still take the time to reply. <br>
<br>
Takish, that incident with Treylor had another reason for me killing him when he popped again after that red necromancer killed him (so he did not lose exp on the first death). One or two days before that incident Honorbound attacked the Lake in force, and it took a while to beat them off. When Honorbound was finally losing Grimshade announced they were looting and scooting.<br>
I doubted that, and I took a risk. I ran to the river near FV where half a dozen newts, most from Honorbound, were gathered. And as I already expected, one of them attacked me, and soon the rest joined in.<br>
Honorbound's reply later was that they were attacked at the river, but it was the other way around. One of you initiated the fight while you were supposed to be looting and scooting.<br>
<br>
So when that opportunity with Treylor arrised, I treated him with equal 'honor'.<br>
<br>
And your part about Grimshade, yes, he is a good player and skilled at pvp...but he does run immediately when he's at an disadvantage. He zoneplugged on many single evens from the Shadow Guard in the past, and I heard on two occasions (not witnessed, just heard it in OOC when Grimshade was defeated) that Grimshade nuked himself in the end to prevent his killer from getting the kill.<br>

When goods took over Stonebrunt I were around level 22. I stayed hunting in Stonebrunt, enemy ground then, from 22 till 26 and 30 till 35. Most of the time alone, sometimes with Shadow Guards, and sometimes with other people as mad as me who ignore little unimportant facts like odds. Since 35 (I'm 37 now) I hunted in Velious, and am doing well there. Again I hunt alone most of the time, sometimes with a friend, and sometimes with a few Iggles who linger there.<br>
And while a bard is not at an advantage in a dungeon, I still went into the Crystal Caverns a few times to club some newts.<br>
<br>
Now, if I had the luxury of bringing a full group over it would be a breeze instead. Hunting in enemy ground is so easy, even some reds don't oppose much of a challenge when I'm alone. And you know as well that that hardly has anything to do with skill. I know exactly what I am doing, while the one I attack is confused and surprised, often panicking. I know how it is to be the hunter instead of the hunted.<br>
<br>
So don't try to insult our bravery or honor. Most of the Shadow Guardians assisted me on multiple occasions in enemy ground and most of the time we hunt without the luxury of a healer, never with the luxury of a full group, and never with the luxury of a whole set of buffs before initiating fights. <br>
<br>
One last word though, I regard Honorbound much higher then most other enemy guilds I encountered, though I think most of you are tad obsessed with points. Sanctus Lumen/Divine Vigilance/Darkenbane/Wolves of Legend all are guilds that grief newbies at every opportunity, while suddenly acting honorably when facing Hate/Ruin/Iggles/Malignant (well, Darkenbane is an exception, they never act honorably).<br>
