<br>
        Today started out as any other, there were many young Iksar training in the various places around our home city of Cabilis. Being young and not fully understanding what my lord Cazic-Thule has planned for me, I too went out to do some training. It was not long until I was united with my skin brothers Betrayal, Heriuru, and my life brother Silrassis. We were at the base of the cursed tower of Kurn, helping the Troopers and Mystics keep the population of unwanted beings under control, all the while trying to learn what the master plan of our Fear Lord is.<br>
<br>
        It is not surprising that on this day many armies of friends were forming up into more exclusive and selective groups. My entire life with the Alchemist Draak Daltanian, I have heard of the power of a particular group, Shadow Guard, and have strived to grow to power in such a way that they would take notice of me, and want me to be within their ranks. The calls of some of the future hero’s, but in most cases I suspect, Shadow Guard fodder, were many and great. I was beckoned by many to join with them in their attempt to return the Iksar Empire to it’s former glory. Though many of these offers were valid, and good enough that most young warriors of Cazic-Thule would not have passed up, I expressed that I was waiting for The Shadow Guard to invite me unto their ranks.<br>
<br>
        As we stood fighting in the Shadow of Kurn’s Tower, a voice, cold and deadly, slipped into my head.<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krintek tells you, ‘It is time brother, for you to join with us, The Shadow Guard. I have also extended this invitation to your brother Silrassis. Come to me where you would enter The Warsliks Woods.”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It was time, my Life Brother and I left for Warsliks to meet up with the powerful and feared Krintek. It was a short journey to where we were to meet, and once there, introduction was very short (there were far more pressing matters to attend to). We then followed Lord Krintek to a section of underground tunnels, where it seems a mighty king once sat..<br>
<br>
       <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krintek says, ‘Shadow Guard hopefuls, please form two lines to either side of me.’</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
+Looking around I see many faces that I have seen in my training, and we were all hopefuls for the Shadow Guard. I thought to myself, this Shadow Guard is very smart and organized and recognizes the power that the Iksar command. The faces that I saw were: Kharn of the Swifttails, Silrassis Trooper of Cabalis, and Exos from The Dead. I noticed that Betrayer showed up for support, having been inducted unto the Shadow Guard earlier. Also present was Lord Vizier Krintek, Katiana of the Council of Shadow, and Vitia.+<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krintek says, ‘Know that I bear witness to your oaths and shall also be the one to hunt you down should you break them. Do you understand?’</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
We all agree, in unison.<br>
        <br>
       <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krintek says, ‘Kneel before the Council of Shadows’</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
We all kneel<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Katiana hisses, ‘Extend to me your palmsss.’</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
We extend our palms.<br>
Katiana quickly slices each of our palms allowing our life’s blood to flow freely from the wounds.<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krintek says, ‘Blood flows’<br>
<br>
        Katiana hisses, “Ressspond to each Oath by Sssstating “I ssso ssswear in blood.””<br>
<br>
<br>
        Krintek says, ‘Do you swear loyalty to your brothers and sisters of the Shadow Guard before all others?’<br>
<br>
In unison, “I sso sswear in blood”<br>
<br>
        Katiana hisses, ‘Do you ssswear to defend the grand cities of our allies in Grobb, Oggok, Paineel, Cabilis and Neriak with your life and eternally in undeath?”<br>
<br>
In unison, “I sso sswear in blood”<br>
<br>
        Krintek says, ‘Do you swear to spurn the lesser races that are not worthy of serving us and give them the hate that is thief just due?”<br>
<br>
In unison, “I sso sswear in blood”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Krintek then places the Shadow Guard Insignia around Exos and my neck, while Katiana places the symbol around the necks of Kharn and Silrassis.<br>
<br>
        <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krintek says, ‘Now rise as Shadow Guardians.’<br>
<br>
        Krintek says, ‘One more thing that you must always remember. In all that you say and do, you now represent the Shadow Guard, represent us well, make us proud to call you brothers!”</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
        After the ceremony, Krintek informed us that he had pressing matters to attend to on Antonica, and left us. I had matters to handle inside of Cabilis, my Life Brother with me; we headed to our home city. On the journey to Cabilis my mind started drifting, thinking of the life I lived without my Life Brother, without even knowing that my Life Brother existed.<br>
