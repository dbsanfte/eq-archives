Every team has grief killers.  I have seen goods, neutrals, and yes, even evils using some kind of tactic that is less than liked on this server, to kill members of opposing alliances.  I have seen them do it over and over again.  Will *I* do it? Yep - if it means doing unto others as they have done to me, absolutely. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I also used to gripe that &quot;goods&quot; acted more like &quot;evil&quot; .... or, that greenie killers were scum of the earth.<br>
<br>
But you know what? Someone pointed something out to me - wise words, they were.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is a PvP server.  We have three alliances - Good, Neutral and Evil.  It is a war between those three.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are times that I will grant mercy upon someone, but not always.  Especially not Legeris. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

i hope the rest of Good team in EF can look at pks this way. fighting reds is VERY valuable pvp training. you learn to react fast because you HAVE to, and we really have very to little to lose by it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uangelosarinikos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Angelos Arinikos</A> at: 9/28/01 9:20:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udiako.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diako</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/28/01 11:09:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3784.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Funny stuff</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Forget the few Neutral that came to EF, kill greens and CC them in the past.  I remember Pumpkin being a nemesis in Halas, killing all non Barbarians that were Good.  Not letting us go to bank in peace.   When was that... Hm...  at least 6-7 weeks ago.<br>
<br>
EF has been pissed off by Neutral.  Gfay has been pissed off by Evils and newts.   We all have a bad taste in our mouth.  Some are just lashing back, and returning the change.<br>
<br>
We're making our own grave ?   Why is it that Revenge is always making a mistake....   Cause they are over doing it ?   Well, I didn't see any Neutral stopping Pumpkin in her 2-3 weeks of killing everyone in EF/BB/Halas zones.  All Newts were in Joy of what she was doing...   Why would other goods feel bad for Neutral now...   I mean really...<br>
<br>
For those that aren't in the 30+, that didn't see the hell we good had to go through...  Try to get some feedback on the History of SZ, and know what happened.  You might understand why some of the Goods are being this bad.  Otherwise, Shut the fuck up, cause you don't have a fucking clue the misery we had to live through ourselves to get this strong. <p><b>Diako Kronanta<br>

Man I am not going to continue some personal battle with a level 50 good i have never met (Warmongrel Fucker). Me saying I was going to Kite your ass while singing great balls of fire..... etc..... was just another way of me saying that you're all fucked up. I didnt really know you were 50, and who gives a shit. I am from VZ where i had a 56 SK in the largest darkie pk guild on the server. So please dont call me a bloob. Noob but not bloob. <br>
<br>
And btw, if you read my quote that says &quot;I am kind of proud of them...&quot; about the goods, you would see I am not fucking whining or complaining. Merely trying to give you minor props while stating my revenge and trying to piss you off at the same time. <br>
<br>
As for griefing, no way will I be a griefer. I wont pick on the same dude that hasn't picked on me. But I will goddamn pick on the whole good team. Way more then evils now, because they are little bitches that need to be spanked. <br>
<br>
Warmongrel, the great thing about this server is that a level 16 can find other ways to kill a level 50 - so take your thumb out of your butt and stick it back in between your ears.<br>

   I will always remember this Newt Ranger that killed me in EF, and said he'd CC my corpse until I left my Guild...  and then said he will kill anyone from my guild.   Next thing you see, he's running for his life scared cause 5 Even to him are after him in EF trying to show him the spirit.<br>
<br>
    I don't agree with Killing Newbies, I don't agree with CC'ing (unless the person is a total Jackass, which hasn't happened to me).  I will defend my own against any enemies without any mercy, mostly the newbies if I've nearby.<br>

<br>
If everyone on Sullon (or maybe even any of the zeks) who has ever been victimized by some form of &quot;dishonorable&quot; griefing chose to get vengence by griefing others in return, then it would be nothing but a grief-fest between all three teams (which is what it actually resembles more and more as time goes by).<br>
<br>
Of course, this is Sullon afterall, the no-rules server, and such is as it shall be... Griefing is griefing only if anyone calls it griefing anymore and honor is a a meaningless concept drowned under layers of infinite circumstance. I think I've grown too numb to even get upset by it anymore.<br>
<br>
What continues to upset me however is the constant justifying of one's acts and the quick nature by which people hide behind some transparent excuse. Yes, goods were griefed and terrorized from level 1-30 in Faydwer. Yes, they were attemping to takeover a zone. Does that justify griefing all the lowbies there? I really don't know.<br>
<br>
If the answer is no, then why respond similarly? If the answer is yes, then why complain?<br>

I've got killed my own fair share from 1-25 in EF/Perma and MM.  I took names down, and vowed vengense to THEM.<br>
<br>
Why cause misery to someone if there is no impact what so ever in killing the person to begin with.  Going in a newbie zone where everyone is 30-35 lvl's below me...  what would be my point to kill them ?  Showing that I have power ?  I think I'm pretty satisfied with my Real Life, I don't need to prove any sense of superiority in Game.<br>
<br>
I know that Enemies are Enemies.  But if my intention when I meet them was to travel through the area, I won't stop.  Many times in Blackburrow I just waved at Newts in there, and was asked if I was there to kill them.  All I told them is to not harm any of my kind.  Goods and Newts were both fighting in BB, and there were no Bloodbath.  I guess, I'm more of a peacemaker in those terms regarding chars under 20. <p><b>Diako Kronanta<br>

Diako is completely right.<br>
<br>
Newt invasions every other day.  Evil invasions every day.  Every single one of us goods that was on at server launch has experienced hell.  While evil xp'd to their hearts content in their 7 newbie zones, we were all crowded into CB.  The good barbarians had to fight constant attacks from the neutrals through blackburrow.  Hell I had to stay up till offpeak hours to get xp in.  I remember several occasions in which I stayed up till 6am simply because I was in TR.  Hard as hell to get into taht group, sometimes you had to wait for 3-6 hours and you'd still not make it.  <br>
<br>

I repeat once more, I am not yet level 50, but I am currently in a hell level, and I will most likely be out of it by the end of this weekend.<br>

I never understand how people can do something that makes them miserable.  I was a one-team shorty on Tallon Zek, which pretty much meant I was teamless.  Even the other shorties not in my guild would train mobs, heal my targets, and group with the enemy all the time.  <br>
<br>
I'd just mock them for being weak, and my group would kill their friends right in front of them.  Fun!  We weren't doing it to 'prove a point'.  We were just doing it because we enjoyed smacking down elves, and the sounds that they made when they died.<br>
<br>
If your life in a game is miserable, quit playing!  If you're having fun, quit saying you're miserable! <p><font face=Verdana><Font Size = 1><B>We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off to go fishing.

<br>
If they were to look back at the posts from the first month, they would find threads almost identical to theirs from Goods about Newts and to a lesser degre Evils.<br>
<br>
It's circular.  Those goods that are griefing now are doing so partly in revenge for what was done to them by Kronar (sp), Velocis (love ya man), Kowboy and Pumpkin to name a few.<br>
<br>
I'm sure the next generation will be bitching about Railroad and Totem somewhere down the line.<br>
<br>
Don't take it so personal.  It is, after all, just a game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udaenn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/29/01 3:42:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3784.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nice Thread</span><hr size=1> hell, listening to anyone bitch like this is hillarious. why don't you go hide on kunark so no one will bother you? <p> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/urailroadpete.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Railroad Pete</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(9/30/01 5:18:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3784.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Christ...</span><hr size=1> You all really need to reread my posts.

<br>
I couldn't do it though, cuz I'd just be an outright hypocrite because that post honestly had me laughing out loud. I don't care if its making fun of the goods or not, its frickin hilarious.<br>
<br>
I think there is a lesson to be learned here for all the trolls and immature posters on SZT. Only that, failing the capacity to establish a point coherently, intelligently, and maturely, one should at least attempt to be funny or entertaining in some similar manner.<br>
<br>
What do you posters who respond with &quot;kthxbye~&quot; and &quot;quit whining poon!&quot; really accomplish aside from becoming one post closer to being a message board warrior (oooh!)? Pete may not have effectively argued his point, but in the very least a person took notice.<br>
