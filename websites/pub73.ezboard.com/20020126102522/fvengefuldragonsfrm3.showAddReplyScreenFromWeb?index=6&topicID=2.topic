He was still a young lad when he was struck with wanderlust and decided to set out and see the world. Thus Huitzil had roamed the land, seeking new knowledge, experiences and friends. If by chance you meet this guy and asked him, “What class are you?” and he’ll reply with a grin, “I’m a pintsized demigod, fear my nuking power.” After much pain and sorrow, Huitzil had finally learned enough in his travels to be considered a low level channeler of the mystic arts. If chance allows that he be invited into a group, he prefers most the company of a warrior, a rogue, a cleric, a bard and an enchanter. Out of all the classes Huitzil has ever met, there is nothing he admired more than clerics who with the blessing of their gods are able to bring him back from death – which has occurred too many times for his taste.  Huitzil has vowed death to all giants out there that has tried to squish him more often than not and since he has similar goals as that of Coldain; he became one of the few outlanders they trusted. Huitzil has been to a few guilds trying to find the one that’s for him but no success as of yet. He has heard of the Guild of Vengeful Dragons and thought, “Can this be the guild I’ve been searching for? To finally be among equals, to meet new friends, to be able to group with people he can trust to guard his life; I have to take this window of opportunity.” <br>
I live in CA and play at almost every free time I have available which is usually late morning to noon, late at night to very early in the morning, and during the weekends. I hope you’ll invite my character, Huitzil to your guild. If needed I can join some of your raids before you invite me so that you’ll get to know me better, perhaps this way I’ll get better faction with you guys. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/udov5731.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dov5731</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFF33>(11/28/01 12:10:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fvengefuldragonsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seeking Great people to be a part of The Vengeful Dragon</span><hr size=1> Note being as Novel or RP as others I thought I would get to the point <br>
<br>
Please answer the following questions;<br>
1. Name: Dandila<br>
2. Class: Druid<br>
3. Character race: Human<br>
4. Level: 32 (while this does equal the lvl 35 min - if you add up all the times I have died fro 30 to 32 I make lvl 40 easy hehe)<br>
5. How long you have played: almost 3 yrs<br>
6. When you play: about noon est to 3am est depending on the day - ie long on at noon off at about 11pm or midnight on at 2 or 3 pm on till 3 or 4 am<br>
7. What you are looking for in a guild: Too Easy Drill Sgt!   Fun Friends Trust Respect Honor and Help shared among all!<br>
8. Why the Dragons: 2 reason  A) I have yet to me a Dragon that has KSed not pay a fair price or offered to help when a need arose B) A few friend said your among the best guilds on the server - Cerrcile (sp) (45 chanter) being one that has also just joined yall<br>
9. What classes do you prefer to Group with in an ideal party: This is a tuff one because it depends on the fight.  Would have to say the best exp grp I have ever been in had 2 monk 3 war and a cleric (being one of the monks myself) - got 2 lvls in 2 hrs as did the whole grp.  But all and all would say best grp would be Mage (aoe pet dd ds and toys) Cleric (duh heals - and rezing for me) Monk (fd pullin damge) Bard (Mana Healin songs so tanks and casters get to full between fights - also AOE DD CHARM BUFFS HASTE MEZ backup Puller ETC ) then fillers  if a shammy is on for rooting and dots slows debuff etc then last slot is a swing slot or a few tanks to get beat on and taunt lol - Total without 2 slots is Pet Monk Bard for tanking so 3 thanks - Mage DD Cleric if we have the mana and bard with that massive dd they get - Cleric Bard for heals - looks like a cool grp<br>
<br>
10. What class do you most admire: Admire hmmm  Have played most and I admire them all - just not for all situations.  So with that being said I dont over Admire any Class sorry<br>
<br>
11. What is your ideal Velious faction: IDEAL is Ally with Dwarf Giant Dragon but VI has since fixed that ability soooo....  it depends on he Guild mostly - Dwarf is easiest to get and if you get dwarf get dragon - better to have 2 friends then 2 enemies...  on the filp side - tanks should get Giant - better ac!  Casters are Dragon - Better stats HPs        As you can tell I'm open hehe<br>

from 6pm PSt til 12 or 1am. M-F<br>
from 6pm PST til 2-4am Sa<br>
All day sunday, usually<br>
<br>
I am looking for a guild that does not fight all the time, that has enough members for me to be able to group, that is honest and trustworthy, and that knows how to have fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I am thinking of Dragons, because I know a few people in Dragons and respect them.  Cerrelia, Skuully, and others.<br>
<br>
The classes for group thing is a bit rough, but the best group I was ever in had a chanter, cleric, two monks, druid, and I.<br>
<br>
Well, so far I think every class has it's purpose and do not admire one more than any other.<br>
<br>
I am currently ally with dwarf and amiable with dragon.  I would prefer to be ally with Giant though.<br>
<br>
If you are trying to find me in game, I may be on an alt, name of Goraliss.  feel free to talk to him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My first Guild was The Enhanced when i still played Chvayre then i went away for the summer so i gave all my stuff away and quit everquest, but everyone knows how addictive EQ is and ya just can't stay away from it so when i got back i restarted with a Shaman because i like the fact that because i'm a priest class and able to buff it would be easy to get into groups and i liked the ability to solo and have a doggy pet. So now at my 35th lvl when things start getting harder and i'm venturing into unknown territory for me i would like to have the company of being in a guild the first for this character.<br>
<br>
1. Name: Trabayre<br>
2. Class: Shaman<br>
3. Character race: Barbarian<br>
4. Level: 35<br>
5. How long you have played: about 8 months<br>
6. When you play: week ends anytime i'm not doin anything and weekdays after 7pm EST to 10pm<br>
7. What you are looking for in a guild. Just people to talk to and get help from. People to grp with and get some good advice. Also it gets boring on the down time when i solo<br>
8. Why the Dragons: I got a friend already in your guild &quot;Keffka aka Kajen&quot;. Also i have met some VD on occasion and they all seem like good people.<br>
9. What classes do you prefer to Group with in an ideal party: Well if i am just partnering i like to grp with a War, Sk, or Pal; basically some class that can take the hits. For a full grp it really depends on what we are killing. I always like to have 2 main tanks War, Sk, Pal and 1 dmg dealer like a rouge or monk. The other 2 i like to be casters always a cleric (i personally like being able to heal but, not to have that job in a grp, Agros to much) and either a necro/wizard or bard for single pulls and enchanter or bard for alot of pulls. <br>
10. What class do you most admire Necro i think they are a great class in general because of the soloing ability or a War just because they can take the hits.<br>
11. What is your ideal Velious faction: don't really have any yet haven't done to much extensive hunting in Velious except for CC. I would like to get Dorf and Dragon fraction up though.<br>

2. Class: Cleric<br>
3. Character race: High Elf Snob<br>
4. Level: 42<br>
5. How long you have played: about 2 years on Druzzil Ro<br>
6. When you play: Mainly 7:00 pm during weekdays and as much as possible during weekends. (CST)<br>
7. What you are looking for in a guild: I don't even refer to a guild as a guild, but rather as a family.  I love to group up with those that I know.  I'm looking for a close group of friends that enjoy to group with each other. <br>
8. Why the Dragons: I used to be under the direction of Stormhawk on the Druzzil Ro server.  I was actually an officer within his guild there.  He is very experienced when it comes to leadership.  I want a family that is not chaotic and listens to it's leaders.  From what I have been told, the Dragons have fun together, and I want to experience the same.<br>
9. What classes do you prefer to Group with in an ideal party: To me, there is no ideal party.  It's the person who is playing the character that makes the difference.  I group with all.  My job is to heal and keep you alive. <br>
10. What class do you most admire: It's not the class that I admire, it's the person playing the class.<br>
11. What is your ideal Velious faction: My Velious faction is neutral at the moment.  My Cleric hasn't really traveled up there.  But Dwarves and Dragon faction sound good to me.<br>

My name is Merkure, i am a high elf cleric, and I am has the study of the prayers of Tunare since 47 seasons.<br>
I look for a solid brotherhood(guild) which will know to bring me quite the heat of the friendship and the good agreement.<br>
I had the occasion to meet some of your members, with whom I fought against the evil which reign still on Kunark's lands.<br>
As a cleric, my first purpose is to help and to look after people.<br>
<br>

Hello, i live in france and play as GMT. but since my job is in 3x8 i have the time to play many nights by month.<br>
I was in raiders of twilight aka arthemus (druid) -remember me storm? in wakening land hunting the flying monkey with daddor and kalamon =)<br>
<br>
about the game : <br>
<br>
The best group in imho : warrior-monk-ranger-cleric-enchanter-druid. But there is of multiple combination so good.<br>
As it was say higher: all the classes are good has to play any depend of the person who play them.<br>
And at last but not the least my ideal velious faction is Kael-giant.<br>
<br>
As we like saying in France, aurevoir et a bientôt (bye and see you soon)<br>

<br>
name: Supay Tartaros<br>
class: Shadowknight Dark Elf<br>
lvl: 56<br>
<br>
guilds before this: Red Guard<br>
<br>
I am playing since febuary 2001<br>
<br>
I play mostly between 6pm GMT+1 till i need sleep (hehe)<br>
<br>
I look for ppl to play with <br>
<br>
Aaladarya asked me to join, and  grythos is nice, like Mindark )))<br>
<br>
Best grp classes: hard to say. CLERIC, ENC/BARD, Shammy, Rogue, Monk/War AND ME!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I dont admire a class, i think the person who play a class can make the best of every class, i saw awesome bards, and awesome rangers, and i saw stupid encs, where i never understand how they become over 50 hehe (ebay???)<br>
<br>
i would like to make some malovent armor(kael) so i need some faction there <br>
<br>
AND btw I NEVER NEVER KILL GORNAIRE<br>
