He originally came from UO and then migrated over. His favorite character was a 35 druid on Rallos, his server of choice (he had higher lvl chars, but he said on Rallos 35 was the fun lvl range for him). He has since quit EQ completely for AO and WWII.<br>
<br>
Because of this however, my first EQ characters were of course, created on Rallos Zek. I learned alot there (not about PKing or PvPing really, but about the atmosphere of a zek). I liked it that the enemies which I fought against and which wanted me dead weren't all just bits of code, and that there were consequences to my actions which directly affected me.<br>
<br>
Throughout my short EQ lifespan, I've banded together with friends on Rallos to hunt down a griefer in Ro. I've run loot and goods between rival guilds as a bard. I've gone on raids in Sullon against those short arrogant dwarves of Kaladim. I've defended Faydwer from massive Iksar and Dark Elf invasions. And I have argued and dabated countless times online about the definitions of &quot;griefers&quot;, &quot;roleplayers&quot;, &quot;dishonor&quot; and &quot;neutral&quot;.<br>
<br>
These are things I never thought possible in a blue server. This, coupled with the fact that most blue servers are ultra crowded kept me from ever trying them out. Lately tho I can't help but wonder how much I am missing. We all know that PvP is fun, challenging, and intensely immersive. But so many state that it is also so flawwed and always shall be because EQ was not designed for PvP. So I gotta ask, what is it I am missing out on by never having played on a non-PvP server that I can't experience on a PvP server? I just want to know that I am not some biased shortsighted hypocrite when I switch to Shadowbane and say how much better it is compared to &quot;that damn unbalanced Verant game&quot;.<br>
<br>
Please fight the urge to respond with &quot;yer not missing anything man! all carebear servers are overcrowded with twinked bluebie farmers who camp all the good spawns 24-7! Zeks rule! PvP forever!&quot; Heh, as funny as that is, I'm actually looking for some constructive responses.<br>

You're not really missing anything, unless you're one of those people that gets worked up or frustrated easily on SZ.<br>
<br>
That's about it, blue servers (at least TP) have a much more friendly environment as a whole, at least at the lower level tiers.  However, it can be a bit harder to make &quot;good friends&quot; on blue servers because you don't go through the same BS together that you do on SZ.<br>
<br>
I also find server politics on blue servers to be much more sickening, as they tend to be petty IMO.<br>
<br>
&quot;Move aside or my guild will camp the s@#t outta mob X and your's will never get into plane Y again!&quot;<br>
<br>
At least here you can do something about it.<br>
<br>
The only other thing I could think of is that it's much easier to get nice equipment on blue servers (at least compared to being on the good team now) than it is here.  So if you get really excited about getting the pHaT l3wTz you might wanna check out a mature blue server.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umorganti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morganti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/21/01 7:53:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How much am I missing?</span><hr size=1> well... did you watch one life to live this morning?<br>

My little brother often make new characters on random servers and an hour later they have full bronze and kunark quested weapon. Guild politics are very fierce and complicated. High level loot zones are off limits unless you reserved it in advance (Example: Planes runs are planned and checked for availability about a month or two in advance) One of the biggest offense on blue servers is Kill Stealing. Of course most of its just talk. The only thing they can do is train you, but that’s gets them &quot;warnings&quot;. Its basically two guilds shouting &quot;Well...fuck you!&quot; Then the other guild shouting back &quot;No, fuck you!&quot; (Well, in a symbolic sense).<br>

The part that got to me was that there was really no point to anything.  On SZ, when I got my RBF, I thought 'cool, now I can beat that druid into the ground next time they try and snare me', on a blue server it's really just something nice with no real purpose other than to get you to a higher level (so that you can get more gear and level more to get more gear and...).  People are very worried about having the 'best' items, not because they really need them but because then they can show how much more uber they are than everyone else, where on SZ, you are trying to get the best stuff you can because it gives you that much better chance at killing rather than being killed.<br>
<br>
Also skill is completely irrelivant, it doesn't matter how effective you are at playing your class, if you're a tank and you can hit things, you're just as good as any other tank, if you're a cleric who keeps people healed, that's just great, if you're a monk who can pull welcome to the club.  Granted better players will die a little less, level a little faster and be able to get gear a little easier but for the most part even a total moron will still do fine leveling from 1 to 60 where on SZ they wouldn't have made it very far when they realized they were being PKed constantly by even cons and had no idea how to fight back.<br>
<br>
There is something to be said for the PvE aspects of EQ, questing, exploring, raiding, but these are things that can be so much more rewarding on a PvP server.  Some people try PvP and don't like it, to them I would say stay where you are and play the game you like.. but if you've ever enjoyed giving someone a free trip to their bind point you can never go back. <p>--------------------<BR>

<br>
Fear not, you can still enjoy this interesting experience!<br>
<br>
First, randomly select a &quot;blue&quot; server from the server selection list.<br>
<br>
Create a level 1 Iksar anything on said server.<br>
<br>
Walk to Trakanon's Teeth.<br>
<br>
Beg kiting Druid_061 until he lets you loot the spare quest items off the froglok forager / hunter.<br>

Like, make it so if someone challenges you to a duel and you are within 5 levels but decline, then you automatically lose all the money you have on you to them (same if you zone while engaged in a duel). And then also set it so you can't join or start a guild unless you turn in the child of order thing and enable PvP. It would be interesting.<br>

<br>
I find that they each provide a slightly different experience. When playing on a blue server, there is a fairly friendly help everyone kind of attitude (from most people, not all). You will be given stuff and buffed fairly frequently. You can travel wherever you want, including fairly high level dungeons and wait to loot the No Drop item of your desire.<br>
<br>
However, as has been pointed out above, the only *points* seem to be:<br>
<li>socializing<br>
<li>leveling<br>
<li>loot<br>
<br>
On Sullon Zek, the social aspect of the game is very different. You don't find people out to help you (perhaps in part because this is a new server and there aren't the glut of items yet) and I don't find random buffers nearly so often. I think this is because of the danger of the server. It gives an adrenaline rush that I never got on a blue server. But it also makes you keep /anon or /role. And you must conserve your mana so that if you get jumped you can defend yourself.<br>
<br>
On a PvP server, I would say social time has been replaced with tactics and so it is far more challenging and actually requires some skill.<br>
<br>
I would say that if you don't find the game social enough or you feel a lack of loot, try a blue server, otherwise I find Sullon Zek far more exciting and interesting.<br>

<br>
pvp advantages: Can kill some PC, only those that arent in your team (Evil, newts, good) Can train if you want to.<br>
<br>
PvE advantages: Can focus more on fighting the more intense NPC, like dragons, gods. Able to travel everywhere and see everything, if you got what it takes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that said, i will reply to most of the pro pvp post above, and straighten some things out.<br>
<br>
Wess rainkeeper said: *Well, loot is very easy to come by. My little brother often make new characters on random servers and an hour later they have full bronze and kunark quested weapon*<br>
<br>
I say: Well this is true for both type of game, i dont see how it is not possible on PVP servers? why wouldnt it? SZ was just opened and a week later mostly everyone was full banded, even some in bronze armor and quested, smithed weapons... now some are lvl 55 with much better than that, its worst then blue server imo. After a year that SZ is out, you try and create a newb there, and see what you can get after an hour played....<br>
<br>
Wess also said *Guild politics are very fierce and complicated. High level loot zones are off limits unless you reserved it in advance *<br>
<br>
i say: Once again a point without any logic to it, PVP is the exact thing, and even worst. High level zone are off limits unless your Team is owning it, and if its owned by your team, you will have to do the same as one blue server, train em if you want a certain camp. You wont get a warning for it, but you will get a bad reputation(that you would also get on PvE) and then suffer the consequences.<br>
<br>
Vachir said :*on a blue server it's really just something nice with no real purpose other than to get you to a higher level (so that you can get more gear and level more to get more gear and...). *<br>
<br>
I say: I disagree entirely, getting a runed bone fork on a blue server is just as useful as on a red one, you need to resist spells just as much in order to defeat the greater NPC, or you will be dead in no time, the purpose is the same, resist spell to survive. As for getting higher level and better gear, isnt that the goal of any RPG? isnt that something to look foward too? or do you mean on PVP server you have no need for levels or better gear? Obviously you are not as you were so happy when you got your RBF... and getting level is even MORE important on PVP then PvE, since without them any higher level than you will own you... less they ultra dumb and dont remember how to cast a spell, or hit auto attack...<br>
<br>
He also said *where on SZ, you are trying to get the best stuff you can because it gives you that much better chance at killing rather than being killed*<br>
<br>
I say: Same as on PvE, enough said.<br>
<br>
He added : *Also skill is completely irrelivant, it doesn't matter how effective you are at playing your class, if you're a tank and you can hit things, you're just as good as any other tank, if you're a cleric who keeps people healed, that's just great, if you're a monk who can pull welcome to the club<br>
<br>
I say: What are the pvp skills? funny i never heard of those on any board, i Myself have played and pked on SZ, i was totally unexperienced in pvp, i said to myself, hell how hard can it be... i just went and totally owned.<br>
how? basically same way i would kill an NPC aside from the fact that PCs have much less Hps, hit much less hard than any NPC could of the same level, and PC are also much more clumbsy in general, in no way can they follow me and track me down better than an NPC can. Now that aside, if your a tank you can hit things, your just as good as anyone else... True its that simple, how is it different on PVP....? Oh wait, you can run around and hope to hit it instead, and sometimes use your all mighty bow!! ok im totally impressed by the pvp skills now. Cleric job is to keep others healed, they suck in PVP, they are good at healing people, there is alot of strategies on how to heal players in pVe at higher level when you encounter the highend NPCs... its not as simple as casting when life is low, because life goes low extremely fast, you need the right timing, and you need to know your every damn spell in order to keep the tanks alive. Now that said, if i see a cleric nuking the hell outta a PC in pvp, hes gonna be oom real fast and his group will fall(if he has one) if not then he will be owned, cleric are no match for most classes in pvp one on one. As for monk pulling... well, how is that different on PVP once more? Monk will pull the same way, but wait.... they can also try and punch people too!! omg! now that takes alot of skills... the better ones with better connection will catch up to the other and hit him more often! than one who is totally lost and cant find his target! omg! skills!<br>
<br>
again he said: *Granted better players will die a little less, level a little faster and be able to get gear a little easier but for the most part even a total moron will still do fine leveling from 1 to 60 where on SZ they wouldn't have made it very far when they realized they were being PKed constantly by even cons and had no idea how to fight back*<br>

I say: once again, how is that different from pvE? the better players(or should i say, those who have more playtime, hardly ever sleep and spend all day playing) will level faster, and faster, will be able to get better gear on pvp as well. Now as for the moron part that cant fight back... Well... i dont think a moron who doesnt know how to fight back an NPC will live long either... since its the same game with the same principles on how to fight, PC or not... if your a casters do your thing, stay out of melee range, use defensive spells as well as offensive to live, if your a melee, go in melee range and hit em as much as you can. In EQ you cannot dodge spells no matter how hard you try, its not possible, you can only resist them, same goes for Pvp or PvE. Or were you saying that being skilled in pvp is being able to slay a moron who doesnt know how to fight?<br>
i did send people on the way to their bind points in pvp, and yes it was an amazing reward, but then came the real aspect of eq... if i spend all my time pking, i will soon be outlvled the the whole server and than all this fun will end... so i need to level level level, get loot loot loot... which all come down to the same as PvE in the end. I play on SZ, i always though that i played too much, nearly 6hours a day sometimes, but still when i got lvl 25, some were already lvl 50... so i gave up, no sense in playing a game where you stand no chance, as skill changes nothing, i will never defeat someone 30 level above me, even if hes the dumbest guy in the world. Eq level treadmill is just not good to go with pvp, if i want to play a game where i kill other players for my amusement, ill go play UO or Tribes 2, where i can start to kick butts immediatly, and where i can dodge spells etc., ya know real skills? EQ is a tactic game, where you need organization in order to get thru tough dungeons, and most of all you need good leaddership to lead 20+ player into mobs infested dungeons.<br>
<br>
It all come down to personnal opinions, i will give one to red server though, sure is great to always watch your back because you never know what might hit you. Other than that, its the same damn game, with the same rules, and the same fighting tactics... just bit easier to kill PC than npc since they are overall weaker than npc, thats all.<br>

<br>
more intense? compared to other NPC's right? Fight NPC's is boring. Fight them enough and you've already got the strategy on how to beat them figured out. It's predictable.<br>
<br>
Fightin in PvP is unpredictable. You don't really know what the other person is going to do until they react.<br>
<br>
So it isn't more of the same. The unpredictability of it all, keeps PvP more intense, enjoyable, and fun.<br>

<br>
As for PC being unpredictable, i agree, sometimes you think they will cast cancel magic to debuff you but they dont, and then you get the advantages over them.... shrug, there is not 100 ways to kill a PC, all depends on their classes and yours, and with my SK, i always use the same tactic, i first use darkness, and i charge at them and melee... of course they could resist my darkness, thats a given, then id have to rely more on the harder to resist Dot, and AC debuffs... i dont see how else i could handle it, really... i need darkness to stick to avoid those nasty situations where i cant catch up with them to hit them... basically, how else would you do it?.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=jennia>Jennia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/23/01 5:18:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Blue vs Red</span><hr size=1> I started on a blue server (waaay back).  I played a female human necro to 50th before Kunark was released.  I got bored.  I quit playing on the blue server and started another female necro on Vallon Zek (because it had just gone live).  Played her to 35 and then Kunark came out - not to mention they took out the item looting from VZ and (even though it sucked to begin with) it made the server boring.<br>
<br>
Went back to blue server to level to 60 and see the great sites of Kunark.  Joined a huge guild.  Did everything (cept PoM and VP).  Got bored.<br>
<br>
Came to SZ and started a rogue goodie.  I am not bored.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this:  any server is fun when yer low.  But when you get to be high level on a blue server (and this was stated by a previous poster) the politics on blue servers is sickening - and I mean fucking pathetic.  Nothing but guilds crying about other guilds who KS'd Venril Sathir while you were buffing up for the raid or who went to Fear without reserving it, etc.  And the thing is...NONE of those guilds had the BALLS to go to war (which I was totally ready for after playing on Vallon - especially since Fear-line spells still work in PvP on blue servers...).  Why wouldn't they go to war?  Because there are still buggy aspects of PvP on blue servers that cause xp loss on death (GASP).  <br>
<br>
So here I am on SZ (where there IS xp loss...) and you know what?  There will be very few of those blue server wannabes here.  And those that do show up will either embrace it or leave.<br>
<br>
Do *not* play on a blue server if you &quot;grew up&quot; on red servers.  You will be sorely disappointed in your wasted efforts.  There's nothing worse than being on a blue server and someone pisses you off and your hands are tied and you can't do anything about it.  Well, there was that one mage in Lguk that I trained and FD'd on...er NM I most certainly did nothing of the sort!  (Or so I told the GM!)  <br>
<br>
You see?  It's cumbersome and bothersome to be high level on blue servers.  Your power is harnessed by a larger body (a guild) rather than exploited by your*self* on a red server.  Enjoy the red.  Be One with the Red.<br>

We may whine and bicker sometimes, but generally everyone respects everyone else, reputation matters, and if you want to do the raiding thing, it isn't hard--there is always something to raid. I started blue and I'm glad I did--yes there may have been more challenge involved in, say, getting a mask of decption in an evil-controlled guk, but, hell I found learning the game and my class to be pretty challenging, without the possibility of getting randomly ganked while runnign quests.<br>
<br>
In addition, something has to be said for getting to know everyone on your server--regardless of their alignment. If you want an open world with no boundaries save those you create yourself, blue is great.<br>
<br>
Why do I play red as well as blue? Several reasons, and not all of them are pvp-based, or at least not pk-ing based.<br>
<br>
1.) its an adrenaline rush knowing you can get killed--it makes familiar zones suddenly dangerous again. Crossing Antonica at level 6 on a blue server would have been a matter of routine--crossing it here was one of the scariest things I ever did.<br>
<br>
2.) Sullon Zek's still relatively untwinked-ness. Hey I have twinks on Saryrn, I like them--but playing Wythe and earning her gear is Fun...I'm proud of my banded and bronze helm. On my home server a guildmate probably would have handed me better by now, even if I didnt bother to buy better myself. Being untwinked is normal here, money means something. I have a sense of accomplishment fishing in the Karanas or raising my baking skill. :P (btw the salmon in the Karanas sell for 4-5sp each...which isnt a bad way to earn a little extra in the beginning...)<br>
<br>
3.) Because zones are to some extent controlled, people actually hunt in them.  When I started on Saryrn over a year ago, there were people in Befallen, in west karana, in mistmoore, in cazic, even in sol a occasionally. For my twinks that is much less true. I told a young bard in my guild who was begging me for &quot;bard equipment&quot;--yeah right, sure here take this symph saber that I dont use much its great for level 11--not--to go get bandit groups in west karana. He said there weren't any.<br>
<br>
I fear he is correct. The only newbies, real ones, that I ever see anymore are all in the freeport area. I refuse to take my alts to the Lake of Ill Omen...but my rogue has been languishing in Cazic Thule for two months now, and there are never any groups in that zone.<br>
<br>
4.) When people here annoy you there is at least the possibility that you can kill them--or failing that you will get a free port to a different zone and not have to listen to their spam while you run back.<br>
<br>
One thing I will miss, and do miss, is team-based play means I won't get to make friends, to get to know people that might be fun that are good or evil. My friend-base is automatically curtailed. At home, I pretty much know all the bards in my level range and above. We hang out, we have a camaraderie. Two-thirds of them aren't the enemy.<br>
<br>
One thing I've noticed is that the board chat here is abot a hundred times more abusive and testerone-based than on a blue server.,,most times to the point of absurdity. The mildest posts here would be blast furnance rants at home. And the rants here...they're all just scatatlogical(sp) jokes...that aren't very funny.<br>
<br>
When all is said and done, I like being Vainne on Saryrn. I love my friends, I like my acquaintances, I've worked hard on that character and she means a lot to me. She may get to ToV one of these days, she might even bother to get her epic. Wythe of SZ probably never will...and that is fine, because that is not what Wythe is for.<br>
<br>
Wythe is for that sense of wonder, and that sense of risk and challenge that still makes the game seem vital no matter what your level.<br>
<br>
(Vainne spent 20 minutes last night running around the ice canyons in ef lost looking for halas--I kept thinking, wow I'm glad this isnt Wythe...then Vox died, Naggy had already fallen and I called it a night. That was fun too--just a different kind of fun.) <p><b>Vainne K'harmicdeva<br>

Some nice posts popped, im glad they did.<br>
<br>
I may have sound pro blue server in my posts and it was intended, because i feel everyone that plays on PVP have close to no respect for those who plays on other server, and after that they pretend to be more mature, i played on RZ, TZ and SZ, and each time i was there i often heard in OOC how blubies are crybabies and countless other names, which shows the complete opposite of what they pretend to be.<br>
<br>
What i tried to do is make some realize that EQ is challenging in both types of game, no matter which server you start, there is no better ones, SZ isnt as hardcore pvp as rallos zek, that i can tell, by having tried both, Rallos Zek you even have to watch your back for your own race or deity players, which makes all more adrenaline boosting then any other pvp servers. Although its very true that SZ one character rule really help bring down those lvl 10 in fungi tunic with 150MR that ive seen on both rallos and TZ, which imo is awesome.<br>
But nevertheless it will not stop those hardcore powergamer such as ruin from doing it with 2 different accounts, and im sure after a while we will start seeing them, as there is no item loot rule.<br>
<br>
Finally all i will add is that, mostly everyone play both types of EQ, for different reasons, and those that call bluebies morons, idiots or whatever else their genious mind can find, dont talk about what you ignore like if you lived it, there is great people on both server. And there is over 30k players that plays on blue server everyday, and no its not because they are afraid to come kill you on a red one, its because they dont enjoy the constant vulgarity and childish things that happen there. Well truthfully i speak for myself as i have witnessed it.. Id attach a screenshot of what someone told me right after i killed them... but cant seem to be able to do so<br>
<br>
random guy you pked : You motherfucker, you suck, im gonna come back and kill you, you will regret it. (i never saw him again, was just words, though i was hoping to meet him again)<br>
nother random guy you pked : fuck man, i wasnt ready, your so gay you cant even fight fair, go back on bluebie server you moron. ( Not much to say about this one, i got him while he was crossing kithicor forest, he was a red con on SZ, so at least 8lvl above me... poor him he wasnt ready, so im a bluebie guy now, shrug. Bit later he came back with his druid buddy and they managed to push me out of Kithicor and i died from Druid dot after zoning.)<br>
<br>
Even though those useless words, i enjoyed giving them the smackdown, just i know how some may feel when they dislike the maturity on those red server, if they were roleplaying, then they sure need some more pratice...<br>

I think I kind of agree more with the red players' posts. As I've stated before, this is a game where alot of people brag and boast endlessly about how their guild was able to kill so and so dragon or so and so god in such and such seconds. And every LAN cafe I go to I always run into someone who says something like, &quot;Hey whats that? Everquest? What level are you? PFFFT! Yer still under 30? Man, I have like 4 characters at 60.&quot;<br>
<br>
If these people think so highly of their characters and respective guilds, they should bring them over to Sullon, start up a goodie guild and take over the Velious zones from the newts. I'll count the seconds while they raid.<br>
<br>
The things I think I am missing are more along the lines of:<br>
<br>
-walking around all the zones in Kunark<br>
-seeing kedge<br>
-jumping from that long long fall everyone keeps talking about<br>
-dying in a plane raid (again and again)<br>
<br>
Heck, I've never even grouped in Befallen (I've been there on Rallos, but didn't stay too long).<br>

First of all not everyone had full banded within the first week, only the people who had a plan going into the live release and followed through with it got well equipped early on. Yes, some people are in the 50s now but that doesn't mean they can get whatever equipment they want, you think a level 50 good is going to be able to get any of the gear from kunark or velious? Hostile territory is a big factor on PvP servers, it's much harder to get equipment when you can't go wherever you want to and find a group to help you farm items.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Wess also said ..*High level loot zones are off limits unless you reserved it in advance *<br>

The calendar planning thing is from blue servers, mostly due to overcrowding where all high level zones are camped 24/7, PvP servers are under populated and for the most part if your team does control a zone, you can plan a raid with very little chance of running into another raiding party.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> getting a runed bone fork on a blue server is just as useful as on a red one<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This simply isn't the case, on a blue server you have your FR gear, your MR gear, your CR gear, your AC gear, your stat gear (depending on class) and your dueling gear, with maybe some PR and DR as well. On SZ you have PvP gear, this consists of having all resists as high as possible with everything else secondary to those. An item with 10 MR will be something I'll wear 100% of the time, not just when I'm 50+ and on a raid with that specific resistance requirement. <br>
<br>
PvP can happen any time, you don't have the luxury of telling that druid to please refrain from snaring you while you run to the bank and get your MR gear so you can fight him properly. Getting that RBF at level 20 won't do a whole lot for you on a blue server.. you could probably just stick with FS and bronze from 1-30s and suffer very little for it, but on SZ it can mean the difference between life and death every minute of every hour you're logged on. Make no mistake, gear is much more important in PvP than in PvE except in the most extreme cases.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for getting higher level and better gear, isnt that the goal of any RPG?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No, the goal on SZ is PvP, levels and gear are a means to this end, not an end of their own. On blue servers levels and gear are all that matter, they are the end purpose, on SZ, levels and gear are there so you can PvP, which is the real reason we're here.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What are the pvp skills? funny i never heard of those on any board<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->So you're saying PvP takes no skill? In PvE I can hit auto attack and leave my computer to go get a drink half the time, if you don't think PvP requires any more skill than stand up, hit auto attack, loot corpse, sit down, repeat, then there’s something terribly wrong.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> if your a tank you can hit things, your just as good as anyone else...

Sometimes the druid will win, sometimes the warrior will win, skill is what makes the difference.

In PvP clerics die first, if you see one you go after it until it dies, then worry about your other enemies, clerics have to know how to survive, there’s no taunting mobs off, root doesn't stick to players with decent MR and you can only be invulnerable for so long, whether your group lives or dies in PvP is often dependant on the skill of your cleric.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> i dont think a moron who doesn’t know how to fight back an NPC will live long either... since its the same game with the same principles on how to fight, PC or not...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Fighting an NPC is infinitely easier than fighting a PC, anyone can PvE from 1-60, not anyone can take down an even con enemy, and definitely not everyone will be successful in a large PvP battle.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In EQ you cannot dodge spells no matter how hard you try, its not possible, you can only resist them, same goes for Pvp or PvE.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Wrong. First it depends on what type of spell, bolt spells can be dodged by hiding behind terrain. Second you can use water, if you're under water and someone tries to cast a spell from above water it won't work, just jump in when you see a wizard start casting that big nuke on you, the same works if they’re in the water and you’re not. Finally you have range, if you're pretty far away from someone and they stop to cast, you can easily step out of range to avoid getting hit and then close back in and engage, you could also zone but zonetag is a whole other issue. Not only can you dodge spells, you can also counter them, spells like stun and shock of lightning are excellent at keeping a caster in mid cast from hitting you with a spell. With no other alternative you can use invisability or hide to remove yourself from an opponents target box, this will not stop a cast in progress but so long as you don't get targeted again you won't get hit with any more spells.  This is a good example of how PvP is more complex than PvE.<br>

<br>
Right, well its funny how it doesnt seem like it when you play on SZ. i played there for the first couple of months and being a new server of course people rush to level up... but they never stop... the goal seem to get lvl 60 before anyone else, then go kill the uber mob and get uber loot before everyone else. Thats exactly like a blue server. If i gotta level up a character for one year till i hit 60 before i can actually start pvping, then its hella boring to play on there. How long has SZ been up now? 3 months? i lost track of time, and too lazy to check on Verant website, but i know it hasnt been that long and ALOT are in the high 40 and 50s... that is some major leveling up, if the goal was truely to PVP, then they should level alot slower then they normally would on Blue servers. BUt pvp is not the goal, its just an added option you have, you can show off your uber l33tness by slaying green cons.... or owning a zone..<br>
<br>
That said Vachir last post was a great one, true you can avoid spells, and dodge one type of spells(bolt line) but its silly to cast that in pvp on someone who is aware of your prescence, perhaps a good spell to start a fight on an unwary opponent since it has a very long range. The water thing i knew about it already, though there isnt water in every zones, plus now with the crouching insta break cast, you can avoid wasting mana on someone who jump in water. Also the Warrior vs druid, is not really related on skills, actually the druid should own the warrior UNLESS, he got nice resist gear. If having nice resist gear is skill, then yes PVP requires lots of skills, and loads of it.<br>
<br>
Also you say you can go afk for 15mins while fighting a kobold... True i can do that too, try it on a dragon on for size... but the case here is that PC will move around and not stay in melee range unless they are melee as well, or have a clear advantages in melee damage over you... they will joust it out, hence the fact that 2hander are lots more efficent in PVP. But running around does not require much skills i can do that, any newbie can run... its easy. I certainly agree that massive war in PVP must be alot of fun, though i havent seen one in almost 2months i played on SZ,(exept some GM event in WC). <br>
<br>
Once more i gotta say it, Gear and Levels is all that matters in PVP as well... and secondly comes organization which can prove effective as well, much like killing NPC always kill the healer first or your in for a long and hard fight, the big difference is that the npc will not try and kill your healer first.<br>
<br>
Even though i post all this and try and prove how PVP isnt all that, i know its alot more fun then PvE, the thing is, until i see players actually trying to kill each other instead of trying to level up faster and gettin uber loot on a red server, i might consider it again... only a handful of them like me actually went ahead and tried to find a good fight, others were just too busy power leveling to even care show up and fight it out, guess at lvl 30 your still not powerful or confident enough to start pvping, need 50+.... shrug<br>
<br>
Threepy<br>
(lost interest in pvp the day he saw the average level of the server, and the big lack of PVP there was, if i wanted to powerlevel and get uber loot id have stayed on blue server) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2630.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2716.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2719.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.threadControl?topicID=2630.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2630.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2630.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sullonzektavernfrm1">General Discussion<option value="sullonzektavernfrm2">Marketplace<option value="sullonzektavernfrm3">No Holds Barred<option value="sullonzektavernfrm4">Guilds of Sullon Zek<option value="sullonzektavernfrm5">Roleplay<option value="sullonzektavernfrm6">Testing Grounds<option value="sullonzektavernfrm7">Administration Station</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern>Sullon Zek Tavern</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Sullon Zek PvP Stats !!</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.entercasino.com/main.cgi?refererID=502600>What's your game?
