She knew she shouldn’t complain. After all, she was lucky to have this dead end job as a clerk in an out of the way corner of the mighty Omni-Tek organization. But, still, she could dream. <br>
<br>
She would dream. <br>
<br>
If it was not for her dreams, she would not have even been able to rise to the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lofty</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> position of clerk. Others might mock the position and the salary, but Natasha was grateful for the step up in her life. But it didn’t mean she was satisfied. <br>
<br>
Natasha grew up poor in a sector of Omni 1’s trade district known as the &quot;Russian Quarter.&quot; What &quot;Russian&quot; meant, she was not sure, but if she was to believe the old folk tales, Russia was a country from a far away planet long destroyed by its own people tens of thousands of years ago. The survivors made their way here and started over. The story was too outlandish to be true, to be sure. But many of her &quot;people,&quot; as they often referred to themselves, believed this story deeply. Some even went so far as to have &quot;natural&quot; children rather than proper genetically engineered children. Natasha was glad that she had a proper Solitus body, even if she was raised in the &quot;low class family unit&quot; rather than the proper Omni-Tek education and development programs. She almost felt sorry for the poor, sickly, inbred miscretins who’s &quot;parents&quot; refused to comply with proper genetic engineering. <br>
<br>
Being raised as she was, she had actually learned to speak the &quot;Russian&quot; language first instead of the proper language. It was defiant the way her &quot;people&quot; rebelled against the Omni-Tek way of life and she hated it. It took her years to learn how to live correctly and speak the right language. She had to study hard and for many hours to achieve a proper education that would afford her the ability to get even this simple clerks job. Many of her &quot;people&quot; were proud of her, at how hard she worked and to be possibly the only person from the &quot;Russian Quarter&quot; to ever gain significant employment with Omni-Tek. <br>
<br>
But among the supporters were an equal number of critics who proclaimed her a sell-out and a traitor to her people and culture. Her father was among her critics. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Some &quot;culture.&quot; </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> She thought to herself. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Impoverished, beholden to ancient traditions outdated eons ago and singing their stupid songs in their stupid language with no future to speak of. They refuse to see the beautiful world that Omni-Tek strives to provide us. They are no better than the Clan scum.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Natasha refused to be condemned to that life. <br>
<br>
She pushed aside the thoughts of her past, her origins. She wanted to concentrate on the future. A future she knew would be bright and successful. She began to read, again, through the file she had found, had been searching for. The file that would change her life. <br>
<br>
The daydream began to materialize. <br>
 <p><a href=" http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/"><img src="http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/img0.gif" border="0"></a><br>I, Mistress Ezra Darkreign, reserve the right to ramble on, speak incoherently, make spelling errors and other such mistakes when posting.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umistressezra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress Ezra</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#778899>(7/15/01 10:35:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/faoemarrfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/img17.gif height=200 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Origins of Ezra</span><hr size=1> Step one was complete. Natasha knew this file was the key she needed to get a jump on her career. She told her closest friends of the plan to get their support and help as well as offering them a chance to be a part of what would make her, and their, career. Though some of them told her that her plan would not work, she knew they simply could not grasp the scope of what she was proposing. Some foolishly threatened to turn her in. But nothing she planned was illegal in anyway. In fact, she would be hailed as a hero if she could make it work. <br>
<br>
But trouble makers were trouble makers and a few less friends made little difference in the grand scheme of her plan. She wasn’t above &quot;getting her hands dirty&quot; and rather quite enjoyed it as a test of her abilities. To be ruthless, cunning and successful in taking the lives of those troublemakers merely set the stage for what was to come. <br>
<br>
The unexpected stage two was complete and she could move forward with her plan as originally intended. <br>
<br>
The first phase was to find a long forgotten project which was still funded and supported, at least on paper, by Omni-Tek. A major corporation the size of Omni-Tek had volumes of these cases and projects long forgotten, waiting to be closed or set in motion. Any industrious person who could get themselves placed in charge of one of those projects could easily find themselves on the fast track toward financial and career success. <br>
<br>
It was all a matter of finding the right project. <br>
<br>
Some of the projects were forgotten for a reason. Foolish and inane could best describe some of those projects, funded simply because someone had a friend high up the corporate ladder. Or, and more likely, that someone had uncovered some dirt on said corporate official and got a nothing project funded simply to live a life of ease, showing up to work to play holo-games while collecting fat payrolls. A few years go by and the whole affair, including the project, is lost and forgotten like the culture of an ancient alien race. The automated human resources department continues to write checks that simply disappear against the vast volume of the Omni-Tek budget. <br>
<br>
But some projects were brilliant. Some were cut down and forgotten intentionally. Such was the case of the project Natasha had uncovered. She looked at the title again and smiled. <br>
<br>
Codename: Darkness <br>
<br>
The Darkness program was created a hundred years ago by a dedicated and radical man named Decker. But Decker’s project stepped on the toes of a bureaucrat who headed a similar project, but far less effective and with a far greater budget. The bureaucrat had Decker assassinated… or at least Natasha believed that is what happened. The Darkness project quickly disappeared just as Decker had. Over the years, the bureaucrat died and slowly his project was closed down. Now Darkness was a ripe gem waiting for someone to run it. <br>
<br>
All Natasha had to do was to get herself appointed to run the Darkness Project. <br>
<br>
The mantra of the Darkness project stood out on the page as Natasha schemed. &quot;Complete Eradication: Zero Retaliation Acceptable.&quot; Darkness was a covert operations commission that allowed Decker to higher highly skilled assassins, cyber-jockies, spies, agents and soldiers of many talents to take the fight to the heart of the Clan rebels, leaving Omni-Tek standing unhindered to expand across the wastes of Rubi-ka, creating an ideal society for every citizen. <br>
<br>
It was a beautiful vision. <br>
<br>
It was an achievable dream provided she could find fanatical and devoted soldiers to work within the autonomy that Darkness provided. It was the autonomy that made Darkness perfect. It would keep Darkness out of the bureaucratic red tape, answering only to the laws of Omni-Tek… and most of those could be compromised given sufficient proof of successful anti-clan activities. With the proper planing, strikes could be made by Darkness, completely destroying a given objective. <br>
<br>
&quot;Complete Eradication: Zero Retaliation Acceptable.&quot; Natasha mulled over the mantra. It was a good idea, in theory. But no plan is perfect. Something can always go wrong. &quot;Complete Eradication&quot; seemed rather redundant to her. She figured she could eliminate the &quot;Complete&quot; in the title and leave &quot;Eradication: Zero Retaliation Acceptable.&quot; Though, she figured there was a better mantra out there… but that was hardly important at this time.  However, she did like the acronym better. E.Z.R.A. <br>
<br>
Natasha smiled. Tomorrow night she would launch phase three on an unsuspecting bureaucrat and would take on her codename as the leader of Darkness. Ezra! <br>
<br>

She was always alert to what was going on around her. She had to be. Every thing someone did was relevant to who they were. If one could simply learn the quirks and tendencies of another, you could easily control that person. <br>
<br>
Demetra was a Meta-physist. A spiritualist for the modern age. A Techno-Shaman, as someone once said and it had stuck in her mind.  A Street Priest who understood the inner-workings of big city culture, which was like a living, breathing organism unto itself with each individual like a cell making up the whole. <br>
<br>
But some might say it was the thrill of the nightlife, fast and furious living, every bit as addictive as any drug that could be purchased on the streets.  Each ally was its own world, with its own rules, gangs and leaders.<br>
<br>
Demetra loved it all.  The good as well as the bad, from the lowliest, half dead, drug abuser strung out on meta-meth to the most cultured aristocrat living in their sky high penthouse who pissed over the edge because they could get away with anything.  <br>
<br>
Demetra glanced back into her hand.  She was intrigued by a small card she got from a “runner” earlier this evening.<br>
<br>
“Do you want to do your part?”  Was all the card had written on it.  On the back was an address of a corporate office and the name “Ezra” signed below.<br>
 <p><a href=" http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/"><img src="http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/img0.gif" border="0"></a><br>I, Mistress Ezra Darkreign, reserve the right to ramble on, speak incoherently, make spelling errors and other such mistakes when posting.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umistressezra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress Ezra</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#778899>(7/16/01 8:42:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/faoemarrfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/img17.gif height=200 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: And So It Begins (A Story)</span><hr size=1> Natasha knocked on the door to her future. She was wearing a tight, red oriental style dress. Growing up the way she had, outside of proper culture, she had little experience with her body in terms of attractiveness. It wasn’t until she stepped into the much larger culture of mainstream society that she began to understand her appearance and how she might use it to her advantage. However, it made her feel terribly uncomfortable. <br>
<br>
But nothing would stop her from her goal. If it meant pandering to the base instincts of men who could shape her destiny, then nothing would stop her from doing so. <br>
<br>
Then the door slid open and the older bureaucratic gentleman stood before her in only a silken bath robe with a wry &quot;cat to a mouse&quot; grin on his face. <br>
<br>
&quot;Come in my pet.&quot; He said in a lower register than he normally spoke with. <br>
<br>
Natasha slinked into the room, the satin-silk fibers of her dress shimmering as they conformed to the movements of her body. The bureaucrat emitted a soft growl as she passed by, as if it were a prelude to a night of wild, animalistic pleasure. She quietly hoped her dress would not betray her by highlighting her crawling skin. She flashed him a wry smile of her own and sauntered strait to the bar. <br>
<br>
He was all to eager to pour her a drink, taking it as a sign of abandoning the restraints of the office-place. She simply needed something to help calm her nerves. She absolutely had to be in control of herself, there was simply too much at stake. She thought about the cards she had sent out to various &quot;elements&quot; that she felt would be needed to build the Darkness project and now felt foolish at having jumped the gun. She had not yet gotten the project. But Natasha had been extremely confident. <br>
<br>
The bureaucrat spoke unendingly about himself and his current projects. He even went so far as to toss out the possibility of Natasha getting a raise and working more closely with him. In a way, Natasha felt sorry for him. He was a moderately attractive man but age and stress had begun to show in his face. His &quot;salt and pepper&quot; hair was thinning in an unattractive way and he was obviously over weight from drinking too much and eating too many fatty foods despite the miraculous fat burning products on the market. She knew he had been in several failed marriages due to the pressures of his job. He was high enough on the corporate ladder to have great power, but not high enough to trust his underlings to complete the work satisfactorily and spent many long nights toiling over case notes, memos, and reports. <br>
<br>
Natasha actually enjoyed the hard work and welcomed the opportunity to put herself into that kind of position. But she did not want a job like he had. Power he certainly had. But he did not have the ability to pave his own road, so to speak, where his career was concerned. Directives were passed down the ladder through him and reports were analyzed and then forwarded to those who would make actual decisions on the knowledge he passed upwards. She wanted to be the one providing the direction in her little slice of Omni-Tek. <br>
<br>
He paused. <br>
<br>
Natasha knew it was the time that he would make his move. Quickly, just as he began to rise from his seat, she placed her foot in his crotch, holding him down. Surprise slowly turned to a devilish grin as his fingers eagerly glided over her ankle, then sliped the sandal-like shoe off. His fingers worked her soft flesh as he massaged her foot. It felt wonderful. <br>
<br>
&quot;Have I been a bad boy?&quot; He asked slyly. <br>
<br>
&quot;As a matter of fact, you have.&quot; Natasha answered as she slipped her hand slowly to a broach pinned to her shoulder. She removed the broach, watching his eyes light up as he expected to watch the dress begin to fall away from her body. But the broach was holding something intact other than her dress. She flipped open a small compartment and pulled out a tiny holo emitter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dirty pictures?&quot; He asked, hopefully. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes.&quot; She answered and flipped the emitter on and began cycling through the images. Suddenly he realized what the pictures were. <br>
<br>
&quot;You bitch.&quot; He growled, jumping to his feet. &quot;Stupid little girl. Do you think to blackmail me?&quot; He asked, glancing again at the images of him in compromising sexual activities. <br>
<br>
Natasha smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;You should have done your homework, bitch. I am not currently married or in a position that your stupid sexual pictures can damage me.&quot; He growled at her, taking on a different kind of predator-like look than he had earlier this night. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look again.&quot; Natasha said softly. <br>
<br>
He looked at the holos more carefully. Suddenly he realized what … no, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> who</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the holos were of. A year ago, company picnic, high ranking corporate official going through rough times with his wife. Wife decides to get back at her husband by seducing him. They realize their bad judgement only too late. He thought it was buried in the past. <br>
<br>
&quot;It does me no good what so ever for you to loose your job over this.&quot; Natasha said reassuringly as she watched his face sour. <br>
<br>
&quot;What do you want.&quot; He growls, looking at her with hate in his eyes… the predator now caged. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nothing really, nothing that will harm you in any way. I want you to assign me to head the Darkness project.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Darkness? Never heard of it.&quot; He says, liking the sound of the payoff. <br>
<br>
&quot;No, of course not. It is about 100 years old.&quot; She says, pulling out a computer memory crystal and handing it to him. &quot;You can claim it as a quality check. You found the program without a leader and assigned me to verify the program or close it. Simple as that. It is a win-win situation. If the program goes well, you are merited for the quality check. If it fails, then you successfully close a useless program wasting company creds for nearly a century.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Is that all?&quot; He asks, feeling relieved by the proposition. <br>
<br>
&quot;That and remember, I still have the originals of these.&quot; She says, indicating the holos. &quot;Don’t screw with me so I have any reason to screw with you.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I am glad we could settle this peacefully. You are a sharp woman. Is there anything I can do to help your new project, Director Dupaski?&quot; He asks regaining a bit of his frisky composure. <br>
<br>
&quot;Not yet. But if you really want to help, I am sure there are things that can be done that will mutually benefit both our careers.&quot; She said as she stood. <br>
<br>
&quot;You don’t have to leave yet.&quot; He cooed. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I do. A girl cant give up all of her aces in one night.&quot; She purred back then sauntered out of the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Natasha was appalled.  The other woman was short, like herself, and even looked a little like Natasha, provided you take away all the gothic make-up.  Natasha hated the “gothic” look.  It reminded her too much of the low-life meta-meth adrenaline fiends who shoot up in back alleys, wildly rampaging through the city babbling incomprehensibly and killing without discretion.  Why Omni put up with those mutoids was beyond her.   <br>
<br>
Demetra seemed to optimize everything Natasha hated on the seedier side of life in Omni controlled cities.  Her general look spoke of rebellion.  She had the look of both cheep hooker with her long black trench coat contrasting the garish white face paint (with black highlights) and fish-net stockings, yet she carried herself with the statuesque grace of authority.  Demetra’s eyes were knowing and piercing.  She looked around the room as if taking in every nook and niche then filed the information away for later use.  <br>
<br>
Natasha saw more to the woman standing before her than her appearance let on.  Demetra looked at Natasha and raised an eyebrow.  <br>
<br>
“Come, sit down.  Let us talk.”  Natasha said evenly.  Demetra crossed over to the chair before Natasha’s plasti-oak desk and dropped into it rather ungracefully.  <br>
<br>
“What’s my part?”  Demetra said looking Natasha strait in the eyes.<br>
<br>
“My name is Ezra.”  Natasha began her well rehearsed speech which told of the Darkness project.  She studied Demetra’s reactions as she spoke, but the woman was emotionless, like an old 200 model android.  The complete lack of output from the gothic woman told Natasha a great deal about her practiced control and secretive nature.   All of the research Natasha had done on Demetra was confirmed.  Natasha was very thorough.  <br>
<br>
“So.” Demetra said at the conclusion of Natasha’s speech.  “You want me to be your ‘right arm,’ is that what you are asking me?”<br>
<br>
“I did not say that.”  Natasha said evenly.  <br>
<br>
“Yes you did.  You said it with your eyes.  You want me.  And in more ways than just the Darkness project.”<br>
<br>
Natasha raised an eyebrow questioningly.  <br>
<br>
“Admit it.  You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   want</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> me.  You lust for my body.” Demetra stood and let her trench coat fall open, revealing naked flesh beneath.  Demetra smirked as Natasha recoiled in disgust.  The display of emotion pleased Demetra.  She was able to push through the prim lady’s measured responses.  Demetra knew that Natasha was not lusting after her.  But it was a great way to test her probable employer.  It also helped to let those who were in authority over you have the impression that they, among all others, were the one who could hide their true intent from you.  It never hurt to let the boss <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   think</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> they had all the aces.  <br>
<br>
Before Natasha had gotten half way through her story, Demetra knew that the woman before her had studied her, followed her and had planned for her every reaction.  In so doing, the corporate woman had to have uncovered her uncanny ability to ‘read’ people.  <br>
<br>
“Deny yourself, as you have always done, for the greater good.”  Demetra said with a smirk.  “But when you are ready to taste the forbidden pleasures, I am here for you, waiting, Natasha.”<br>
<br>
Natasha’s eyes went wide.  “How do you know my name?” <br>
<br>
“Come now.  You’re not the only one to do research.”  Demetra said with a grin.  She had given Natasha the trump card with her feigned lust angle and now needed to prove her worth. <br>
<br>
“Demetra, you will call me Ezra.  Is that clear?”  Natasha said evenly, regaining her composure.<br>
<br>
“I have not even agreed to join you yet.  I will do nothing.  However, you will call me Mistress Ezra if you wish for me to join and will continue to do so if I so chose.”  Demetra said, throwing down an aggressive card.<br>
<br>
The intent was not missed.<br>
<br>
“But why take my name?”  Natasha asked, and for the first time the words flowed naturally rather than practiced.  <br>
<br>
“Because.”  Demetra answered<br>
<br>
“Because why?”  Natasha pressed.<br>
<br>
“Just because.”  Demetra replied.<br>
<br>
This infuriated Natasha.  She was being mocked now by the painted woman and she did not like it.  <br>
<br>
Natasha realized why the woman made the demand.  It wasn’t a whim but a measured counter response to her statement earlier about not asking Demetra to be her ‘right arm.’  Duel Ezras would connate a partnership to future recruits.  Demetra wasn’t really wondering if Natasha was asking her to be that ‘right arm.’  She was determined to be it.  At least she now knew that Demetra wanted into the Darkness project.  <br>
<br>
The woman was sharp, Natasha had to give her that.  And if the rest of her research on Demetra was as accurate as what she had discovered already, then perhaps it would not be a bad idea to have the woman as her right arm.  <br>
<br>
“Agreed, Mistress Ezra.  Welcome aboard.”  Natasha said with a smile.<br>
<br>
“A pleasure.  And more of that to come.”  Demetra said licking her lips.<br>
<br>
Natasha smiled warily.  &quot;The first order of business is to find recruits who share the vision of the Darkness project.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know just where to start.&quot;  Demetra said with a wry grin.<br>
<br>
So did Natasha, who returned the grin.  <p><a href=" http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/"><img src="http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/img0.gif" border="0"></a><br>I, Mistress Ezra Darkreign, reserve the right to ramble on, speak incoherently, make spelling errors and other such mistakes when posting.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umistressezra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress Ezra</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/19/01 2:39:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umistressezra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mistress Ezra</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#778899>(7/19/01 2:35:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/faoemarrfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mistressezra.homestead.com/files/img17.gif height=200 width=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well...</span><hr size=1> Well that's it for now.
