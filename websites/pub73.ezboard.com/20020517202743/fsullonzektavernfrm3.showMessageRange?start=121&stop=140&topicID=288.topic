<br>
Reality check people. Toab you are a shit sniper, aiming to shoot your load on any little boy you see.<br>
You are a fucking pathetic piece of piss, if I may para-phrase, &quot;self-esteem aint my strong suit&quot;?<br>
<br>
Haha. Good. Go fuck an electrical socket and Ill be sure to turn out my lights so you can squeeze out every little extra bit of voltage.<br>
<br>
<br>
To summarize, Vladde Still = Adultery taction who likes to be fucked up the ass by women because he doesnt have the physical strength to resist<br>
<br>
Toab = shit bag, but is better than his boozehag wife because being a man means you think with your head and not your brain sometimes.  But at least he throws off the assinine suggestions his shit bag wife throws out. <br>
<br>
So where does that leave Toab to me? hm... I enjoy flaming and such and would have done more of it here if Toab and Cyp hadnt spammed like chapters from a movie stars diary but anyway Toab the point of me flaming you was, for you to not be a dumbfuck and do what your dumbfuck old lady implied, and fuck around on her.<br>
<br>
Hopefully you are not, as you seem to claim. And if your wife ignores you  at home for time with your daughter, ignore her for your daughter because daughters = daddies little girl  forever <br>
and wifes = ball and chain/biotch who divorces you for all your worth/ hopefully die before you do.<br>
<br>
And lastly shit hose, putting up disgusting pictures does not make you a flamer, it makes you a farg for knowing where to get all those pictures. and they are fucking disgusting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You can laugh at that or flame it all you want but I think i have a right to be disgusted by gross shit otherwise it means I am so fucked up as to be immune to it.<br>

Not very good Jo. You're losing your touch.<br>
<br>
Does this mean, you're finally getting in touch with your Homosexual nature, and admiting to yourself that you like cock? Is your female side showing through? Looks that way.<br>
<br>
Now you need to finish your self healing process. Why don't you head on down to the local fag bar, and tell everyone in there to line up, because you want them all to train you until they can't get it up anymore. Just think Jo! Hours upon hours of steady cock pounding into your asshole! How many times will you cum? How many times will they cum? You know you'll love it, so give it a try tonight. I don't want to hear the detail though, K? <br>
<br>
Just a brief thank you to all of us here on NHB for helping you find yourself is more than enough.<br>

<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  jodick...little more coherency in your posts would be appreciated, not required but appreciated.  Interesting way you have describing my family situation. I guess being Canadian and all means you have to put things in their simplest terms. I guess that works for you.  You seem a little off with the vulgarity so I can only guess that you weren't able to cum inside rover last night like you were able to before. Don't worry, the Ice Princess will take of that for you. You had her pussy juices flowing yesterday for the first time in 10 years for her. I think it pretty much shocked her.  Well, regardless, I will keep my &quot;boozehag&quot; wife (shit, and Cyp thinks I am a misogynist..what about this fruit?), and you can keep your bevy of underage boys and homeless animals.<br>

WTF? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I don't really give a flying fuck what you think about me, but it has become clear to me and everyone else here that you must care what everyone thinks about you.  You one serious fucked up adolescent.  My family life growing up was no picnic, but it sounds to me yours was an absolute horror. Hell, I never realized I was angry until I hit 25 or so. You are barely 20 and it seems to me you are about go postal at any second. I bet if we scanned your back yard we would find the carcasses of small animals that you tortured at a younger age.  I may need help, but seriously d00d, you are one fucked up individual.  Don't think for one moment that any of your future posts will go unscathed. You are pariah, you don't like, and you are acting out because of your situation. As to the point of your flaming me, read the context of my post and you will understand that I couldn't and can't do those things. Sure, I will talk to my wife about why she suggested such things, but I would never act on it. I don't think I would be able to look at my daughter in the eye again if I did.  As far as Vladde is concerned, I don't agree with how he is getting his ass-play, but I won't condemn him for it.  For I doubt there is one married man in this forum that hasn't at least thought about getting some strange on their hang-low at one time or another.<br>

OMFG!!! JODick is human afterall? Nah, must be the lithium he is on.  My wife doesnt ignore me, she wants to spend a majority of the time with our daughter because time is a precious commodity. It's not like I zone out when they are together, I am usually there too (except in the mornings when I run).  I spend alot of 1-on-1 time with my daughter because mom is either on a trip or she has to work on the weekends.  It is truly beginning to get under my wife's skin that our daughter calls me when she is scared or upset now...so I think that is having some bearing on her psyche.  My wife isnt a ball&amp;chain, but she can be too overbearing and aggressive when it comes to my spare time (she wants me to go to bed the same time she does instead of playing games or reading...but I cant go to bed at 8 pm, so sue me).  As far as divorce goes, she is worth a helluva lot more than I am (science doesn't pay much considering the education you need to get to the higher levels, and business execs with minimal education but alot common sense get paid bucket full of money..system is skewed I think),  the final point if she keeps up this type A personality on the move shit she will defintely die before me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Jimmy Buffet is for when I really need to relax. Plus with the weather he fits into a lazy summer day better than the bands I listed above...plus my daughter can sing part of son of a son of a sailor now..it's pretty cute. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I pretty much like all music, there's not one genre that I at least don't have one CD of.<br>
<br>
I have found that thrash metal and heavy metal are great to train to, especially those long (2-3 hour) runs on the weekends.  I just mix something for the mini disk and I am off.<br>
<br>
1.System of a down --great music..new CD out on 9/4<br>
2.Tool -- I don't know I have aenima, but I haven't really got into them. I dont see the appeal either. Their concert here sold out in less then 10 mintues (30 k seat arena). Besides, can you really take lachrymologists seriously..well, at least, I can't<br>
3. Deftones --- awesome, saw them with Godsmack a few weeks ago. One of the few nights I was allowed to go out with friends.<br>
4. Papa Roach -- Locals, and unfortunately one hit wonders...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Love, joy, heaven<br>
