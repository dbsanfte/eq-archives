I cannot log on at all.  I was on the phone with tech support for over an hour yesterday (Monday 12/24); when I got on the phone I was having trouble zoning into Kunark; when I got off the phone, I could not log on at all - go figure - LOL.<br>
<br>
I have cable modem now, so connection is screaming fast compared to old dial-up.  I'm running AMD 475 Mhz with 384 megs of RAM and RIVA TNT2 32meg video card.<br>
<br>
When I try to log on - I get to the portion where the song plays - the song plays, and no messages scroll down at the bottom.  The song finishes and just stays on that screen forever.<br>
<br>
Has anyone seen this happen before?  Or anything resembling it?  I'm very very frustrated with this and frankly, I'm ready to just call it quits and cancel my account.  I've upgraded my system and connected to cable modem, all so I can play this game, and I still can't play.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions would be more than appreciated - thank you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uiblacie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IBLacie</A> at: 12/25/01 9:17:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bdisciplesofdrinal.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gdar>gdar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Official Mental Child</span><br> <font color=#993300>(12/25/01 11:43:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fdisciplesofdrinalfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Can't Log On At All</span><hr size=1> Well, what you explain is typical of what happens if you load more luclin models than you can fit in memory.. rather than gracefuly displaying an error message it just dies while loading the char models.<br>
<br>
There's a new game exe patch this morning with no explanation, so the memory needs of the game may have gone up a bit. They have also been having serious problems with crashing on the AMD k6 family of processors, which it sounds like you have (based on clockrate). I've got an Athlon Thunderbird 900 and haven't had that problem yet.<br>
<br>
I'd try the following things (in order):<br>
1) reboot the machine and try starting the game from a fresh reboot. If you have 8 dozen little task-tray widgets, kill some off.<br>
2) try disabling some luclin models if you have them on.<br>
3) try disabling sound, emote animations, dynamic lighting, etc from the &quot;options&quot; button before you log in.<br>
<br>
I can still log in at the moment without problems.<br>

<br>
One thing u could try, if u can disable it, is maybe try loading without the new stuff, which uses all heaps of the your mem. U know, to see whether sol and the new models is causing the problem.<br>
<br>
Gdar's number 3 sounds good, disable all the options before i log in, u can enable them later if u are successful. Hope u get the problem fixed Lacie, goodluck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fbe5b4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uiblacie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IBLacie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#993300>(12/25/01 8:36:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fdisciplesofdrinalfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Can't Log On At All</span><hr size=1> Well, I tried all that:<br>
<br>
Disabled all start-up items (I usually do that anyway);<br>
Turned off every available option, including sound;<br>
Uninstalled and reinstalled the entire program, including expansions and patches (aaack).<br>
<br>
None of this is working - the same thing continues happening.<br>
<br>
What happens is I log on the normal way and it gets to the part where the song plays - normally a dialogue of nonsense starts running on the bottom; this is not happening.  The song finishes and that's it - I'm looking at the buxom lady and the tiger (hmmmm bestial ideas at Sony?) and the program is evidently locked up.  Can't Ctrl-F4 out or Ctrl-Alt-Del out or Alt-Tab.  The only way out at that point is to power down.<br>
<br>
I am able to log on to the chat servers, but of course, people there absolutely do not give a damn.   (Yeah, I'm fed up with that idea - evidently.)<br>
<br>
I suspect I am a victim of the AMD K6 processor problem.  It appears that I am not the only one.  I've been home now for 4 days with the flu and really just wanted to play, and have not been able to  &lt;slice of cheese with that whine?&gt;.  So, I will try, once again, to contact the mental giants at tech support from work on Wednesday.<br>
<br>
Thanks for trying to help you guys. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uakenzi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Akenzi</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.animationlibrary.com/Animation9/Cartoons/cuteness.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Leader and Dork Extraordinaire</span><br> <font color=#993300>(12/26/01 9:09:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fdisciplesofdrinalfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Can't Log On At All</span><hr size=1> Ack any luck Lacie?

I've blown out all video drivers and reinstalled DirectX 8.1 multiple times and tweaked the registry and I just don't know what else to do.  Tonight I will take my computer out for a walk to my computer tech friend's house and see what he can do - he tried some stuff on it last night via PC Anywhere which was a trip for me - watching my screen do stuff without me - lol.<br>
<br>
As for Ceraph, I'm happy he's progressing, but I can't keep up if I can't log on  ;-(<br>
<br>
Since I was home sick with the flu for Christmas, it was my intent to play both Monday and Tuesday, but this of course did not occur, so I'm at level 21 and holding.<br>
<br>
I really am about a step away from canceling my account.  Sony and Verant do not give a damn about their subscribers, and each time I have a problem, this becomes more and more apparent to me.  I guess one subscriber is insignificant when you have tens of thousands.  This is disheartening to me, to say the least.  I'm seriously thinking about checking out Dark Age of Camelot - which evidently doesn't suffer from the ridiculous bugginess of EQ.  Of course, when I talk to the idiots at SOE tech service, there is no doubt in my mind why the program is in the state it is -- perhaps Sony hires incompetents on purpose?  Hmmm - planned obsolescence?   Hmmm.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I rant, therefore, I am.   &lt;Dennis Miller&gt;<br>
<br>
No idea at all if I'll ever be back on - maybe, maybe not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#fed995><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/utorrasu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torrasu</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://publish.hometown.aol.com/aeverheart/images/attack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Norrath's crankiest tailor</span><br> <font color=#993300>(12/27/01 4:27:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fdisciplesofdrinalfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=139.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Can't Log On At All</span><hr size=1> If you really play DAoC come say hi to me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know you don't know me, but I'm nice to everyone except Akenzi.<br>

The guide said to delete the zone - which I believe is Timorous Deep &lt;&lt;zone you hit when you get on the shuttles from Butcherblock&gt;&gt;.  Of course, it didn't work.  Interestingly enough, when the guide summoned me &quot;you are being summoned by the gods&quot; to Lake of Ill Omen, which is where I'd like to go, I got there no problem, except for perhaps taking a long time to zone there.  Could the guide let me stay there?  Of course not; so I'm back in EK where I've been for way too long now.  I'm thinking about exploring SK for a while, but I must say this entire thing has dampened my enthusiasm for playing.<br>
<br>
The problem I was having was an IRQ conflict when the cable modem was installed - which was weird, since it didn't show its face until a few days after the installation - go figure.<br>
<br>
Now that I have the amazingly fast connection with the cable modem, I'm still suffering from horrible lag - especially in zones where there is a bank for some reason.  I have no idea, but I intend to bide my time for a while until I can get a new computer.  If for some reason this does not help, I'm outta EQ - - I've had it.  It's amazing to me that the genius of Sony Online Entertainment/Verant/whomever would choose graphics over performance.  But as long as the cash keeps flowing in to them - why on earth would they mind?<br>
<br>
Oh well, I'm playing a paladin for a while - she's at level 8 now, and hanging around Qeynos area - I think I'll take her to WK and kill some furry stuff - lol.<br>
<br>
