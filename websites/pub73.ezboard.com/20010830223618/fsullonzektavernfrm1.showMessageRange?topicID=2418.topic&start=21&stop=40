But the fact that Druids can SoW, Buff, and most importantly dmg shield themselves without fear of being Cancelled is a big problem, and makes Druids very VERY effective. <p>-------------------------------------------<BR><img src="http://ac.teabbs.com/public/sig/sigpic3.gif"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umorganti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morganti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 12:15:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Does Cancel magic need to be changed on Sullon?</span><hr size=1> think of it this way tho, druids are awsome PvP and soloing, they also do some buffing pretty well... other than that....<br>

<br>
We have lots of druids, you have lots of necros/sks.  I really don't see a raid full of necromancers and sks taking anything down.  But the flaw with that thinking is, the whole team isn't made up of necromancers/shadow knights.  The same is true for the neutral/good teams.  It isn't just druids.<br>
<br>
Also.. Jenikal,<br>
This is true for alot of classes.  <br>
Magicians can throw up quite gigantic damage shields.<br>
Magicians can be evil.<br>
Shamen can buff themselves to an insane extent, this includes sow.<br>
Shamen can be, and very often are, evil.<br>
Clerics can buff themselves quite well.<br>
Clerics can be evil.<br>
Druids can damage shield and buff.<br>
Druids cannot be evil.<br>
<br>
The cancel magic bug really isn't being prejudice towards evils at all.  Don't try to make it sound that way. <p><img src="http://64.81.87.8/images/charles.jpg"></img></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=charles>Charles</A> at: 8/16/01 1:10:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uannid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anni D</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 1:10:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Does Cancel magic need to be changed on Sullon?</span><hr size=1> Yeah, we have rogues too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Cancel magic needs to be changed. At the BARE MINIMUM it needs to be made so enchanters can cast their strip enchantment line on enemies.<br>
<br>
You dont need to flag it is friendly, you can nuke yourself already, so you can cast even enemy flagged spells on yourself from what I understand.<br>

I would guess that there are definately more druids than the other classes, but I doubt they take up a full 50 percent. At least not any more than the necros do on the evils.<br>

As for the change, as a ranger I am against it. I can slow the enemy down or speed myself up, deal with damage shields in other ways.  I *like* you not being able to cancel my buffs. (use a two hander, nuke, etc.)<br>
<br>
But for the sake of fairness, it probably should be changed.<br>

Second of all, i would HARDLY say that evil= blue.  Not by a long shot jack.  Please post proof here of how over 50% of the evil community is blue, without Newts doing the same thing, and i will accept your comment of the evil team being blue.<br>
<br>
I also agree that druids=40% of the population of newts.  WAY too many druids heh. <p>                 <img src=http://members.theglobe.com/kambic/mat.jpg>

Seriously though, for those wondering, The good team is pretty well rounded, as we have to be in a smaller community... that's why there were so many re-rolls, at least in my guild.  But I think we have just as many druids as we do enchanters and warriors and clerics (my guild) and pretty similar for the entire good team...<br>
<br>
And YES YES YES cancel magic needs to be fixed.. at LEAST before I get my cancel magic spell *grin* <p><P><html><center><a href="http://angerthas.com/"><center><IMG SRC="http://angerthas.com/horsesig.gif"></center></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/umorganti.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morganti</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 10:49:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Does Cancel magic need to be changed on Sullon?</span><hr size=1> very rarely am i killed by dr00ds as i have done a good job of not being a troll and keeping both my MR and FR rather high (both were in the 80's when i stopped playing).  I was usually killed by wizards with cold spells as my cold resist was only 30.  The point is tho, it was the same wiz 4 times...  other than him i saw very little non-dr00d competition wherever i went.  in Qhills i met alot of human and half elf dr00ds (i don't care what level you are if you are stupid enough to make a half elf dr00d you are dead) at little bit farther east in the karanas and Runnyeye they were all halflings.  I failed to make trips over to Faydwer tho as I spent most of my newbie days there and now find that i hate the place.  THe raiding parties i saw had a huge number of dr00ds and bards.  Maybe some rangers in there or warriors but 90% of the time a raiding party was 5 or 6 dr00ds and about 4 bards.  Maybe a chanter or wiz would come along.  The only place where i saw other classes besides dr00ds were in EF and Tox.  last time i was in Tox there were 15 ppl in there.  13 were neutral.  only 4 were above lvl 6 and none of them above 13.  they were misc casters, didn't see many choking things tho, lots of wiz nukes and mage pets.  In EF it was about 60% sham and 30%rog and 10% war.  again since most ppl are anon i have to go by just what they look like, fortunatly wars rogues and shams are easy to tell apart.  Now with all of this information that i have gathered in the past month or so.  THe neut team is either planning on debuffing uber mobs to death or not even thinking about them at all.  Iwould not want to be neutral when Ruin breaks off from their PvE and goes PvP...  20 bucks they are smart enough to not be kited. <p>"You can take me out back and shoot me but I will be damned if I agree with you."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uwazuzubalu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wazu Zubalu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/16/01 11:15:23 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Does Cancel magic need to be changed on Sullon?</span><hr size=1> Seems like I fill out a /bug report every day.

And Shamans can be evil, and throw up buffs / SoW. But the thing about a druid, is they can buff themselves up (including SoW) AND they can put up dmg shields - essentially a combination of a Magician and a Shaman, making them more powerful than either one of them. And considering 40% of the newts are druids, it makes it that much harder to kill them. <br>
