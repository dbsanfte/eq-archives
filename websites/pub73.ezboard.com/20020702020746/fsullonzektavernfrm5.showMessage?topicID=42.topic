Two in particular I managed to observe for quite awhile, although I kept my distance. The first was a fabulous unicorn, the first I have seen aside from pictures from the scrolls in the great library, and I felt honored for the chance to view it. There was something different about this unicorn, though. Whereas by all accounts they are immaculate and majestic beasts, this one appeared worn and dirty, its hair matted and tattered in spots. It seemed agitated, so I did not approach it. The other creature I had the fortune to observe was exactly the opposite. A darkly beautiful horse by all appearances, but an evil creature indeed. Black as night, with flaming eyes. Amazingly, I heard it speak, shouting out a maddened cry of revenge as it struck down a barbarian warrior outside the pass with will alone, felling him in one blow and charring all the flesh from his bones without even touching him before I even had a chance to react. After this display, I decided it would be prudent to take my leave, but since the vile creature was blocking the pass, I bundled my journal and meager supplies, and made my way to the mountains of Steamfont, traditional lands of the gnomes.<br><br>After following a path that could scarcely be called such and losing my way several times after getting directions from a friendly but apparently disoriented gnomish guardsman named Halv, I stayed for a short while in Ak'Anon to replenish my stores. I know it is frowned upon to buy water and food when the Goddess endows us to provide our own, but one can only live on summoned water and black bread for so long. As I was packing my gear outside and readying to continue my wanderings, I was approached by a bard and two companions.  He introduced himself as Naidran, and his companions as another bard called Seeth, and a female warrior named Ladenia. He then asked that I accompany them on a quest for the horn of a minotaur to add to his musical arsenal. Wanting to broaden my horizons (and add to my journal for further reports), I agreed. It was only afterwards that he told me that the only place they could be aquired was the cave rumored to be the lair of the foul gnomish necromancer known as Meldrath the Malignant. Still, I did give my word...<br><br>I know that the common folk disbelieve the rumors that the music of a talented bard can give others powers far beyond their own, but I know for a fact that we travelled the distance in less than a fourth of the usual time while he was banging on the drums. Watchman Halv certainly looked surprised as we whizzed by him. The unfortunate thing about this was we managed to get to he cave all that much sooner. And even moving at superior speed, we could smell it long before we could see it. The odor was hideous, like a charnel house in a barnyard, and seemed to come from the entrance in palpatable waves. For the first few minutes after we arrived, I wondered if I would need use Tunare's power to relieve the sickness caused by the awful smell on my companions, as well as myself. Almost as bad as the smell were the awful noises. Gruntings mixed with shrill notes that sounded like the screams of the dying.<br><br>As the rest of us prepared for the fight outside, Naidran informed us on what we would be facing, bull men of extrordinary ferocity, but little intelligence. He informed us that usually the horns were carried by the lower station, ripped from the heads of their vanquished enemies while in training deep within Meldrath's lair. How comforting. Still, I was overcome by curiosity, and peered into the cave (while holding my nose), anxious for the first sight of the creatures. The interior of the cave was dark, and with it being light outside, my enanced vision was somewhat compromised. But gradually the picture became clear. I was relieved to see that the sounds were not some creature being tortured, but of someone, or something, blowing on a horn. Then two red eyes appeared out of the darkness, and I gathered that the creature had seen me. Backing up a little and throwing myself to the side, I managed to avoid the horns and flying hooves as it charged through the spot I was standing but a moment before. <br><br>Fortunately, my companions were more on the ball than I was, and I managed to get a good look at the foul beast while they fought and I kept them from death. Never in all my admittedly short travellings have I seen a creature so ugly. It was shorter than I am, but at least three times as massive with the head of a maddened bull. Thick, rank, curly brown hair covered its entire body, and foamy slobber dripped from its jaws. The musical (if you could call it that) horn was apparently also usable as a weapon, for Ladenia narrowly avoided being run through by it at least twice. Still, my companions were superior fighters, and Tunare was with us. Soon blood joined the rivers of sweat running off the beast, and with a cough of bloody foam, it bellowed an incomprehensable curse on us, calling for Meldrath before it crumpled to the ground, dead. However, the bard had only managed to wrest the horn from its grip before the minotuar's dying cry was answered by another from within. This one was much louder, deeper, and much more powerful. I had only enough time to turn towards the cave to see a much larger minotaur carrying a massive axe barreling towards us before Naidran called the command to run for cover.<br><br>All four of us headed for the shelter of the guard outposts, Naidran banging on his drums like mad to speed our feet. But such was the rage of the monster that it managed to keep pace just behind us, swinging its deadly axe and cleaving my cloak in half. I was lucky that was the only thing I lost. Others were not so fortunate. As we came over the top of one of the hills, we happened to see a small group of gnome necromancers, undoubtably Meldrath's acolytes coming to pay their respects to their master. Surprised by our appearance, they dropped their offerings and prepared to cast some kind of vile spells on us, which they never completed. <br><br>Naidran never paused in his running or playing, and not wanting to be left behind to the tender mercies of the monster, neither did I. What would happen to us if we were caught was obvious as the minotaur decended upon the necromancers. Maddened with fury, it apparently did not recognize its allies, and their cries of triumph at its appearance were abruptly cut short by the sickening sounds of breaking bones and the thudding axe. I did not hazard a look back, and seconds later the beast's hot breath was on our heels again, its axe wet with blood. As we raced down the path, we could see Watchman Halv sitting at the crossroads, apparently eating his lunch. At the sight of the minotaur, he leaped up, and as we ran by at super speed with the beast following, he hamstrung the monster with an expert flash of his sword. A second later, and the sweating beast was on the ground with the same sword shoved in its neck. On a side note, my respect for gnomish warriors has improved quite considerably.<br><br>Since the bard got what he came for, there was really no reason to go back to the cave, and we said our thanks and goodbyes there at the crossroads while Halv wiped the blood from his sword on the dead minotaur. He even apologized for steering me wrong, and pointed me back in the direction of the Faydark, with a warning to watch out for bandits on the way. I wished my companions luck, and headed back along the trail. After a relatively uneventful journey through Steamfont, I entered the Faydark and happened upon the remains of the poor barbarian. All that the scavengers had left were a few bones. Recalling that I had no plans on where to go next, I remembered something of their customs. A barbarian's spirit is never happy when he dies and cannot rest at home. So I gathered up what bones I could find and wrapped them in a bundle, placing them in my pack. I will return the barbarian's remains to his homeland, Halas, stopping to turn in this report along the way. Hopefully my next report will be from there.<br><br>Gilrathus Boren<br>Koada'Dal Cleric of Tunare<br>Felwithe <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=42.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=42.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic><img src=http://home.att.net/~neoleo/reply2.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.threadControl?topicID=42.topic><img src= border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=42.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=42.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sullonzektavernfrm1">General Discussion<option value="sullonzektavernfrm2">Marketplace<option value="sullonzektavernfrm3">No Holds Barred<option value="sullonzektavernfrm4">Guilds of Sullon Zek<option value="sullonzektavernfrm5">Roleplay<option value="sullonzektavernfrm6">Testing Grounds<option value="sullonzektavernfrm7">Administration Station</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern>Sullon Zek Tavern</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm5>Roleplay</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Sullon Zek PvP Stats !!</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" bgcolor="#CC3333"><tr><td><img src="http://images.allposters.com/images/banners/searchbox1_left.gif" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="65" border="0"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://images.allposters.com/images/banners/searchbox1_center.gif" WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="40" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><input type="text" name="associatesearch" size="9"><input type="hidden" name="aid" value="147977"></td><td valign="center"><input type="image" src="http://images.allposters.com/images/banners/searchbox1_right.gif" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="25" border="0"></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></form></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript" SRC="http://a1028.g.akamai.net/6/1028/968/444516c765e1c0/lunafetch.about.com/cgi/luna/lunaC.js?vpn=ez_compute&sp=ezboard1"></SCRIPT><SCRIPT>sprinkslite();</SCRIPT><NOSCRIPT><a href="http://sprinks.about.com/index.htm?PM=725_030_01"><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2" color="#330066"><B>Sprinks</B></font></a><BR><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" size="2" color="#000000">Start driving targeted traffic to your site with Sprinks, About's Sponsored Links program.</font><BR><font face="arial, geneva, helvetica" color="#999999" size="2">http://www.sprinks.com/</font></NOSCRIPT></CENTER><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
