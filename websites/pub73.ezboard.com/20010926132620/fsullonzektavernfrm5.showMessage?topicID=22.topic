I and 15 others were battling in the Estate of Unrest. All of our side were neutral, and we were trying desperately to level and join the highest ranks of players. We received information from our brethren and friends in the Butcherblok Mountains that a force of 30 good were on their way to Unrest to do battle with the neutral forces stationed there. A team was preparing themselves in our dwarven homeland, but these forces would not be prepared in time to stop the goods. The lights, formed up exclusively of elves, slaughtered the few neutrals that stood in their way in Butcherblok and ran into Dagnor's Cauldron. The 15 of us stationed in Unrest had been preparing for the attack, and had our defenses waiting at the zone. A lone rogue reported that the goods were at the zone line to Unrest and were preparing to enter. This rogue zoned in a few minutes later stating they were coming. I shouted to our troops to stand firm, and to stand their ground, as is only natural for dwarves and our companions. The goods rushed into the zone, and a great battle was had. It lasted for only five minutes, whereas the neutral were killed in quick order. We fought valiantly, but had been outnumbered two to one and did not stand a chance. I myself took down three of the bastards, but to no avail. Whenever one fell, another would take his place. <br>
Upon respawning in Butcherblok, I muttered many curses and then prepared to find my way back to Unrest. However, upon zoning into Dagnors, I found another great battle underway. It appeared that while our two forces were doing battle in Unrest, the reinforcements that had been gathering in Butcherblok had come up from behind the enemy and engaged in battle. The goods were pushed back into the zone of Unrest, and the remaining neutrals massed in Dagnors. We all agreed that this would be the final push of the assualt, for if we were to lose our bodies in Unrest, no more troops would come to our rescue. After muttering many prayers to all our assorted gods, we charged into the zone and engaged the ten or so elves that remained. Another great battle was had, in which their leader, Leges, narrowly escaped using his high level magics to withdraw. The neutrals had retaken Unrest. <br>
<br>
I talked to Leges after the battle, and we all agreed that a great time had been had by all. Those five minutes in Unrest was one of, if not the most fun I ave ever had in this game. I salute everyone who participated in the battle, and I look forward to the next great battles that shall surely occur on this server. A big thumbs up to Verant for this one, I have renewed my interest in Everquest again and look forward to one day leading the neutrals into battle in distant lands. Until then, fight with honor! <br>
