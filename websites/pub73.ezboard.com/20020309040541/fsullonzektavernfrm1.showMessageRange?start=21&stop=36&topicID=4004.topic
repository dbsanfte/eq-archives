Gayrage does not = WhooDatt</span><hr size=1> Haha, it just goes to prove that my first instinct that Kiana was just a bitter and annoying gimp proved true. I have no affiliation with Darkenbane, or Grayrage <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  at all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and it was *I* that asked for the information since you were spreading false information. I don't even particularly like DB, but I would rather have 50 DB than one bitter bitch. You might claim whatever you want, but it is customary that people that try to impersonate other posters on messageboards are revealed for who they really are. I can't even begin to fathom how you thought you would be any different.<br>
<br>
Have you ever heard of the term 'trolling'? Go look it up, because that's exactly what you were doing and it just gets very annoying after a while. It's sad that you have to resort to impersination and spreading false information to manipulate public opinion when people just don't cared no matter how much you complained. Don't give me that trash about 'joke' either, you have done it multiple times and there has never been anything remotely humoristic about it, you just keep badmouthing them. <br>
<br>
Fucking pathetic if you ask me, you have whined about DB and posed 'innocent' leading questions ever since you got here. Why so bitter, have they touched your life so deeply that you must spend all your days posting hateful messages? The joke isn't on them you know, because they don't care, it's on you.<br>
<br>
You bluffed and got called on it, accept it and move on. Personally I would have banned you, because your sole purpose on this board is to stir up some flamewars against DB and the other 'evil griefers'. <p><b>Velox Argentum</b><BR>

I would usually have dignified you with a proper flame at this point, but seeing as yours was so pitiful I think it speaks for itself. Work on that creativity.<br>
<br>
Now, as for your (false) claims, where did I say that I &quot;found it out&quot;, were did I claim 'we' anything? I just wanted made it clear that the reason I asked for her personal info to be revealed wasn't because of any bias towards DB, it was because she was being fucking annoying. The only people that would still think it fun at this point are just more bitter mindless people.<br>

Really, the entire mangina theme is overplayed. You should try something original.<br>
<br>
As for you posting on the messageboard, my point was that this revolves around a Sullon Zek issue. Guess what? You know <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> jack shit</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about it, so you can take your second-hand bullshit, and you can walk back to your gay server, or Dark Age of Care-A-Lot.. wherever the fuck your gimp ass plays, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> shut the fuck up</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.

HEY, BOARD OWNER, Velox is being annoying, please post all his info here about him. Start with name and address.<br>
<br>
How long has this board been up?<br>
<br>
How many &quot;annoying&quot; posts have there been?<br>
<br>
How many people have had their info posted? incorrectly I might add.<br>
<br>
<br>
*I* had nothin to do with your fucking Dark guild bashing. I would love to, thay sound like pricks, you included.  <br>
Fact of the matter is, what Kiana did was goddamn funny. You find it annoying. Big fucking deal. Write a reply, flame her, or go cry about it. None of that matters.<br>
<br>
Board owner guy stepped way over his boundry. It wasn't 'net info' lurking out there insecure that someone hacked, it was info devulged to the privledges of the tavern owner. On some network sites that constitutes a violation of privacy and is a legal offense. I have no idea about sleazyboard's policy.<br>
<br>

Board owner guy stepped way over his boundry. It wasn't 'net info' lurking out there insecure that someone hacked, it was info devulged to the privledges of the tavern owner.

Here is news for you WooDat, the admin can do what the fuck he wants with this board, and it's definitely not against any privace laws. You could have had a slim chance of complaining (to EZboard) if he had posted your IP address (very slim though), but he didn't so stfu. You see, you aren't anonymous on the internet and this board has never agreed on anything beyond that, so take your screaming and kicking little angry foo self off the internet if you can't handle it. <p><b>Velox Argentum</b><BR>
