<br>
DAoC:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What is PvP? How is handled differently than other online RPGs? <br>
<br>
PvP is shorthand for &quot;Player vs. Player&quot;. Some online RPGs do not allow player vs. player combat at all; instead characters fight with NPC monsters – this is the model that EverQuest follows, with the exception of a few EQ PvP servers. Others, like Ultima Online, allow everyone to fight everyone else, which can sometimes be chaotic. Camelot will be team-based PvP (based on Realm), where characters will be able to rise up to medium level without having to worry about being marauded by high-level enemies. As the players grow in stature, they will be expected to protect their realm from enemy incursions, as well as occasionally go on raiding parties against other Realms. <br>
<br>
In order to allow new players some time to gain experience in the game, each Realm will have its own unique protected adventuring areas that are designed for new players. These areas will allow the new player an opportunity to gain experience without worrying at all about an invasion from across the seas. <br>
<br>
Player levels will be based on experience vs. monsters, not vs. other players. At higher levels, players will have to adventure out into regions between the realms, which could bring them into conflict with enemies, but not necessarily so. The true PvP comes into play when actively going out on raids, or protecting your Relics from enemy invasions. <br>
<br>
Each player accumulates &quot;Realm Points&quot; while either defending their Realm against enemy invasions or going out on raiding parties. As the player gains Realm Points, they gain special titles as well as bonuses to their skill statistics. Because of this, a high-level player who has gained Realm points will be more powerful than a player of the same level who has not. The game will not force players into PvP, but if you choose to do so, you will become more powerful.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->-So the points from this, pvp is mid to high level only, you can't gain xp from pvp but instead you get some kind of bonus that is unrelated to xp, there are 3 teams and the areas they control are static and can not be effected by player actions although players are expected to hold raids against enemy territories.<br>
<br>
SB:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 10.02  Will there be Player-versus-Player (PvP) combat?<br>
<br>
Yes, Shadowbane has been built from the ground up to support Player-versus-Player combat (in fact, some might say that the game's backstory actively encourages it).  In addition to PvP, we have also implemented many game mechanics to support Guild-versus-Guild (GvG) and Kingdom-versus-Kingdom (KvK) combat.<br>
<br>
This isn't to say, however, that our PvP Combat is unrestricted -- The game is territory based, with lands ranging from completely protected (such as the Newbie Areas and Starting Cities) to extremely dangerous (hostile advanced areas and land held by enemy nations).<br>
<br>
10.03  What about Player Killing?<br>
<br>
We have worked very hard to ensure that the combat system fits within the context of the game world.  Pointless violence is not the purpose of Shadowbane: but we also assert that it's hard to tell a gripping story (especially a gripping fantasy story) without conflict or battles at all. We remain firm believers that not only can PvP and Roleplaying go hand in hand, but that, in fact, the pinnacle of each can only be achieved when the two exist in tandem. Without the power to back up your words, what good is a well-acted swagger? And how much more meaningful will your character's victories be when firmly grounded in an epic or mythic context?<br>
<br>
Various game mechanics have been put in place that enhance combat while deterring gratuitous or random PKing.  For instance, experience points gained from victory are based on levels, and only a peer or higher level character will yield any significant gain. <br>
<br>
The traditional PKs of other games are outsiders who wander from region to region in search of prey, vanishing when their victims come looking for revenge. In Shadowbane, however, all players will belong to a Guild, run either by GMs or Players. Guilds are highly territorial, and you can easily learn where a character is from by viewing their Guild Crest when you click on them or by simply viewing your &quot;Recent Attacks&quot; log. Wanton murderers will be held accountable for their actions by the Guilds they serve, and the penalties for being expelled from a Guild are severe. Furthermore, trying to operate without the fixed home base that a Guild provides is asking for serious trouble. So, you may ask, what's to keep all the PKs from forming Guilds of their own? Nothing, but there's nothing to keep you and anyone ever troubled by them from forming your own Guilds, banding together, and battering the PK Guilds to dust. It's hard to hide a city, or a Tree of Life. Also, the reliance on Guilds means that every would-be victim has a Guild full of supporters to help them get even.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->-newbie areas and starting cities are protected from pvp, pvp range is from fairly low to high level, lower level characters yield less experience than higher level ones but xp can be gained from pvp, all characters must belong to a guild instead of a static 'team', guilds are based out of cities that can be attacked and destroyed by opposing guilds leading to a dynamic world where your 'team' is your guild and player actions can make a difference in the game world. <p>--------------------<BR>

<br>
   DaOC certainly looks to have a better PvP and character advancement setup than EQ, but it seems that DaOC tried to improve the current systems existing in current games, whereas Shadowbane tried to work from the ground up with an entirely different kind of game.<br>
<br>
   When I look at DAOC I see a good looking hybrid of UO and EQ with a lot of the existing faults of both games corrected.<br>
<br>
   When I look at Shadowbane, I see something new altogether, something untried and exciting.  Gameplay is more important than graphics for me, but I have to say, I think the graphics in Shadowbane are amazing.  Go to the screenshots section, and open up one of their lizarman battle screenshots, then open up a screenshot of a lizardman battle in EQ.  They're worlds apart.  Even the grass, and the sky, etc all look terrific.  <br>
<br>
   I see DaOC as a game I could get into for a while, but would eventually (few months) become same old same old.  I see SB as something that I could REALLY get into <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   There's so much of the world that's put into the player's hands.

It's kinda funny watching so many people debate two games that aren't out yet. <br>
<br>
DAoC will be my next game.  Why? Simple, EQ has grown boring, and DAoC will be out in October whereas SB won't be out until next year.    <br>
<br>
That makes my choice pretty damn simple right there.  <br>
<br>
Many people, including plenty of DAoC bashers, are going to end up coming to the same conclusion when DAoC is released.   <br>
<br>
If SB ends up being better than DAoC or if it doesn't measure up.. well, honestly, I don't care.  So long as  DAoC is good enough to fool around with for a few months and so long as at least one of the two is a really good longer-lasting game then I'll be happy.  <br>
<br>
Being that SB is in a very early beta and DAoC hasn't fully implemented PvP or the third realm I think its kinda ignorant to be making broad comparisons at this point.   <p> <br>

It is very much like EQ.  If you think that sucks, then you'll not like the game.<br>
<br>
If you like EQ, then I can't see any reason why you wouldn't like DAoC. It's interface is similar, it's graphics are similar (but better), it's gameplay is similar.<br>
<br>
The classes are certainly different, but it's still a class/level based game.<br>
<br>
People who won't like it are those who desire fast leveling. You can't macro to GM overnight. You can't powerlevel up to max in a weekend.  For those who think leveling in EQ is too slow, you won't like the leveling in DAoC for although it's faster than EQ, it doesn't touch the macro magic of UO or the promises of level 30 in a week of SB.  This is assuming you are doing it legit, without high levels juicing you.<br>
<br>
All in all, it's a fine game. I'm kinda bored with the kill/level death march so i don't know if I'll play it or not.  Even though SB will attract an even more vile element than SZ, the fast leveling appeals to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mystaya>Mystaya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/18/01 10:45:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dark Age of Camelot vs. Shadowbane (long)</span><hr size=1> DaoC has a lot of work to do before becomes anything close to an EQ killer.  The premise is terrific and I love alot of the creative ways they came up with to have money sinks, avoid twinking, taking the camping/farming out of the game, etc.<br>
<br>
BUT, the game lacks that hook, that thing that makes you log in every day ( at least for myself and many others I know ).  The interface needs alot of work, it doesn't have the ease of EQ.  I think though, the largest issue is the lack of community there. Associations ( guilds) haven't been implemented yet, and communication between players is a pain.  The world is vast, and its easy to be the only one around for a long distance. <br>
<br>
One of the best things about it though is the development team.  They really do seem to listen to the testers and do their best to address things.  If they can fix the interface and community feel it will  be great.  If not , then  people might buy it, but they will not stay.<br>
<br>
(Note: This is how I felt a couple months ago, I haven't logged into it much since SZ opened, so they may have fixed a few things)<br>
<br>
Over all you CANNOT compare the two games.  One is out and one is not.  Until you are in it and playing you won't know.  Pretty graphics and nice web pages to not make up for over all playability.  When SB comes out THEN you can compare the two Betas.  I heard over and over that Daoc would kill EQ, as of right now? not a chance........<br>
