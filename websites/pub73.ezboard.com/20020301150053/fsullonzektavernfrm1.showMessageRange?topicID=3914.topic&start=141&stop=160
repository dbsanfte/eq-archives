&quot;Apologist&quot; means someone who argues on behalf of people who are wrong, not someone who apologizes.  It isn't neccesarily a negative term, it just means that the person being defended is not generally highly regarded.  For example, if I were to argue that Kaiser Wilhelm II was actually an intelligent person who got unlucky, someone (usually who disagrees) would call me a Kaiser Wilhelm apologist.<br>
<br>
Seriously, Agrul, the last 5 levels in the game, all hell levels.   <br>
<br>
If you are supposed to be maximally hostile by every means neccesary, shouldn't you be using 3rd party software that can't be detected and fabricating complaints to GMs to try to get the other guilds disbanded?  It's war after all.  <br>
<br>
If not, then you've chosen an arbitrary line of &quot;shitiness&quot; that you won't cross.  And since that line is arbitrary, why not set it at a less irritating place?<br>
<br>
There's no sense in defending something that you personally would not do.  Would you do this?<br>

<br>
The source of this whole well of pissed off people is just the difference between the people who are playing to make friends and the people who are playing to win.<br>
<br>
I play to win.  If I can make friends in the process, so much the better, but I don't believe in giving the opponet a break just to make them like me.  So while I hope Nafgar dies and gets corpsecamped back to level 5, I merely hate him because he's my opponet, not because I disagree with his style or think he should physically die in real life.<br>
<br>
Pino's sleeping disorder is unfortunate, but it's hardly fair to ask people to give him a break in a game because of it.  If Larry Bird returned to basketball, you couldn't tell people not to steal the ball from him just because he's not as fast as he used to be.<br>
<br>
(You could make an argument that you should be nice to people so that they give you breaks later, thus helping you win, but that's only if you expect to need more breaks then them.  I don't need breaks, so I don't give em.)<br>

It's a good thing VZ was never hardcoded and stripped of play nice rules. Sounds like you would have left the iggles and joined &lt;Prophets&gt; heh<br>
<br>
To set the record straight, I was there when this all happened and was involved in training DBC off Pino.<br>
I know this server has no rules and that's fine.<br>
Pino didn't whine or complain at all, and that's great.<br>
<br>
Regarding the checkmate argument and chess, that isn't applicable due to the fact that when the game ends, it's over for good. Chess is not persistent. EQ is. If you pwn someone in chess, you can shake hands, bitch slap the guy, whatever but the game is over forever and in the past.<br>
<br>
We all want to score points and be in the top spot on this server but I'm sure everyone wants to have fun playing this game. What is the point of playing and being the number one in points if you hate the game itself?<br>
<br>
I don't care if I get CC'd, trained, bind rushed, whatever. That stuff is part of Sullon Zek.<br>
<br>
When some idiots decide to bind camp someone who is AFK, it makes me wonder exactly what is going through their minds. Is it:<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, we're going to score some serious points here with no work whatsoever&quot;?<br>
<br>
or perhaps:<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's delevel this guy so next time we see him he is a weaker foe&quot;<br>
<br>
or maybe even:<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's piss this guy off so much that he quits. One less enemy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Regardless, they are all acts of cowardice and take no skill whatsoever. OK, so one enemy got a bit weaker this day. Pin a rose on your nose. I love PvP and enjoy the challenge. Bind camping an AFK is NOT PvP. I truly feel sorry for someone who feels better about himself/herself because he ganked a guy down 5 levels when he was AFK.<br>
<br>
Many people on these boards say there is no place for honor on SZ but I believe there is. I have had many bloody fights with people from TDC, Zanshin (before disbanding), Sanctus Lumen, and even DBC (Well, one anyway: Marqus) where their members were very honorable in the aftermath no matter what the casualties were on both sides. Does this make me soft against these guys? No way! I'm going to come with all the artillery I've got every time we meet.<br>
<br>
This post will probably draw loads of flames from people who will mock my honor but that's ok. In closing, before last night I had never even seen Pino but I felt obligated, as an enemy of DBC, to do something about it. That's all I have to say.<br>

<br>
If you aren't playing by the rules, then you aren't playing the game.  I do my best to stay within the rules because when I win a game, I like to know it was because I kick ass (or perhaps because my opponet did something stupid).  When I find out where you were hiding, it's because I know the territory and knew where the good hiding places were, not because some external program told me.<br>
<br>
Any fool can cheat and win.  And what's the point of being the #1 fool when you can be the #1 skilled player?<br>
<br>
I'd rather be a winner in my head and a loser at the game than the other way around.  Until I can beat someone on a level playing field, I haven't beat them at all.  I think that's the attitude you'll get from most &quot;real gamers&quot;.  Other people literally only want to win, and will break rules to get that sense of winning, but that's just their own eggshell thin ego talking.<br>
<br>
(In poker you might cheat cause there's a hundred bucks on the table.  In online games, there's no reason other than your own overinflated ego or small, yappy dog like desire to impress others.)<br>
<br>
PS:<br>
I didn't like the Prophets because they cheated.  If VZ were hard coded, I still wouldn't like them, because it wouldn't change the fact that they were known for breaking rules.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if they came to Sullon, I would wipe the slate clean, but given their bannings for being caught using external programs to cheat with, I doubt they'd deserve it.  People who cheat tend to stick to their methods, they'd simply find new ways to cheat here.<br>
<br>
I should probably mention that this is all the &quot;theory&quot; behind my gaming style.  Even the most dedicated rule abiding football player may get furious enough to kick another player in the nuts, which is definiately against the rules, but while spurious outbursts may be forgivable, people who commit a sort of &quot;1st degree cheating&quot; are generally just fools, too incompetent to win on their own, and not really worth my time because they're too far below my skill level to even have a good conversation with.<br>

There's no defined goals for winning.<br>
<br>
If winning = killing people, then bind camping someone is legit.  You'd be a fool not to.<br>
<br>
If winning = being highest level, ditto.<br>
<br>
If winning = proving your skill in 1 on 1 fights with a level playing field, then bind camping someone is as pointless as farming greens.<br>
<br>
If winning = having lots of friends, including enemies, then bind camping anyone is counter-productive.<br>
<br>
Since EQ has no real point, various people are going by various and contradictory definitions of winning.  You say we lost, we say we won, over the same event.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is why I can't wait til Shadowbane.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS:<br>
The way the scoreboard is currently tallied, winning is defined as getting points.  Bindcamping someone can be worth a lot of points.  /shrug.  This is why so many people love farming greens.  It's worth points, therefore it makes them a winner, right?  That's what the scoreboard says!<br>

<br>
Tackling someone by their facemask is a dirty way to play football -- you could break someone's neck!  So it's against the rules.<br>
<br>
Faking a handoff so the defense wastes time tackling the wrong guy.... is that dishonorable?  The honorable thing to do would be to keep the ball in plain sight constantly, so that the defense knows who to tackle, right?<br>
<br>
I think that sounds pretty ridiculous.  Asking someone not to bindcamp people in EQ is pretty much the same.  It's a viable option, it gives you points and improves your chances of beating the person again later, what's not to like?<br>
<br>
I'd like to play poker with some of you.  You'd probably show me your hand because hiding it would be dishonorable.<br>

What a stupid sentiment.  What possible dry, shriveled twitch could it give you to win, AT A GAME, dishonorably?  People that feel this way should go find a bloody Nietzsche discussion group and leave normal well adjusted people to play computer games while they slowly implode.<br>
<br>
Analogies to chess or poker are retarded.  How do you act cheap in a game of chess?  You can't suddenly play a game of chess with someone while he's already got 10 other games of chess agroed on him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I basically think that the justification for actions like this, (that were called &quot;griefing&quot; when they were illegal, if you no longer prefer the term) are specious.  They're based on laughably false analogies and philosophical tracts that are either Nietzschean or fascisty, depending on your level of distaste.  War to the utmost, etc etc.  It's all false logic.  Behavior is constrained by social norms in most cases, not by the absolute limits of the rules.  If you don't believe me, ask yourself, if you saw a random enemy, would you delevel him 59-54?  Do you bindcamp?  Do you kill people you meet randomly on CRs?  Most people find this stuff fucking petty.  <br>
<br>
You don't have to be Don Quixote not to be a prick. You just have to play the game like a person and not like some angst-ridden adolescent who just read about the Will to Power.  <br>
<br>
What kind of fuckup plays football caring ONLY about the rules and not sportsmanship?  Anyone who really, honestly only cares about winning, period, in the games they play is tragic.  People say that because it sounds cool, but if you care about winning more than fun... eh.... what the fuck are you?<br>
<br>
<br>
On a different note, for those of you who insist on behaving as if this is some grand darwinian struggle, why don't you take the example of WWII fighter pilots, who didn't strafe parachutists jumping out of aircraft in most cases?  <br>
<br>
Why didn't they?  Partly because it's a fucking low thing to kill someone helpless in cold blood.  Partly because pretty soon everybody would do it if someone started.  Sound like anything we know?  An analogy is never a proof, but this one is actually fairly close.  An important distinction is the stakes involved, but as you seem intent to behave as if the game should be played to the bitterest extremity...<br>

Could I?  Yes.  Should I?  Maybe.  Do I?  No.  I set my own personal guidelines, not those of other players - it isn't going to kill me if Jakka wants to use ShowEQ to make the game that much easier, so why should I try to tell him he can't?<br>

&quot;If not, then you've chosen an arbitrary line of &quot;shitiness&quot; that you won't cross. And since that line is arbitrary, why not set it at a less irritating place?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yup, I've set my own *personal* guidelines, with no attempt to hinder the choices others may make.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I enjoy the place it's at now.  I don't find it irritating in the least.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's no sense in defending something that you personally would not do. Would you do this?&quot;<br>
<br>
I defend freedom of action within virtual environments, regardless of whether or not I agree or disagree with a person's actions.  There's plenty of reason to defend something you wouldn't do.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bind camping an AFK is NOT PvP&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree.  That doesn't make it an unfair, unethical, and immoral practice though, /shrug.<br>

<br>
we play the server as a war with no limits, thats why we came here. if we wanted a watered down pvp server with 56 ress'es at the end for everyone and hand holding and a pat on the back from the adversary we would have stayed on rallos with our uber equipped 55 - 60 chars and continued to PK there rather then build all new ones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=minidas>Minidas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/4/01 6:40:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3914.topic&index=155>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IE Defeats DB &amp; TDC, Ruin monk comments on PvP and D</span><hr size=1> It's actually the least stupid war analogy yet propsed here to my knowledge.  WWII was essentially a total war with no limits.  The constraints were practical ones; no poison gas because of retaliation/common decency.  Little shooting of parachuting pilots because of retaliation/common decency.<br>
<br>
Real fighter pilots, with their lives on the line, DIDN'T shoot them by and large.  It would have made the war a lot less pleasant in a hurry and been personally distasteful.<br>
<br>
The arguement that the SZ ruleset allows for and encourages all behavior is specious.  It seems compelling on the face of it, but it doesn't actually hold up.  A genuinely total effort that disregards &quot;moral&quot; inhibitions about things like bindcamping afks would also disregard minor matters like immo healing on VZ.  It isn't honourable, but we're playing to win, goddamn it? <br>
<br>
The rules of SZ are simple a bare boned, negative framework.  This in no way suggests that players are somehow being &quot;cool&quot; by behaving their most bestial. I wasn't just throwing the word around when I said the DB charter was &quot;fascisty.&quot;  If you've read enough fascist &quot;intellectual treatises&quot; you get a feel for what they read like.  I've actually taken a course specifically on fascism, and this sort of irrationalist sense that we should throw aside outdated morals now that we realize we can is part and parcel.  Rules, morals are constraints of the weak and we should realize our will to power.<br>
<br>
But it's fundamentally unsound.  Just because the msot fundamental rules are negative (only forbidding behavior, not telling us how we should behave otherwise) doesn't mean that positive rules _should_ not exist in addition.  Even though VZ should be hardcoded, purists ARE cool by their enforcement of a rule that improves the server.<br>
<br>
So would people who realized the ability to act like an ass isn't a reason to do so.<br>

I played chess alot in jr high.  I have defeated a master.  I'm not saying I am better than rated masters, but that I can beat them, so I believe I have succeded in chess more than most.<br>

I have played ALOT of poker.  2 of my RL friends now make their living as pro poker players.  I've considered doing the same.  We are very good.<br>
<br>
I see no correlation between these games and EQ.  There is no way to &quot;win&quot; EQ.  The goal is to have fun.  You cannot have fun by winning as there is no winning.<br>
<br>
In chess, RTS games, and poker, there is a definite way to win.  How does one win EQ?  Wiping out the other teams?  Sounds like you killed the game if you win then. <p>Milt, Iksar Shaman.

The shape of combat on SZ is in the hands of the players.  Saying it is in the hands of the most arbitrarily unpleasant players is an easy answer.  <br>
