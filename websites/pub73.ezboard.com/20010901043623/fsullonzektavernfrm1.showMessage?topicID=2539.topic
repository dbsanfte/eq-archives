I would like to address a few of the recurring topics I see.  Please contain your flames to the contents of this message, and not me in the game, as I already know the majority of goods and evils hate me.<br>
<br>
I came to this server to fight other players.  I thought that was the idea.  I have historically played Evil characters, but I knew Evil would be overpowered, and I can't stand High-Elves (naked Big Birds) so Neutral presented me with the most potential targets.  The trouble is, I'm not sure many other people actually came here to fight.  I think most of the Sullon Zek population, especially the Evils, came because it was a new server, period.  Now I'm not saying no Evils fight, not at all, but the undeniable fact is that the majority of them do not have any interest in PvP.  That's the first failing of this server, and it's not Verant's fault.  <br>
<br>
I, like most people I think, didn't know or expect Verant to make a decent point system, and I certainly didn't expect them to dedicate part of their webpage to it.  It has its problems, but it has exceeded my expectations for a game which has basically shunned PvP from the day Rallos was introduced in Beta 4.  (Yes, I was there in Beta 3 asking for a PvP server when there was none.)  The problem with the points system is that it is _still_ easier to get points by killing two people 10 levels below you, than one person your level or higher.  <br>
<br>
Contrary to popular belief (popular belief that has spread so many rumors about me it's like an issue of the Inquirer), I hunt whites exclusively.  The key there is _hunt_.  If I see a green running from some mobs, yeah I will snare him and let the mobs finish him.  If there's someone with a title (ie, 20+) at a bubble, yeah I will probably down him in one spell if I'm not in a hurry.  And if you launch on me, yeah I will try and take you out one way or another, regardless.  I do let a lot more greens go than I kill, though, simply because I don't want to waste time and mana on people I can't even loot.  I've been accused of &quot;farming greens&quot; since the points page went up, but if you were watching at all when they changed the system, and made harsher penalties for killing people out of your range, a few people dropped off the top 10 entirely and my score did not change at all.  But I digress...<br>
<br>
I would like to see insignias mean more.  I would like them to be the sole calculation for points.  I would also like to see people like Kronar _not_ incur negative points for locking down a zone like Blackburrow.  Sure, he isn't earning anyone's respect, but he _is_ disrupting an enemy zone, and that is part of what this server is about.  Don't get me wrong, I don't think he should get points for sitting at the line and petting people for three hours, but I don't think it should earn him, or certainly not the whole evil team, negative points.  I know I would be a little irritated if some high level neutral rang in to give us negative points every day and then I had to hear about it on ooc.<br>
<br>
Back to insignias, they will never be worth much more than points on this server, because it is too easily abused.  If they made superior tokens redeemable for nice cash prizes, a high level character with a resurrecting cleric friend, would strike a bargain with a high level person on another team, and farm eachother for tokens.  The reward, then, will always be less than the effort it would take to do this (which isn't very much).<br>
<br>
To that end, I would like to see tokens mean more, and for PvP deaths to not be resurrectable.  People may still farm eachother for them, but at least it will be more of a sacrifice.<br>
<br>
The last issue about tokens which I have seen raised is higher level people wearing down low levels and letting their own low levels finish them off.  The only way to combat this is to have the loot rights be based on damage, and not the kill shot.  That is the only way.  Unfortunately, Verant has already said they weren't willing to spend the time programming it in.  I hope at some point they change their mind.<br>
<br>
As a quick aside, I would like to see item loot for people in your range.  On Rallos this sent a lot of people to naked gear or no drop gear, but that _does_ give them a major disadvantage, caster or not.  I enjoyed being able to click on people's items and look for the best thing after a kill.  Of course, they aren't adding this two months in because half the server would cry or quit, but I just thought I'd mention it.<br>
<br>
One thing that bothers me on this server is opposite team alliances and same team enemies.  There isn't a whole lot you can do to a person of your team who is killstealing and/or training you, except stop everything you're doing and try to train them back for hours on end.  This just doesn't seem right on an alliance based PvP server.  Then you have people of opposite teams working together.  That just doesn't seem to be keeping in the spirit of the server either.  I have played other racewar games, and the only way to really make them work is if you have a human element watching and punishing people for hurting their own team or helping the other one.  Sadly, with the amount of players we have, they aren't sending dedicated GMs to make sure this happens.  I wouldn't mind a couple rule amendments though that say you can't hurt (ks, train, or otherwise abuse) your own team or help another team.  This wouldn't solve it, but accompanied with a few suspensions, it would help curb it.<br>
<br>
Lastly, and everyone will hate this idea, but I'd really like /who to only report people of your team.  Everytime I zone in somewhere I get newbies who I wasn't even going to kill spamming ooc and shout with nonsense.  Then the people in my range huddle by a zone line ready to plug, or just gate.  This isn't just for me, every now and then some evils or goods decide to raid a neutral zone and get the same treatment.  Right now, /who is the most powerful command in the game, and on a server where the idea is to fight people of other alliances, I don't see why it should lay out all your enemies for you on a silver platter.<br>
<br>
To sum up:<br>
<br>
Points only for insignias.<br>
No negative points for green kills.<br>
No resurrecting of PvP deaths.<br>
Looting rights to person who does most damage, not kill shot.<br>
No cross teaming or same team griefing.<br>
/Who to only report people in the zone of your team.<br>
<br>
Alright, that's all I have for now.  See you on the field. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uzade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/19/01 7:53:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.spree.com/funNgames/ZADESZ/Zade.jpg width=120 height=200 ></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Actually, the /who command reporting only your team members is an interesting idea that I haven't heard before.

<br>
The only major downfall I see with this is Tracking.  If a druid/ranger/bard can pick up someone not on the /who list on tracking then it makes those classes a bit overpowered.  Druids don't need anymore power, I know I played one past 50 on Tallon.<br>

<br>
Gotta disagree. Evil is not over-powered, as shown by the points sytem, and the fact that not having Druids, Rangers and Paladins is a signigicant hit, especially druids. If you mean because of the number of evils, wrong again too. There are not than many more evils than newts. If newts had picked classes other than the easiest most un-balanced pvp class in the game (druids) then newts would be doing a lot more. Even so, newts have TONS of people, close to the same size as the evil team from my observations.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Now I'm not saying no Evils fight, not at all, but the undeniable fact is that the majority of them do not have any interest in PvP.&quot;<br>
<br>
Definitely wrong. First off, most evils are busy leveling, and will be fighting a lot more later after they get their levels and gear. Unlike druids, most other classes need gear to be effective. Not to mention that since evils lack porting classes and players to an incredibly extent, its very difficult for them to run around pvp'ing all the time. Unlike your team, we dont have 1 druid for every 3 players. We have 1 wizard for every 40-50. Huge difference.<br>
<br>
&quot;The problem with the points system is that it is _still_ easier to get points by killing two people 10 levels below you, than one person your level or higher.&quot;<br>
<br>
Depends on your class. As it is now, its difficult for a red caster to kill a 10-level-lower melee because of the screwed up resists. Also, for all those people who dont have snare (the single most powerful pvp spell) they lost a lot of kills to people zoning, zone plugging or running to guards, etc. You only get 50 point for 10 levels lower, 105 for 1 higher, thats not bad. For some people Its a lot harder to kill 2 people 10 levels lower than you at the same time than someone one level higher at once. I think the current point system is not so bad, except you shouldnt lose points in pvp especially when you are fighting back greens who attacked you first.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I hunt whites exclusively. The key there is _hunt_.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well thats nice for you, you're mid-level, and have TONS of them to hunt. Youve also got tracking, soc/sow, gates, buffs, nukes, dot's, AND you cant be dispelled because of the 3 month old cancel magic bug. I'm not that impressed, you play the easiest pvp class in the game, a class that is completely over-powered at almost every level. Whites are easy kills for druids, and either way, you can farm who you want, more power to you.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to see insignias mean more. &quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would also like to see people like Kronar _not_ incur negative points for locking down a zone like Blackburrow. Sure, he isn't earning anyone's respect, but he _is_ disrupting an enemy zone, and that is part of what this server is about. Don't get me wrong, I don't think he should get points for sitting at the line and petting people for three hours, but I don't think it should earn him, or certainly not the whole evil team, negative points.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;To that end, I would like to see tokens mean more, and for PvP deaths to not be resurrectable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed.<br>
<br>
&quot;only way to combat this is to have the loot rights be based on damage, and not the kill shot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Disagree, Group pvp is where its at, and the way to combat this is to have a group with you, or run if you dont like whats about to happen.<br>
<br>
&quot;As a quick aside, I would like to see item loot for people in your range.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed, item loot is awesome, and in fact WAY better than points, coins, or even exp loss.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wouldn't mind a couple rule amendments though that say you can't hurt (ks, train, or otherwise abuse) your own team or help another team. This wouldn't solve it, but accompanied with a few suspensions, it would help curb it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The best way to deal with it is make it so you can attack anyone, like RZ. Teams should only HELP, not HURT. You should be rewarded for playing in theme (deity kills give you coins) but allowed to kill whoever you want. Hard-coding and no-killing-teammates is stupid, but most people are too small-minded to realize that.<br>
<br>
&quot;but I'd really like /who to only report people of your team.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed. Ive been suggesting this since August 1999.<br>

The last known knowledge of numbers was that evil team had twoce as many. Now you say newts are equal?<br>
<br>
You also sound off the whine about newts haveing druids and RANGERS?<br>
<br>
Ya, evil just has SKs and Necros to counter that with. And Necros are very hard to PvP with right? LOL!<br>
<br>
And I loved your arguement to the fact that evils do not want to PvP- which is because they are too busy levling and getting gear, but don't you worry, they plan on PvPing soon!!<br>

******************************************<br>
<br>
Points for insignias--/agree.<br>
<br>
No negative points for green--/agree.<br>
<br>
No PvP res--I am going to disagree with you here. I think it would be much more useful to just say you can't get more than 1 insignia from a character in 'x' amount of time (24 hours?), which serves the same function of keeping people from abusing the insignia rewards and also doesn't nerf the role of clerics in PvP, which your idea would do to a large degree.<br>
<br>
Looting rights to most damage--/agree.  Also, agree with being able to get stuff.  If this is implemented along with fixing resists/a.c. (see below), this will make high level ganking of low levels a little more problematic rather than the walk through the park that it is now.<br>
<br>
No cross teaming, etc.--hmmm.  This is just an EQ universal annoyance.   But, that's all it is is just an annoyance.  Also, it doesn't happen to such a large degree that I think it constitutes a major problem.  So, I would classify it as just annoying but not something I am going to stress about.<br>
<br>
/who--I am so glad you brought this up. I totally agree with you about this, as this is kind of a back-assward way of tracking someone down. Also, it makes rangers and other trackers(my class) that much more powerful....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And, just to throw this in even though this has been covered over many posts, make the PC's have resists based on actual resists, NOT THEIR EQUIVALENT GODDAMN MOB LEVEL.  This is utterly retarded.  No other game does this.  That's why people get gear, cast spells to protect, etc. Same thing for a.c. An a.c. of 100 should mean the same thing whether on a level 1 or a level 60.<br>

Evil was 50 percent, neutral was 35 percent, and good was 15 percent.  There is no reason to think that has changed dramatically.<br>
<br>
Evil also has a higher average level due to easier leveling and a lot of people, who just wanted to level in peace, taking the road most travelled.  No, Verant didn't release stats on the average level.  But those are my observations.<br>
<br>
Yeah, snare is kind of rough.  It takes your sow, and that is pretty much a wrap, unless you are close enough to plug at a line or the attacker runs out of mana.  You know what else is kind of like snare? The darkness line, which the two roughest evil classes happen to get.<br>
<br>
It is good that the few evils who want (or pretend to want) to pk are bitter about having no one to hunt.  I can't think of a more fitting punishment for anyone who picked evil.  I am pretty sure most people who picked good and neutral, did so just so they would have something to fight with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=FAEBD7><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/utheiven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Theiven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>poon</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/19/01 10:34:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sullon Zek</span><hr size=1> Nice post Dharma...  All your ideas are great, and even the ability to loot cash + insignia + item, although harsh, is very fun indeed.

<br>
Anyway, the whole point thing should *most likely* be thrown out and Insignias are the only thing that count.  When this server first came out and i heard about the insignias that you got when you killed someone, i got really excited.  I really hoped there would be shops / NPC's / GM's who you could turn these into for special items.  Even if they were stat-less, colorful armor/weapons, it would be great.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this whole point thing is in need of a change.  Several people who decide to kill 200 greens in a day should not lower a teams' entire &quot;score&quot;<br>

Things have changed a lot since then, those numbers don't mean anything.  My best guess from playing a newt and evil is as follows<br>
<br>
Good 15%<br>
Newt 35-40%<br>
Evil 45-50%<br>
<br>
Do I have any proof to back this up, well no.  But don't quote a very very old census and say that it backs up your opinion either.<br>
<br>
Yes the way druids are setup now they are way overpowered.  Druids strength is in their buffs and there hard to resist dots.  They have taken away the ability to remove buffs, and have made most spells unreliable(since last patch) except for the hard to resist dot/lifetap spells.  Necros do not live by buffs, so they don't have this 'overpowered' feel to them.<br>
<br>
Coin loot is bad, it makes people not want to PvP, it also isn't fair in EQ because the attacker rarely risks anything, there is no fair risk/reward setup with it.  Removing the team coding makes the server pointless, just go back to RZ if you want a guild based server with item loot.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=spyder>Spyder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/20/01 12:47:46 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol</span><hr size=1> Aye, I like the /who recommendation.

would even take it further, to make it where you COULD NOT even communicate with people on the other teams (not in /ooc, /auction, /shout, /say, /tell, not ANY communication with other team members) while in-game (to make them seem more like NPC's to you--also so you wouldnt have to listen to their whining or smack-talk).  This would definitely keep teams from alligning with eachother (ie, eliminate cross-teaming).  <br>

Also the evil team does seem busy leveling up, sometimes forgeting to defend their backyards, but soon we will be finished and the the rain of fire and chaos will start!<br>

I agree with everything Dharma said, save that I would allow revives in PvP, just not resurrects (meaning you could skip the corpse run, but not regain the exp.).<br>

/Who is always a problem.  Kind of hard to sneak in an area.<br>
But it also can tell you what a zone may be like (too many from the wrong guild for example). Maybe have invis work like for GMs where you dont show up on the who list.<br>
<br>
For item looting -- mixed feellings.  I am from RZ where 1 item looting is the style there.  But you really don't want SZ to become a casters haven. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2539.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2539.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2539.topic&start=61&stop=75>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2671.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2652.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.threadControl?topicID=2539.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2539.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2539.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub73.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="sullonzektavernfrm1">General Discussion<option value="sullonzektavernfrm2">Marketplace<option value="sullonzektavernfrm3">No Holds Barred<option value="sullonzektavernfrm4">Guilds of Sullon Zek<option value="sullonzektavernfrm5">Roleplay<option value="sullonzektavernfrm6">Testing Grounds<option value="sullonzektavernfrm7">Administration Station</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/bsullonzektavern>Sullon Zek Tavern</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp">Sullon Zek PvP Stats !!</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-1925262" target="_blank" >
