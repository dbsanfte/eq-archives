<br>
Storyline for the same people that whined that I didn't provide one in my thread:<br>
<br>
So, here I was, chillin' in Kael Drakkel, enjoying the sights, trying to avoid the various giant-sized appendages I could've sworn were aiming for me.<br>
<br>
I was just enjoyin' life, livin' it up, wonderin' why there are giant men but not giant women... when, all of a sudden, the call goes up to rally outside Kael Drakkel; a fight t'wer brewin'.<br>
<br>
Long story short:  We sat on our asses fer a few hours waiting for everyone to show up, then telerported to the Dreadlands.<br>
<br>
Meandering about the Evil hellhole, we eventually came upon a few Dark Elves in a particular yeti cave.  They died.<br>
<br>
Then that crazy sonfoabitch, Vega Icantpronouncehissurname,halfspellit, decided we was goin' ta mess with the Evils in KC.  We approached the castle and dashed inside.  Lo' and behold, such a battle, such horrors, such sights.. we were victorious.  No force of shadow warriors and absent warriors can stand against Gladius Fatalis! (OOC:  There was no one there.)<br>
<br>
Eventually some Ruin and Infernal Elephants was outside, n' we hopped out ter fight 'im.<br>
<br>
They were a tad too seasoned fer us, so we gunned it outa there, losing a decidedly absent-minded Enchanter (Read:  He was Linkdead).<br>
<br>
We rallied in Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
They rallied outside FVie, nearby the zoneline into the nauseating city of scum-sucking Goods.<br>
<br>
After a few zoneline battled, one of their Necromancers plopped a Splurt on me, and wit' the ungodly age difference 'tween us, ma attempts ter dispell the uncomfortable shit were in vain.  I died.  (OOC:  Level 40 Neutrals should not be fighting level 51+ Evils, for the sake of, y'know, not being dead.)<br>
<br>
A few hours later I was revived and our lil' adventure continued.<br>
<br>
Entering the Lake of Imbeciles, we walked around killin' young'uns here and there.  I fell asleep a few times, though high points of the lake included a few powerful Iksar Shaman that seemed to think Spirit of thar Wolf were a buff they shouldn't apply when we was in the area.  They didn't live; we did.<br>
<br>
Growing tired of this prepubescent pile of Evils, we decided ta head towards the Overthere, and took the pass through Frontier Mountains on our way.<br>
<br>
The mountain ranges were fairly cleanly, lacking the foul stench of Evil bitches and bastards, so we didn't bother searching the area, and simply entered the Overthere.<br>
<br>
At this point our lil' raiding party seemed to have gotten discombobulated, mixed up, and in general: confused.  My group t'wer the only one in the area, apparently.<br>
<br>
We dropped a few gnoll-fuckin' Evils, including the late Gimil and scale-clad Ritual, of Malignant and Infernal Elite, respectively.<br>
<br>
This were all great fun, but t'was not to last.<br>
<br>
Around the area where Over There (dun know meself why the fuck ya'd name a place Over There, save ta confuse the shit outa me) meets Over He- er, the Warslik's Woods - we met a party of what musta been a thousand (n' 1!) Evils.  Many perished, and the few survivors escaped to meander about &quot;Over There.&quot;<br>
<br>
Slowly my companions dwindled; Ketu, the Druid, evacuated himself from danger, whilst Vardan, the Monk, got his ass whupped by some prissy Necromancers, and Kowboy, the Enchanter, decided it prudent to Gate.  Twer me and a few hundred Evil orc-mothered dogs &quot;Over There&quot; at this point, and time ta have some fun.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not terribly familiar with &quot;Over There,&quot; and could simply come up with, &quot;I'm Over There&quot; in response ta the various kindly shouts of, &quot;Where the fuck are you,&quot; but eventually made my way ter Skyfire's ramp-entrance, only to find a few billion nasties slaying the general wildlife for shits and giggles.  Freaks.<br>
<br>
So's, I says ta myself, let's have some fun, and spent the next few hours Charming various monsters onto the groups at the ramp, dispelling their Charms / Snares / Fears, whacking certain female Magicians over the head with me blades, n' in general makin' a nuisance of myself.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, every time one would get low six would appear outa no where, and so not many / any fell to my critters 'er me at this point.  I didn' die either, but I much prefer blood to no blood.<br>
<br>
Ah, a few highlights of &quot;poking the beehive,&quot; as one Evil fruit put it:<br>
<br>
Crawling up the grassy gnoll, careful to hide myself in the local brush and ferns, I spotted my target.  A scantily clad Human female with an earthen elemental by her side - Lemortia, the Magician, a Bashin' Iggle.  Singing my sweet siren song, I carefully entwined the dirt-ball in music, watching with satisfaction as the confused fuck jumped off a rather convenient cliff.<br>
<br>
Defenseless and relatively alone (the 30 Evils below her didn't count), the Magician provided a very tempting target.  &quot;What the hell 'im I waiting fer,&quot; I says ta myself, and leap at her, digging my blades into her pale flesh.  She justs stand there, smiling at me, taunting me with her foul snickers.  So's I dig in some more, intending ta cut this wench up real good.  Pity too, she had nice legs.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden the world went crazy, and this fuckin' 'chanter's pet kitty started kickin' my ass, so I say's ta myself, &quot;Agrul, you an't no fighter, get yer ass outa here,&quot; and I does, right quick-like.  (OOC:  I Shadowstepped from Da Bashin' Iggles trap.. that being Lemortia playing bait with Kento's hasted, Charmed pet playing bruiser... with exactly 25 health points left).<br>
<br>
I spent a few more hours fuckin' with the swarm o' Evils around the ramp, exchanging taunts - but, alas, all good things must come to an end, and I eventually had ta leave, so's I says goodbye, giving Dragoon V'lask a hug and a pat on the back 'fore I do, and head towards the Frontier Mountains.<br>
<br>
Now, this one particular annoyin' fuck of an Evil shit, Kirlen, takes it on himself ta piss me off, but fails miserably.  (OOC:  Kirlen wanted me to stay and apparently die.. perhaps I'm simply narrow-minded, but I didn't view a Dark Elven Cleric we had slain a few weeks ago as a very interesting target, and decided to leave anyways.)<br>
<br>
As I'm headin' through the mountains back ta Firiona Vie and some fine Elven women, I spots this one particularly ugly Goblin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Agrul,&quot; I thinks, &quot;we gots ta put that thing outa its misery.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, I does.  (OOC:  The Goblin dropped a Juntah Harvester, an 8/31 1hs with +15 sv poison on the side)<br>
<br>
Took ma new toy with me ter Firiona Vie, met a few nice lasses, and eventually decided it whar time ta head back home.<br>
<br>
OOC:  The rest of the trip was uneventful, as I &quot;ghetto-gated&quot; back to Velious via the watery depths of Firiona Vie.<br>
<br>
Storyline, OOC:<br>
<br>
We got our asses beat by levle 55ish (on average) Evils in DL/KC.<br>
<br>
We r0x0red some greens in LOIO (with the occasional red/even popping up unexpectedly).<br>
<br>
There was almost no one in the Frontier Mountains.<br>
<br>
We had a buncha good fights in OT, dropped some people, and eventually lost a bunch of men to a huge swarm of Evils.  Slowly the survivors died off / evac'd / gated / Etc. until I was the only one left, pulling corpses around and playing with the local inhabitants (Special thanks to Lemortia, Renxerox, Kento, all the other Bashin' Iggles I fought, Ruzzuk, Ritual for bein' a persistent bitch, and Kirlen for making me laugh).<br>
<br>
Now it's you all's turn to come to Velious, =p .<br>

Glad to hear that the Bashin Iggle folks are proving to be fun honorable enemies. May this trait be reflected, and our future wars bring forth great tales of battle.<br>
<br>
Ruin - I always love to fight yas. From my understanding, the guild did not try to avoid fighting you, but instead took to better, more advantageous (sp?) lands to fight you. Your choice not to come and fight there is respected. <br>
<br>
Worry not Ruin, we will tangle again soon enough :)<br>

Ranadiel and company tracked Vardan down and helped avenge my death -- all others except Agrul were gone (until later).  At one point Agrul was zone hopping and was low on health and somehow managed to escape the horde of evils waiting on either side &lt;frown&gt;.<br>
<br>
Helped sniff out a GF rescue party (they used my old hiding spot in the FM tunnel).  My uber greenage resists faired better there and I was able to get help from Ennder and crew and the 4 GF members fled away.<br>
<br>
After that I had to log and take care of my daughter ---<br>
<br>
Fun time!<br>

but with the resists the way they are, it would never land.<br>
<br>
For us high levelers, its all about melee and healing now.<br>
<br>
So you use your great Zek brains, and think of something.<br>
<br>
Where's those elite Zek tactics I've heard so much about?<br>
<br>
bah.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Splurt wouldn't kill us fast.  Splurt would kill us slowly but surely, because it starts out at around 1 damage a tick and builds up exponentially.  It would, however, kill us.<br>
<br>
Splurt is nearly unresistable in PvP.  The resists changes effect unresistable DoTs in no way.  Splurt will still land on *all* targets 99.9% of the time.  If you care to test it and prove your stupidity, give me one of your Necromancers and he can chain-cast it on me.  I won't resist it even once.<br>
<br>
We can't dispell your Splurts because Verant didn't so much as touch the dispell coding, and the level difference makes it impossible for us to dispell most of your buffs / DoTs.<br>
<br>
Therefore, a single unresistable DoT (i.e. Splurt) is extremely deadly to us.  Add in that all your spells are potentially more dangerous than ours, a good number of them are unresistable, and that your melees hit 5 times as hard as ours.. and you come to the conclusion that level 35-40's should not fight level 55's.  That's asking to die.<br>
<br>
While thus far fighting Ruin has been somewhat interesting, you always beat your chests after beating people 20 levels below you - and that's just dull.  Kindly shut the fuck up and open your mouth when you know what you're talking about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hehe -- it was a fun time. When GF zoned in I immediately went to the FM zoneline (and then backtracked to WW as they bypassed me there). Helped chase Kento around then found Agrul and Vardan -- being the ever so bold (but not so bright) inkie that I am I sent my pet in and tried to darkness them. Well lvl 40ish bard + lvl 40ish monk &gt; lvl 19 necromancer (though not by much *poke*).&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, you had help when we dropped you.  Jaidan was there with you.  Unfortunately, he was DMFed and lev'ing in an attempt to escape Vardan and I, so we killed you first.<br>
<br>
Jaidan gated shortly after your death, as I was singing the lev. song to get up to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ranadiel and company tracked Vardan down and helped avenge my death -- all others except Agrul were gone (until later). At one point Agrul was zone hopping and was low on health and somehow managed to escape the horde of evils waiting on either side &lt;frown&gt;.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was never zone-hopping low on health.<br>
<br>
The only time I was close to death was when Da Bashin' Iggles charmed sabretooth nearly gnabbed me.. the only times I zoned out were:<br>
<br>
A)  I accidently zoned whilst searching for Param's corpse (to drag) nearby WW.<br>
<br>
B)  I zoned into WW chasing after some Iksar Necromancer I had at 30% health.  He logged off as I zoned over (meaning I zoned over and he disappeared as I was hitting A to attack).  There were a good number of Evils over there, and it wasn't the most suitable position, so I zoned back into OT and continued playing cat and mouse with the Evils there.<br>
<br>
It was a fun few hours though.. reminded me of DL on TZ.<br>

Umm.... splurt is unresistable in PvP.   Just a FYI for the bloobs I guess =/<br>
<br>
Anyways, this was not a flame fest towards GF. They came into OT which I personally thought takes some sack taking it that OT houses like 100+ peeps a night in it. They gave us a battle, and left. Over all a good fight IMO.<br>
<br>
No offense to &lt;Ruin&gt; but if you guys wanna fair fight your gonna have to wait for another month or 2 tell the rest of us catch up. Level 50-60s attacking isnt a fight, thats a slaughter plain and simple.<br>

<br>
Wow if there ever was a statement that reeks of someone begging to have the moron label attached to them this would be it.<br>
<br>
Splurt will never ever kill anyone above lvl 30 fast it takes a damn long time to start doing signifigant damage and once you start having to fight people within range of you maybe you will realize its a worthless DOT against anyone worth their salt in PvP.<br>
<br>
I have been splurted what im sure is now hundreds of times and i've resisted it 3 times ever, most people will be lucky to resist it once in their PvP careers and it has nothing at all to do with resistance checks.<br>
<br>
DOT's that don't have an initial DD/Debuff component to them do not check a resistance but rather just make a luck roll which to the best I can figure is a 99% chance of landing. DOT's that have an initial DD (Shaman Bane of Knife and Plague line) or a Debuff (Enchanter/Necro Str/Agi debuff series) have to check against their respective resistance before landing and if the DD/Debuff is resisted the DOT does not take hold.  <br>
<br>
This is what makes Winged Death and Pyro the most feared DOT's until a Shaman scribes lvl 60 Malo into his spell book and Bane of Nife becomes viable.<br>

Agrul may have covered this, I didn't bother reading on after that incredibly ignorant and foolish post, but necro spells that don't roll vs resists are:<br>
<br>
-Leach line.<br>
-Blood line.<br>
-Tap line.<br>
