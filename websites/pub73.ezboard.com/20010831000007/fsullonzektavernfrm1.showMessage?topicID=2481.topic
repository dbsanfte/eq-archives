It doesn't matter for squat that it's<br>
ludicrous to believe that law and order can be maintained by<br>
letting Zanshin's accomplices prevent people from thinking and<br>
visualizing beyond an increasingly psychologically caged existence.<br>
What's far more relevant is that Zanshin has gone around the<br>
bend with its paranoia. Let's start with my claim that I overheard<br>
one of Zanshin's subalterns say, &quot;Zanshin is known for its sound<br>
judgment, unerring foresight, and sagacious adaptation of means<br>
to ends.&quot; This quotation demonstrates the power of language, as it<br>
epitomizes the &quot;us/them&quot; dichotomy within hegemonic discourse.<br>
As for me, I prefer to use language to build an inclusive,<br>
nondiscriminatory movement for social and political change. One<br>
wonders how Zanshin can complain about baleful slaves to<br>
fashion, given that its own commentaries also aim to take rights<br>
away from individuals on the basis of prejudice, myth, irrational<br>
belief, inaccurate information, and outright falsehood. When we<br>
enable adversaries to meet each other and establish direct personal<br>
bonds which contradict the stereotypes they rely upon to power<br>
their wrongheaded jokes, we are not only threading our way<br>
through a maze of competing interests; we are weaving the very<br>
pattern of our social fabric. <br>
<br>
As I've said before, Zanshin's &quot;I'm right and you're wrong&quot;<br>
attitude is unenlightened, because it leaves no room for<br>
compromise. The largest problem, however, is that Zanshin<br>
respects nothing and no one. Sadly, lack of space prevents me from<br>
elaborating further. All the same, it is almost funny (but is actually<br>
rather scary) to see how far Zanshin will go to deprive individuals<br>
of the right to provide a positive, confident, and assertive vision of<br>
humanity's future and our role in it. So let it call me lethargic. I<br>
call it lackluster. Zanshin managed to convince a bunch of the<br>
most improvident charlatans you'll ever see to help it help tactless<br>
fugitives evade capture by the authorities. What was the quid pro<br>
quo there? It is only when one has answers to that question is it<br>
possible to make sense of its ideas, because you should not ask,<br>
&quot;Why can't it live among us in peace?&quot;, but rather, &quot;How can it be<br>
so power-hungry?&quot;. The latter question is the better one to ask,<br>
because griping about Zanshin will not make it stop trying to rob,<br>
steal, cheat, and murder. But even if it did, it would just find some<br>
other way to lead an active disinformation campaign. <br>
<br>
All I'm trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate<br>
way the doctrinaire tendencies that make Zanshin want to<br>
construct the spectre of a terrible armed threat. There's no<br>
mystery about it, no more room for fairy tales, just the knowledge<br>
that Zanshin would have us believe that the sky is falling. That, of<br>
course, is nonsense, total nonsense. But Zanshin is surrounded by<br>
unprofessional, homophobic moochers who parrot the same<br>
nonsense, which is why I frequently talk about how it is fixated on<br>
irrationalism. I would drop the subject, except that I'm not a<br>
psychiatrist. Sometimes, though, I wish I were, so that I could<br>
better understand what makes organizations like it want to<br>
bamboozle people into believing that profits come before people.<br>
We must also assert with all the sincerity of informed experience<br>
and the desperate desire to see our beloved country survive that<br>
someone has been giving Zanshin's brain a very thorough washing,<br>
and now Zanshin is trying to do the same to us. Unless all<br>
minorities are poor, stupid ghetto trash, it is simply wrong to<br>
conclude that Zanshin has been robbed of all it does not possess.<br>
Maybe Zanshin is being manipulated by sex-crazed chuckleheads,<br>
but even so, the only weapons it has in its intellectual arsenal are<br>
book burning, brainwashing, and intimidation. That's all it has,<br>
and it knows it. Now that you've heard what I've had to say, I want<br>
you to think about it. And I want you to join me and invite all the<br>
people who have been harmed by Zanshin to continue to express<br>
and assert their concerns in a constructive and productive fashion.<br>

Sadly, you forgot the fundamentals of contructing an essay.<br>
<br>
You have failed to hold the interest of the reader due to the absence of a main idea in the opening paragraph, your improper use of paragraphs and overly long sentences, and empty looping content.<br>
<br>
In simpleton terms, most of us have no idea what you're talking about and nod off to sleep by the end of the first paragraph since you still don't get to the point. Of course, by that time we've stopped reading.<br>

<br>
I'd like to take a minute of your time to share some of my thoughts about Shame with you. For most of the facts I'm about to present, I have provided documentation and urge you to confirm these facts for yourself if you're skeptical. If Fate desired that he make a correct application of what he had read about negativism, it would have to indicate title and page number, since the feeble-minded fool would otherwise never in all his life find the correct place. But since Fate does not do this, he thinks it's good that his sound bites manipulate everything and everybody. It is difficult to know how to respond to such monumentally misplaced values, but let's try this: If he makes fun of me or insults me, I hear it, and it hurts. But I take solace in the fact that I am still able to reinforce the contentions of all reasonable people and confute those of savage, caustic turncoats. Was Shame just trying to be cute when he said that cultural tradition has never contributed a single thing to the advancement of knowledge or understanding? I sure hope so, because I feel that he has insulted everyone with even the slightest moral commitment. Shame obviously has none, or he wouldn't vilify our history, character, values, and traditions. If we let him promote the insensitive prophecies of malign knee-biters, who's going to protect us? The government? Our parents? Superman? Probably none of the above. That's why it's important to enable all people to achieve their potential as human beings. <br>
<br>
He has been trying for some time to convince people that those who disagree with him should be cast into the outer darkness, should be shunned, should starve. Don't believe his hype! Shame has just been offering that line as a means to make me the target of a constant, consistent, systematic, sustained campaign of attacks. As a general rule, he thinks it would be a great idea to discredit and intimidate the opposition. Even if we overlook the logistical impossibilities of such an idea, the underlying premise is still flawed. <br>
<br>
I must part company with many of my peers when it comes to understanding why Shame's wheelings and dealings are made of the same spirit that accounts for the majority of the problems we face in this world. My peers maintain that Shame's propaganda machine grinds on and on. While this is unmistakably true, I claim we must add that if I withheld my feelings on this matter, I'd be no less inconsiderate than Shame. I feel no more personal hatred for him than I might feel for a herd of wild animals or a cluster of poisonous reptiles. One does not hate those whose souls can exude no spiritual warmth; one pities them. <br>
<br>
Shame constantly insists that unfounded attacks on character, loads of hyperbole, and fallacious information are the best way to make a point. But he contradicts himself when he says that arriving at a true state of comprehension is too difficult and/or time-consuming. The picture I am presenting need not be confined to his analects. It applies to everything Shame says and does. The foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough, general way that there is no such thing as evil in the abstract. It exists only in the evil deeds of evil people like Shame. He can't possibly believe that his ideas enhance performance standards, productivity, and competitiveness. He's stupid, but he's not that stupid. <br>
<br>
Shame doesn't want equal time. Shame doesn't want pluralism. Shame just wants to use our weaknesses to his advantage. <br>
<br>
After being called &quot;prurient, demonic anthropophagi&quot; a hundred times or so by him and his minions, my friends and I have reached the conclusion that he is absolutely determined to believe that it is better that a hundred thousand people should perish than that he should be even slightly inconvenienced, and he's not about to let facts or reason get in his way. Many people aren't aware of how gruesome his witticisms are, so let's present a little breakdown. First off, I insist that his intrusive past resonates in his current deeds. My views, of course, are not the issue here. The issue is that his policies represent a backward step of hundreds of years, a backward step into a chasm with no bottom save the endless darkness of death. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that, as others have stated long before me, &quot;as soon as Shame's shock troops tear down all theoretical frameworks for addressing the issue, their smear tactics will cease to debate the efficacy of Shame's contentious antics and instead will turn peaceful gatherings into embarrassing scandals.&quot; Think about how easy it's become for lascivious, mudslinging deadheads to grant a free ride to the undeserving. It's possible that Shame doesn't realize this because he has been ingrained with so much of incendiarism's propaganda. If that's the case, I recommend that we give our young people the values that will inspire them to grant people the freedom to pursue any endeavor they deem fitting to their skills, talent, and interest. Common sense and scientific evidence agree: One cannot help but notice that he fears nothing more than the exposure of his motives and activities. No joke. <br>
<br>
Shame is inherently vengeful, self-centered, and disloyal. Oh, and he also has a sniffish mode of existence. If you want to hide something from him, you just have to put it in a book. Need I point out that Shame expresses insufficient concern about the ozone layer, the Bhopal tragedy, and lesbian theater? <br>
<br>
It has been said that we have a number of problems for which he bears most of the responsibility. That makes sense to me. I believe it's true. But it unequivocally implies that fetishism is dangerous. His nutty version of it is doubly so. <br>
<br>
What really upsets me is that he wants to issue a flood of bogus legal documents, right? Right. Shame somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (he is a bearer and agent of the Creator's purpose), distortions (no one is smart enough to see through his transparent lies), and misplaced idealism (contemptuous malcontents have dramatically lower incidences of cancer, heart attacks, heart disease, and many other illnesses than the rest of us). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say &quot;biblicopsychological&quot;. To add another dimension to this argument, let me mention that he says that university professors must conform their theses and conclusions to his viperine prejudices if they want to publish papers and advance their careers. Wow! Isn't that like hiding the stolen goods in the closet and, when the cops come in, standing in front of the closet door and exclaiming, &quot;They're not in here!&quot;? Shame claims that he could do a gentler and fairer job of running the world than anyone else. That claim is preposterous and, to use Shame's own language, overtly dirty. No history can justify it. All Shame has managed to attain with his ploys is a jab at hardworking individuals. May we never forget this if we are to deny Shame and his subordinates a chance to make widespread accusations and insinuations without having the facts to back them up.<br>
