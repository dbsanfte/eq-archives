<br>
And then you bitch about the point system broken? And you bitch about people laughing at you for not being able to kill anyone less than 20 levels below you? I'm glad school starts soon so you won't be able to make too much more of an idiot of yourself.<br>
<br>
Rashweaki: Are you seriously that dumb?<br>
<br>
Yeah, there are gonna be druids high enough to circle into Dreadlands before the Iksar, who never had to worry about anyone raiding THEIR newbie zones, who had an incredible exp bonus, who had instant access to great equipment, will get to the same level and take over.<br>
<br>
Riiiiiiiiiiiight. May as well say Newts could have taken over Lavastorm. After all, DRUIDS CAN PORT THERE! Or Guk! Or Oasis! Druids can port into South Ro! <br>
<br>
You don't SERIOUSLY believe that newts low-level could have made it through the deathtrap that is FV (outside the outpost), and you don't SERIOUSLY believe that the PvP-plauged newts (who all had to run to Qeynos first for even a tiny bit of safety) could have gotten into Sebilis before the evils.<br>
<br>
You don't &quot;take&quot; a zone that nobody but you is in. It's not like you had to kick anyone out. &lt;font color=blue&gt; Evil &lt;/font&gt; was the first team to get to a level appropriate for Kunark, AND I WONDER WHY.<br>
<br>
Vik: &quot;Yah to bad my sk was only lvl 30. And i got to 16 hunting in befallen where i had to contend with alot of newts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh-huh. Because those halfling druids are just so dangerous inside Befallen. Even with the 20 or so evils running around in WC guarding your back. Alot = you had to fight more than once, every single day? Alot = checking the /who list every five minutes because a good or newt force could enter the zone at any time? Are you seriously calling Befallen a contested zone, even though it's right smack in the middle of a whole lot of &lt;font color=blue&gt; evil &lt;/font&gt; territory? And you call ME stupid?<br>
<br>
&quot;Then when i did move to loio i was always the person getting people together to fight of good/newt attacks&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh-huh. No, really, I believe you. Honest. Just because I spent levels 14-15 soloing in LOIO without any problems at all, as the only non-evil in the zone, even when people would shout that I was in the zone and give my location doesn't mean anything. I mean, had YOU been on-line at the time, your uber l33tness would have tracked me down. Uh-huh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe you should know what the fuck your talking about before you try to flame someone huh?&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;font color=blue&gt; Why would I ever flame a team that won't even try to PvP a piece of moldy fried chicken until level 50? &lt;/font&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Im sure newts hunting in veleous is a real fucking challange huh? All the mid lvl battles for zone control?&quot;<br>
<br>
You really haven't been paying much attention, have you?<br>
<br>
&quot;Your right there are alot of evil who dont pvp&quot;<br>
<br>
Apparently, most of &lt;font color=blue&gt; evil &lt;/font&gt; can't PvP, or one person wouldn't be able to put the entire team into the negative numbers.<br>
<br>
The only place team &lt;font color=blue&gt; evil &lt;/font&gt; as a whole will ever be red is on the scoreboard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;but you know there are people that do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah. The people like Gamtick who get to 50 and then wade into the awesomely challenging battlefield of Highkeep. And then bitch that the point system is broken, but they don't care. All day.<br>
<br>
&quot;I dont have to goto karana to get pvp. I can sit in loio and fight plently of newts and goods all day while gaining exp.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uh-huh. No, really, I believe you.<br>
<br>
Gamtick: Yeah, takes lots of skill to kill a level 7 in CB with one nuke. Ooooh, I'm in awe of the skill it takes to manage that. Simply in awe.<br>
<br>
&lt;font color=blue&gt; That's why you joined the evil team after all, though... so you wouldn't have to PvP when it's not SAFE. &lt;/font&gt; <p><CENTER>

I have said in MANY, MANY, Posts that I could Care Less about the points, matter of fact I said &quot;FUCK THE POINTS&quot;. I started a post About a week ago stating that &quot;I was wondering if school had started since there is a lack of posts on the boards&quot; Apparently you missed that one to. Also if I was a High School kid and didn't have school, wouldn't you think I would be playing on EQ and not arguing with your sorry lame fucking ass here? Damn your a fucking Dipshit. Your prolly just like me sitting at your Desk at work hitting refresh on the Msg Board? Thats what I'm doing because I'm bored. <br>
FYI:As I said before, If I see a Greenie I kill him/her, if I see a White I'll kill him/her for sure, if I see a Red con I will attempt to kill him/her for sure. <br>
