<br>
Ah, GMs.<br>
<br>
The same GMs that hand out warnings on other servers for Enchanters using Charmed mobs to kill people, because, and I quote, &quot;mobs cause exp-loss, and you use mobs to kill people, therefore your an exp-kiler.&quot;<br>
<br>
The same GMs that can't seem to agree on *ANY* issue.<br>
<br>
The same GMs that summon and bind players in the ToV / VP.<br>
<br>
The same Verant that hands out bannings for an out-of-game action due to their idiocy and poor security.<br>
<br>
My point?  GMs aren't a concrete source of information.<br>
<br>
By the way, telling Hentai he's stupid hardly &quot;counters&quot; any of his points.. you were doing better with the whole, &quot;Shut the fuck up.&quot; thing.<br>

Whether the person who gets the last blow or most cumulative damage, doesnt really matter to me.  I think what they need to do though, is to offer incentives to people to PvP in ways that avoid people doing these type things. <br>
<br>
If they gave experience, they could accomplish this.  If you gave exp the same as you would for a mob, (ie, person or group shares exp for kill).  For the first kill of a particular PC you would get full exp, 2nd kill, if anyone in the group is in on 2nd kill of that particular PC within 24 hour period, then that person only gets 75% exp in 2nd kill, 50% on 3rd kill, 25% on 4th kill, 0 exp on any kills after that within 24 hour period.  <br>
<br>
This would encourage people to move on, and not corpse camp (because you would want to move on to new prey, for better exp).  It would keep people from trying to waste time killing greens (for the most part). AND it would address the loss of exp you have from PvP, in that you could GAIN exp in a win.  (Sucks that you can lose exp from PvP, but cant gain exp).  <br>

Wish I did, I would like to know what people think.  Maybe I will get the time later (doubt it).<br>
<br>
I think it's a fine tactic.  People in PvP should be able to hurt each other.  High levels should be able to make low levels suffer and have to flee them.  I despise the 5 level newbie immortality sanctuary rule.  I don't even like how killing someone who is level 5 causes no loss of experience. Likewise, I like how with a bit of extra effort a high level can make a low level lose exp.  I can sorta respect why they high level can't do it outright, but people SHOULD be scared of higher levels.  Dying, even to a high level, should be a bad thing.  Higher levels should be able to cause experience loss, even if indirectly with some extra effort.<br>
<br>
If they did decide to do something, making it illegal is NOT how they should do it.  Coding it out somehow is far better.<br>

<br>
There is a HUGE difference between training, corpse camping, and a speed hack.. <br>
<br>
If I am not mistaken the things which players are banned for is Really excessive bad language right? <br>
and 2 here is the biggy see if you can grasp this concept... speed hacks showeq whatever you want to do are not Game exploits they are HACKs you are not allowed to mess with verants software that is why you are allowed to do shit like having  50th wiz nuke someone to 2% life and having someone low kill it. how is that different than powerleveling someone? its an in game thing not something someone did to change the way the game works. <br>
<br>
ok and lastly I applaud whoever was doing that I forget there names. I enjoyed hearing people whine and bitch about it. I would do the same shit if I could it is a great plan/piece of teamwork. so please stop whining. remember this server is...<br>
NO RULES. (as long as you don't take it upon yourself to mess with the games mechanics).<br>
<br>
a bigger problem I see with the server is crap like the dark elf level 5 guy in Freeport who likes to train the ogre paladin to the dock. to kill off fellow evils. Even if another team was there they couldn't stop him because technically it is a newbie zone so verant doesn't want to make newbies PKable there.  shit like that is an exploit as well. but /shrug what can you do. <br>

<br>
Well... I got my lvl back twice, and back on track.  They did a great job killing many of us... hehe  Also Pumpking was a terror in EF last night...  Also in Halas, heard that she was in the water with someone else... like a shark waiting for a prey.   Decided banking could wait after that...   Ran into her trying to kill a whity rogue... she had someone else to play with in front of me... so I ran the other way.  No need to give her another 30-35 points on an easy kill... hehe<br>
<br>
Well, revange will be sweet...  Just hope I can get to advance and get it...   I'm building up some resentment...   I think I understand why some end up killing greens for no reason...   It's cause they were killed so many times with no chance in hell...  Well, if that's where I'm going to end up... So be it.  I was hoping I didn't have to kill Greenies to get my satisfaction for revange...

I don't know why anyone cannot seem to understand this.  I am not bitching.  I am bringing up a valid point, and asked for suggestions.<br>
<br>
Perdition, so what you are saying is that this is a &quot;no rules&quot; server, but you can't mess with the game mechanics (I.E- Speed Hacking).  So, this is a &quot;no rules&quot; server but there is a rule about messing with the game mechanics.  This makes no sense.  Please clarify.<br>
<br>
Per, i am &quot;dealing with it&quot;, but what is the sense of not trying to get it fixed?  When your car is broken, do you just deal with it?  Or do you get it fixed? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Agrul-  So, what you're telling me is that i am better off just sitting here hoping that a GM will magically change the rules without me /feedbacking?  If that GM had told me that it is a valid tactic and is NOT an exploit, would you still have listed all the things you had?<br>

<br>
you say you are not bitching because you think it is a valid point.  i guess because, you lost exp.<br>
<br>
we think you are a whiney, little poon bitch; because, we do not think it is a valid point.  we think it is fair.<br>
<br>
we think it is fair because,<br>
1) if they can do it to you, some on your team can do it to them.<br>
<br>
2) because the risk is the same, as it is not item loss, it is exp; that is the same for every lvl.<br>
<br>
3) because we were smart enough to see this as a tactic without lvl limits, and apparently you were not.<br>
<br>
4) because we seem to be able to get groups, and now no one who has read this thread would probably group with you.  if it is this bad now, i can't imagine what a group chat would have been like with you when it happened.<br>
<br>
i guess the only valid point is you died.  i hope they do it again, repeatedly; and run you off the server.  <br>

If that GM had told me that it is a valid tactic and is NOT an exploit, would you still have listed all the things you had?&quot;<br>
<br>
/feedback does not result in a response from a GM.<br>
<br>
/petition does.<br>
<br>
I think you've got those 2 confused.<br>
<br>
And, in case you missed it:<br>
<br>
&quot;My point? GMs aren't a concrete source of information.&quot;<br>
<br>
That was my point.<br>
<br>
I never said not to try and fix things that were &quot;broken;&quot; merely that a GM's word means jack shit, and you'll need something more concrete than that to prove that it's an &quot;exploit&quot; of the game mechanics.<br>
<br>
&quot;If that GM had told me that it is a valid tactic and is NOT an exploit, would you still have listed all the things you had?&quot;<br>
<br>
I doubt you would have posted it then, as it wouldn't back up your argument, and you'd still be a few replies back with no response to my call for some proof that it's an exploit.<br>

<br>
Hentai, my point is not valid because i lost experience.  My point is valid because all i did was ask everyone's opinion on a simple situation.  Yet faggots like you reply with dumbass flames that are not needed.<br>
<br>
Agrul - I /feedbacked about experience loss, and then /petitioned the GM and asked him if what those two were doing was valid.<br>
<br>
It isn't really a big fucking deal, and i don't understand why so many wankers feel that they have to flame me, without even making a point (half-assed flames if i may say so myself).<br>
<br>
On a lighter note, this is my first topic that has reached the 100 post mark *cheers*<br>
