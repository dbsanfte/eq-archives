“the dream”<br>
<br>
Dear Mother,<br>
<br>
I am so very happy to be back in Ak’Anon after that terrifying trip abroad, I do not know how I get myself in the middle of such things. All this “defending the lands” stuff is not for me. I wish I could just be left alone to enjoy the splendors of our beloved Steam Font mountains and earn an honest living the only way any decent thief should. Alas, something inside me just wont let that happen, it must be the blood of old Thurfiz Halliwax causing me the grief. <br>
<br>
Well, enough of all that, let me tell you about my dream I had last night. First let me say I have never experienced such a vivid dream in all my years. It was as if I were there in the midst of it, it was both frightening and wondrous at the same time. <br>
<br>
There we were standing atop of ridge, a large army of my kin and other brave gnomes, with the banners of all different houses of the gnomish empire, waving in the wind. Also in our midst were brave dwarves from Kaladim and the fleet of foot halflings from the city of Rivervale. We were flanked by the elves of Felwithe and Kelethin. All of us dressed for battle, the mood was of tense excitement. <br>
<br>
There was a stir from the front of the ranks, and it trickled to our midst where I stood. I being a curious sole wedged my way forward towards the front. Well let me tell you, I wish I wouldn’t have looked, because across a large valley that stood between us, on the other ridge stood a mass of indescribable horror. From our vantage point it was hard to make out detail but for a blue black sea of moving bodies, mixed in with big gray hulking figures the color of wet mud, and giant rocks that moved on humongous legs! There too, banners flew in the wind, although I could not make out the symbols, I knew them not to be friendly.<br>
<br>
At that moment our forces were a buzz of activity, forming ranks and such. The elders barking orders and moving the younger ones to there respective areas. It was then that I was brusquely grabbed by the arm and dragged to the back and side of our formation, by a wizen old scout. I did not catch his name, but I did manage to blurt out “what is going on here?!” He gave me a look as if I was half crazed and said, “well if ye be living under a rock for a bit o’ time, ye’d not know that we are to fight the evil armies of Isharuuk today!!” “Now get ye’self in line here with the rest of the scouts, we move out in a moment, to the flank and rear of the dark army under guise of the shadows.”<br>
<br>
I swallowed hard, and complied. I could see from my vantage point, all of our clerics had moved to the rear, aft of the warriors and paladins but before the other magic wielders. Our warriors were all forming a tight line, elbow to elbow, shield to shield. To the flanks stood archers, with bows ready and quivers full of arrows. I chanced a glance over the valley and saw the dark army doing the same, except the big lumbering beasts were not very well organized and did not seem to be remotely interested in what the elves of darkness were yelling at them. Then to my amazement I saw another being in there midst, lizard like but tall as a elf ! These creatures were slinking around at will between the ranks of others.<br>
<br>
With a tug of my arm my small band was off into the woods where the shadows fell more densely, angling straight away from our army, far from the impending crush of armies, as to not be seen, then turning in towards the valley in the general direction of the enemy. The plan was from what I heard to evade the enemy scouts if any and try to come up from behind and side of the enemy. We stopped for a bit and the elders applied poison to there weapons. I, being to young to understand the exact placement of a poisoned weapon was left to my trusty rapier and sturdy bow.<br>
<br>
At one point in our “sneak” to the enemy as we scouts like to call it, we stopped and hid motionless, I cannot be sure but I think the enemy also had scouts in the area and a glimpse of them was caught. It must have been thought that our purpose would be better served to continue on and cause havoc to the rear of the enemy than to engage the evil scouts there in the shadows. They would be greeted by our forces on the ridge, no doubt.<br>
After a short bit we made our way to the edge of the shadows on the rear flank of the evil army. The foul smell of those great lumbering beasts reached us before we even laid eyes upon the enemy. What a putrid smell it was, it made want to run right there and then. The elders of our small group were all gathering towards the front, there weapons dripping with many different types of fetid poisons. I, along with other younger scouts were told to prepare our bows and to stand back in the shadows, until the word was given.<br>
I of course did not argue this point, I had no desire to get any closer to that evil than I already was. <br>
<br>
From my vantage point I caught glimpses of the enemy mass, and it was a cruel bunch, all dressed in shining bronze armor and masks right out of any gnome child’s worst nightmare. Some of the huge beasts were dressed in thorny armor, yet some were just in rags.<br>
<br>
A great multitude of horns sounded in the distance from our armies ridge and from this far away I could see the army of light descending the valley in a great wall of small and tall alike, armor glinting in the sun, a great battle cry reached my ears next.<br>
<br>
Then the dark army surged forward down the side of their ridge heading directly for the wall of light. The dark army let loose with a barrage of magic’s, directed at the front of the charging light army, great fireballs and gasses clouds descended upon the brave soles heading for destruction. Multiple warriors were struck at once some thrown to the ground, some stumbling onward, heaving as they went. In a split second the barrage from the light army slammed into the leading front of the army of darkness. Great beasts were singed, blasted with both fire and ice, gusts of air blasted into lizards and dark elves alike, hurling them about. Arrows hammered into the bigger targets, some of the beasts looking like giant pin cushions, some fell but most trudged forward, stumbling on.<br>
<br>
From the midst of both charging armies, magical creatures appeared, overtaking the running mortals. Shield and sword animations, summoned elementals and running undead were seen taking the lead of this strange race.<br>
<br>
The beasts loped ahead, the lizards slinked along and the two masses collided at the bottom in a great “CRASH” of metal and will !<br>
<br>
Some of the younger scouts in my group were growing edgy, but the elders held them in check. “Stay, the shadows” I heard the elders say, “Stay the shadows”. “Wait for the signal”. <br>
<br>
From our vantage point in the woods halfway up the enemy ridge it was hard to make out what was going on below in any detail, the din of shouts, cries and metal on metal drifted in the wind. The battle raged on in the very center of the valley, the dark army still had numbers that stayed behind, and did not join the fray, but stayed half way down the valley wall, magic users and healers I did assume. They stayed far enough back as to stay clear of sword and arrow but close enough to still be in range to cast there multitude of spells.<br>
<br>
We moved as a unit stealthily down the wooded portion of the valley until we were slightly behind and still flanking the rear of the enemy casters. Then the silent word was given in slight hand gestures that only a scout would understand, and the elder scouts moved out with poison dripping from their weapons. The moved silently, sticking to any shadow or obstruction they could find, like a blanket of silent death they crept towards the unprotected casters.<br>
<br>
I watched as some of the elders were engaged by a small squad of warriors that had stayed back to protect the casters, but most found there mark with a violent plunge of their weapon into the back of preoccupied casters and healers. <br>
<br>
The word was given and we let loose with our bows, we shot again, and again as fast as we could knock the arrows. Knives flew, shriekens whizzed and spears were hurled, all aimed at this rear section of the enemy. Clerics and casters were cut down in mid-spell, for some it was more cruel as the poison quickly did unspeakable things to there dark blood.<br>
<br>
Some of the casters turned our way and fire, ice and wind were thrown our way. The trees protected us somewhat but many a scout was cut down. Then the evil pets came on, it was time to draw our steel and earn our merit as warriors!<br>
<br>
Horribly huge skeletons advanced one bashing me so hard on the shield, I went numb and was spun around right into a horrible elemental of rock and dirt . It pounded me this way and that and the skeleton did the same. Then my senses were back and “Thorn” flashed out and pierced the Giant mass of bones and I slipped away before it had its wits about it again. Other scouts were at my side then and we moved this way and that weaving a strange kind of dance through our enemies and their abominations.<br>
<br>
Through our struggles I caught glances of the main battle, my eye scanned the mass of destruction until I found the flag of Halliwax, still sailing in the midst of the battle! Our forces seemed to swallowed up in the midst of the taller dark army, all but our flags. There was a great battle raging around the flag of Halliwax, the flag began to fall to the ground and my heart skipped a beat and it seemed they were being overcome by the big brutes of evil!<br>
<br>
My attention was quickly brought back “swish” of a mace heading directly for my small gnomish head. I ducked without thinking rolling on the ground, up in a flash I was driving my rapier “Thorn” deep into the thigh of an assailing dark healer. The bronze armor the dark enemy wore was strong but Thorn was much to sharp to be turned away. With a well placed foot on the assailants knee I pried Thorn out, with a quick jerk, before the healer could react. Other scouts were at my side then, swallowing the cleric up in quick thrusts and slashes.<br>
<br>
A quick glance back to the main battle saw a small wedge being forced through the main heart of the dark army led by the mighty dwarves of Kaladim all armored from head to toe, wielding mighty two handed axes, the weapon of choice amongst most dwarven warriors. One of these Dwarves caught the Halliwax standard as its flag bearer fell in battle, he quickly planted in the ground to fly again and pressed on.<br>
<br>
A huge growl from my left snapped my back to the task at hand. A huge beast the color of mud with big yellow eyes was closing on me fast with a cruel looking halberd swinging towards me. I threw up my shield and just managed to deflect it away from my vital parts. Down I went to the ground, I rolled with the force but came up with no air in my lungs. The huge beast raised the halberd again to finish me, but a slew of knives landed in its thick throat and it fell backwards with a thud.<br>
<br>
Loud explosions of fire moved my attention back to the main foray. The enemy casters were blazing their fire at the warriors of the army of light. Some of our warriors heaved in great convulsions, some were set a blaze, some clutched their hands to their eyes as if blinded.<br>
<br>
The enemy casters were taking turns sitting down meditating and rising to cast . Under different circumstances this would have been a comical sight to see, but as it were I was not laughing. Down in the valley the great beasts of mud and the moving rocks on legs were wreaking great havoc on our warriors. It would take 3 or more of our warriors to bring down one of those large beasts. The legs of these towers were the only vulnerable part it seemed and was the main target of gnome sword and dwarven axe. <br>
<br>
The battle carried away from me at the moment so I began to creep towards the enemy casters that were focused on the battle below. Suddenly with a wash of green light, the roots around my feet grabbed me fast! I could not move! Then a huge blast of white light into my eyes! I clawed at them, trying to rub them clear but all was dark. I hunkered down the best I could as to not be seen but I knew I was in real trouble. A huge blast of energy tore slammed into me knocking me down. My feet however stayed fast to the rooted spot. I could not breathe I was fading fast, another blast of energy crushed my chest, the little wind I had in it taken from me, my shield flew from my hands.<br>
<br>
My eyes finally cleared to see ……….. her! The dark elf priestess from the vision of the church I had on my travels! She was standing directly over my standing on my arm that held Thorn. Raising her cruel steel mace she said “I know of you Berae Halliwax, you have meddled once to often in the business of the Tier’ Dal. Goodbye little pest” . The mace raced towards my head with cruel speed ………………………….<br>
<br>
Then I awoke in my room with a cry of horror ! I was alone, in my dark room, the sweet smell of pipe smoke still lingering in the air. All was quiet except for my labored breathing and the distant tick of the clockworks. <br>
<br>
I did not sleep the rest of the night, needless to say, I didn’t even try. I know not what this means, I hope it is just my overactive mind calming down after my travels.<br>
<br>
Oh, dear mother, I wish you were here to comfort me. I wish I knew you, I wish I could sit and talk with you. I wish I could hear all the stories of how you and father met. Oh, my older sister Derae tries hard to take care of me and be my guide, for that I am grateful. <br>
<br>
Alas, I don’t even know your name. I will find you though mother, I will not stop until I have scoured every inch of gnomish lore, I will find you, I will………………….<br>
<br>
We will make you proud, mother.<br>
<br>
Your loving daughter,<br>
