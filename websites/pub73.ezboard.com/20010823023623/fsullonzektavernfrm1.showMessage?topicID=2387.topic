<br>
Better luck next time, =) .<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
Since people want a storyline, and Coraan's a Dwarf, and Dwarves are bad storytellers, here it is:<br>
<br>
I had around an hour or two left in the day, and would only see myself as a nuisance to a group, as I'd leave them shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I logged on with every intent of slaughtering those fuckin' walrus-men parading about the beach, and harvesting their precious tusks for the mysterious &quot;|0|-|@+ |00+$.&quot;  I know not what these strange items are, but they seem to be in great demand, and who better to retreive them than a young, dashing, enterprising Bard such as myself?<br>
<br>
Entering the icy hell that is Velious, I find myself in the confines of a gigantic structure crafted along enormous guildlines, with none other than its makers - the giants - in mind.<br>
<br>
Slipping over to Pollos's (the banker~) side, I toss him a few spare coins, a sup3r s3kr3t password, and he opens my designated bank vault.  After briskly reorganizing the mess I found within, I donned my Crystalline Armors (sirs, MR am gud) and mystical Storm-imbued Collar, heading out towards the dangerous region known only as, &quot;The Eastern Wastes.&quot;<br>
<br>
I arrived in the Eastern Wastes, but trouble reared its fug-ugly head, in the form of a strange telepathic communication from my guildmates, &quot;Yo Fucka,  we gotz sum IE's fuckin' with us in WL, get yo ass over here.&quot;  And I did.  Who would dare challenge the authority of such a powerful telepathic communication?<br>
<br>
Upon arriving in the wild wilderness, I met my leader, lord, and all-around supreme power in the universe, Vega PerIcantspellhissurname.  Lord Vega's faithful cur (Zarn!) was there too, sleeping at his side.<br>
<br>
Apparently two vile fiends bearing the symbol of none other than Infernal Elite (bad people~) were terrorizing the poor, helpless, weak, defenseless, and all-around pitiful Giants of that loveable forest.<br>
<br>
A brief trek across the forest, first one way, and then the other, and then another (until I was thoroughly confused, and lost beyond a shadow of a doubt) revealed no tracks whatsoever, and a good deal of hopelessly identical trees.<br>
<br>
Despite my forlorn, bewildered, frightened, and all-around desperate situation, I persevered (Yay!), willing myself to find the entrance to Kael Drakkel, and seek safety in the iron-tight grip of none other than that in-need-of-counseling Lieutenant Krofer.  Despite his previous anger at my leading his &quot;best&quot; troops to their amu- that is, unfortunate- deaths at the hands of the Sifaye bitches, we endeavored to work together in an attempt to route the Infernal Elite hellions.<br>
<br>
A shout went up!  Sylvan, gimpy, pathetic, all-around Ranger that he was, had found the damnedable entities!  Heading to the site our (this description shortened for the sake of the reading-impaired) Ranger described, I found naught but the traces of a camp.  Synogr and Raplo had move on.  Jackasses.<br>
<br>
The search was looking hopeless, my adrenaline raising with every moment, and each bit of ground looking more and more like the last patch, all bearing one similarity - those fuckin' Evils weren't there.<br>
<br>
Ah, but our cries for blood had not gone unheard!  The great she-bitch Veeshan rose from her immortal slumber, and had answered my call!  The diabolical Evils known as the dreadful Infernal Elite were sending reinforcements numbering in the 1's of 10's of - ok, there were 10.<br>
<br>
Orders went out, people listened, and we amassed at the designated renedvouz point - within the confines of Kael Drakkel, bordering the Eastern Wastes.<br>
<br>
We entered the Wastes, allowing our Druids to fill us with the Spirit of the Wolf.  I found this rather annoying, as everyone knows that Druids are useless, quad-kiting, slow-as-hell, definately-not-as-fast-as-Bards sonsofbitches, but I allowed the disgraceful being known as Sylvan to &quot;buff&quot; (no pervs, not that way~) me all the same.<br>
<br>
We re-entered Kael Drakkel and waited.<br>
<br>
We continued to wait.<br>
<br>
We waited some more.<br>
<br>
And more.<br>
<br>
A- they're here!<br>
<br>
Erpain, one of our less-seasoned Magicians falls.  By the Gods, we will avenge his death!<br>
<br>
Despite the confusion stirred by the battle, I manage to locate the dread mistress Hakubaii, recognizing her slender, enchanting form amongst the mass of hideously blubber-adorned Trolls and Ogres.<br>
<br>
Now, I've got a thing for Dark Elven women, and found it rather difficult to dip my blade into her tantalizing flesh, but what the fuck, if the Ranger could do it, so could I!  Flap, swap, ding, damn, dong, *insert corny 70's batman comic words here*, I slash and hew at her blue-black skin, tossing in a disruptive bellow here and there for comical effect.  She flees to the Eastern Wastes, apparently tiring of the deadly dance.<br>
<br>
I meander about the battle, whacking Kibby here, Gremie there, searching for a target to my liking.  Ah, there he is - Kirlen, a Cleric of approximately the same number of seasons as I.  I've no problem dispatching with him - Dark Elven males only serve as competition for their more attractive counterparts, and I rather enjoy rending their limbs from their torso's.  Kirlen flees to the Eastern Wastes as well.<br>
<br>
After the two Dark Elves have fled, the entirety of our forces turn our attentions to the fat-ass fucks, namely Gremie, Kibby, Nafgar and friends.  They, also, flee from us, though a few of them stick around trying to poke sharp things into our loveable Halfling Ilissill - unfortunately for them, she appears to be a tad too low to the ground, and they seem to trip over their feet as often as make contact.<br>
<br>
The first sequence of the third battle (indeed, I left out the 4 IE that plugged earlier in WL as we searched for the 2 in-zone~) ends.<br>
<br>
We bide our time, healing and regaining our mana.  Erpain returns to his corpse and redresses (eww, don't look~) as I flirt with all females present and play mana-whore to the enthusiastic Bella.<br>
<br>
The battered (but not beaten) Infernal Elite forces re-appear on our side of things, and are again beaten back.  Hakubaii is now the obvious target, and I have a tad more help in keeping her occupied, and we end up forcing her to turn tail and wiggle her butt back into the Eastern Wastes, robe, arms, and legs flailing as she dashes the other way.<br>
<br>
The rest follow suit, heading for the Wastes, away from the painful sting of our dancing blades and *insert other roleplaying crap here*.<br>
<br>
Vega, all-powerful, wise, and-not-in-the-least stupid leader that he is, orders the more melee-prone beings amongst us to give chase.<br>
<br>
So, we do just that.<br>
<br>
On the other side, in the Eastern Wastes, 3 or 4 large-assed, unattractive Trolls and Ogres pin Coraan between them, forcing him to endure such tortures as the, &quot;Arm-Investigation,&quot; &quot;Ass-Attack,&quot; and &quot;Sandwich.&quot;  The last is particularly disgusting.<br>
<br>
Coraan's meager Dwarven limbs fall to the ground, lifeless, as he succumbs to this pungent onslaught.<br>
<br>
I again seek out Hakubaii and re-engage the stinging dance, dipping my blade between her robes, my painful shouts in her ears, and in short forcing her back into Kael Drakkel.  She falls on the other side to our forces there - I do not have the pleasure of finishing her, much to my disappointment.<br>
<br>
Kirlen is beaten to a bloody pulp by several of us - Lethdar, the furious Monk especially - and retreats to Kael Drakkel, looking more like a half-squashed tomato than a blue-skinned menace to society.<br>
<br>
The other forces of the Infernal Elite slowly dwindle across to Kael Drakkel, until none remain in the Eastern Wastes.  Half Gladius Fatalis' forces in the Wastes return to Kael to dispatch the foul fiends, with the other half remaining in the Wastes, guarding the area (along with SoB members, Vidmaster comes to mind, amongst a few others~), should the yellow-bellied cowards return.<br>
<br>
Several of these seem to have been caught in the void between worlds, and disappear entirely, only to reappear later on in the battle (hi Nafgar, say hello to the zone-camping, zone-plugger-awaiting, AE-fearing Bard~).  Most of these survive (fuckin' Dr00dz, you were supposed to Snare Nafgar while I got him away from the zoneline~), though a bug threw Kibby across the zone, and he ended up getting his ass beat by a decidely weak warrior of Neutrality.<br>
<br>
By this point in time the third battle is more or less over, and we begin to hear reports of several more Infernal Elephants reappearing (read:  These are the 4 -6 that zone-plugged earlier sirs~) at the border of Kael Drakkel and the Wakening Lands.<br>
<br>
Several of us head there, proceeding to beat on the skulls of such infamous beings as Piggus the Rogue and Synogr the Shadowknight.  Again, they perform this interesting event I hear tell described as simply, &quot;zone-plugging.&quot;<br>
<br>
The fourth and final battle ends.<br>
<br>
It's time for me to leave the world and pursue less bloody ventures in a world known as, &quot;Real Life,&quot; and I &quot;log off.&quot;<br>
<br>

We also recieved word that a few IE were spotted in Wakening lands, near the SS zoneline.<br>
<br>
So we gather at Kael, and await them. Caught them by suprise when they zoned in, and it was a very fun fight. THey were eventually knocked back across the zoneline. We med up and determined ideal targets (such as their wizard Hakairball). IE zoned back in this time, and was pushed out again. Now the charge went up for many Melee's to zone over to EW to disrupt their medding. I, unfortunately, am a very fast zoner, so I appeared quite alone, and was ganked by all of them (thanks for the attention).<br>
<br>
However my death was not in vain, as the other melees appeared and many IE zoned back to kael. Fights were now on both sides of the zoneline, and the end result was a few IE dead, maybe a few gated (not sure), but all the rest zoneplugged.<br>
<br>
Nafgar- not sure where your corpse will appear, or if you will even have one or still be alive at zoneline. Very curious in fact. Seemed you missed your pluging by a few seconds, and we had you LD fighting in EW. The moment Starbrow got a kill on you (It said you were killed by starbrow), your body/corpse went poof.<br>
<br>
There was also an IE that got bugged in zoning, due to dying while zoning. So He ended up appearing somewhere (safe spot I assume) in EW with 1 hitpoint. Heard a low level newt found him and finished him.<br>
<br>
The IE in wakening Lands were now reported to be at the Kael zoneline, so my group went over there and killed half/other half plugged. There was more fighting on the EW side as well, but mostly from pluggers returning to find us still there waiting.<br>
<br>
We hung around, thinking that IE would come back in greater force, but they did not.<br>
<br>
It was a fun fight, and I look forward to more struggles over Kael. I am sad to say that the majority of the IE folks are no longer KOS to Giants.<br>
<br>
I would like to invite any Neutral that is level 25 or higher to head over to Velious. Evils are greater than us in numbers on this server, and once they grow tired of Kunurk, the struggle will be very hard in Velious. We could use some reinforcements.<br>
<br>
PS- thanks to DB and TDC that had some members show up to join in the fight.<br>
<br>
PPS - there is your story.<br>

Ah well.. Starbrow got a KS on you, if not the points for the kill... it was funky, =p .<br>

To those of you that would prefer I'd sent them a tell.. um... good for you, don't read the post next time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hmmm you post this fight , but the fight with ruin in EW you dont post. hmm wonder why ?&quot;<br>
<br>
You'll notice the bridge battle has already been posted.  In addition, we didn't take part in that battle.<br>

Along with Rakil, I hope to jet on over there with my guild as soon as we get the numbers / lvls.<br>
<br>
P.S. This will be one hell of a fight, and I forsee that it will be an almost dead even affair - as Rakil said before, the only Evils that will make a difference are the ones in Iggles, Hate, IE, Ruin and Malignant. I think we'll see a clash of:<br>

<br>
The only evidence thus far came from the beginning of the server, where Evils nearly doubled the Neutral population.<br>
<br>
If you have *any* proof whatsoever that the Neutral population has faded slower than Evil population, feel free to present it.<br>

But considering that we are now the 4th most populated server rather than in the top 5 every day, I have to think that the teams are a lot more even than most think.<br>
<br>
Take Tallon Zek for example, when it first came out 50% of the server was Darks, because bluebies wanted to take a &quot;vacation&quot; and wanted to be &quot;bad ass PvP'ers&quot;. The numbers calmed down, people left, and now the teams are a lot more even than they used to be. I have to believe that this same phenomenon has hit SZ aswell. <p>-------------------------------------------<BR><img src="http://ac.teabbs.com/public/sig/sigpic3.gif"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#DEB887><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/uagrul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Agrul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(8/15/01 9:45:11 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Battle Of Kael, Neuts vs. IE</span><hr size=1> Who says the Tallon Zek teams are even?<br>
<br>
Darks are still the largest team, the Lights just cross-team, making them seem smaller.<br>
<br>
Our server losing people doesn't mean the teams evened out in any way.<br>
