I take this game very personally.  If I could, I would go to the homes of everyone who has ever caused me exp loss, kick their dogs, piss in their cornflakes, and shit on their lawns.  I think if most of you look objectively at yourself, you'd realize that you take this game very personal as well.  Otherwise why are you so mad about your friend getting deleveled?

Not exactly.  What stopped them was all of us hunting ulthorks drove them off, then guarded Narc's spawn point until a GM came to log him off  They left a bard in zone waiting for us to leave so they could continue to delevel him as soon as we got tired and decided to go to sleep.

We're playing by the same rules as Pino's guild, so he has nothing to complain about.<br>

I know nothing of the situation with Narc.  I doubt he lost 4 post 50 lvls.  <br>

Grumples is a good person, not complete scum like Jotok.  He just uses people like Jotok who exist on both teams inorder to justify extreme griefing.<br>

We're here to play with no rules, however, when something beyond someones control happens that makes him lose DAYS of work, that sucks ass!<br>

We all do, or we wouldn't play this game, we would play something like CS where there is no attachment to your toon, no hours of hard work represented and no long term friends/allies/enemies made.<br>
<br>
Which is what makes actions like these despicable. To derive personal pleasure from taking several days of work from a person and destroying it is a sympton of someone who merely is cruel. This is no different than the high school bully, or the guy at work who abuses someone because he can, or the kid who burns small animals. Causing grief to another human being for the sick personal enjoyment of their suffering isn't the character trait of a decent human being. Because they are doing it in a faceless, inhuman, manner over a video game isn't all that different than constanly beating up the geek at school because he is skinnier and gets better grades than you. Do you fail to see this, or do you just not care?<br>
<br>
As for Narc, what happened was just as wrong. Look, I think Narc even may have deserved it, but I cannot condone that action. For the same reasons as above, I personally enjoy beating Narc's ass (which I have done) in game and winning a competition between us, I do not condone or even understand the mentality to cause permanent loss of hours or days of another players time. <p><font color = ff0000>Velael regards you indifferently - He appears to be a taxi</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub73.ezboard.com/utakish.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Takish</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tavern Regular</span><br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/3/01 3:50:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub73.ezboard.com/fsullonzektavernfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3914.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What you believe makes no difference</span><hr size=1> It's so very odd to me that Grumples (Slamz) is the same guy who used to scream louder then anyone else about the &lt;Prophets&gt; doing stuff on VZ that was not against the server's ruleset (Xteam Healing, etc.).

He has been known to be a griefer/pker in the past, and quite frankly it doesnt matter.  Hes a newt, I bind raped him.  Was fun because I believe our group got 2 DB coins while we were doing it.<br>
<br>
Own up to shit.  You camped Pino because you are an asshole.  I camped Narc because I'm an asshole.  The difference between you and I, Gray, is I'm much better at it than you are.<br>

P.S. FYI Narc ate a total of 10-11 exp deaths that night, and he de-leveled from level 45-44 I believe.  He started even con to jakka and became green.<br>
