<br>
Actually, as an enforcer I can tell you that thats not true. Most enforcers, from those I've talked to and met, and me personally, have the bare minimum for using our best nano programs at the time. I come up against a mob that gangks my skills, that leaves me without the ability to cast usually mighty or brave chall to cyc. If I'm up against a mob older than I am, and not susceptible to energy melee, I'm goin down usually. I don't carry FA kits because I could only afford to keep either FA or Treatment up, and I chose treatment. If my skills are dropped low enough where I can't cast Mongo slam either, which is +331 hps and a 33hp per every tic or two, I'm outta luck since there is no lower version of it.<br>
<br>
So, my two cents, if used right, those deprive skill nanos could drain enforcers at least, of just about all the nano's that actually make it a dmg dealer.<br>

All your nano skills depend on 80% intelligence and 20% spread out over other stats.  Nano Pool is mostly Psychic and a few spread out over others.  You'll need to be raising those constantly to avoid hitting your skill caps for your nano skills or you're basically handicapping yourself.  <br>
<br>
Also, in earlier betas they had info on skill caps based on your breed (not max for level, but max for breed for str/agi/sta/int etc etc).  Dunno if they're still in effect, but when you get to lvl 180 and can't raise your nano skills anymore because your atrox is capped the lowest on Int (what all your nano skills are 80% based on), you won't be casting the end-spells due to breed limitation rather than ip limitation.  That puts you at a huge disadvantage.  <br>
<br>
Also if you really think about what the above post says about Atrox's having the same stats at lvl 100 as other breeds...  of course they will.  People at 100 are only capped by their ip's, not their breeds.  You can have certain similar skills as any other breed out there, but you'll spend a lot more IP's doing it.  And you'll also be giving up other helpful skills in pvp such as defense, maps, swimming/adventuring, first aid etc.  Also, saying he has similar stats means the hp advantage isn't there either.  Sorry but I don't see any sense in that.  You can simulate an Atrox Trader by making a Solitus trader and just NOT spend ip's on other than your necessary skills.  Also, skills aren't on a linear multiplier are they?  Primary stats are the only ones on static multipliers last I remember.  Not even body dev/nano pool are static.  Of course I could be wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
So with an Atrox Trader, you're going to have a slightly easier time raising your hitpoints (1x multiplier compared to 2x for solitus), but you're paying 3x for three other skills.  The extra you're paying just to keep your nano skills going far outweighs the small discount on stamina, IMO.  You're also discarding the STR/AGI benefit from an Atrox since traders don't really need them unless you want to use a wider range of armor.  So in the end you're not really getting a hp advantage, you're just taking on a huge nano disadvantage.<br>
<br>
I quit my Atrox MA because at lvl 42 I had the same hitpoints and offensive skills as a same lvl solitus MA, but was 8 levels behind on nano skills because of the skill cap due to low abilities.  He also had a higher comp lit/first aid which I consider very important.<br>
<br>
Play a few lvls up to lvl 15 or so and see which direction you're heading with your char.  Look at where you're spending your ip's and make your decision from there.  Everyone is still a newbie in this game so don't take message board rep-seekers' stories as gospel.  Personally I think they're handicapping themselves and are justifying themselves.  I'm far from an expert too, so don't take my post to heart either.  If you really wanna make an Atrox, go for it man.  That's the cool part of AO, you have a lot of control over your character development so make whatever you think will be good.  <br>
