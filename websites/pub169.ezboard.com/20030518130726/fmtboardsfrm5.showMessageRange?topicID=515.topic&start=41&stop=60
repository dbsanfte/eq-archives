No, you said the word <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>before</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if you read how I quoted you. But you have already flip flopped for others already so its ok. We understand that you cant maintain a debate and that you are reaching. <br>
<br>
<br>
I said since..meaning after.  Russian, French, and Chinese companies broke the resolutions by continuing to help Iraq after the Gulf War. <br>
<br>
French supplied and help fix mirage jets. <br>
Russians helped with cruise missles, night vision goggles, and gps jamming equipment. <br>
Chinese helped lay their new anti-aircraft network. <br>

Sorry, I'm Canadian. I'm not a pseudo-Canadian from Quebec who wants to *stay* Canadian only as long as the liberal federal government keeps screwing the rest of the country and continues to bribe them to stay in. Want to leave? Be my guest. The rest of the country would be happy to see you leave. Too bad we couldn't stick pontoons on your sorry province and float it across the Atlantic to join France in a virtual orgy of self-gratification.<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned once the English beat you on the Plains of Abraham they should have kicked your butts back to France. /shrug<br>
<br>
And as for the 7 million people in Canada who mostly speak french - yeah, whatever. Try the people in Quebec, sections of the Maritimes, and a few French-Canadian sections spread all over the country. <br>
<br>
And racism? Try speaking out the other side of your face, maybe - isn't it your province that has language police, h'mm? Nice policy.<br>
<br>
Thanks for playing.<br>

<br>
And btw , if *some peoples here want to separate from the rest of the Canada its because they take money from here to put in other province ...And yes we have a naming policy WTF we speak french ! Why we have to speak english if  less than 3% of our population in quebec speak english every day ??When i go to another country i speak the langage they speak or at least i try..Langage policy is not racist 60% of the people here do not understand english ..<br>

 I'm, quite honestly, not in the mood to dig up links, or offer hard core proof. I'm basing this from what I've seen on tv, yes, here in America. Wasn't it Saddam's regime that took a village (town, whatever you call it wherever you live) and unleashed some chemicals on everyone who lived there, just to see what would happen? We are talking people who died, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, newborns, elderly, children.. And those that lived, many were maimed for life. <br>
<br>
So I'm guessing Saddam ordered that cause he was bored one day? He, of course, has no intentions of using that on people outside of his country, right?<br>
<br>
Get real guys. Can't change the fact that the USA declared war on Iraq. Can't change the fact that France said no, that Britian said yes. Can't change any of it, it's done with, it's started. How about supporting your government, no matter what it is, or support the troops that are risking their lives over there. But then again, y'all would rather fight the battle with words from the comfort of your home, safe and sound. Gotcha <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

No offense Calalily, I really like and respect most of your point of views even If I dont agree with them, but WTFH is all of our mod's problems?  Do none of them understand that this has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with eq?  Rants are for EQ rants, you the RANTS MODERATOR should know this.  Move this to Off Topic already GDI  Some people would like to read rants about bishes ninja-lewtin and @#%$ than more @#%$ about this war, every second im bombarded with crap on tv about it and no offence but its getting depressing.  If I want to come and rant about the war or GB or whatever then Ill go to offtopic and rant under one of the 1000000 threads about it already there, but do your bloody job and move this thread like you should have, not post and add to it but move it.  If I felt like it Id add 100000 comments to everyone's post but atm Im sick of the news and hearing about death and the war, I want to bish out some idiotic nwbs not talk about how Saddam is a fvcktard.  So once again plz do yer jobs and keep posts where they should be, or else we should just remove all moderators because they seem to be nonfunctional just like the UN. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=estephe>Estephe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#628CBC>(3/31/03 5:02:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=515.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ranting George Bush</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And France, where do you think they got thier Nukes from?

If you call &quot;racial&quot; insult a response, well, see ya, and good bye, i'm not interested.<br>
to take all in a nutshell:<br>
we (french) really don't care about the french fries story, or other wine embargo (less than 10% or our production).<br>
<br>
we (french) are against an illegal war (preemptive strike against irak, it's an open door to pakistan vs india, or north korean vs usa, and you wan't whine about this, you started first). Oh, and good luck to face the cost of this war. In GWI, nato afforded the money to pay for it, now you're all alone, welcome economic crisis.<br>
<br>
I  (me) hate to read the &quot;run coward&quot; and other bullshit like that some @#%$ post here, thinking they are funny and only show a complete lack of world (and france) history, and hide and trust behind what they see on TV. Just a little information, about the ruppert murdok group (foxnews, the sun....) : <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.mrcranky.com/movies/iraqwarcoverage.html">www.mrcranky.com/movies/i...erage.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> (little advice on the amercian tv news)<br>
<br>
and the most important: <br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.sierratimes.com/03/02/28/arpubmg022803.htm">www.sierratimes.com/03/02...022803.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
to sum it up, the first words : <br>
<br>
On February 14, a Florida Appeals court ruled there is absolutely nothing illegal about lying, concealing or distorting information by a major press organization.<br>
<br>
You have stranges guys, in florida... they got problemes with the elections, and now, they allow foxnews to lie.... hopefully, you can trust in god, that's all you have.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other funny things ? (look, i'm not a few weeks late bud, i have the time to follow this war and the mind to not trust everything i watch/read):<br>

<br>
A wonderfull article, where rummy show how stupid he is: he know where the weapons of mass destruction are !! in a non explored land yet, and out of range of the Us forces. 2 questions : why if he knows that he don't told to the UN inspectors ? USA would have the complete approval of france and other nations.  If there is really weapons here, how stupid is it to tell to saddam you know where they are ? he just have to move them now (well, it's not so stupid, because when US forces raise this point and didn't find anything, he will argue that saddam have moved the weapons).<br>
<br>

where the soldiers are asked to pray for bush. that seems very similar to the muslims fanatics, isn't it ? They try to transform a war agasint terrorism into a holy war, in the heart of the muslim religion, between iran, syrria, saoudi arabia, palestine.... How SMART is it !!1<br>

<br>
<br>
Like we said in France : &quot;enleve tes oeilleres&quot;. To base your tells on only 1 source, a partial source, because totally involved in war, is the best way to go to the wrong way. Yes, soldiers are in irak now, but ask yourself why, and don't be so proud of your &quot;patriotism&quot;. USA are not alone in this little blue thing we call earth, they have to deal with other nations. acting selfish like now is the best way to get a flipflap in the head in few months. Rummy and powel are on the wrong way, as the internationnal reaction showed them (even tony blair don't have a so bright political futur), and rummy starts to feel it:<br>

what's done is done, shut the hell up and enjoy all your fellow French supporters in feeling the injustice of an &quot;illegal&quot; war.<br>

  Frankly, I am sick to death of the what ifs, the quotes, the links, the indignant drivel being spewed here.  It's enough already, France made it's choice not to agree which is their right, we decided to go ahead with what we knew was the right thing to do, end of story.<br>
<br>
Damn, between you &amp; Estephe I am ready to invade France myself and throw a huge can of shut the f*ck up into your country.<br>
<br>
go read a book, take a stroll, drink with some friends and forget all about what we might be doing in Iraq, it no longer concerns you since your country opted not to get involved, do us all a favor and STAY uninvolved<br>

Every country knows how to make a nuclear bomb, its not a big secret. Its easy actually. What they dont have is the materials.  The nuclear reactor the french gave Saddam is the type where the spent rods can be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. Why dont you go learn something about nuclear materials before spouting of about what you do not know.  Maybe even read something about what is going on in North Korea right now, and it might help you understand. <br>
<br>
Its the reasons we wanted North Koreans to have our water nukes instead of the ones they had, which they signed a treaty to get rid of in favor of ours. So they wouldnt have nuclear materials for weapons. <br>
<br>
by the way, just so you know, <br>

Why would a country with a massive oil reserve need nuclear energy? And there are two types of reactors mainly. Those that produce waste product that are radioactive, but non fiss/fuseable, and those whose products can be refined into weapons grade material. Guess which one france helped Iraq build?<br>
