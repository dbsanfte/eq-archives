I had to take my kid (now FOUR YEARS OLD...dear god where does the time go) to get his 4 year vaccinations.  I don't know who was more scared.  Actually I do..it was ME.<br>
<br>
So we're in the waiting room and I'm explaining to him, pulling no punches, that this is going to hurt and hurt bad...but it will only last for a second.  He has to get three shots, so trying to tell him to be a strong little man and it will all be over.<br>
<br>
So his turn is called, we go into the room, I sit him on my lap.  I hold one arm as the technician swabs the others.  I tell Terry to look at me and the tech gives the shot.  My kid screams &quot;OUCH! MEANIE!!!!&quot;  Well that wasn't too bad.  Two more to go, I tell him.  He says &quot;NO MORE!!!&quot; as the technician puts a bandaid on him.<br>
<br>
My kid starts staring at this bandaid as the tech says &quot;Ok, two more in the other arm and we are all done&quot;.<br>
<br>
Terry looks at the tech, looks at the bandaid, then rolls up his other sleeves and sticks out his arm.  Then, with the other hand, extends it and does the &quot;come here&quot; motion with his open/close fist and says (ala Rock) &quot;Just Bring It!&quot;<br>
<br>
We were laughing for 15 minutes, no joke.  Poor guy had to get another tech to give the other two shots because we couldn't stop laughing.<br>
<br>
Two more bandaids, three stickers, and one very strong little man.<br>
<br>
My kid is the coolest kid in town. <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

i was always the kid that needed to be held down for any kind of shot.  they thought holding down my upper body would be fine, until the day i kicked the nurse in the guts. <p><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/eqjassy/images/jassy-southpark.jpg" alt=""><br>

<br>
my son had to go for his 18month checkup and shots. my wife took my daughter along cause she wanted to go. well after the first poke Gideon ( my son) started crying of course. Mckenzie (my duaghter ) didnt like that at all. puffed up her chest and said &quot; you stop that, mom thier hurting my brother&quot;<br>
then the next shot came &quot;your mean, stop hurting the baby, i dont like you&quot;. <br>
<br>
i tell you when i first found out my wife was preganent i literally broke down crying. at work no less. i was a teller at BofA and i fell down behind the counter crying. my wife and i (GF at the time) had just gotten back together three days before and i had put in my notice at BofA the day before ( almost 24 hours exactly from the time i gave notice til she called and said she was preg.). <br>
<br>
i was not ready to be a daddy, hell im still not. however they are the best thing that ive ever been a part of. never thought much about being a daddy, now i dont know how i existed before. its so amazing to see the world through thier eyes. they dont have any of the restraints or social prejudices we have, its just a whole big world for thiem to explore.<br>
<br>
we are truly blessed Drack. kids are an amazing gift.<br>
<br>

I enlisted while we were engaged.  Went to Basic and Tech school.  Came home for Xmas where we planned to have a baby (even though we weren't married yet).  Went back to tech school.<br>
<br>
Now at first I thought the Air Force was my last hope of straightening me out.  After my dad died I just started chugging the booze like a fish.  I stopped eating, quit my civilian job, lost about 40lbs.  I was definately heading down.  Even in tech school I was spending my whole paycheck at the clubs.<br>
<br>
Graduated tech school, got married, got stationed in Montana (YEEEEE HAW).  Still drinking, rarely eating...then BAM.  Terry was born.<br>
<br>
It was funny.  I looked down, nothing but the big light shining.  Look up at my wife then looked down again and there he was (bloody mess).  However the light shining down on him would have made an excellent picture.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, without concentrated effort or thought...I grew up.  Who woulda thunk it???<br>
<br>
Got divorced, got my son and things haven't looked better.  I drink again, but very very rarely and I don't get sick/pukemegutsout drunk like I used to.  (single parent, 4 yr old and hangover = BAAAAAAAD) <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">
