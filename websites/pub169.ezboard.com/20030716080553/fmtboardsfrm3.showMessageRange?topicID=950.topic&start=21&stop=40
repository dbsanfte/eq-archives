Glad to here you booted that trash to curb.<br>
Yea i know i should of never let him try them , i should know better.<br>
But when you been on MT for well over 2 years you just like to think people have more respect than that.<br>
<br>
Stupid me for being a trusting person with humanity.<br>
<br>
Like i said its not the PP im concerned about its the act.<br>
<br>
I woulda be just as pissed had it been a 500 pp item based on fact i let myself get scammed.<br>
<br>
Well Slew hope you enjoy those arms, ill get them back afte ri rip your arms off and beat you with them.<br>

This little bugger asked my 51 druid to pl him to 40 (at the time he was 3 yellows from it). He offered to pay me 500p per yellow. Being a broke druid I took him up on the offer and left my exp group to do this. I leveled him to 40 and he said 'brb afk a min' then went LD about 30 secs later. Well being the nice person I am I waited for 15 min, knowing that LDs happen when you least expect them to. So when he didn't come back I went ahead and logged. <br>
I kept an eye out for him and one day about a week later he pops up in my guild (Yup I am an OTWH member) and I thought well I'll be he is still around. I sent a tell to one of my officers to let them know that I have a BIG problem with this guy and explained why.  So after a few minutes the officer said I should get a tell from him and I did. He offered me 30p. I reminded him of the agreement and he said he would pay. So I was happy to think of being 1500p richer. I asked where to meet him and he said the bank and then went LD again.<br>
I finally got him to the bank a day or so later, after much and I mean MUCH prompting I managed to get all owed execpt 494p. Which I have been checking daily for his arse to show back up. <br>
Never the less he has not been on when I have. I will hound him for the rest, so if you see him send him a tell reminding him that he still owes me 494p. <br>
<br>
Safe and happy hunting to all. I am sorry to hear of your plight, believe me I feel for you. <br>

Someone else to watch out for: Wolffist. Had the incident occured only once, I wouldn't post this. A while back, Lukata (I believe?) from Wandering Warlords sends me a tell that one of our guild members stole a 6k weapon from him and went LD. Our member is named &quot;Wolffist&quot;, a monk. Lukata is, I believe, a monk. The weapon was, ironically, for a monk.<br>
<br>
Wolf was questioned, and he claims a friend of his logged on to his acct and did this horrible act. He wouldn't tell us who his friend was tho... in asking around we found a mutual friend who ratted out &quot;Slew&quot; as this &quot;friend&quot;. It was the exact same M.O. tho, that's why I am posting. Wanted to see the gfx, so Lukata traded the weapon thinking he could trust his then guild member, Wolffist. Wolf was then kicked from WW, and ended up in Theater of Dreams, where he was until I read this thread. <br>
<br>
I now believe they are the same guy, same account or owner. Way too many similarities, and who knows how many victims that have not come forward yet? It's a shame that so many people have to steal and rip people off rather than just play fair. If that's how they act here, how do they act IRL? Scarey.<br>
