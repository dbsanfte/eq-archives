Yes I stand by what I said, TW has helped more players get flagged for higher tiers then I have seen from any other guild.<br>
They also help alot of people you dont see or hear about until we get really pissed off and go off on a board like this.<br>
I was leader of Friends of Fate for a year and since its a low end guild I thought for sure I would never get my epic, but I tried anyway, I met a lot of TW members even a year ago that were kind and helped me, not because they had to but because they are just kind.<br>
Of course players that are jealous are going to try to smear their rep any chance they get, but its really their own misfortune.<br>
TW is just like any other guild with the exception they are able to pretty much go to any zone they want and tackle any mob they chose to aim for, should prove they know how to work together, not they are out to destroy others.<br>

Of course, Hitler was a evil nasty Nazi, but the other guys who joined up later only wore black and silver uniforms with swastikas, but I'm sure many were actually nice people...<br>
<br>
The point is not that TW are Nazis (trolls take note).  For the thinking impaired, I am not saying that TW are Nazis.<br>
<br>
The point is that when you sign up for an organization, you sign on to their reputation.  Nobody has room to say &quot;well, my club has a bad rep, but I'm not like that&quot; because you ARE like that by virtue of being a member.<br>
<br>
If you don't like being called a Nazi, don't shave your head and wear swastikas.<br>
<br>
If you don't like being lumped in with TW's bad reputation, then drop the guild tag.  If, on the other hand, TW offers you what you seek in the game, then accept the fact that you're a dyed-in-the-wool Tardwalker with a bad rep.<br>

<br>
So is reviction responsible for Kohos' actions while kohos was in reviction?  I know he did some @#%$ up @#%$,  I was there,  in reviction.  Also lytic wasn't squeaky clean either,  he would train people also.  He just was smarter and would only brag about it in tells,  or say things like oops im really sorry.  He was a lawyer and all.<br>
<br>
Well,  this monks actions don't surprise me since Kohos was in reviction all that time ago,  and if you know what kohos did and was capable of,  you know all the rest of reviction would do the same<br>

Actually, it's about posting a thread about someone INTENTIONALLY griefing you when there's evidence that a) it might not have been griefing (i.e., you backed into the train) and b) it might not have been intentional (Tanego tells you, 'If I had known it was yours I would not have' and that he didn't see you, etc.).<br>
<br>
Raum explained how with all that was going on it would be easy to get the wrong impression unless you had a bird's eye view.  Apparently you aren't having any of that.<br>
<br>
As for the GM moving the shard, who knows why the GM's decided to intervene?  We know that the shard was moved, but we DON'T know that Tanego got a warning or mark for it (which he'd have gotten if he'd done something intentionally wrong).  They might have decided that since Tanego himself said that he realized after the fact that it was &quot;your&quot; shard, and was sorry for having looted it, but that he didn't do it on purpose, then there was no harm in moving it.  Maybe the GMs spoke to him also, and he told them the same thing, and didn't object to them giving the shard to you because he felt bad about it.<br>
<br>
Or maybe they just agreed that he was a &quot;Lazy KSing Reviction Monk!&quot;   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tulinx>tulinx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/8/03 1:47:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=786.topic&index=50>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Tanego Lazy KSing Reviction Monk!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>IM the one to blame for everything that goes on in the world past and present!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Of course, they would usually leave the loot from said mob, so you got that..just not the xp. Sigh, you can remake a character now and watch it happen over and over. You are fighting your giant bat and along comes dwardpally01 to come save the day. That is most irritating<br>
<br>
So lets go back to the case in point. Lonely wizard was kiting evil seer. Reviction male monk decides to &quot;save&quot; lonley wizard. Lonely wizard runs and crowd controls train while reviction monk takes shard away from female wizard well because shes female, and emp is not a woman's work! That is the male mentality in this game. All of us women need to stand together and overthrow this thinking!!! DEATH TO ALL MEN!

Hahhha oh geesh they are board and have nothing better to do? TANEGO KSed that is why they intervened! /bonk<br>
 &quot;Rau&quot; Has changed his story several times.<br>
 &quot;Tanego&quot; did not only train but KSed the mob said was not camping but kiting at the time he ksed, he was the only one there that killed it.<br>
 &quot;GM did move the shard, and gave me an appology for Tanego's behavior, &quot;it was intolerable&quot;.<br>

guilds are going to defend their guildies , right or wrong. It just gonna happen. No reason to come to the boards and flame, because 5 ppl will find fault with yuour guild. You brought said guild up by naming said guild. Had you left it between you and him, and not said reviction monk, it might have gone better, i dunno<br>
<br>
also mistakes happen, and seeing how your shard hunting for a very rare spawn...ppl will try to exploit you or you them. If it wasnt him it would have been someone else.

 I have never had anyone train me by going FD infront of me and dropping mobs on me intentionally.<br>
<br>
 It would really piss me off.<br>
<br>
 It was bad enough when Tempoff and I were KS'd by Sehsz over the shard. I was sitting back, letter her melee it... if I would have known he was going to KS us I would have unleashed the cleric n00k p0waH! But he just stood WAY back, it was really lame... didnt even see it coming.<br>
<br>
 Speaking of which, anyone know Sehsz? The heartless manner in which he KS'd us made it very obvious to me that he was very anti-social. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zairavhalkerie>ZairaVhalkerie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/8/03 8:41:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=786.topic&index=58>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Spam</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Had you left it between you and him, and not said reviction monk, it might have gone better, i dunno<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Maybe, but this seems to be a trend lately, I have been hearing every day and witnessed it personally other then Tanego ksing, they have not respected any camps our guild has been doing or calling. <br>
Will take it up with officers for suggestions but this has now become a really crappy way to play EQ.<br>
Want respect from us earn it! Dont just call camp check and then say F* them we are camping there anyway, its getting ridiculous, I am not going to arm wrestle over a camp I am already at.<br>
If you want to share it and its big enough I will share, but I will not be KSed or pushed out of a camp I am at first, nor will any other member of my guild.<br>
If they are doing it to &quot;get back&quot; at TW because &quot;they sat there and waited for us to wipe in VT&quot; as one reviction member said, then they are also very sad little people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raumalan>Raumalan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/8/03 8:52:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=786.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Spam</span><hr size=1> Geez, i thought you all were supposed to be dropping this.
