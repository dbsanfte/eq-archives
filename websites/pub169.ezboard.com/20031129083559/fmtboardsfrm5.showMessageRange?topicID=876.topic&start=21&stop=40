This has to be the most articulate and erudite thread I've ever seen on these boards. <br>
<br>
2.  How did this end up in rants?  <br>
<br>
3.  Excellent points raised here with a well structured history lesson to boot.  <br>
<br>
I thoroughly believe that Israel has a right, like any other nation, to exercise measures in self-defense but where is that line drawn these days?  Syria has had a long history of being the Arab power-broker in the Mid-East, with inferred ties to Hamas and Jihad and most assurely hosting other unsavory elements of the radical Islam movement.  However, crossing sovereign boundaries of a neighboring nation puts Israel in a much more precarious position in world opinion.  Irrelevant as the U.N. has rendered itself in many instances, even the appearance of a belated unified front can have dire consequences to an Israeli economy already approaching shambles.  Loan guarantees and financial aid sources for Israel are crucial.  <br>
<br>
And yet, how does Israel counter the horrific threat of violence visited on its population?  If the Syrians are willing to harbor these radical elements, are they not implicitly involved?  If Mexico had Al Qaeda camps operating in Chihuahua or Sonora, I'd imagine that they'd be smoking ruins without so much as a courtesy call from Dubya to Vicente.  Being a former resident of the Southwest, in this hypothetical, I'd be thankful and none too worried about the niceties of diplomatic protocol.  <br>
<br>
And the real tragedy is that each camp is entrenched by their own zealots.  Islamic terrorists would rather hurl their children into a bomber's vest than see the peace process move forward.  The political machine the Palestinians are stuck with robs them of resources as well; corruption is rampant in the PA.  <br>
<br>
The Israeli hard-liners are just as entrenched as their radical Islamic counterparts.  Illegal settlements corrode the Israeli government's credibility and any coalition in the Knesset will undoubtedly be held to account by ultra-orthodox factions who cite the Palestinians as nothing more than animals.  Yitzak Rabin, the last best hope for an enduring peace in the Middle East, was assassinated by a Jew.  I couldn't help but make a parallel observation to the day Anwar Sadat was murdered - not by the Mossad, but by fellow Muslims who could not stand that he sponsored a peace deal with Israel.  <br>
<br>
It's a sticky mess there, that one.  While I'd like to think otherwise, I believe that the Mid-East will see worse times ahead before anything gets better.  Sad.  <br>

Both sides have played tit-for-tat games, and I agree it doens't facilitate a solution. I would point out that the Israeli mainstream has NEVER ever pressed for outright extermination of Arabs in Israel, as many &quot;mainstream&quot; Palestineans have.<br>

Here here! I agree totally. I think the victims are the inhabatants of the fomer Palestine, Jews and Arabs alike! I think the villins in the are the Arab nations in fact I would say the Syrians and Egyptians (and Arab League) were most responsible.<br>

Well I object to the &quot;cant we all get along&quot; folks. I think mistakes should be understood, and since history is written by the victors, understood in that context. I can see where the Arabs were wronged and whre the Israeli's could have done better, however, intervention from other nations perpetuates the terror in the region. If there were no arms from Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia, there would be no Intifatah. <p><table align="center" cols="3" rows="2" width="80%" ><!border= "2" bordercolor="black" >

<br>
mm... I think you misunderstand.  I'm not saying if we all stopped playing the blame game, held hands for a while and sang songs together all the problems would go away.  The two sides hate each other WAY too much for that.  It's going to take generations before the two people can truly live at peace.  <br>
<br>
What I am saying is that people who blindly support one side or another while trying to lay the blame on the other side are contributing to the problem and not helping.  The facts do not support finding a guilty party.  For every single fact you post up about the Palestinians, I can post one about the Israelis.  for every single atrocity commited by the Israelis, I can point to one done by the Palestinians.  For every single bad political choice made by the Palestinians, I can point to one made by Israel.  You say the weapons from Saudi and Iran help the Intifadah but what about American weapons to Israel?  Without those, there would be no intifadah either.<br>
<br>
I don't believe it is possible to find the guilty party here.  I don't believe it's possible to find one side who is more guilty over the other.  I believe trying to lay blame is pointless.  It doesn't help the end solution.<br>
<br>
Lets assume the best, through massive research and some sort of time machine, you were able to find the person who commited the first act of violance.  Ignoring for a moment the impossibility of this event and all the external forces you would have to take into account (British occupation, Ottoman Occupation, Crusades, the Cold War, Oil Politics, WW2 and every single other event that muddied the waters and made finding blame impossible), lets assume you did find the guilty party.  So what?  What does it mean?  Do you think the guilty side will just go &quot;well damn, I guess it was our fault after all!  Sorry guys, we'll stop now&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Fact is, the Palestinians want a country.  Regardless of your view on this issue, they DO deserve better than they currently have.  Palestinians children are growing up in conditions that I wouldn't kennel my dog in while supposedly under the government of a 1st world country.  They did nothing to deserve this yet they're being oppressed.<br>
<br>
Fact is, the Israelis deserve security.  Regardless of your view of history, it's their country and they deserve a chance to live in peace without their neighbors trying to kill them.  Israeli kids grow up with bomb drills and gas masks.  They grow up missing their parents one months out of the year and they grow up knowing that at age 18 they will have to risk their lives so their country can survive.  They did nothing to deserve this yet they are at risk.<br>
<br>
How will assigning blame help either one of these issues?  Assuming you can find a clear guilty party, which I believe is impossible, what possible different will it mean to the people currently involved in the conflict?  The people who are dying had very little to do with the original issue.  Why should they care who started it?<br>
<br>
Every person who blindly supports one side or the other while trying to find who to blame is contributing to the problem, not the solution.  When you say &quot;well, the Israelis have the moral upper hand&quot; you're also saying the Palestinians need to stop their struggle.  Well, guess what, even if it was the Palestinians who started this 50 years ago, it means nothing to the people currently fighting.  They're fighting for their kids, their lives and their futures which means the past doesn't mean much.<br>
<br>
Everytime someone tries to place blame, you're lengthening the conflict because it gives the high ground to one side or the other.  Well, people who have the high ground rarely compromise.  They insist that the other side is wrong and should surrender or stop or give up.  This conflict is not going to be solved by one side or the other giving up, it's going to be solved through a compromise.<br>
<br>
Anyway, sorry for rambling.  Just my view on the issue I guess.  At this point, I don't care who's to blame, I just want to stop having to phone home and wait to see if I get an answer or not everytime I see a bombing on the news.<br>
<br>
If I could suggest something, you seem like an intelligent and active person.  Stop trying to convince people who's to blame here and start trying to convince them to pressure their congressmen and senators to force a solution.  Believe me, the majority of Israelis will appreciate that MUCH more. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

I can agree with that, with the current leadership of the Palestineans gone, this may be possible. I really feel that the Israeli's would pursue peace with great vigor if Arafat was gone.

I wonder how you feel about yourself knowing that every lie and distorted truth you spout off leads to more suffering for your beloved palestinians, who I bet you know nothing about.  Do you even know how much ignorance of the actual conflict your statement betrays?  Do you realize how well it shows that you've never even bothered to educate yourself about this conflict you claim to be involved in?<br>
<br>
You know nothing about the issue except some misguided propaganda that was fed to you through your filtered US eyes.  You've never seen war, you've never seen the consequences, you know nothing about the truth but you like spouting off crap that will make you seem rebelious to your friends and oh so counter culture girlfriend.  Political opinions are basically your version of body piercings, you have them to shock but you know absolutely nothing about their actual meanings and backgrounds.<br>
<br>
you know something, I thought about ranting here and calling you names, but I have a different idea.  Lets see how much you really know about the issue.  Lets show the audiance what you really are.  Here's a pop quiz for you.  Any one who claims to know so much about the middle east and the Arab / Israeli conflict should know this information right away since it's closely related to the causes and development of the conflict.  I expect the answers pretty darn fast here, it's a closed book test after all.<br>
<br>
1.  What do you know about the conflicts between Palestinians and Jordanians / Syrians?<br>
2.  What do you know about pre Israel Jewish settlements in Palestine?<br>
3.  What do you know about the religeous beliefs of the Zionists?<br>
4.  What do you know about the Partition called for in the original UN resolution and why it failed to materialize?<br>
5.  Compare the conditions of the Wall under Jordanian rule to the Dome of the Rock under Israeli rule.<br>
6.  Explain the religeous background behind martyrdom in Islam.  <br>
7.  List specifics about how the British favored Jews over Arabs.  Please include some information about the final disposition of weapons and arms that the British left in country.<br>
8.  Explain how the Muslims have a claim to the land.  Describe why this claim supercedes Jewish claims to the area proven by the existance of the Temple and other Jewish settlements.  Set out some specific rules that grant a people ownership of a land.<br>
9.  Describe in detail the difference between Palestinian terrorists and Al Qaida and why you support one but not the other.<br>
10.  Describe in detail the difference between Palestinians and Native Americans and explain why you have not decided to leave the US and campaign to return all land to the Natives.<br>
11.  Explain the differences between Palestinians, Druze and Bedouin.  Then detail why the Palestinians hate Israel while the Druze and Bedouin are full citizens of Israel and serve in its army.<br>
12.  Explain the difference between Palestinians and Israeli arabs and detail why Israeli Arabs did not lose their land in 1948.<br>
<br>
Finally, explain in detail the claim the Palestinians have on the land.  Please detail why the British did not have the authority to dispose of the land in whatever method they saw fit.  If you justify your arguments by stating that the British Mandate was based on conquest and the holding of property by force, please explain how the Muslim claim is different since the area known as Palestine was conquered by the Muslims after the Crusades and was then conquered once more by the Ottoman Turks.<br>
<br>
Just curious to see how much actual information and research you have about the issue and how much is stupid rhetoric designed to impress your friends at coffee house get togethers. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

<br>
I dont care.<br>
<br>
While you make a calm, intelligent, fence sitting case for yourself, Im not impressed. I could do the same for my causes... but yours? I dont know enough, or care enough. I know enough to have an opinion, and thats what Ive got.<br>
<br>
While you might have an opinion regarding Appalachian class strife, or Cherokee treatment before and after the Trail of Tears, Im willing to bet my bottom dollar that you dont know as much about any of it as I do. Why not? You arnt Appalachian. You arnt Cherokee. I AM.<br>
<br>
Youre an Israeli Jew. You know a shi<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->tload more about the whole thing than I do. Im in the back seat here... Im just the average American. I know what I see, through my US media eyes. I have a simplistic, stupid opinion that happens to mesh with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every single fu<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->cking Arab or Arab-American's</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Ive ever met in Ohio or Washington. You live in the Holy Land, I live in the land of the Whopper. You went to school in Israel <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the United States, while Ive been in Columbus, OH public and OSU and OW. My knowledge of the facts and figures of the whole thing is tiny, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>tiny</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> compaired to yours.<br>
<br>
But it all comes back to: I couldnt give less of a fu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->ck. I care about the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict, but I care more about other things. I have other worries, concerns I find more important than a bunch of bickering about a sun dried stretch of dirt in a place I wouldnt visit on a dare. So here it is, Rustem the Terrorist Supporter, giving up his true opinion on the matter: Who gives a fu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->ck about Jews or Arabs? I dont, beyond my little opinion. Im entitled to it, and Id like to see you take it away from me. Sure, I spout this sh<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->it, and Im labeled an anti-Semite. But who isnt... so maybe you are able to take it away from me. It matters, of course. Its really the epicenter of international politics... but it doesnt affect me one way or another.<br>
<br>
Your piece of sh<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->it country has drained more from mine than I care to imagine. Your worthless, fanatic public and government has crushed a people under their collective heel. Your bullshit bitching and crying about 'now that weve made our bed, help us sleep in it' makes me sick. If the whole fu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->cking place blew up tomorrow, at least I wouldnt feel guilty that my tax money is going to help keep up a regime that came up with Ansar 3. Fu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->ck you, and fu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->ck a country that ignored UNRs 232 and 338. I dont care enough.<br>
<br>
My beloved Palestinians are pretty low on my list, Sun. I just come here to piss you off, cause Im so counter culture. Im such a  fanatic, that I post about it on a message board. My hipster friends and girlfriend are so fu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->cking impressed by it, theyve been of the same opinion since before I met them. You stupid cu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->nt. The US isnt all Republicans like Srie or Virest. There are plenty of people here who arnt particularly sympathetic towards Judaism or Islam. They just know what they know, and have formed an opinion.<br>
<br>
So, if you want me to, I could go around on the net and come up with your pop quiz answers. But since that would be doing what youre asking me, a waste of my time, and a pointless exercise in bullsh<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->it, I wont. I dont know the answers. Enlighten me. <br>
<br>
And remember, before you accuse me of whatever: my opinion has changed. Violence wont change anything. But a lack of US support sure as fu<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->ck will.<br>

<br>
Yes and no.  Maybe someone (like me for instance) will have an opinion on these matters.  However, since I am not currently spun up on the topic, I tend to (believe it or not folks) keep my mouth shut.  If I am going to publically state an opinion on matters like this, it is better to have some knowledge and readings under yer belt (in lieu of experience).  Now while Sunmina and I are not ranting each other into the ground, I am actually learning some interesting things about the subject from her - a different perspective then what I get from slanted media/texts.  While it might not give much in the way of a different message, she does present it with more color then the black and white that our media portrays.<br>
<br>
Ex:  I had no idea that Hammas actually provided social support to the Palastinians.  When I saw that here, I did some research and what do ya know - they do, and probably moreso then the PLO.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tis better to be perceived a fool and remain silent then to speak and remove all doubt.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are, indeed, entitled to your opinion.  However, challenge yourself for yourself (not for me, not for Sunmina, or anyone else on this board) and read up on the whole topic first.  Because of you, during my free time today, I won't be trolling here as much, I will be looking up the Trail of Tears.  I might be asking you some questions soon. <p>Yer either on the right side of the fence, or the wrong side of my shotgun.<br>

<br>
    I think it's an interpretation of jihad, but I know very little about Islam.   What I do know (which is probably wrong) is that jihad is supposed to be an internal struggle of good versus evil, but has been interpreted also to mean external holy wars, which guarantees the martyr a place in Paradise. <br>

<br>
    According to which system of law?  I doubt either the Israelis or the Palestinians use Common Law which is an outgrowth of the practices of the English mixed in with some Roman Elements.

    Well for one thing, the Native Americans had not advanced beyond a stone age culture when the Europeans arrived, largely due to the lack of a decent pack animal.

She generally knows what shes talking about, and doesnt really take a side, asides from the idea that Israel has a right to exist. Anyone who was interested in the subject would do well to read what she has written. Note that Im not be sarcastic, regarding the above.<br>

Your knowledge regarding my Appa/ Cher issues isnt the question. The idea behind my statement is, chances are I know a hell of a lot more about those two things than Sun does, and she obviously knows more about the Iraeli/ Pales, as shes from the area and grew up seeing it first hand.<br>

She can have any old opinion she wants regarding Appalachian prejudice, Cherokee treatment, etc. Shes quite entitled to it, no matter how little she knows about the subject.<br>

<br>
Yet you urge people to action in a matter that's literally life and death.  Let me summerize your attitude then.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I know nothing about the subject, I refuse to listen to people who do but I will do my best to urge that some action be taken even if it will cost lives with the full knowledge of the fact that I know nothing about the issue.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Close enough?  You do understand that your actions have consequences yes?  You do realize that what you say can and does have an impact, correct?  So when I say you're harming the Palestinians you claim to love, I'm being serious.  Then again, I forget, you don't care.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I dont need another god damned history lesson of the god damned  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Two things.  If you expect to be taken seriously, then yes you do.  Second, usring action and spouting off without a solid knowledge of the issue causes problems.  If US citizens bothered to educate themselves more on the issue and based their votes accordingly, the problem would be solved.  Unfortunately, most are like you, happy in their ignorance yet insistent that their opinion should matter.<br>
<br>
I'll say it again, YOU are part of the problem.  YOU and people like you are the reason Palestinians are dying.  But again, you don't care...<br>
<br>
Think a moment, the only thing you accomplished with your post was to make people discount your opinion.  The ONLY thing you accomplish with these uneducated and unresearched opinions is to make people disbelieve your side even more.  When someone comes here and reads this thread do you think they'll develop some sort of sympathy for your cause from your posts?  No, they'll see an extremist, a fanatic or just a spoiled ignorant kid.  Think about that one for a second and what it does to your causes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> An exhaustive knowledge of a matter IS NOT CRITICAL OR MANDATORY to form an opinion on the matter. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Are you serious?  You think a cursory examination of the facts is enough to form an opinion and urge for action in a matter as complex and important as this?  You think it's not required to research an issue that affects the lives of millions?  Not sure how to respond to that I guess except by ignoring you I suppose.  You're simply not worth talking to.  I don't need to argue against you, you're doing a fine job of it already. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

There is a fine line between an opinion and ignorance, very fine. &quot;Most&quot; people that give opinions actually know what they are talking about and even if they do, they might get shot down upon it but it is still an opinion. For example, look at Rush Limba saying the media really likes that quarterback because he is black. If you knew enough about Rush (for better or for worse) you know that he knows what he is talking about. You might not agree with his opinion but then again, he didnt just make it up either (and i dont agree with his opinion on that matter too). In the immortal words of my favorite philosopher -<br>
&quot;We should not then think so much of what the majority will say about us, but what he will say who understands justice and injustice, the one, that is, and the truth itself. So that, in the first place, you were wrong to believe that we should care for the opinion of the many about what is just, beautiful, good and their opposites.&quot; - Socrates<br>
<br>
As for the problem in the middle east: I have to agree on all the points here. I try not to just watch &quot;US Media&quot; since it is actually rather biased. I do want Englsih spoken Media that does not try to persuade but rather inform (CNN is a rather nice one, LA/NY Times are good newspapers that are also rather unbaised).<br>
<br>
I really think Arafat is the problem but then again, Sharon is not making anything better. I dont think removing Arafat and Sharon will solve anything because the hate is so deep within the people themselves. The next PM of Israel might be more liberal and want to end the war but when you and your citizens are being bombed and public outrage goes through the roof, you can only last so long before action is nessecary.<br>
<br>
As for Israels trying to get only the &quot;bad guys&quot; and killing innocents, it is a hard call. While they do kill bystanders, I really think the Palestineans are doing a bit worse by killing a bit more innocents and bystanders. Of course, if the killing could just stop which it probably wont, the people living in the middle east can jsut move on. In addition, I think the Palestineans are feeling a bit more pressure because of NATO and the US being more influencial (much more so after Iraq) in the area. Have you ever seen a cornered wolf that has nothing to lose? I dont think the Palestineans are going to die off or go anywhere else soon but they are fighting very hard for their cause. From the viewpoint of Arafat, this is their land. It does not matter who conquers who (but I think the majority of the world does), if your father tilled the land, and his father before that, and his father before that, it is your land. Esp with the history of the middle east, it does seem a cause to die for. <p>Do or Die, Time to Fly~</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dhameon>Dhameon</A> at: 10/11/03 4:09 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=876.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=876.topic&start=41&stop=49>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=876.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=876.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=876.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.tdtccomputers.com/morellthulebbs/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=876.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=876.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=876.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=876.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm48">Announcements & Suggestion<option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm43">Retirement Center<option value="mtboardsfrm49">The Legendary Threads<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#AAAAAA>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#AAAAAA> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5>Off Topic</a> <font color=#AAAAAA> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#AAAAAA> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
