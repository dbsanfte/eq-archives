Cheney : &quot;Stated simply, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies and against us.&quot; <br>
<br>
Ari Fleischer : &quot;You've heard the president say repeatedly that he has chemical and biological weapons.&quot; <br>
<br>
Fleischer : &quot;We know for a fact that there are weapons there.&quot; <br>
<br>
Rumsfeld : &quot;There's no doubt in my mind that they currently have chemical and biological weapons.&quot; <br>

Bush : &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">We have sources that tell us that Saddam recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.&quot; <br>

Cheney : &quot;We believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Bush :  &quot;Intelligence ... leaves no doubt that the Iraqi regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised.&quot; <br>
<br>
Powel : &quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>While we were here in this council chamber debating Resolution 1441 last fall, we know from sources that a missile brigade outside Baghdad was dispersing rocket launchers and warheads containing biological warfare agent, distributing them to various locations in western Iraq</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.&quot;<br>

<br>
Powel : &quot;Hussein had failed to account for materials sufficient to produce more than 25,000 liters of anthrax, 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin, 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent, 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agents and several mobile biological weapons labs &quot;<br>

You started this thread to stir up more flames because Mommy doesn't hug you enough, and it's full of the same propagandizing half-truth trash that you've spouted for the past year.  Don't get all pi$$y and upset now because I revealed you to be the self-important crybaby that you are.  <br>
<br>
You used the death of an innocent journalist to fuel the flames of your anti-American agenda, and I called you out for it.  You made a callous, ridiculously bourgeious comment about how it doesn't matter that &quot;old and fragile&quot; people die because of bureaucratic ineptitude, and I called you out for it.  You belabored the obvious by saying that American soldiers are nervous in Iraq, and I called you out for it.  <br>
<br>
Hop in a tank, knowing that around every corner someone could be waiting to ambush you, and tell me that you can see someone over 100 yards away clearly from an exposed MG position.  Spend a few weeks in a free-fire zone, then come talk to me, you keyboard mashing coward.  Mazen Dana knew the risks, and he was 100 times the man than you'll ever be for them.  Your words are hollow, and your actions nonexistent; the only place that your opinions matter is in your own mind.   <br>
<br>
Let's reiterate:  YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A COMBAT ZONE.  You have ZERO idea what you're blathering about, and you're selfishly trying to subjugate a man's senseless death IN A COMBAT ZONE to further your anti-American agenda.  You live in a country that's responsible for many of the worst atrocities in the name of Imperialism in the past thousand years, yet is unable to maintain a civil response system to deal with even non-severe weather, and you spend the bulk of your time researching new and exciting ways to criticize American foreign policy.  Nice f*cking priorities, jacka$$.  Oh, and regarding our involvement in Africa, do your homework--unless you think French troops attacking Liberians while disguised as Ivorian army regulars constitutes &quot;objective and unbiased aid.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I don't need to resort to racist jokes for you--you're an ignorant twit, and continue to reveal yourself as one with every rumor-mongering, hate-filled quasi-LePen post.  That kind of silliness crosses all ethnic and gender boundaries. <br>

<br>
For sure Ayerish life seems so exiting.<br>
He was reporter during 1st war gulf, then he got 2 or 3 master didn't remember. And also he specks fluent French, Arabic and Hebrew. (Mythomaniac?) <br>
<br>
He is really well informed and he knows what he talks about:<br>
<br>
Ayerish march 2003 :<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Check this thread in a week, after we've found evidence of WMD.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ayerish end march 2003 :<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now that there IS concrete proof that Saddam has banned weapons.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
He is so WELL informed and don't forget he is &quot;far more cultured than other American&quot;.<br>
<br>
May be a &quot;so well educated&quot; man could answer those few questions:<br>
<br>
Do you still believe Iraq was a direct threat to USA ?<br>
Do you still believe Iraq was working on nuclear weapon ?<br>
Do you still believe Iraq was trying to buy some uranium to Nigeria?<br>
Do you still believe Iraq was able to lunch a Chemical / Biological attack in less than 45 minute?<br>
Do you still believe Chem/Bio weapon was given to Iraq soldier and they were about to use them?<br>
Do you still believe Iraq is linked with 9/11 terrorism attack?<br>
Do you still believe now there is lower risk for terrorism attack?<br>
<br>
But I doubt he can...<br>

Throwing to many questions / evidences to their face at the same time will lead you nowhere. They are not ready yet, and so they start insults and criticizes on subjects which have nothing to do with Iraq. You should have let them debate about the lie thing.<br>
Some of them have just realized their president lied to them. Their brains have not connected that to the fact that hundreds of their soldiers died and will still die for nothing in Iraq and that Iraq will probably turn into an integrist country very hostile to USA in the next few years.<br>
