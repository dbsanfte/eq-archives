ok ill ask again, what should the ISRAELI government do about the wholesale slaughter of thier citizens. dont preach to me about american $$$, im asking, instead of dozing homes and conducting midnight raids on &quot;settlers&quot; homes, what should the ISRAELI govt do about it?<br>
<br>
i got a question for any of you historians out there. why was Israel chosen for the homeland of the Jewish peoples after WWII? ive never understood why the UN [well i dont think it was actually the UN then (was it?) but mostly the same players] took land from the middle east, 1000s of miles from where thier suffering took place. i mean really could a worse spot have been chosen? why not a huge chunk of GERMAN soil? after all its the Germans who were persecuting them, so why did it cost the middle east? <p>DESEPCHUN<br>

<br>
give palestinians land back, perhaps even negotiate with neighboring nations to help buy/acquire some slivers of thier land for the Palestenian state. given that they all wave the plight of the palestenians to show how evil Isreal is, theyd be hard pressed to justify not being willing to help. the USA could even help acquire the land weve got ALOT of stuff we could trade for it. <br>
<br>
take all the so called HOLY LANDS (churches and such not the whole land of Isreal, specific sites) and make them places similar to our wash DC. apart from the rest of the nation, not a state but like a protected refuge. put UN security forces in charge of thier protection, formed of a coalition of Palestinians and Israleis dedicated to protecting and preserving those lands despite ideological differances. those lands must be open to all religions that hold them dear or youll never see an end to this sort of thing.<br>
<br>
realistic? probably not, but it sure would be nice to see. thats the kind of thing im asking you for Rustem, an alternative to how thier doing things now. a better solution. insted of just more anger about how thier dealing with it now.<br>

That is one month after WWII ended, but the allied forces being UK,USSR,USA,France. Had special priority over these lands. Being German war time occupied territory, British territory and Soviet Territory. Of the major countries that were divided, added and turned into free states. Cept for the iron curtain till the fall of communism in Russia.<br>
<br>
Palestine, New Jordan and Iraq were the states in that area at the time. Northern Palestine was homeland to a large jewish community with-out much aggravation from passed fights in ottoman empire(turkey now)/russian and syrian territory in the past(0-1850). So the best bet would be to migrate some of the jewish european population to Northern palestine in those already large jewish communities and rebuild Israel of the past(which was in Palestinian territory long before due to conquests and barbarians)<br>
<br>
So European owned land from Palestine and Turkey formed what is known today with the help of large jewish community the state of Israel &quot;Minor Holy Land&quot; and 75% of Palestine was set for Arabic Palestinians to the south. Lebanon was set-up.<br>
<br>
This upset lots of Palestinians and formed much of what we know today. I think couple of years ago Israel was gaining more and more land from Palestinian land or &quot;More Holy Land&quot;<br>
due to religion significance.<br>
<br>
Heres Some history I dug up <br>

Well that is how I see it buy piecing information I got and the history i knew myself.<br>
<br>
Btw before Israel was built again, Palestine reached from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, New Jordan(syria), to Turkey.<br>

I wasn't implying that YOU personally would have ignored the news had the woman been Palestinian; I was simply pointing out that, if she HAD been, she'd just have been one more Palestinian killed, and in all likelihood it would have gone unreported, or relegated to the back page of most newspapers.  <br>
<br>
The fact that she was an ignorant American activist is what made the story so sensationalized.  You coming here and pointing it out, and then getting upset when people say &quot;so what?&quot; is pretty childish.  Her action was every bit as one-sided and blind as you're accusing the U.S.'s support of Israel to be.  Once again, I'll ask you--would you feel as much remorse and outrage if an innocent Israeli woman sacrificed herself in the path of an incoming Palestinian bomb as a statement against terroristic violence?  <br>
<br>
Don't misunderstand me, I'm not taking sides on the issue--both sides are inexorably corrupt and wrong on most counts.  I'm simply pointing out that getting bent out of shape and self-righteous over the attention-whoring actions of one hippie--who is audacious enough to think her presence will stop a decades-old conflict--is fairly narrow-minded and hypocritical.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qikkiq>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 147<br> <font color=#628CBC>(3/20/03 3:39:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=48>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: American killed...</span><hr size=1> Let's not forget how the whole palestinian thing got started.<br>
<br>
As late as 1948, there was a place called Palestine where Palestinians lived in about as much harmony as could be had in a land rife with tribal rivalries, clan warfare and religious strife.<br>
<br>
Then, a bunch of assclowns, let's call them &quot;UN&quot; for short, got together and under the powerful urging of the a powerful UN member (cough), TOOK AWAY Palestine and gave it to the Jews (and yes it was given to the Jews to be a Jewish state where they could live without gas ovens and concentration camps), and called it Israel.  It was &quot;The Vision (tm)&quot; United Nations style.<br>
<br>
As you might imagine if, say, someone took Texas away and gave it to the Mexicans, the Palestinians were mightily pissed and so were all the Arabs in the area.  Or a better example might be that the UN, after considering the plight of aboriginal people in North America, separates Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba from Canada and the US, gives them a flag and calls it &quot;The Democratic Republic of North American First Nations&quot; giving the aboriginals right and title to all property in that area... how do you think the rest of the poeple who live there would react?  They'd blow veins.  Even on a micro-scale... if some asses in  uniforms show up at my house tomorrow and says &quot;we're taking this house away without compensation and giving it to Robert Littleweasel's Iroquois band&quot;, they'd better bring the SWAT team too because they'll be taking it over my dead body and I'll be sure to take as many of them with me as I can.<br>
<br>
In any case, the Jews, having suffered unspeakable atrocities at the hands of the Germans, decided that they could probably commit some of their own atrocities because it was their dirt now and no filthy Palestinians were going to @#%$ with it, and compared to what was done to them, nobody would really notice.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile the Palestinians were all saying &quot;WTF??&quot;  They wanted to go to other countries, but those countries basically said &quot;Hey, go get your own country back, we'll even help if it means you won't come here.&quot;<br>
<br>
So Palestinians went to war with the Israeli occupier.  And since they don't have big spiffy UN members handing them billions of dollars a year to buy tanks and planes and nuclear bombs, they do what they can with Semtex and nails and old jalopies.  And when they do, Israel responds with tanks and F-16's and bulldozers.<br>
<br>
The Palestinians have a VERY legitimate beef, much more legitimate, in my opinion, than Israel's &quot;right to defend itself&quot;.  Palestine was flat-out stolen from the Palestinians.   This simple fact is lost on Israeli zealots.  If they could grasp this simple concept, they might be able to find a simpler solution that involves less killing and bulldozing.<br>
<br>
Palestinians really have nothing to lose.  That's why they keep it up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lokar008>lokar008</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1006<br> <font color=#628CBC>(3/20/03 4:47:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: American killed...</span><hr size=1> ok, thank you. so no Palestine was never Occupied correct?<br>

<br>
This quagmire did not begin in 1948 after WWII, but goes back into the 19th century.<br>
<br>
However, from a practical point of reference, a more convenient starting place would be the Arab Revolt of 1917.  [you know, Lawrence of Arabia, and all that].  Prior to that 'Palestine' was part of the Ottoman Empire.<br>
<br>
The whole thing is EXTREMELY complicated; with first this group [Palestians], and then that group, [Jews] being promised a reward [homeland] for their various assistance to the British Empire in it's struggles during WWI and WWII.<br>
<br>
I really don't want to attempt to unravel the Gordian Knot of all the treaties, protocols and agreements that mark the milestones of this mess.  Suffice it to say that BOTH sides have legitimate [though mutually exclusive] claims to the land that now encompasses the state of Israel and the areas of Gaza and the West Bank.<br>
<br>
I have very little confidence there can EVER be a peaceful solution to this mess; and I, for one, would certainly not want to place myself in the middle of that powder keg [or in front of a bulldozer] just for some idealistic 'posturing'!<br>

And I dont have a solution other than dissolution of one state or another, either to one state disappearing or one whole Hebrew/ Arab state. I dont care right now, all I care about is my country giving huge amounts of money to another Iraq.<br>

Palestine (yes, I know it was a while ago) had every chance to have its own country from the very beginning. This resolution was accepted by the Israelis, but rejected by the Palestinians. Why did the Palestinians reject it? Well, at the time they heavily outnumbered the Israelis and figured they didnt need this. They could just go to war with their allies (notice, the same ones who also voted against this resolution) and defeat Israel anyway. Their thinking was why share the land when they could take it all by force. Well, they gambled on this and LOST. Now afterwards, after starting a war and LOSING, they seem to want to go back to this idea of an independent Palestinian state. I dont know man, they started a war knowing the risks, they accepted the risks, and they lost. Tough to really find sympathy for a people like this.<br>

<br>
It is painfully apparent to me that on issues like this, where people have passionate beliefs, that a LITTLE knowledge is a dangerous thing!  People tend to react emotionally, rather than rationally. [one of those cases of, &quot;Don't confuse me with the facts!&quot;]<br>
<br>
Someone once said, &quot;There are lies, damn lies, and statistics.&quot;  Each side on this issue I am sure, will put their own interpretation [spin] on the basic facts presented here, but here is at least an abbreviated time-line: [for what it is worth]<br>

[edited:  this time-line is stridently anti-Israeli in tone, [it comes from a Palestinaian web site], and omits quite a vast number of 'incidents' that reflect unfavorably on the Arab side of the issue, [especially during the 1936-1939 Arab Revolt period (for instance they conveniently neglect to tell you that Al Husseini had German financial backing in the revolt and after it collapsed was given political assylum by Hitler)], but I used it never-the-less, because it is fairly comprehensive in the general flow of events.

<br>
I am sure that prior to the moment when her back was broken by the dozer, Sister Golden Hair Suprise felt strongly that she was there to try to right an injustice to the oppressed Palestinian People.  I admire her sense of compassion, and her high ideals, but there are so very many injustices to go around on ALL sides there, that to foolishly believe that making a statement by the forfiture of your young life will make a difference, is so tragic, foolish, and sad as to almost defy description; at least to me.<br>
