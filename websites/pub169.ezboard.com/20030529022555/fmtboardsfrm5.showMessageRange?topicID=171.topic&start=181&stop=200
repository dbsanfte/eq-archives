what kind of job? its easy to say &quot;get a job, u bum!&quot;, but if ur born into this world in poverty, without possibilities to educate yourself well, learning early that u are bottom silt in society..would u feel motivated to get a job, when u can make more cash dealing with drugs and robbing the liquor store? i would never support such a system, if i was the black ghettoblaster here.<br>

i believe its called something like &quot;smokeable heroin&quot;, roughly translated.<br>
<br>
but the again, the hen or the egg? do they smoke crack cause they cant find a job, or cant they find a job cause they smoke crack?<br>
<br>
there is always a reason to why people start abusing drugs.<br>
in this case, i would say its because society wont let them progress.<br>
<br>
in the southern part of america, whites and blacks stil lare separated at the schools. there were two black students attending my friends university in south caroline 2 years ago, but they quickly left cause they didnt feel welcome at all.<br>
<br>
according to my friend, european tourists in america would feel shocked about how americans categorizes people, based on their origin.<br>
<br>
this would be the southern part of america.<br>

i know that its racism. but what im talking about here is america - the big melting pot of origins - how could u possibly consider someone &quot;less american&quot;?<br>

its understandable in a country which havent had foreigners for hundreds of years. its one of our weaknesses - the fear of the unknown. but as an american, i dont see how someone could consider f.e. blacks as less american.<br>

no the panthers and the watts riots didnt change things, well not by themselves, they were certainly a part of the changes that were sweeping across the nation, but they were not the SOUL (sorry couldnt resist the pun) source of those changes. they didnt start this topic, its as old as time. for as long as there have been have and have nots this topic has been around. i firmly believe that given human nature it will never end, it seems to be one of our natural defense mechanisms to mistrust that which we dont directly know. <p>DESEPCHUN &lt;BR&gt;EXILED PRINCE OF ERUDIN&lt;BR&gt;Forever Exiled Elite&lt;BR&gt;Member of the EXILED GATEKEEPERS</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fogelxanedu>Fogel Xanedu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 475<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/2/02 11:56:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=186>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  .</span><hr size=1> Not sure were the panthers were mentioned, and don't feel like sorting through this mess to find out, but I'd like to point out that they and people like malcom x not only contributed nothing to the situation, they only set it back further. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreket>Kreket</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fimble Adorer</span><br>  Posts: 1191<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/3/02 8:00:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=187>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> lokar, i read some world statistics somewhere regarding free speech. i dont have a reference tho.<br>
<br>
america was ranked 17. finland would be on the top, since they are pretty unambiguous (sp?). i dont know where sweden were, but i could imagine they were somewhere between 10 and 6, or lower than 17. cause even tho we are good at free speech, things are pretty directed regarding homosexuality, drugs, racism and all other controversial topics. we work very hard to be jesus-like, and ive had many threads deleted when i discuss these matters. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
we are very &quot;open-minded&quot;, or at least we work hard to give that impression during our shallow ways. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  tho, 95% of the parents born in the 40's would try to direct their daughter if she started dating a black man. this is VERY typical swedish behaviour.<br>

<br>
its like this, all-over again: <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  in worldwide events, americans would be educated in what mattered to them. since a lot of the world happenings involve america, u would know a lot..even tho it would be a bit directed. (any country would direct this kind of info). but what didnt involve america, wouldnt appeal to your educational system.<br>
<br>
sweden, on the other hand, is a very dependent country, and we are forced to learn as much as possible about the surrounding world, no matter what. we need that knowledge to simply stand a chance in f.e. the world economics.<br>
<br>
this isnt what i consider a bash against a nation. i consider this fact.<br>
<br>
tho, i DO believe that europeans regard f.e. israel from a neutral perspective, where americans would regard it from an american perspective. where most of u see it as common sense to give back the jews their homelands, europeans would see &quot;big brother america&quot; force a native people to move out of their lands.<br>
who REALLY owns this piece of land is irrelevant, since 2000 years have passed and the rest is strictly religious. a religious war..today..its very primitive!<br>
<br>
as for my assumptions giving the impression theyve been drawn out of movies, it might be so. i remember when we read about islam in school, and i strongly reacted on how directed the information was!<br>
<br>
but as with everything else - there are always more sides to it than what is dished out.<br>
<br>
as for america, america has done very good. and i have to admit my country would fall if america fell.<br>
<br>
BUT, imo..america has done more bad then good to the world. the major wars fought have been for a good cause.. f.e. the wwII and the american civil war. but as for the rest..i simply cant agree with it.<br>
<br>
nagasaki, israel and vietnam. 3 wars i simply cant see anything positive about. i regard them as egoistic and evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
all nations have their flaws, but its extra important with america to be flawless, cause your foundation is not the same as other nations. u represent something called freedom. u represent a new era of progression, yet u are one of the most aggressive nations out there, standing on a lot of bloodshed.<br>
<br>
i find that a flaw.<br>
<br>
i feels to me that u are preserving a very harsh 300 year old political system. (death penalties, 25 years prison sentence for a recividist shoplifter in california, religious wars etc).<br>

I dare say we have stopped more death than we have delivered.

It's funny, because even the Japanese who were alive then and are alive now, say the bomb was a necessary evil, but you, who learned about it in school, want to disagree with those who were alive at the time and witnessed events with their eyes.<br>
<br>
I would also dare to say you dont know anything about the war in the pacific. Because every time someone brings up valid points, you do one of two things, either (a) Ignore the points you cant nitpick at with something out of a movie (pearl harbor... oy vey, what a GREAT source to quote) or, (b) You say &quot;Just cuz we did it, doesnt mean its right and you can do it!&quot; <br>
<br>
I dont begrudge your ignorance on the subject though, the Pacific war had nothing to do with your people, and though you say your educations are soooo complete, unless you go to school 24/7 for 22 years, you arent going to learn everything about the world, especially not about american wars you had nothing to do with. Sure, Adolph was a'knocking on your door, but you probably wouldnt know Emperor Hirohito from Judge Ito.<br>

<br>
Its almost as if you DO have some great points, but your basis for them seems to be taken from conspiracy theory websites.  As for the bombing of Japan, I can confirm Canna's statements about what the Japanese people themselves stated.  The only thing that may differ is whether the second bomb was an absolute necessity or not.  It has been argued the time frame for unconditional surrender was not long enough (especially after such a devastating attack).  There are many arguments for and against the second attack but that is something that will always be clouded in history and what's done is done.  However, the Japanese people themselves have repeatedly stated how ready they were to die, if a land assault had taken place.<br>
<br>
As for Vietnam, I am curious as to what the American's believe the cause of the war was... or why they were there.  The French definitely had a leading role in the whole ordeal but the U.S. played a key role in forcing the war issue as well.

this would go for the first bomb as well. and i dont think usa is more entitled to use nuclear bombs then any other country. i consider it an act of stupidity to use nuclear bombs, cause in the end it wont do sh!t to the world politics or whatever. u dont save anyone..u dont protect a so called freedom. u simply stir things up to the worse by controlling different opinions with a destructive weapon of global proportions.<br>

i stick to that opinion and no matter HOW many water proof arguments someone pumps me with, american or not, i would NEVER let it justify the nuclear bomb.<br>
