I don't think so. I think eq only touches the UI file (UI_charname_##) if you're loading the new UI. So any changes you made for the new UI should still be intact when you run the new UI again.<br>
<br>
A Guide told me, sometimes if your body doesn't disappear when you 'fully loot' your corpse. You can try reverting back to the old UI and you may see the items that were presumably missing.<br>
<br>
I got my items back. The GM admin basically said, they currently don't know what is causing the items to disappear. I asked him what should I do to avoid this from happening again. He said, &quot;Don't die!  &quot;. For me death and fun go hand in hand so I've just reverted back to the old UI until they get the issue sorted out. It's a pity because I really like they way they've implemented the pet health and command system.<br>

2)Re: New UI<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Also from the Concert Hall, with some more information on it:<br>
==================================<br>
Had this happen several times to me. Started paying closer attention every time I was looting corpse and narrowed down what was happening. Got together with GM there to reproduce and we narrowed it down to two things, both stemming from one new UI feature. It should be fixed shortly. For the time being.. here's what is happening.<br>
<br>
When looting items off your corpse in the old UI, you were only able to take one item at a time. If you right-clicked to loot two items quickly, only the first item you clicked would get looted. You had to wait until it was in to your inventory to loot the second one, this made looting in heavy lag very slow.<br>
<br>
With the new UI, you can &quot;queue&quot; up items to loot. In a lag burst you can click 10 items on your corpse and have all 10 of them be looted in order. Works fine normally, but occasionally problems happen.<br>
<br>
Occasionally items are simply dropped out of the queue order and poof, but this seems to happen more rarely, generally in heavy lag.<br>
<br>
The other problem that can cause you to lose an item every time is easier to reproduce but still has to do with queuing up items.<br>
<br>
If you queue more bags then you have space to loot, it will go to your cursor, IF your cursor is empty when you first queue the backpack. If you pick up an item and have it on your cursor when the backpack gets around to being looted, it tries to go your corpse and poofs. This doesn't happen if you don't queue the bags. If you slowly loot the 5 bags, waiting for each to finish before clicking the next, the 5th bag simply does not get looted.<br>
<br>
Example: You have 4 inventory slots open. You quickly click 5 backpacks to loot, then you pick up your sleeper's key from the inventory. Even though you have 5 inventory spots open now, when the bag was queued there were only 4 inventory spots open, so the bag tries to go to your cursor (which now is holding your key). Your bag cannot be there at the same time and poofs.<br>
<br>
Log and over-detailed answer.. but the problem in a nutshell is that queued items do not check to see if it's save to loot when they are actually looted, the check occurs when you first click the item and things can change by the time it is actually looted.<br>
<br>
Another example of this is when buying items. Say you have 8 open inventory slots, if you quickly spam the buy button 9 times, the 9th ore gets bought and goes to your cursor, picking up an item in between spamming the button and actually getting the 9th ore will cause your 9th ore to disappear. At the same time, if you slowly loot the 8 ore and fill up every spot, it will not allow you to buy the 9th ore. Instead you get the message that your inventory is full.<br>
<br>
So! Avoid queueing items for now, especially when looting your corpse. Verant is aware of the problem and it should be fixed soon. Let's just hope they decide to change the time the check is performed (when the item is actually looted, rather than when you intially click the item) instead of removing queueing all together. I have a feeling they'll probably just axe the queueing of items, which I have already grown fond of. <br>
<br>
