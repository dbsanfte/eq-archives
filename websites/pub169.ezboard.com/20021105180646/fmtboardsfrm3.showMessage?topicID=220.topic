Seems last night there was a Ninja on Naggy (again).<br>
<br>
At approximately 1am Eastern a 6-Group band lead by Thraax Silverbladed took on, and summarily dispatched, above mentioned nasty Red Dragon . . . . However.. . . .<br>
<br>
After Thraxx, and I , and a few other sad members of G1 (also commonly known as the SUICIDE Squad) got our Rezzes . .. it was discovered 3 items from Naggy's dead rotting corpse were missing . . . Specifically: <br>
Selos Drums of the March<br>
Orb of Tishani (Tishani Orb?? not sure of exact name)<br>
and a Treasure Hunters Bag (100% wt Reduction).<br>
<br>
I understand the sequence of event as follows . . . <br>
<br>
Very shortly after the (IMO) UNTIMELY deaths of a majority G1, the Dragon was Felled by G4 . . who's leader promptly locked the corpse . . It was this member that noted all the items.<br>
<br>
After approximatley 5 minutes, control of the corpse was transfered to 1 of the 2 surviving members of G1 . . <br>
<br>
Thraax and I and the  rest of G1 were rezzed . . Thraax then assumed control of the Naggy Bod . .. but was only able to see and loot these items:<br>
1 Diamond<br>
1 pair Gaunts of Fiery Might<br>
1 Ruby Crown<br>
and I believe 1 Bladestopper.<br>
<br>
There were a handful of peeps in  Naggy's lair that were not grouped but no one noticed any obvious Loot and scoot tactics  ..  like unexplained trains . ..  group members disbanding and going LD  . . etc.<br>
<br>
I COMMEND Thraax for keeping  things very calm and civil (I happened to be on another raid where a Ninja occurred, and it got REALLY Ugly . . reallly fast). He offered several times to whomever Ninja'd simply return the goods . . and there would be NO hard feelings / repercussions . . . this, sadly, did not work.<br>
Eventually we rolled on ALL loot, even the missing items ( WOOT, a roll of 899 out of 1000 wins me a set INVISIBLE Selos Drums!!) . ..  Several petitions have been sent . . but no word yet on whether server logs can determine who the looter was . . or what became of the missing items . . . I believe Thraax will be posting that when he gets it . .Until then . . I'll hafta be running at only near warp speed, playin these Walrus skin drums  =(.<br>
<br>
As something to prevent or at least more easily identify Ninja looting/looters . . I propose that instead of seeing:<br>
&quot;Someone is already looting this corpse&quot;<br>
that the message, &quot; PCX is already looting this Corpse&quot;.<br>
It would help during the times of confusion to be able to see if someone slipped in and took control of the corpse . .<br>
<br>
Also, I'll strongly recommend on my future raids, that the Leader of the Exp Group loot ALL non- nodrop items .  . and if needed, leave just a gem or something of lesser value on the bod . . (I figure this is common practice on higher level raids . . but most of us are still in our Raid infancy . . pickin on the defenseless lil' dragons)<br>
<br>
Thanks all,<br>
<br>
Martos<br>
&quot;OOM . . 52 FOREVER . .  and has ANYONE seen my new Drums??&quot;<br>

Most raids I have been on were andled like that. <br>
<br>
The raid leader loots items. All rezzes are done then all items are rolled on that are rollable.<br>
<br>
Anyone at the raid have a list of all the names that were there? Maybe you can pass it along to the gm to assit them.<br>
<br>
Sorry to hear about the items being ninjad. Hopefully a GM will <br>
resolve the matter and make the items go poof from the person who has them. <br>

Suggestion:  Start posting the names of all in attendance at these raids.  This way if Player_XX is always at a raid that gets ninja looted, we can start eye balling him a bit more.  Live in suspicion!!!!!<br>
<br>
Sucks that people are stealing loot.

<br>
As for GM support of preventing Ninja Looting . . I've heard they have at times been Excellent at tracking down the offender . . I have heard the logs (though QUITE massive) can be parsed for the critical Data  . and here we have excellent Logged info from Nerak . . <br>
<br>
I've posted an initial and follow-up Petition at the www.eqlive.com site (contact your GM) . . and so far have only received confirmation e-mails stating they've received mine . . I do have High hopes for that avenue of action . . however . . I was in game today long enough to petition and get a response . . sadly the Guide that talked with me said the GMs need to have a suspect's name . . and that going through massive logs was not something they commonly do . . . .<br>
<br>
Very sad . . when, given the timestamp data we have .. I'd think it would be relatively easy to track this event. . and by NOT taking action, Verant really only condones the practice of Ninja looting . . and in my opinion, ninja tactics greatly undermine the spirit of the EQ &quot;game&quot; . . . <br>
<br>
I DO feel confident (so far) that when I get an actual e-mail response from a GM  . . we can get to the bottom of this event. <br>
<br>
Lastly, I am hoping that the Raid Leader, Thraax, is able to post something here or in another thread regarding HIS experience in getting this cleared.<br>
<br>
<br>
blah blah blah . . guess thats why this is the rant board . . thanks all.<br>

i really hope verant will come up with a good way of preventing these things..<br>
<br>
maybe areawide --bogga has looted a cloak of flames-- (on nameds only maybe?), &quot;pcx is already looting dat corpse&quot; or a better GM system where GM will be there withing 30 mins and tell RL who looted the stuff. then again..GMs are GMs and they have a lot to do. :/<br>
<br>
hmm.. a command that gives the &lt;edit&gt; groupleader in exp group &lt;/edit&gt; authority to lock the corpse for him only until he /unlock &lt;target&gt;? and on top of that - on a 30 min corpse - 10 minutes lock and u can invite people to group to have access to corpse?<br>

sounds good to me!<br>
