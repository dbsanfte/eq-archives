<br>
CSM/LaDA does an Open Vox raid on Sunday 20th April at 2pm EST. Please sign up here.<br>
We meet at 1.30pm EST in Permafrost.<br>
Level Limit for Clerics: 42-52<br>
All other Classes: 45-52<br>
<br>
Loot: <br>
1 Item Claimed (Book preffered if it dropps)<br>
All other Loot will be rolled by class who can use!<br>
No raidfee needed!<br>
<br>
This was a RIP-OFF  books x2, Hammer x2 and a RBB  dropped <br>
so they Claimed the RBB and passed the 2 books out to the pally in their guild.  This was a very Gimp thing to do, and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I strongly recommend that no one attends their Raids.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->If your sent tell by them because they don't have enought people to do their Raid for epics drops.<br>
<br>

P.S. CSM/LaDA  don't send me tells any more to help you gimps out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leonaria>Leonaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/21/03 9:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=828.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: CSM/LaDA</span><hr size=1> One of the books went to a member of Hunters of the Undead, just to correct the record. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tquilwestwood>Tquil Westwood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/21/03 9:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=828.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: CSM/LaDA</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the update.<br>

But neither CSM nor LaDA had any pallies show up that needed them.  Probably due to the holiday.  Rather then loot the books and MQ them to people that were not even there they went to the only other 2 pallies there that could use them.  Both in other guilds.  I was there at the raid with an alt.  I was there for the entire time. And I saw at least 6 times that the loot rules were explained in the raid channel.  I saw it explained that 1 item was claimed and that all epic items were going to be rolled on whether they be books or scales because at that time we knew the pally it was going to was not going to be there.  If you did not like the rules you should have left then. Instead YOU choose to stay.   <br>
Complaining about the rules after that fact while knowing full well what they were before hand is in poor taste.  If you did not know what they were before hand then you were not paying attention the the raid channel.  Either way this is not anyone's fault  but your own that you are upset.  If you didn't agree with the loot rules fine.  Nobody forced you to stay after they were explained.<br>
<br>
2nd. I know for a fact you were not asked to dual by a 65 monk afterwards.  I know this because neither CSM nor LaDA has one.  Please stop making things up to simply smear us.  Again poor taste.<br>
<br>
3rd. If anyone at anytime ever has a problem with a member of my guild then contact me directly in game.  I am on just about every night.<br>

<br>
But it was said more then once BEFORE we started the fight that:<br>
<br>
- Guild will claim 1 item<br>
<br>
and <br>
<br>
- ALL Epic-Drops are OPEN to roll by class who need<br>
<br>
Also i know that our member who announced the raid in several zones didnt say that the Book would be claimed.<br>
<br>
But the phrase &quot;Book preferred&quot; doesnt mean &quot;We claim the book if we still need or not, and in case that NO Book drops we claim nothing&quot;.<br>
<br>
If someone got a direct tell with the invite to come, then for sure i dont know what he got told, but again<br>
<br>
It was said often enough that we would claim another item then a Epic-piece.<br>
<br>
Several people heard that, and maybe others didnt see it cause of the heavy spam in raidchats from people which seem to know anything better then the Raidleader, and by that at least cause a delay of the raid which wouldnt happen if everyone would only wait and follow the instructions.<br>
<br>
And for the record, read the schedule post from HotU with which they tried to get Vox at 4th even there was still another reservation on calendar.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Hunters of the Undead would like to schedule an Open Vox Raid for Sunday, May 4, 2003 at 1pm<br>
<br>
Claim 1 book and if it does not drop reserve the right to claim one drop Item for Hosting guild.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now, its a little more specific then ours, but at least may result in the same claim according if no Books but a RBB drops as best NON-Epic-piece.<br>
<br>
Sorry everyone that those poor dragons now after all those new releases still have loot in there table which no one wants to use either then on an Alt (like the 2 Cleric-Hammers this time).<br>
<br>
Its well known that there are lots of people on this server which always know better when an item only should be rolled by a single class (like Satchels by Monks), but its also well known that people seem not to be able to read/understand rules.<br>
<br>
Or is it more that they did understand, but hope to change them by complaining about it AFTER the mob is down ???<br>
<br>
If you dont like those rules, then simply stay away and organize those raids on your own, but please stop whining and complaining when you dont get a roll on the item you want or when you stand up to late to get a reservation.<br>
<br>
As we normal only have 2 groups up to 52 (plus the 60+ Buffers) it might happen that we will have to cancel a schedule, then feel free to gather forces and kill them, but make sure EVERYONE understands your Lootrules BEFORE the kill (which might not serve you fom complaining about 100%).<br>
<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
To correct Protanis before another does:<br>
<br>
We HAVE a 65 Monk since this weekend, but i dont think he will have duelled someone for those whining about not getting to roll on an item.<br>

<br>
First, i wont know for sure, how much people attending Open Vox/Naggy-Raids are Alts, and how much of the items they may roll will end in the bazaar 5 mins later, even if the roll was NEED BEFORE GREED.<br>
<br>
So it dont see a reason why the organizing Guild/Alliance should go away without getting anything USEFULL and without getting a RAIDFEE for all the work AND trouble with people which only can speak but not hear (i know its not everyone, but its alot on every raid).<br>
<br>
Second, BIG THANKS for giving us our 1st RANT, guess that means we are big step further on the way up to the big Guilds/Alliances now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

        Smear your Guild, I was Called a little Kid and told to Shut up in you Raid channel when this went down and I told you there I was going to post here.<br>
<br>
        Remember &quot;Denile is a river&quot; so you can try and post all you want. You can't hide the Truth. I'm Just trying to make sure other don't Get Ripped- Off like I was.<br>
<br>
        Maybe your guild will think twice before Claiming a 50k 36% haste item.  But I don't think so &quot;Greed before Need is some guilds Moto. <br>

<br>
Is it possible that your NBG was to possible win it, and then drop it on your trader?<br>
<br>
I guess people which really roll NBG wont do that cause its worth lots of pp, they do it cause they need it, regardless what it costs in bazaar.<br>
<br>
The RBB btw is on that 65 Monk now, which offered you a duel after some bad things you did in PoI.<br>
<br>
Is it possible that when you have seen our shout &quot;VOX-Raids...&quot;, that you instantly stopped reading the whole message (which would have told you that 1 item will be claimed, but all Epic-Drops would be NBG rolled) to check what possible expensive drop may there on that you could roll ?<br>
<br>
I cant be 100% sure, but i dont think you got the invite via a direct tell, cause on warriors we are well equipped:<br>
<br>
1 delevelled to 52 from 58 for this mobs,<br>
1 levelled up to 52 (8 AAs)with unbuffed 1100AC 2900HP 140MR<br>
<br>
so we never would direct ask other warriors to attend, we dont denie them to come, but for sure we are not needing lots more warriors to kill these 2 dragons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=devictionmt>DevictionMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/22/03 12:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=828.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: CSM/LaDA</span><hr size=1> cant argue with people not willing to listen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twinsenreiselied>Twinsen Reiselied</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/22/03 12:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=828.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: CSM/LaDA</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1 delevelled to 52 from 58 for this mobs,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
