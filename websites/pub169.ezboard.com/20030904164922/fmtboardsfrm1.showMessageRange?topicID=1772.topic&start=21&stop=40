In MOST states it is a law that you cannot send unsolicited porn.  Videos of masturbation falls under porn in anyone's book I would think.<br>
<br>
On the good part having played mostly female charatcers for over 3 years in this game, I belive sexual harassment has become much less of a problem here than it used to be.  Maybe more females are playing.  Maybe the GM are doing more about it.  Who knows.  But it can be a problem and will continue to be a large problem unless people do somthing about it.<br>
<br>
The GMs, espcially if you /report WILL do somthing about that person wether a soulmark or outright ban, they will take notice of that person.<br>
<br>
Now joking around is one thing, but if it is clearly unwarranted, it harassment and needs to stop. And if a person feels the need to send nekkid pics of themselves to somene they ahve not met yet in RL....they need help.  And for those it has not happened to or the guys who have not seen it, let me tell you it DOES happen.<br>
<br>
I had one guy who I hunted with several times.  We spoke in tells and becasme passing freinds.  He asked for my email one day and I didn't even think not to give it.  I am a guildleader, my email is quite public.  He asked me if it was ookay to send pics of himself.  I never thought anything of it.  Lots of peeps who had become freinds have sent pics of themselves.<br>
<br>
They were of him naked and erect.  I am quit happily married and in no need of cybering or looking for another person.  This floored me.  To his credit he did apologize profusly and never bothered me again.  But to this day I still cannot belive he sent those pics.  Our conversations  were never more than &quot;Hey what level are you now?&quot;  &quot;Did you get flagged for Valor yet&quot; so on.  <br>
<br>
Another time...remeber when Luclin came out and they &quot;upgraded&quot; female human models esepcially?  My main was a female human paladin...ina  treeweave.  At that time with those graphis, we POURED out of the BP.  Anyway Ill try to make a long story short.  This was before they upgraded paladins and made them more useful, therefore you would sit for hours and hours and days looking for a group and since maybe a handful of chanters had KEI and there were vey few hanters on the server, normal paladins could not solo effectivly.  Without KEI and without the upgrades they were given.<br>
<br>
I finally got a group and only ahd a short bit to level to 49 and was int he Dls.  Keep in mind paladin's don't get spells from 40 to 49 so I was quite anxious.  I FINALLY get a group after about 3 hours.  And it is a chain pulling, good group.  We are sailign and killing, the harassment starts.  I joke along a bit, not ebing a prude.  It starts to turn ugly and not from one person but four of the group memebers.  Especially the rogue.<br>
<br>
I finally said, enoug  is enough, this is getting bad, knowck it off and lets kill.  The rogue and monk would not stop.  The rogues  was doing stuff like &quot;So and so cumms alll over your leg for 10,000 points of sexual ectasy!&quot; and things like that.  If I did not ave one more blue to go I would have disbanded and left.  I asked them to boot out rogue since he was the one casueing the problems. and they said no if I didn't like I could leave.  FInally they stopped dead and told me and I quote, &quot;If you got a problem with it, blame Verant for making the chicks so hot&quot;<br>
<br>
This is the type of attitude that needs to be be STOPPED.<br>
<br>
Unforntunetly, I tried to report the rogue, but at that time we eiehter didn;t have filters or I didn;'t know about them and my screen was scrolling by so fast I honestly couldn;t capture it.  I was so upset by that and guys coming up and oogling my treewevae I did not play that character for months.<br>
<br>
Anyway my 2cp ont he subject.  Thank you for the warning, I will warn my guild as well.<br>

I know sexuality is a pretty big part of life and EQ life.  But you better know your audience, consequences or no.<br>
<br>
But Emmy, Aadarri, and a couple others, yeah, thats way too much.  You should only have to ask once. <br>
<br>
So whether it's worse or not, seems like things are getting a bit out of hand with the actions they are taking.<br>

It is not my place to divulge names, and ask anyone who knows me, i dont throw out rumor and conjecture.  I was a previous member of Black Claws a guild he was very intune with and know several people both in game and real life that know and have played with him.<br>
<br>
I am VERY surprised this is the first post on the issues in some time.  But i think that maybe more to do with mention that sexual overtones in eq are dying. I dont htink so, i think we are all just ignore it.  I have been guilty of overtones myself, but never to an extreme as this, but then most guild chats in BnB were unratable, and only once as GL did i recieve a complaint.  It was about talk of drug use, not sex oddly enough.<br>
<br>
I am guilty too once of a &quot;mistell&quot; intended for one of my longest RL friends ( a female) that got sent instead ot Shakaira who snuck in a tell to me before i hit &quot;/r&quot;.  I was so embarresed, but she was really kewl about it, understood, accepted my appology.  Shes a pretty kewl cat.<br>

<br>
I don't know you. <br>
<br>
Hence my skepticism.<br>
<br>
Emmie, on the otherhand, belongs to a guild which I was once a proud member, &amp; I still call quite a few of the folks behind the toons, &quot;friend.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Given her affiliation, I've no reason to assume that Emmie is lying about this, nor blowing the facts out of proportion.<br>
<br>
As I said before, I'm perfectly solid with your line of logic:  anyone who puts up with depraved behavior in exchange for virtual real estate is an utter fool.<br>
<br>
My issue was that anyone can spout off &quot;Well I know someone that... ad nauseam.&quot; in an attempt to stir up hornet's nests, and make the case that a victim is not a victim because he / she somehow deserved what he / she got because they somehow provoked the neer-do-well into unsavory behavior.<br>
<br>
I don't see Entilzha showing up to defend his name, nor do I see anyone rushing to his defense, nor do I see these &quot;I used Entilzha to get a RBB&quot; people.<br>
<br>
The silence is deafening.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that you're not a man of your word.  I'm saying that if Entilzha is as much a pawn as you claim he is, I haven't seen the proof.<br>
<br>
At least not in this thread.  <br>
<br>
Without it, you're just generating hypotheticals in an attempt to generate &quot;sympathy for the devil,&quot; (&quot;Well, your honor, she was wearing this skimpy, red dress &amp; I couldn't help myself...&quot;) which IMO, is somewhat lame given the overall nature of this thread.<br>
<br>
Fair enough?<br>
<br>

<br>
 I think I remeber you from toffs days ... maybe it was the only other erudite paly ... lol.<br>
<br>
 because of things like your above quote is the problem, not only is it hard to tell anyone when you feel uncomfortable because someone makes you by going over the edge with sexual remarks, but when you do if you have your guildleader or friends say thing like this, is exactly why it is allowed to continue ... those words echo and translate to<br>
<br>
 &quot;I do no even belive you.&quot;<br>
<br>
 I made the mistake at first to be passive and take remarks when i put my picture in eqfaces and got stalked in game and since my name WAS my im name for the chat programs I also use was easy to do. I also opened an im one day and chatted with the person for a while because did recognize the name from mt, so I thought ok no big deal ... maybe 15 minutes later it was this &quot;oh do you have a cam? mine is on if you wanting to see what I look like ... &quot;  sure I did , so I did hit the view web cam thing, and I never did used that chat program again or my game name ever after and that person also no longer plays eq.<br>
<br>
 I had another say some things to me in game, it made me so upset I did take off my picture and all email things, just everything because it happened reight after I had to move states because of the same kind of thing but not having to do at all with the internet, is frightening to have someone stand outside your house and have the police do nothing until after they almost kill you.<br>
<br>
 I have learned since then how to stop this sort of thing before it starts, I am not affraid to have others email or stand up for myself if someone posts something, emotes something, or says anything in guildchat over limits or starting to go this way.<br>
<br>
 On the other hand I have been accussed of the same: for no reason other then jealousy. <br>
<br>
 Camping the ac a long long time ago I was joking in guildchat, said when someone ask lfg &quot;come to OOT for co-ed naked pirate hunting&quot; and nothing more then this and maybe joking about one of the monk in our guild marrying the cleric and my char so he could have two wives, Oh and I declared every tuesday &quot;gay tuesday&quot; ... this was a joke of course never said anything more then the above, but a wife in the guild signed on an alt and bitched me directly in guildchat, then signed off the alt back to her main. I did not feel like I had the right to say anything at all from that point on until ...<br>
<br>
 Funny thing a few days later she did a mistell in guildchat ... cybering someone for real, very VERY detailed ... then I was thinking f*ck you hypocrit b*tch .. she said she meant to do it, maybe so no one would tell her husband ... just hope whoever else she does in game isn't 12 ... =add few other not so kind slut type names here not in english= .<br>
