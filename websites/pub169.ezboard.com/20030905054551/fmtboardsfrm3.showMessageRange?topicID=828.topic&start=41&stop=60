<br>
To justify the rippoff and still working on how your motives are just.<br>
<br>
Then back to the age of the player and being a noobie.<br>
<br>
So, your statement is! It is just to rip-off someone that is a noobie.  But wrong to rip-off someone who has been on the server for ( you fill in the blank here help me out).<br>
<br>
Then there is still the part on freedom of speech. If ripped -off and we are not allowed to flame or smear you on the server boards.  <br>
<br>
Then compaire a monk who lost a roll to a rip-off and no roll is like.<br>
I compaired apples and pears once looked alot alike, color, mass, shape and skin. But in the end they were still not the same.    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You want him to stop whining but your post is gonna cause more it.<br>
<br>
I wasn't on the raid but hey usually the draw of the raid is for the really good loot.  I'm not saying you were wrong but most peeps go on a raid to get the cof or the rbb or cocw...stuff like that.<br>
<br>
And most raids (I have been on 7 vox/raids) you roll on the really good loot.  And yes I have been on csm/lada raids.<br>
<br>
So I can understand the confusion.  Usually it's 1book or scale and not 1 item that you decide.<br>
<br>
And you have to understand, I know the guild spends money and time organizing these raids so they set rules up so they get a definate payoff.<br>
<br>
But what about the peeps on the raid...they spend time and sometimes they lose xp.  I was in a raid with CSM/LADA and we wiped on vox three times.  I got 96% rez but I lost about 7% xp at 52 for about 9hours of raiding cause I died several times.  But I had alot of fun and I really enjoyed the peeps but what kept me in the raid is because I won't leave a raid until it is called.  (A bunch of naked peeps waiting for rez fighting naked against Ice Giants and Zake taking down an Ice Giant with his bare hands and looting it for the axe then taking down another one was awesome). But I went for the chance of getting an uber drop and had good time.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm wrong but I really think you guys should change your loot rules.  You would get more peeps at the raid.  I mean isn't the purpose of the raid to help guildies get their epic not to farm good loot (which I'm not saying you guys are doing but some peeps might get that impression... I mean how many pallys do you have in your guild). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brendayan>Brendayan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/24/03 10:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=828.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  staff</span><hr size=1> Just an aside, the 2hb is quite nice.<br>

DO NOT invite outsiders to your raids again. Save yourself the hassle, let them find someone else to flame who's rules are even more stringent than yours. VOILA! Having been part of a large alliance for quite a while, we invited outsiders as guests, our RL set the loot rules, which generally reserved all right to the loot. Many times we charged a raid fee to cover the costs of dots, nothing wrong with that as the clerics need reimbursement. If he was in the raid channel and was asking questions or permission to loot then this argument should be closed. He was able to  see instructions and now when he can't loot something that dropped he cries. Guess I should rant about every raid I've attended where I died multiple times lost 10% exp or more, which happens on a regular basis, and then I don't get phat lewts..that's just outrageous! As much exp as I've lost at times I hate to see what the exp loss is to the poor monks that pull these mobs. <br>
And btw grats on 65 Rasza! You're a  great monk! And believe it or not I know CSM does have pallies, I can think of a couple off the top of my head, since I used to group with them regularly, and I'm sure LaDa does also.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rasza>Rasza</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/24/03 12:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=828.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: staff</span><hr size=1> thank you DemaniMt for the gratssss and alsso thank you Tilluin you all rockssss<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

   Either your TQuils alt, child, or aren't smart enough to open your own EZBoard account.  Which is it?<br>
<br>
  Perhaps, as the great leader and warrior that you are.  You should organize your own dragon raids and /claim the RBB for yourself if you have issues with other peoples raids.<br>
<br>
  Further, at your raid, make everyone a looter as you recommended for CSM/LaDA.  I think once you have done this say, 4-5 times, you MIGHT be worthy of ranting someone.  <br>
<br>
  Once you've raided 10-15 times, and have as large a guild as CSM/LaDA and know who is showing up.  You might figure out, you have no clue which loot you really need to reserve, as none of the correct classes may or may not show up.  So you post an open reservation of one loot.<br>
<br>
  Either way, its quite obvious your not a mature player at this point in the game, or you'd organize your own Vox/Nagy raid and reserve the Uber Loots you so desire.<br>

I see you well versed as Kissing butt as you are explaining why other guilds are just so big they can't get people to come.<br>
(could it be in this case they are too big and using 52 and below to get the loot they so want)<br>
<br>
In you can take your big, firm  DSL and do all of CSM/LaDA for all I care.<br>
<br>
I hope you get the message its not cool to use people.<br>
<br>
But I see from you post you like and give full customer service for free. good job !!!!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

P.S. Did your big brother give you a penhouse with the pages stuck together again? I saw you crying for it on your other post.  Stop wasting my time gimp !!!<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I see you well versed as Kissing butt ... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Exactly what are you trying to say here, that Iegil is trying to kiss up to this alliance?  Do you know what lvl Iegil is, or what class, or what guild?  Let me tell you.  He's a 65 druid in the top guild on the server.  He's prolly more accustomed to folks kissing his cute tush.  He has absolutely no need to kiss up to anyone, except maybe his FE guildleaders hehe.<br>
<br>
From the start of hearing this rant, I did have to question why the books weren't chosen, as they can be MQ'd.  But that's a call I'm sure the guild alliance has discussed and there is a valid reason.  It just hasn't been mentioned (the question) or addressed (the answer) here yet to my knowledge.  If an alliance were truly 110% set on getting the epics, they'd claim a book each time it dropped and MQ it with a paladin.  So, I'm not sure why that wasn't done in this case.<br>
<br>
However, regarding the rant itself, the instructions clearly state ~ 1 item claimed &quot;book preferred&quot; ~ it doesn't say &quot;book claimed&quot;.  Plain and simple - the prestated rules left it open that one item would be claimed, possibly the book, but it never stated it would definitely be the book.  Books dropped, one item was claimed.  They did not go against their stated rules.<br>
<br>
Folks don't do Naggy/Vox for the loot.  Some do, but the items that drop are rare and far between.  30-50 raiders for 1-3 drops maybe, some of which are epic related and therefore off limits for claiming.  Many folks go for the experience of a dragon kill with all the fixings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=iegil>iegil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 204<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/30/03 7:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=828.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: staff</span><hr size=1> Crystilla, thanks =)<br>

When your done looking at that...<br>
<br>
Now, why would I kiss ass to Clan Silvermoon/LDA for loot?<br>
<br>
I used CSM/LDA?<br>
<br>
Hell they are old friends I haven't talked to in a long time.  But having raided with them for 5 months,  I pretty much know their drill.<br>
<br>
In the end, it all boils down the same...<br>
