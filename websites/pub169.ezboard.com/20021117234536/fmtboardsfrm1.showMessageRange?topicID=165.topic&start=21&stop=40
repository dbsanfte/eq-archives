Lootwhore? Maybe not, but at the end of the day, you had only ONE aim.. your epic. You were level 43 and hell bent on getting mage epic. There's more to the game than that.. You always said you aimed to be the lowest level mage with epic on the server.<br>

I have a lot of friends in Ronins who left and joined BaM, and I'm sure they will agree we remained friends afterwards.<br>

<br>
btw, the policy that was in particular is the 5 point minimum bidding for the ToV armors, and 20 points for BP.  Many of the officer at the time was for it(I was for the change, although I was not officially officer in title at the time), and I already had a full set of ToV armor at that point.  And the person that was pushing for this change has like 150 points, while rest has like 50 points.  And that person only has claimed 1 silk robe during all the time that Ronins was in ToV.  Using 60 points to guarantee a silk robe if drop that day will not be painful at all.<br>
<br>
And for plate BP or others to go below 20 points will not happen until like 80%+ of the members gotten it before that demand will happen, if it does.  And the plate BP drop up to that time was like 3, and there were still like 15+ that still needs it.  So in my opinion it would not have happen until maybe at least another 3 months.  =) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/umagneticianmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>magneticianMT</A> at: 8/17/02 4:31:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/usemmynicelot.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SemmyNicelot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/17/02 5:03:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hi</span><hr size=1> As i see it Booke is calling all members and former members of Ronins Unskill.

<br>
Daxian...yes, my goal was to be the lowest level mage on MT to gain mage epic. Why? cuz i saw so many level 60's struggling to be epified, thus this took much time out of their enjoyment of the game. The epic is able to be started when you can start it. Simple as that. I created Booke, and at level 10, he was already collecting epic pieces (Thanks to my alt Yalwen). It never stopped me from giving 110% on any raid i was at with Ronins. Simple fact is this in your statement, Dax..i didn't knock the guild. Draxus got his panties in a bunch based on me saying 35 Ronins took HoT when 18 or so BaM were..<br>
<br>
<br>
as me and MT discussed through previous posts. This wasn't due to the NEED for 35, and i didn't try to post that with the &quot;bumbling fools&quot; kind of logic that Draxus is hell bent on trying to make it sound..It was because Ronins was so large, and we always had guests and apps = more people there. SIMPLE AS THAT..there is no damn reason for anyone else to try to add anything more to that!!! (the only reason i put that i was jealous is because as i stated before..35 people = less loots for everyone vs. 18 players)..now LET THAT DROP PLEASE!<br>
<br>
Semmy..PLEASE don't get me started on you fool. You were the most brown nosing sack of crap i have ever met, and everyone I know who has ever met you agrees when talking about you. Here, you want to bash me on my epic wishes? How about us after the scout quest in WW. How about your whining and crying and temper tantrum about how you help everyone, and no one will come help you kill Faydedar. Well, the sniveling did it, and you got your Fay kill. Then after that, peaches and cream. Now..i am not gonna say i DIDN'T gripe and complain a lot, cuz i did..I just remained smart enough to not come on a public message board and try to make you look stupid. You do that on your own. By the way, ever get the taste of Cecilia's ass out of your nose and mouth? No, guess not, cuz yer still here puckering up.<br>
<br>
&quot;maybe if you went to a raid you would agree.&quot; by the way moron, i was at almost every Ronins raid, while you were still in DL groups, sexually harrassing females you grouped with.<br>
<br>
MT, again. a great post in response to Spara..i TRULY had no problems really with the changing of the loot system. it was simply and only, the manner in which it was presented. Mob in camp, battle spam and suddenly, in mid-fight no less:<br>
<br>
Cecilia tells the guild, &quot;blah blah..new change in bid policy..blah&quot; (i am paraphrasing)..this took the focus AT THE TIME, off the mob as everyone is typing &quot;huh?&quot;, &quot;what?&quot; and &quot;are you kidding?&quot; as opposed to fighting the mob!..<br>
<br>
now, once the mob was down..the discussions started. Yes, I DID see the point of the new policy..however, no voting was done, it was a decision not even presented to us, the members of the guild. I did not agree with the way the decision was made (although if explained, without a mob in camp, or in mid raid, i would have likely agreed)..when my concerns were expressed I got &quot;if you don't like it, you can be teleported out&quot;. That was enough for me..I blew the remaining points I had, and thought about it, and guildremoved.<br>
<br>
The leadership of Ronins was the problem in my mind. Not the officers. I had personal beef with Cecilia. Now, if she was a friend, sure. Run to her defense, I understand it. But I never ONCE in this thread, bashed Ronins as a guild. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.<br>

  If I was flaming, it will be obvious.  I think there were 2 times that it WAS that obvious.  But I was merely correcting some facts =)<br>
<br>
  I can see how this was originally taken as different ways.  But since I didn't really care about 35 vs 18 thing, so I merely stated why 35 was in the raids.  And why Ronins was in the top 5-7 during it's prime, and I feel that explanation is well sufficient.  If there are any mis-stated facts, from my point of view, I will jump in.  I may not be playing anymore, but I will always be a RONINS =)<br>

  Although I may not care enough to have the time sink of loging in at this point, but trolling boards at work is still very much doable. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/umagneticianmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>magneticianMT</A> at: 8/18/02 2:38:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uyalwensomeyallosesome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YalwenSomeyallosesome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/18/02 2:59:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Something special..gone</span><hr size=1> &quot;you need to think about what you post&quot;<br>

Nice try at an obvious straw man, but you are really pulling that out of the air, ace.  Please point out a single other post were I thought even one other person was &quot;out to get&quot; me.  Let me save you the trouble, there are none.  I don't even see how you can conclude that I think you are &quot;out to get me&quot; here; I don't.  I honestly think you made a careless &amp; misguided comment out of your stated anger with Ceci's guild leadership.  Please take that one up with the source, sir.<br>
<br>
If you can't handle me telling you that you have no place putting down Ronins, I'll tell you again, think before you post.  Obviously I'm not the only one you offended.  You see, that is the problem with making grossly generalized statements.  You know that if you make that kind of a statement about any other guild on MT, you will hear the same kind of response.  What do you think the former members of BaM would say if I made a similar generalization?  &quot;I was so jealous of Ronins who were taking things out with far fewer people.&quot;  How does that sound to you?  Despite your predictable denial, we both know you would be the busy typing out your response.<br>
<br>
You are entitled to your opinions about Ceci &amp; Ronins.  You are even entitled to post those opinions on a public board, but don't try to paint me as either disloyal or paranoid because I point out how flat wrong you are.  Next time engage some brain cells before hitting the post button.<br>

<br>
no yer just the only one that read my post, saw the sentence you threw a hissy fit and felt you had to respond. any other posts after that are from YOUR doing not mine.<br>
<br>
like i said. i have no kind unwords for Ronin's as a guild, not 98% of the people in it. Hell ask BaM members. When Ronins fell apart after Cec's lil act with the Lodi shield going to one of his/her alts, when Ronin's was disbanding, I was QUICK to point out members that should be recruited. We got several of them too.<br>
<br>
So stop reading what you WANT to see in my messages, grow up, move on, come on up out of the basement and see life for the fun it is rather than brooding over some post on a bulletin board. Ronins was a mighty powerful guild, i will never deny that. Would you like to try to turn my last sentence there into something other than what i say? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/udraxusmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Draxus MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/18/02 9:25:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=165.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Something special..gone</span><hr size=1> What, are you blaming ME because other posters have a problem with you?

<br>
If you want me to believe that you didn't mean what you said or whatever, you are wasting your virtual breath.  You were either too thoughtless to correctly articulate what you were really trying to say, or you were trying to hide a malice towards Ceci that you decided to take out on the guild.  Either way I have little sympathy.  You get an gold star for effort, though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><br><font size=2>

<br>
i am not blaming you for that, cuz aside from you, i dunno of anyone else that has a problem with me.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm at fault because PK ganked your spider in VL&quot; <br>
<br>
i never been ganked by PK, much less in VL..i have not been there since my early 50's, much less ganked by them. my convo with Ritchie there..no ganking was involved.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you want me to believe that you didn't mean what you said or whatever, you are wasting your virtual breath.&quot;<br>
<br>
you refuse to read my post and see the logic of what i say. to me, that is the virtual waste.<br>
<br>
&quot;You were either too thoughtless to correctly articulate what you were really trying to say, or you were trying to hide a malice towards Ceci that you decided to take out on the guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
i didn't know i needed to put my post through the &quot;thoughless police&quot; in order to express my sadness for fear one little line in it might get you all worked up. i never hid any malice towards Cec. Every Ronin and every BaM member knew i despised her/him. but again. I had nothing against the guild, nor the MEMBERS. get that through your thick skull, dumbass. the more i say it, the more you try to point out how i am &quot;anti-Ronins&quot; or something.<br>
<br>
&quot;Either way I have little sympathy&quot;<br>
<br>
please don't. yer sympathy is like herpes. I don't see people lining up to get either.<br>
<br>
&quot;You get an gold star for effort, though&quot;<br>
