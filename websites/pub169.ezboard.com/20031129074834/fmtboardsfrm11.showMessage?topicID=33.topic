The barkeep was pleasant enough (spoke of her as 'Good Lady Blindedhorse'), and the reanimated help was good. The food was hot and oily; fried stonegazer, curried wolf taj, spiced potatoes and leaks, ice mushrooms (these only being available for a short time each month). The drinks were unusual enough to maintain interest, and good enough to keep drinking; buttermilk laced with spiked orchid poison, ale made with rotten peaches and plums, and there were more kinds of whiskey served in Paineel than any city, anywhere.<br>
<br>
A hissing, sputtering skeleton sounded in tune with the palm wood fire in the dining area. Fires were considered unneeded on Odus, as most of the small continent was warm and humid, but the damp had turned chilly with the wind off of the Stonebrunts shifting today. An enchantment kept little smoke mephits dancing in the fireplace, much to the amusement of Sosoca: there was nothing like relaxing in comfort while watching something helpless suffer. <br>
<br>
&quot;Yeess, maadaamm?&quot;, the servant asked, clumsily imitating the fine mannerisms of a dark elf waiter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhh, Ill have the fried uiui, and the specialty, extra hot. Buttermilk and a bottle of Grinfire's to drink, please...&quot;, she murmured, sliding the menu across the mahogany tabletop.<br>
<br>
As she sat, she savored the anticipation of having the specialty. Stewed erudite was one of the most expensive meals served anywhere (One hundred and fifty platinum pieces), but it was worth it. Cannibalism, was, she supposed, wrong. But it felt right, and she enjoyed both the taste of the food and the knowledge that she would pay dearly for such a desecration later. Not even the trolls ate their own... it was a unique touch that made Paineel home. The horrific hunts on horseback in Toxxulia was a treasured tradition in the south, a black, feared event in the north.<br>
<br>
The uiui came out first, with the drinks. Fried, unleavened bread served in butter, with plain yogurt to dip. It was usually a breakfast food, but the barkeep knew Sosoca well enough to make accommodations. She was a rich, self indulgent woman, and appreciated fine things. She was a frequent customer, and had a habit of tipping outrageous amounts when she was drunk, so he would kill the food himself if she asked. She bit off the black wax cap on the Grinfire's, and poured some of the whiskey into a small glass, watching flakes of cinder settle at the bottom. The stench of burnt blood and alcohol mixed with the pleasant odor of the bread.<br>
<br>
Holding the glass to her chin, she looked out at nothing. She had been morose and reflective the past few weeks... A notion had occurred to her recently that she hadnt been able to shake.<br>
<br>
She had been in Luclin, watching people mill around at the Nexus. They were heading off in a hundred different directions, but Sosoca was sitting. She saw a few others who were doing the same, just staring at life passing them by. She wondered what everyones story was. Maybe that woman was on her way to meet her father for his birthday. Maybe that troll was heading home to his wife. Maybe that elf was planning on killing someone. Maybe that dwarf was willing to do anything for riches, including betrayal.<br>
<br>
But did anyone really have an idea in their head of what was going to happen next? Anything from a cold to a pregnancy to being eaten by a dragon could happen. Nobody knew what was coming, not even the most ancient wizards. Real liches might have a clue, cause of their endless half-life, but even endless amounts of experience didnt make up for the unknowable nature of existence. Then Soscoa came to a realization: everyone was lost. None of the people around her (even the rangers) really knew which way to turn, including herself.<br>
<br>
She saw a small Vah Shir getting knocked around by the hustle and bustle. He was holding a leather bag with one paw, and wiping his nose with the other. He seemed to be having trouble getting used to the smell of all these different races together... snot ran out of his nostrils quicker than he could keep it off. He looked miserable.<br>
<br>
Usually, Sosoca loved to see things in pain and confusion. It gave her a validation for living. The idea of something in agony because of her was fulfilling, one of the things that made her love her chosen path in life. But this little catboy looking sad and lost made her heart ache. She spoke out into the crowd in broken Vah Shir:<br>
<br>
&quot;You! Boy! Come here, furry.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked surprised, then wary. Maybe he had heard the stories of the dark skinned men who were so condescending and rude. He padded over to her, keeping a healthy distance.<br>
<br>
She pulled a gleaming trinket from her bag, and a jerked bit of Qeynos sewer rat (her snack of choice). She patted the stone next to her, indicating him to sit. He was still wary, but his green gold eyes shone bright with curiosity.<br>
<br>
She ate some of the jerky to show there was no poison, and handed it to him. He snurfed at it, then ate the whole thing in one gulp. She laughed, and began to speak.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see this, dear?&quot;, she said in a low voice. She twirled the thing on the end of its chain, showing off its convoluted lines and spirals of metal. It was gnomish, a device that caught light, stored it, and could spray a rainbow of colors later to show your way. His gaze followed it, marveling at the way it seemed to shift into and out of sight. He nodded that yes, he did see it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you may have it. It may help you sometime. Keep it forever if you like, or sell it in the Bazaar as soon as you are out of sight, it makes no difference to me. I dont need it anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
She handed it over to him, and quickly explained how it worked. He turned it over in his paws, seeming to grasp the idea of something that had one function, but could be used and enjoyed in different ways. As an experiment, he shot a blast of red light into an ogres face that was passing in the crowd.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ruh, Ill kill you for that, you fuzzy runt!&quot;, bellowed the fellow, obviously overreacting to the situation. He pulled a maul from his back, and charged towards the Vah Shir, trampling a few smaller folk along the way. The cat yowled, and leaped from the rock to dash away.<br>
<br>
Sosoca whispered something evil sounding, and pointed her hand at the charging ogre. Her fingers shriveled for a moment, then blackish slime sprayed from wounds that werent really there. The ogre stopped suddenly, looking surprised. He coughed, then coughed again. Then again. Soon, he was rolling on the ground, retching out his last meal. He was no longer bellowing, but gasping for breath. He begged for a shaman, he wanted some water, he needed help... His skin started to go blue from lack of breath. The disease was starting to eat his throat away, and if someone didnt help him soon, the dwarves would be spitting on his corpse as they walked past, and the gnomes and dark elves would be fighting over who got to go through his pockets.<br>
<br>
The Vah Shir child crept back to his place beside her, watching the ogre writhe on the ground a few paces away. He seemed fascinated that the little woman in the robe had taken down such a mighty creature so quickly. She spoke again:<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone is lost, dear. At all times, and at all levels. You dont know if where you are heading is there right now, it could be destroyed. You dont know if your little bag there is going to be stolen by a light fingered wood elf on the way. You dont know if your parents are going to be there for you when you return. The same goes for me. Ive been wandering all my life... maybe if I had true faith in Cazic Thule, I would feel better about whats happening. Maybe if I had a clear idea of what I want to do with my life and the means to make it happen, I wouldnt feel so bad. But I dont, so here I am.<br>
<br>
&quot;Being lost is a terrible thing, but we all endure it every day. I just want you to know that: you dont know whats going to happen next. Take your time. Enjoy the worlds around you. Love someone. Have faith. Be kind to those who need it, and deliver justice to those who you deem deserve it. The confusion and sorrow of being lost cant be helped with money and power. Your people singing songs about your exploits after you die wont help you be a better person now.&quot;<br>
<br>
She indicated the trinket, which he held close to his chest now.<br>
<br>
&quot;That thing has lit my way in the caves of Kunark, the watery graveyards of Velious, and the dark plains of Luclin here. Its been a great help... something that kept me not be so lost. But now I realize that I am still lost, and I want you to have it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The ogre hadnt been able to get anyones attention in time, and was in the process of expiring right in front of them. People were busy with their own things... Too busy to help a stupid jack's ass who had bitten off more than he could chew.<br>
<br>
A troll tripped over him, and crashed down on the other side. She got up, brushed herself off, and pulled her spear to skewer the annoyance. Looking down, she seemed to recognize the choking ogre.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rurrak! You dumby! Whats wrong with you?&quot;<br>
<br>
She chanted something quickly, and Sosoca could see an icy wind stir her hair, could hear unseen spirits of health and violence and life and death howling behind her words. She threw a little yellow powder on the ogre, who was slowing down on the coughing.<br>
<br>
He stood up shakily, and vomited a huge amount of blood onto his feet. Sosoca giggled at his pain, but he didnt notice. He thanked the troll, who still seemed annoyed that she had to use some dried frog intestine on him, and leaned on her as she walked. He gave Sosoca one fearful look over his shoulder... she moved her hands quickly to create an illusion, and winked at him with glowing yellow eyes, red smoke pouring out of her mouth and nose. He jerked his head around and shuffled along a little faster in the opposite direction.<br>
<br>
&quot;Okay my boy, go along towards your errand. Hold on, lets do something about your nose...&quot;<br>
<br>
She recited something pleasant sounding, like chimes in words he couldnt understand. His sinuses cleared up immediately, and he took a big breath in through his nose. He pawed her hands, licking her tattooed face and filthy dreadlocks in thanks. He tied the light source around his neck by its chain, and bowed deeply to her, growling something in his language. He bounded off into the crowd, not looking quite so lost anymore...<br>
<br>
The plate of stewed erudite flesh clanked down onto the table, and Sosoca let out a little sound of fright at being snapped back into reality. She looked up at the skeleton waiter, irked at being spooked so easily.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she hissed at him, waving him away at the same time.<br>
<br>
She ate slowly with her hands, drank too much directly out of the bottle. She kept looking at the smoke mephits dancing and writhing in the fire, thinking about how lost she felt. Maybe she would find some guidance in The Abbatoir... She would visit after she ate, it was right across the way. They always preached Cazic at her, because she had a reputation for blasphemy and arrogance. But she still appreciated a little guidance from the real leader of Paineel, the high necromancer. After that, she would stop in at the Poison Petal for some supplies, then back out into the outside world, away from her beloved rain and glass and plants and familiar faces that made up Paineel.<br>
<br>
At least she knew what she was doing next.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
