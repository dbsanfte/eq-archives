----------<br>
<br>
So like you're probably wondering how I became a Shadow Knight in the service of Innoruuk, the Father of like Hate.<br>
<br>
I guess it like goes back to my parents, y'know? My dad was like this Monk of the Ashen Order, and they like serve Quellious the Tranquil. Only my dad wasn't one of those Monks who like kicked ass. He spent all his time like meditating and stuff. He was like this total pacifist who would never raise even like a finger in violence, even to defend himself or his family. And he'd only eat like vegetables and fruits and stuff, because he said it was too violent to even like kill animals for food! Like I am SO SURE!<br>
<br>
Mom wasn't much better, either. She was like a Cleric of Erollisi Marr, and she was like a COMPLETE flake. I mean, like the constant talk about &quot;love this&quot; and &quot;love that&quot; was like RILLY bogus and annoying, but there was like more to it than just that, y'know? It was like my mom never had like a logical thought in her life, y'know? She just like totally operated on impulse and emotion, and like never rilly thought things through. So like she was always buying these bogus charms from like these huckster merchants that would come to Freeport for like the trade fairs, and she'd totally believe you if you told her you had like a new cure for colds or backaches or whatever, even though it was like TOTALLY obvious that the &quot;cures&quot; were like completely bogus. And she was always visiting like these fortune tellers and stuff, and like making my family live their lives according to these totally vague &quot;prophecies&quot; that would like apply to ANYBODY if you like thought hard enough about it.<br>
<br>
But like when I was a kid, I totally didn't realize any of this. I was like &quot;This is cool, and mom and dad like love me and stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
As if.<br>
<br>
As I got like older, though, I totally began to see what losers my parents were. First off, my name is like totally bogus. &quot;Starflower.&quot; It like just reeks of like peace and love and like cosmic forces and stuff, like my parents are all into. But I like came out TOTALLY lucky. My sister's name was like &quot;Softnote.&quot; And my brother's name is like &quot;Rainbow.&quot; Like omigod! Like gag me big time! Can you like imagine going through life as like a guy with a name like &quot;Rainbow?&quot;<br>
<br>
I never really thought much about my name, though, 'cause it's like what I grew up with, y'know? But as my brother got older, he was like TOTALLY picked on and made fun of by the other kids. And our loser parents like totally never did anything. My dad just like meditated and told my brother that he was like totally better than the other kids, even if they like beat the crap out of him and like stole his toys, and that it would be like wrong to fight back. And my mom was all like &quot;You should show them love, Rainbow! Love them and they'll love you back!&quot; Like I am SO SURE that's gonna work. I mean, like give me a break! Like totally!<br>
<br>
So one day I was like walking back from the market when I saw these assholes totally kicking my brother's ass. I was like 13 at the time, and he was like 8. And I like just totally saw red, and I ran over and like kicked THEIR asses instead. My brother was like totally happy, because it was like the first time ever in his life that anybody had stood up for him. But when my parents found out, they were like TOTALLY pissed! My dad like totally yelled at me and I was like grounded for a month! And I was all like &quot;OMIGOD! I'm getting grounded because I like took up for my little brother?!? Like how totally bogus is that?&quot;<br>
<br>
And that was like just the start. After that little incident, my dad was like mortified and like totally ashamed to be seen in the guildhouse of the Ashen Order. And I like TOTALLY don't know why, because I've seen Ashen Order monks like totally kick ass. But he was like on a personal crusade to get the Ashen Order monks to abandon their martial arts stuff and turn completely over to like vegetarianism and like meditation and stuff. Like gag me. <br>
<br>
Anyhow, since he figured he couldn't show his face in the Ashen Order guildhouse, he decided that we'd move to Qeynos, where he would try to convert the &quot;godless heathen monks&quot; of the Silent Fist Clan into followers of Quellious. So we like packed up all our stuff and moved like ALL the way across Antonica to that dump Qeynos. I mean talk about being out on like the ass end of the world! Freeport is like this huge hub of activity, and Qeynos is like SUCH a bumpkin town. So I was like being torn away from all my friends, and my brother and sister were being torn away from THEIR friends, all so my lame-o dad could preach his particular brand of peace to the monks of Qeynos.<br>
<br>
So we get to Qeynos, and like it's this TOTAL hole. The schools like totally sucked, and like there was NOTHING to do. I swear they like totally roll up the sidewalks of Qeynos at night! And I like totally hated it there, and so did like my brother and sister.<br>
<br>
But dad wasn't swayed, and mom was like &quot;I'll stick by your father through thick and thin! He's the man of the house after all!&quot; Like totally grow a spine, mom, y'know? So dad started preaching, and like made a few converts, but not many. Basically, he was that Weirdo Dude from Freeport, y'know? The one who like prayed and meditated and like didn't eat meat or fight or anything (and let me tell you, the Barbarians were like TOTALLY confused by that whole &quot;Don't eat meat or drink alcohol or fight&quot; bit). Everybody except for like the 5 converts he got thought my dad was like a total loon.<br>
<br>
And of COURSE, my mom is going around looking for like fortune tellers and like charms and stuff. And she found these farmers who were like complete retards, but who would make her like these talismans and charms and stuff to keep away evil spirts. So while my dad was out getting a reputation for being like a total loon, my mom was out getting a reputation for also being like a total loon. And naturally, me and my brother and sister were like the &quot;Children of the Loons,&quot; which like RILLY made our lives Hell. Like for the first time ever, people made fun of me for MY name, which like totally pissed me off. It got to where I had to like walk home from school with my brother and sister, so they wouldn't get like beat up on. The kids my age tried to like kick my ass, but I totally wiped the ground with 'em. And I'd learned my lesson in like Freeport, so I didn't tell my parents about that bit at ALL.<br>
<br>
But word like gets around, y'know? And one day when I was like 17, I got home from school after like defending myself for like the umpteenth time, and my parents are like totally pissed. Someone had told 'em about me defending myself in school and stuff, and they were like TOTALLY bent out of shape about it. And they were all like lecturing me and stuff about all this peace and love and understanding stuff, and it was like total crap! And like for the first time in my life I was like SO MAD at my parents! I couldn't BELIEVE that they would stand there and like tell me that I should like &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; and &quot;the soft answer turneth away wrath&quot; and all this other BS! I mean it's like one thing if you don't wanna defend YOURSELF against someone who's trying to beat you into a pulp. But it's like totally another thing when your parents won't defend their own kids!<br>
<br>
So I like totally flew into this rage, and I like totally yelled and screamed and told 'em what losers they were for not defending their own family, and for being such total &quot;peace, love and understanding&quot; freaks! And they just like blinked at me and walked out of the room.<br>
<br>
I totally cried myself to sleep that night.<br>
<br>
And then I woke up in the middle of the night and discovered that I'd been like tied to my bed. My parents were there. And there was like this pig-faced little inbred farmer's wife -- the one who made like the charms and talismans and stuff for my mom. And she was saying how I'd been like &quot;possessed by a demon&quot; and stuff, and she was telling my dad how they'd have to like cut some notches in my head to like let the demons out. And my mom was all like crying and stuff, and she like started to shave my head even though I was trying to tell her that I like totally wasn't possessed! And I struggled and tried to get loose, but like I was TOTALLY tied down and couldn't move. So I like wiggled my head a lot, trying to keep them from like doing anything, and like my OWN DAD came over and like held my head really tightly so I couldn't move! And I was crying, and I was like SO scared!<br>
<br>
But then my brother and sister came in to the room, all like yelling and screaming that the house was like on fire and stuff. So my mom and my dad like ran off to investigate, leaving me there with my brother and sister and like this inbred farmer chick. And like as soon as my dad and mom were gone, my sister like totally beaned the inbred farmer chick upside the head with like this big candlestick. And my brother like cut the ropes that were tying me to the bed.<br>
<br>
As soon as I was free I TOTALLY jumped out the window. And then I turned around to like grab my brother and sister, but my parents had come back into the room and like grabbed my brother and sister before they could like come with me. So I ran off and like totally hid in the Qeynos sewers.<br>
<br>
My plan was to like wait for another night to like grab my brother and sister, and then we were gonna all like run away to Freeport. But that never happened. Because when my sister like creamed the farmer woman with the candlestick...she killed her. And that loser dad of mine like TURNED IN HIS OWN DAUGHTER TO THE GUARDS! He said she had like violated the tenets of Quellious the Tranquil, and should suffer the consequences. And when my sister was on trial, my dad like testified AGAINST her! And said that she should be punished like an adult for her crime.<br>
<br>
So my sister, at like the age of 15, was hanged for like the crime of murder. And my dad, who might as well have put the noose around her neck himself, stood there and watched her die.<br>
<br>
Well, this made my mom like totally snap. She became like a complete head case, and she'd like talk to herself, or she'd talk to my sister (who wasn't there), or she'd like talk to me (and I wasn't there either, although I heard about it later). And about a month after my sister dropped through the trapdoor, my mom decided that it was all my brother's fault, because he was like possessed by demons like his big sister (me) was supposed to have been possessed. So at the age of 12, my brother was tied down to the bed (like I was), and my mom like drilled these big holes into his head with an awl. It like didn't kill him. I totally wish it would have. Someday I'll go back to Qeynos and put him out of his misery, 'cause he's like this total vegetable now.<br>
<br>
After that happened, I like totally had no reason to stay in Qeynos.<br>
<br>
My parents had like given up on finding me, so I like snuck out of Qeynos one night and started heading east. I'd like steal bread or pies from the windows of farm houses, and I'd like drink from streams and stuff. And eventually I made my way to like Highpass Hold, where I like hooked up with these Dark Elf merchants who were like very quiet and somber, but needed a strong hand to help 'em with like their loading and stuff. And on the way to Freeport (for that's where they were heading) they like taught me the VERY basics of like how to use a sword, in case we were like attacked by bandits.<br>
<br>
And when I got to Freeport, I like totally kicked around like a bum. I was like aimless and driftless. I took a job at like this inn in East Freeport, and tried to like forget about my past. And one day I was like in the basement of the inn, looking for some stuff, when I like discovered this secret wall that led into like these catacombs under Freeport. After spending so much time in like the Qeynos sewers, the Freeport sewers didn't really like scare me or anything, so I went exploring.<br>
<br>
And that's where I like found the Dismal Rage.<br>
<br>
I guess they like sensed something inside of me -- sensed the TOTAL hate I have for those messed-up loser parents of mine who like totally ruined my life and the lives of my brother and sister. Because they totally welcomed me. And they like sat me down and told me about the Father of Hate, and how He's going to like totally kick everybody's ass some day, and how I should like follow Him if I want to like be on the winning side. And it all like felt so TOTALLY right inside me when I thought about it.<br>
<br>
So I like joined up with the Dismal Rage, and became a Shadow Knight, and like I've never looked back.<br>
<br>
And someday, I'll meet up with my parents again. And all the peace and love and understanding in the world will be like totally NO help for what I have in mind... <br>

Well, I didn't score any killer loot. But like the priests in Neriak were all like rilly down on me, I guess 'cause I'm like human.

And there's like these skeletons too, which is like totally cool 'cause I can like score bone chips for the day when I get my spells and stuff. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ustarflowersk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starflower SK</A> at: 8/14/02 12:32:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ustarflowersk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starflower SK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/14/02 12:33:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Starflower Valleygirl, Shadowknight of Innoruuk</span><hr size=1> I just scored a bitchin' bronze scythe from these goody-goody losers who were hunting and killing spectres in the Oasis of Marr.

But when it wears off it's like totally this huge downer, and I just feel like all weak and powerless and...and...and IT JUST SUCKS, OKAY?!?<br>

And it's SO cool that they don't like give me lip or anything when I tell 'em to do stuff.<br>

Anyhow, with my new spells and my new skeleton buddies, we totally rule. Running up and down in the West Commonlands killing like pumas and skeletons and stuff. Even got a few licks in on those young kodiak bears! But the best part -- I mean like TOTALLY the best part of all -- was going into the Nektulos Forest and wasting those half-pint halflings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ustarflowersk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starflower SK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/17/02 12:10:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Starflower Valleygirl, Shadowknight of Innoruuk</span><hr size=1> Rank 10: Innoruuk must like be totally watching over me, 'cause I'm having like totally good luck scoring cash.
