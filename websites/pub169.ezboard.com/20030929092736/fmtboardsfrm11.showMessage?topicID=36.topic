<br>
A tired smile fell upon the rugged face of the dwarf priest.  He hadn't seen the majesty of the Butcherblock in years.  Now, there they were, as royal as ever as they penetrated the sky.  Soon he would be back in the tunnels that was his home.  <br>
<br>
His time for adventure was over.<br>
<br>
He wore the scars of battle.  His face scarred, an eye completely blind and without vision, a slight limp.  His worst wound though, was that in his heart.  His last battle with the God of Hate himself, Innoruk, left a hole in his heart.  Innoruk, knowing Drackore was leading an army for their final battle, managed to weave a spell that left most of Drackore's closest and dearest friends in a pile of ash, beyond any aid that the priest could do.  Drackore and the remaining fighters proceeded to defeat Innoruk once again, but Drackore had changed.  Looking upon the corpse of Innoruk, Drackore summoned all the power that Brell would bestow upon him, and obliterated the corpse of the God.  <br>
<br>
Drackore and his allies proceeded to tear down the city of Hate, and when leaving, all that could be heard was the pained cries of the remaining followers of Innoruk - screaming in torment as the remnants of their stronghold burned to the ground.<br>
<br>
<br>
Drackore was finished.  He bode farewell to his friends in the Valhalla legions, and has returned home.<br>
<br>
Drackore bagged his holy Water Sprinkler and began to walk towards the tunnel in the mountain.  That's when the skies turned blood red.  Skeletons that roamed just outside the hallowed city Drackore called home grew larger, meaner, stronger.  The earth itself opened up beneath his feet, causing him to tumble to the ground.<br>
<br>
Innoruk appeared before him, bellowing in laughter.  The skeletons siezed Drackore and before Drackore could summon any aid, found himself bound in Innoruks magical web.  Besides Innoruk was a young Troll, one that had obviously spent his entire life tortured by the evil god.  Innoruk drew a dagger and piereced the forehead of the troll, drawing blood.  Gathering the blood upon the dagger, Innoruk approached Drackore.  Never a word was spoken, as Innoruk plunged the dagger through Drackore's chest - then disappeared.  The troll, collapsing lifelessly to the ground.<br>
<br>
Drackore could only lie there, bound and stunned.  Suddenly his body began convulse, his remain eye's sight started to blur and fade, his thoughts went from fear to anger - increidble and fierce anger.  Drackore never felt such anger, such.....hate.  Just as soon as it started, it stopped.  Drackore's corpse fell limp.<br>
<br>
Some hours went by before Drackore opened his eyes.  His head was heavy from what felt like a hangover due to drinking too much dwarven ale.  He sat up, and fell over.  Not from dizziness, but almost from lack of dexterity.  He sat up again, more carefully and focused his vision.  What he saw  made him gasp for the first time in his life.  Before him, he saw himself.  Actually he saw his corpse.  He began to look at his hands and arms.  They were scaley, cracked, and green.<br>
<br>
He stood up, only to find he was much taller then he was accustomed to and hit his head on a tree branch.<br>
<br>
&quot;For the love of Brell what did that fiend do to me?!?&quot;<br>
<br>
It all came back to him.  Innoruk placed Drackore's soul in the body of a troll. <br>
<br>
After hours of gathering himself, he reached for his bag.  If he could use the Water Sprinker of Ankh on his corpse and resurrect it, maybe his soul would go back to it's rightful place.  However as he reached inside, the Water Sprinkler emitted a painful charge of electricity and fell to the ground.<br>
<br>
With this new situation, he proceeded to the docks.  There he would board a ship and formulate a plan as to what he would do next.  As he walked through the woods, a small goblin began to taunt him.  When the goblin tripped him, he fell with a thud.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't be so sour, ugly troll.  Get up and get revenge, if you can catch me&quot;<br>
<br>
Drackore stood and delevered a punch to the goblin's stomach, causing the goblin to break in two and fall to the ground.  Drackore took the coin and a rusty sword from the goblin's possession.  As he approached the docks, a guard halted him and asked his name.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sourr...Sourr Reevenj&quot;  <br>
<br>
With only Innoruk on his mind...revenge would indeed be sour. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daocsucks>Daoc Sucks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/3/03 5:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> kick ass story man! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=36.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=36.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=36.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.threadControl?topicID=36.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=36.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=36.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm43">Retirement Center<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11>Roleplay</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
