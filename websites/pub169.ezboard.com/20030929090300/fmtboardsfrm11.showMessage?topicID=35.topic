The small bit of wood didnt reply, at least not in a way Tippu could hear.<br>
<br>
Tippu considered himself a realist. He held something in his hand, and it was what it was. There was no doubt... a sword could cut someone who disagreed in half, a pen could write a poem, a piece of fruit could be eaten. He knew swordsmen and poets and farmers, but he didnt think they only thought of those things in those terms... They became something more, because of their importance to the people who used them.<br>
<br>
But Tippu didnt have anything like that. The only material things he had any attachment to was his whip, and his book. And even then, if he lost one of them, he could always make another. <br>
<br>
Tippu Tib was a slaver, and one of the most important tools of the trade was the whip. A good whip could be a motivation, just being wound on your hip. A new recruit (as he called them) would see it, and realize what it was, but still step out of line. Generally, at least while in Tippus care, they only made that mistake once. After that first experience, they never wanted to see it unwound again. People who didnt sell fast usually got a chance to see it in action a couple times in the few months Tippu would keep them, and averted their eyes when he took it from its clasp.<br>
<br>
It was a good custom job, and he had paid a leatherworker in Paineel over four thousand platinum for it. Twenty feet long, and roughly ten pounds, it was really too large for his small dark elf frame, but he made due. The first few months of owning it hurt his shoulder and arm, but eventually his joints tightened up and some more muscle mass appeared, and now he could snap the head off a snake at fifteen feet with just a slight shrug and a flick of his wrist. It was made from the hide of Nightmares, the procurement of said skin being an adventure in itself. He commissioned a ebonywood handle that fit his hand, with many ornate carvings of a northern fashion (Tippu having an appreciation of Barbaric culture and design). The length was almost uniform, until the last five feet or so. It tapered a little, then split off into five different ends, or snaps. Each one had a different piece of Goblin forged iron sewn in, and each bit of metal was a stylized relief  of a different Goblin god or goddess, all spikes and hooks and bladed swirls. He had accidentally cut a halflings throat with it, only intending to get him in the chest. The hobbit had ducked a little when he saw Tippu rearing back, and one of the metal shards tore his throat out. The bloodstain took two slaves two days to clean out of the Erudian rug the halfing had been standing on at the time.<br>
<br>
Tippu loved and took care of his whip, and it became a symbol of his tyranny and evil to the unfortunate fellows who came into his care. He was a middle man in the slave trading world, but he liked to think that the slaves feared him more than their capturers, or their eventual masters. But to him, the whip was a whip. It didnt mean anything more to him, it was just a good tool that he enjoyed using, and that was it.<br>
<br>
But when he thought about it, the book really might mean something beyond what it was. The book had been a work in progress ever since he had killed his first man...<br>
<br>
It was a barfight in Neriak. Tippu had been drinking fish wine or whatever had been fashionable at the time, and was trying to catch the eye of a black eyed beauty on the other end of the bar. Eventually, he had asked the barkeep to send her a drink, his treat. She took the drink and nodded to him, but the young dark elf next to her hadnt appreciated the gesture as much as she. He stood up, and walked straight to Tippu, a bad look in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Look here, I will not have this insult. I call match, and if youre not a coward, youll accept my offer,&quot; said the dark elf, puffing his chest out. Tippu had met these types before, but had never been on the receiving end of their trouble. He was interested in how it would pan out.<br>
<br>
&quot;I meant no harm, friend. I was merely sending a pretty young lady a bit of wine. No harm, no harm. How about I buy you a drink?&quot; Tippu laid out a few more gold, and watched the mans face carefully for a reaction.<br>
<br>
The elf looked down at the money, and spit on it. His feelings about the matter were apparent, and Tippu shifted his weight a little to free up his right side.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, then. I guess Ill have to call match with you, my new friend. Where will you have it? Outside in the Nektulos, or in the alley behind this fine establishment?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Right here, on this spot. My honor will not tolerate the breath in your lungs any longer!&quot; The elf pulled his sword, a Lamentation from the looks of it. But even before the tip had left its scabbard, he was dead.<br>
<br>
Tippu had been hiding a stiletto under his hand the entire time, and in a blur of metal armor and blue skin, it had become embedded in his adversarys throat to the hilt. Those who had been watching the altercation gasped, and watched with voyeuristic glee as the elf dropped to his knees, clawing at his throat. The sword clanged onto the wood floor at his side, forgotten.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hak! Surgh-ang rrr-sssssss,&quot; he gurgled, and then it no words came, just the last flow of blood from his mouth. He feel onto his side, and seemed to try to focus on Tippus boots before dying. All of this was watched with great fascination by the patrons, but the greatest interest came from Tippu himself.<br>
<br>
Later on, he wondered what the man had been trying to say. His throat had been cut, which of course would make clear articulation troublesome, but Tippu was very curious as to what the last words the man would ever say were supposed to be. <br>
<br>
This all happened when he was a young man, just starting to choose his lot in life. Becoming a slaver gave him audience to many things, the death of men and women being one of them. He always tried to listen well at the very last moment. Sometimes people died too quickly to ever get anything out, as in the battle field. A iron star to the back of the skull killed quickly, and there was no chance. But he had seen hundreds of people die, the causes being everything from disease to magic to evisceration, and when that happened, people usually had something to say.<br>
<br>
The book was full of last words. It looked like a normal book on the outside, plain brown leather with cream colored pages, but the insides were just entries:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;I refuse to feel regret for anything Ive done.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
~ Thoriss Hilvershade, disease, 3490<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Please tell my family I love them. Please take care of them for me, Harrick.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
~ 'Guim', to his brother, stab wound, 3492<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Innoruuk! Take me, please! I can bear no more, please... please let me die.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
~ Jafa Qi`Mim, magical poisoning, 3497<br>
<br>
And so on. Over a hundred entries... Tippu collected them as a man may collect coins, or silk tapestries. He read and reread them, trying to find something beyond the words themselves. <br>
<br>
He supposed he was looking for meaning in life in them, a final realization before death shedding light on what the point of it all was. About most things, he said &quot;This is this.&quot;... but about his recordings of final statements, he thought there might be something more, something he couldnt see. Maybe if he got enough of them, he would find the connection. He might be able to see what the justification of the gods were, what the reason is for watching us dance on lifes stage, eating and sleeping and crying and laughing and loving and killing and dying.<br>
<br>
Tippu was a man who owned men, and was feared and respected in his profession. He <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>made</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> men dance on his own little lifes stage, but he couldnt see a real reason behind it... he supposed it was just sadistic tendencies coming out, or a issue of asserting power over another being. This disgusted him, this facet of his personality, but he enjoyed their weary movements and the tearful, screaming goodbyes of mothers whos children are being sold. He had freed people, as well, and enjoyed the look of surprise and unbelievable thanks on their faces as he opened the back of his cage-wagon, some random, desolate spot in the wilderness, and winked to them. They took off to have the best nights sleep of their lives, and he appreciated them for how they made him feel as they ran.<br>
<br>
But all of this didnt really give him even a slight idea of what the meaning of life was. The only thing that he thought could really show him was his book, if he could figure out the pattern, or find the hole in the words that let him through to the other side of the paper and ink, to see what there was at the end of life. His book filled slowly, on and on...<br>
<br>
So he had his whip, and his book. These things were his, and they were what they were. Nothing special to them, no anthropomorphication in his mind, no symbolism. He lived by them, and he supposed a few people had died because of them.<br>
<br>
Tippu Tib sat at the front of his cage-wagon, listening to the wood elf weep her sorrow into the night. He wanted to know what she would cry out right before she died. He fought off a desire to pull over, yank her out of the back, and hold a knife to her throat, just to see what she would say... But she had cost too much and would sell for even more to his contact. He had a business to run, and he wouldnt ruin himself for his silly book.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quiet back there, or Ill be moved to use the whip!&quot; he yelled in a gruff voice he used just for the slaves. She whimpered and fell silent once again... perhaps she was holding the little idol to her chest, praying in her mind.<br>
<br>
He stared out into the black hole of the forest in front of him, over his horses head. The road went along slowly, and the night was warm. He knew where he was, where he was going, and what he was doing. This is this, so to speak.<br>
<br>
His favorite entry ran through his mind:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Everything is gone, and what we can see is nothing that we can know.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
~ Sallisa Belouchiia, suicide, 4011<br>
<br>
Tippu wondered what hed say right before he died, and if anyone would write it down in his book for him.<br>
