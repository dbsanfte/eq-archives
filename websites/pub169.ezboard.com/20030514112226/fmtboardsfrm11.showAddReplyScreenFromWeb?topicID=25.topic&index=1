<br>
In the cold halls of Permafrost did Nathomin take Malaehi, and they spoke of soft touches and feelings that burned in their minds as well as their bodies.<br>
<br>
In the cold halls of the Dragon did Nathomin take The High Elf Malaehi, and introduced her to the world of passion between men and woman. It was not painless, and Nathomin had not thought to tell her of the pains that could come of this thing.<br>
<br>
So much did they share... So much did they learn together, of eachother... But when it was done, still more questions did she ask... And those he could not answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What am I to do now? What do I do now that I have broken my most sacred oath for you?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi stared at the Tier'Dal rogue with tears in her eyes, and Nathomin could not answer... He did not know.<br>
<br>
He wanted to tell her that every thing would be well, that her goddess would understand and aprove, but he did not know.<br>
He would not lie to her and say he did. He wanted to tell her that she would now be fulfilled. But he knew that every moment she was with someone it could very well be filled with a yearning... and that hunger would never go away.<br>
<br>
They left the cold halls and went to find shelter from the winds of the frozen lands of the Barbarians... In a lone tower they sat and spoke more, He felt something that he had not felt before, He had been with two other woman before, and this... this was something new. He had felt passion before, but this..... What was this that was gripping his heart to see tears in her eyes?<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Why Nathomin?! Why did you do this to me?!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;  Her face turned down in anger, she stood and turned her back to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What can you give me to replace what you have taken?<br>
Words? Empty words and ...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
She placed her pale hand on her belly, so recently he had filled her, and now she felt so very empty inside.. Just an hour ago he had thrilled her with his touch, Now her skin felt only cold and tired ...and sore.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WHY?!?!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi turned to face Nathomin, anger and feelings of betrayal spilling forth from her eyes mixing with the tears that trickled down her face and hung on her fine jaw. Nathomin ached to kiss them from her face, to take away her pain. But when he stepped forward to take her in his arms she backed away like a feral thing, fear and hurt enveloped her, His eyes fell to the floor as his arms dropped to his sides limply.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I wanted to give you.... to show you what LOVE can be when you know passion... I wanted you to have this, to be able to understand ....</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>UNDERSTAND!!!! Understand... Do you even understand what you have DONE!?! What you have TAKEN from me...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi turned away again and looked up into the cold distance of the Everfrost sky and wept.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Oh goddess, ... forgive me...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin looked up and his breath caught in his throat. She stood there, a silhouett of beauty against the white snow clad hills... His heart jumped in his chest and he took a step forward again, only to stop dead still as he watched her body stiffen at his approach.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You have taken from me thief... You have taken something you can NEVER replace..</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Her hands clenched at her sides and Nathomin's mind cried out to beg her forgiveness.. but his mouth could not move.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You have taken what was not yours to take, what was not mine to give.. and you have given me what in return thief?!!...<br>
<br>
No, Do not speak... Think on this as you make camp Nathomin.<br>
Think on what you have done as you wash the blood of my innocence from your flesh.. and know that you cannot undo what you have done...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi stepped out of the tower into the Everfrost night leaving the rogue to his thoughts... and the cold howling of the winds. The silent howling of his mind and heart...<br>
<br>
Nathomin stood in the doorway of the tower for long hours. Time passed and he stood like a statue. The sun crested the horizon and still he stood there.. his eyes did not see the land awaken, his ears did not hear the calls of the hunters as they cried out their victories, and their battle cries to the Tribunal...<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Xas Sun-runner.. My dear Sun-runner. I have taken from you and for this, I will not forgive myself.. If you never forgive me, then I will understand... But what is this you have taken from me?... Why does my heart ache so? Why do I feel like this when I have never... even when my first lover went into the halls of madness and left me to wander alone... Not even then did I feel like this...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
The snow began to fall outside the land gaining another cloak of ice hideing the soil below it under another layer of blindeing white.<br>
<br>
The rogue looked up into the grey sky seeking something... Solice? Forgiveness?.. He knew not which. From his lips came words spoken for one he knew little of. Words for a Goddess whome he had taken from.. A prayor for a woman he had wronged.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I have taken from your servant Erolissi... I have taken from you, and I ask forgiveness.. Guide her Goddess.. Show her that she is still your child, and that even such as I....</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin breathed out a sigh of frustration, These words did not come easy from lips that had only spoken hate for so long.<br>
<br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can even I know your grace Goddess of Love? Can even one born of shadows and hate... Is this what I am feeling now under this cold and forsaken sky?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin sat there as the snow was driven up into the doorway, and Nathomin closed his eyes holding in the pain that he felt growing in his chest. Holding in the one thing he knew he had given to his Sun-runner. His.... Love.<br>
