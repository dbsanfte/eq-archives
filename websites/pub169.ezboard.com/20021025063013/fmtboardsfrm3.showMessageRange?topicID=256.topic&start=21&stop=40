*shrug* I didnt know it was biased to remain neutral on an issue. <br>

Really, this post isnt even about the sunmina situation, people just turned it into that. I was making a commentary on words and how they affect people, I was stating my opinion, which Im pretty sure is my right.

<br>
My whole bias argument I'll admit may be splitting hairs but see it from my viewpoint. There was no such tolerence post when the Rustem thing went down. There is a reasonable argument to be made here that although you may have thought the same at the time you may not have posted it because Sunmina and Fe was/is your friends.<br>
<br>
I dunno, perhaps I  am off base here, I will admit that.

But really, I didnt comment on the rustem stuff because I didnt care, didnt bother me. Nor do child molestation references.

   Brytar, this was uncalled for.   Honestly, you should ask for Sunmina's forgiveness for this statement even if she is being a total witch.<br>
<br>
 True, Sunmina's comments to Drackore were wrong and it should be obvious that she is touching on what should be a personal issue for him, in much the same way Rustem did to her.    <br>

Everyone.  Freaking stop!<br>
<br>
First off, Sunmina, your sarcasm is bested only by your ability to get a dead cat to lick the crabs out of your crotch.<br>
<br>
Next off....this is between me and it.  Yes the comments were gross, disgusting, horrid.  I made my reply in the It wants to be a moderator thread.  Go read it there.<br>
<br>
Attacking her location, her sister, etc is no better then her comments.<br>
<br>
Rustem, while I completely disagreed with his radical views, NEVER came close to the level of maggot crap that it posted.<br>
<br>
Why on EARTH did someone take it to the FE board?  The same board that IT asked it's inept whipped forum-op to edit my hello post to &quot;loving sheep&quot;.  You really think they give a damn over there?  A punk is a punk is a punk.  Pot meet kettle?  Not in this case.<br>
<br>
This isn't me vs FE.  What FE does is what FE does.  This isn't even Drackore the Cleric in EQ vs IT the Enchanter in EQ.  This is Drackore the mt.com troll vs IT, the crablice queen of Tel Aviv.<br>
<br>
*I* personally apologize to everyone here for bringing IT to the level it felt it needed to go to make that post.  It was my original post welcoming back a pair of it's that brought it to post that.  Moonleaf and everyone else, I love ya dearly.<br>
<br>
Now let it go.  If IT was banned, I sincerely request it's unbanning.  I want it to come here and post freely as I think I need say nothing to continue to make it look any worse.<br>
<br>
Cann, I see yer point.  Many wars were fought over words.  *I* know how I treat my child, thus while what it said did anger me, it wasn't necessarily because it was directed towards me and my son, but because it involved a child in general.<br>

We might as well skip forum rules altogether.<br>
<br>
People saying that these are just words are either so jaded that it's plain scary or just lying because acting callous is all the rage.<br>
<br>
Try to understand this; 99% of rant personal attacks are fabricated because the ranter doesn't know a lot of RL detail about the rantee. He can call them anything, and that's what ranters are accustomed to. Yes, rants seem out of control but there are a lot of unwritten rules involved.<br>
<br>
Arguments within family or friends can become especially nasty because they have access to personal info and know their weak spots. On the internet strangers can accumulate such info if they are readily available because it is still an expressive medium.<br>
<br>
Furthering our train of thought a griefer (which is what Sunmina seems to be) can decide from that info (which she doesn't hesitate to use to her advantage although a less...what the heck..evil person would consider out-of-bounds) what causes someone the most hurt.<br>
<br>
The scary thing to me is that Sunmina is smart, so you can't really blame her apparent spite on stupidity or attention-getting (debatable), which basically leaves you with simply a person taking joy in hurting someone else using every means even if it means stooping to the gutter.<br>
<br>
Please ban her, it would help her, and it would definitely help this community<br>

Words are the most powerful tool given mankind! With only a few words you can get your fellow man fired from his job; change his life drastically. With only a few more you can put him in jail.<br>
<br>
With the right words you can teach, comfort, enlighten, and inspire him to better the entire world.<br>
<br>
You want proof of the power of a few hastily written words on a message board? Just look at the reaction they caused! Pontificating about the silliness of the reaction doesn't make it go away. It's still there and not getting any better!<br>
<br>
No, my friend. The right words at the right time can do wonders... even on a message board about a game!<br>
<br>
Yeah yeah, I know the title is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ranting anger</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ranting words</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but my point is you can't blame a mob for being lynch-crazy any more than you can blame a dog for wanting to poop on your fresh-mowed lawn.

<br>
words are indeed powerful.  that is why free speech has to be protected.  her words were a very poor choice and i think reflected badly upon her but they did nobody any harm.  the only way these words would have caused drack harm is if she were trying to get people to believe them as truth (considered liable/slander and illegal, albeit complicated by the fact its against a fictional charactar), or if he actually did this in RL (in which case he is a criminal and honestly deserves what he gets).  i seriously doubt he is losing sleep over them.<br>
<br>
there has to be some censorship on these boards however and i understand that.  none of us want to log in to some of that garbage the zek people were posting here, we would simply quit coming.  its a very fine line.<br>

voltair summed it up nicely &quot;I may not agree with what you say, but I shall defend to the death your right to say it.&quot;<br>

Where did you seep out of anyhoo? I notice all of a sudden you're 60 and in DM and are on these boards spitting off your vocal vomit.<br>
