Oh blah blah blah. Yes, I did make myself unpopular on many message boards. I had a problem you see, I took the game too seriously and would analyze every little detail about game balance, and got into arguments often. I acknowledged this in a post a few months ago (my first check up) and offered an appology to anyone who I may have been cross with. <br>
<br>
One thing. Who or what is Litgruv? I really Don't know what you're talking about.<br>
<br>
You take this game way too seriously guy. It's unfortunate not everyone can quit for 8 months and then come back. It really is funny how petty and ridiculous in game and guild disputes are when your mind isnt consumed by the game.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if anyone can please tell me if they have seen the Noonie character running around on MT I would appreciate feedback. I would like to think someone is enjoying it as much as I did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I mean im picturing this lil kid, 17-19 that tortures cats who has a mom and dad that spoiled him too much and he abuses it by being a @#%$ to them no matter how much they reach out and try to help him, Maybe even got to the point where pop said enough and kicked you out cause your disrespecting the house hold. Someone that has no respect for anything or anyone if it doesnt better him personaly or visualy. Has like this tight lil handful of friends that all talk themselves  into believe the world sucks so bad and its all just so wrong so they can justify their lazy,ignorant and intolerant actions to themselves. The type of kid that rolls his sleeves up and smokes cig's to look cool but would piss his pants in the face of any real danger or real life confritation.<br>

The thing is your trying to be so idividual and stand alone as leader of the cynical rebelion here, but your just the board @#%$.

...and no as a matter of fact deuxe, I joined AV months after the board trolls here like drack started having their fun. I knew what I was getting into before I got into it. AV has proven themselves time and time again to me that this is all bullshit. This is one of my reasons for joining AV, another reason would be that the guild of AV doesn't jump on bandwagons of hate like this one the last time I checked, it is just sad.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is when I was &quot;the rest of the server&quot; as you put it, I did not think poorly of AV. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=litgruvmt>LitgruvMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/27/03 12:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1234.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wow am I a dork...</span><hr size=1> &quot;Or maybe he's just calling it the way he (and everyone else on the server who isn't in AV) sees it.&quot;<br>

<br>
Now this is LONG.  However, read this with a clear and open mind.  Cast aside your presumptions and opinions of me.  Don't be sensitive and assume that some things in here are meant as insults.  I tried my best to keep swearing and insults and &quot;pwning tactics&quot; out of this.  This is a true, sincere, and from the heart post.<br>
<br>
Older then 17, never harmed an animal in my life.  Actually, I find animals relaxing.  I went hunting once and got a deer.  Felt like crap for a week.  Can't bring myself to do it again.  I find animals to be defenseless and I would much rather attack people, regardless of how stupid, for the fact that they have a much better chance of defending themselves.  Had a great childhood actually.  Both parents were there, strict upbringing, and the main point:  i was taught common sense!  I was taught how to actually think for myself and to analyze situations and people.  That's why I like to come here.  To analyze people.  This place has the largest concentration of selfish, self centered, ignorant, and completely stupid people I have ever seen...really!  And yes Lit, I place you in that list.  I judge you by how you present yourself here.  You judge me as some bully that tortured cats.  That's fine.  I pick on you for following a twat like Mhalgrim and your zerg band of Captain Craptastic roadies, try to defend or deny or coverup the numerous underhanded f.uckups, then march over to the Raves forum to suckup and try to gain sympathy and forgiveness.<br>
<br>
You are well written.  You show intelligence.  In your posts I read some sort of desire to be considered a fair player and a want to be liked by the community as a whole.  Yet ya continue to wear the tag and be the voicebox for that tag.  It isn't working very well.  <br>
<br>
Life is full of surprises.  From the way I read your posts, I will voice my assumption that YOU are far better then what AV obviously deserves.  I would bet that Rev or Triune or hell maybe FE would give you a shot.  When I saw Legoleaf was part of AV, I was shocked.  I kinda though Lego was better then that...but like I said:  Life is full of surprises.<br>
<br>
So to answer your post as to why I come here and lead my little uprising?  Simple.  I wasn't a holy saint in game.  I made some mistakes, nothing like ganking raid targets or ks'ing high profile mobs.  I was part of a duo once and the guy that was tanking KSed someone's mob.  I made reparations as best I could and apologized and made sure I wasn't part of something like that again.  Go through all the rants and find any rant about me that is EQ based.  When I was in Titan Lords, Desperate Measures, and LoV, find some about those guilds.  DM had one real rant about one of it's members.  LoV had some rants about some folks after I left.  All three had a few bad apples, but the leaders and officers dealt with them and dealt with the community to resolve the issues.  I wouldn't put MY reputation down the toilet.  If they didn't deal with the issues, I wouldn't have joined or stayed with them as long as I did.  I left TL to join DM because most of TL was heading that way or to FE anyways.  I left DM because of disagreements with the leadership and LoV was a better timezone guild for me anyways.  Drack left LoV when he left the game.  If I kept Drack, I'd still be in LoV today probably (unless Aknok kicked me out because he and i always argued, but that was just so much fun! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
I played on other servers.  When AV was nothing and TW was the crap guild, even then MT was probably the nicest server to play on.  The general population was kind, curteous, and fun to be around.  I see that declining a small bit (not in any ghetto nose dive sort of way).  I see AV as being a large part of that.  A lot of people don't trust you because of the tag.  A lot of people wear that tag.  Again and again you pull stunts like these to cause more people to not trust you.  You guys get mad at the backlash and lash out more it seems.  <br>
<br>
To be honest, I don't think AV can recover from this.  I think the month of October has seen AV leaders etch in stone a permanant reputation for being cheaters, theives, and backstabbers.  I think individual members can recover by leaving and heading towards more &quot;reputable&quot; guilds or even forming their own.  The latter, of course, will take far more work because like ZH, you'll just be considered the &quot;offshoot of a rotten guild&quot; until you prove yerselves otherwise.  Plus you have to start back a few steps to move forward again.  But as AV...if ya get an exodus of people that are tired of being labled &quot;crap&quot;, then I got a feeling the few morons like Fattbutt out there will be used up and you'll have nothing left but a shell of a guild, like TW.<br>
<br>
I'd be surprised if ya make it to Time in tact.  Then again, life is full of surprises.  Will ya make it to time as a guild that did it right...or will ya make it to time by finding new ways of zerging and exploiting and ganking and KSing?  That will be interesting to see unfold.<br>

True, but from what I remember rants was the most populated board...<br>

Besides, posting something in rants isn't necessarily an invitation for verbal abuse.

You showed the intelligence and openmindedness i didnt think you had. To be honest i have a certain level of respect and more to the point understanding of a person with a lil anger behind their words.<br>
<br>
Realize this though, as you said in another post you dont like people that put on smiley faces, i dont either, but realize that i have been the aangry/cynical one, i have spent my time hanging around and beating on some @#%$ morning that truly deserved it. Its barely a crime its almost a justice, but to me i found its a perpetual justice that just follows you around. Yea i guess i got some hippy left in me from my younger years as i have seen the span from blackness to light and decided that i wanna reside a lil closer to the light. Im sick of the turbulence and just want some smooth waves on my ocean, the storms have been long and hard at times. What can i say, im almost 30, call it getting old.<br>
<br>
I come here for the same reason as you i believe, i come here to see the zoo of the human psyche which is so increadibly fun to disect it almost a addiction in itself. Sometimes i think i missed my calling in life as a psychologist.<br>
<br>
Understand that i dont play much these days and to be honest i dont even know alot of AV anymore, but what i do know are good people, so when they are attacked i feel the need for some reason to defend the roseann's the bisnacha's the emerests the kilrods and linor's, the kyepez's and all the people that are happy to see me when i do get the chance to log on and would be happy to do anything for me because of the friendships formed, the same people that do not have a bad bone in them and i know would never do anything wrong intentialy. I do not look for a fight and i do indeed try to get along with every single person, but if i feel attack i will always bring it back to anyone the best i can. Not exactly the buddhist/pacifst idealism i hold in high respect, but last time i checked i wasnt jesus.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to finish up, you have proved  me wrong. I found your post real enough and full of enough intelligance and humanity that frankly it would be like arguing with myself to bicker anymore. We might not be friends and get along, but atleast i understand you now. And never once was it said that you had to like someone that earned your respect anyway.<br>
<br>
Later. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sourrrevenge>Sourr Revenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 550<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/27/03 2:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1234.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Final Truce Post</span><hr size=1> Can I ask ya a question?  You say you don't play much anymore.  Now I understand the desire to defend my friends and guildmates and such, but if they were constantly coming under attack from people and I wasn't there to know what happened, wouldn't you want to kinda defend em from a distance?  <br>
<br>
Let's take the Broo/Stormfeather thing.  I was in DM with Broo.  Broo is/was a friend.  When I first saw the post I was livid!  I was all over the poster's a.ss about how dare he attack my friend and guildmate.  <br>
<br>
Then it came out that it was true.  I ended up backing off and slinking away with my foot in my mouth.  Of course I also tore into Broo about it afterwards in /tells because as I said, we shared the tag and I didn't want my rep drug down because of someone else's actions.<br>

If i left this forum today believing that mhalgrim had a honest intent to gank other guilds or that tumnayar intentialy traning people or that members made it a practice to gank BoT mobs i would tear into them so bad they would either boot me or i would be booted. But i have been there, i have witnessed the choices that AV takes the heat for, ive seen the remorese and plain confusion on what to do on some things that end up in this forum as AV being evil and horrible as a guild. <br>
<br>
<br>
Lets take the AV/PE situation. You have no idea how much i laid into them for this, i was riding the edge of having everyone on the guild hating my guts cause i would stand there alone and tell them how good some PE are and how we need to work together so we dont spend 3 hours raiding Ssra cause 1.5 hours was spent in /ooc with PE arguing along with waiting for a GM to come. It was getting stupid.<br>
<br>
 I believe this is my role in AV to be honest. To be the outsider that looks at things the way others cant see sometimes and to keep bringing it to peoples attention till it catches on. I really dont wanna pretend im the man or something, but i firmly believe that me doing that has played a noticable role in allowing other AV personel to stand up for what they believe in and help shape the guild in the way everyone see's fit. Not just 3 people or whatever.<br>
<br>
In complete seriousness, i blieve AV has the potential to grow into a really respectible and mature guild and i guess thats what frustrates me about stuff like whats going on here, cause its impeding that path.<br>
<br>
Now hold up a sec, im pretty sure you already dinging your bullshit meter, but just try to hear me.  AV has done things wrong, i wont deny that and AV will not deny it. We are not perfect. But here is what im saying. Neither is any guild. I ask you to hit your back button and look at all the posts all saing the same thing on this front page and ask yourself honestly, is this just a bad guild or is it a combination of mistakes by a guild coupled with a need for the comminity to have someone to pick on. I mean who doesnt like to have a outlet for anger right ?<br>
<br>
hit back man, there is atleast 6 threads all on 1 topic. If what i said was not true then it would all be in 1 thread where the topics would be talked about or fight over, like any other rant. But when AV is involved suddenly it circus. 6 threads dude, all saying the same thing over and over. thats not about AV doign something wrong, thats about sharks going on a frenzy cause they taste blood.<br>
<br>
<br>
Seriously dude, you can call us stupid all you want. Maybe we are, maybe we arent, but 99% of the time, we are just trying to figure out how to do it, not be shady.<br>

I was in TL, but after getting into a spat with leadership (geez it's been so long I forgot their names. there were 2 leaders at the time, a female human pally and an iksar monk. The female human pally was a sweetheart, but the iksar monk, he was a real piece of work...). <br>
Anyway, after that I was guildless for awhile. I joined united guardians after being invited by the now in FE enchanter Ariel. When United Guardians dissolved, I followed an old guildy Phantomyst into TW. In TW I remained until I decided to quit playing which also happened around the same time when TW started to fall apart.<br>
<br>
In all likelihood you don't remember me from TL, and you just remember my antics on the board from when I was in TW. My board persona made a lot of people get a bad impression before even meeting me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .
