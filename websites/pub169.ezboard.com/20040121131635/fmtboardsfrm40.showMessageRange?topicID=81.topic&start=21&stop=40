This is a manipulative individual that is determined, you will do as he says even to the point of removing friends or family from the guild to try and force Itcey to rejoin. Comments of &quot;rogues arn't needed in a group or guild &quot; and many others just further belittle anyone that played a class or was of a (RL)sex (females)that he deemed unimportant and second rate. <br>
 Picture the scene -you are happily killing away with guildies and friends in a group, all the sudden you see the message you have been removed from guild. Send a message to the Guild leader and get no response as to what you have done, so you do the only other thing and send a message from florida to Virginia to an officer online to ask what you have done. Only to find out not only is she no longer a member of the guild, but it doesnt matter what you have done you are just a PAWN to get someone else back. What can possible be next for this type individual when his own guild members are meaningless and useless when compared against what he wants.<br>

What kind of asswade would say that.Rogues are very important to raids and exp groups.Rogues are good DPS as well as can disarm traps and pick locks.Rogues are a big + on corpse runs specially a rogue with SoS(shroud of stealth).People that continue to say certain classes are not needed in EQ obivously have no @#%$ clue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyepez>kyepez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 300<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(9/3/03 9:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Attn: anyone considering Nectars of Isolation  {moved ha</span><hr size=1> Nectar of Isolation.....BRRR that name is just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  meaningful and Dramatic <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sylpheden>Sylpheden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(9/3/03 9:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Attn: anyone considering Nectars of Isolation  {moved ha</span><hr size=1> Qrgauthil, did you think that through before you posted?<br>
<br>
Being the member of any  recreational activity &quot;club&quot; it is certainly not nice to be taken of the team........<br>
<br>
True EQ is a game.<br>
<br>
Untrue you can do as you please since it don't matter, it is just a game. <br>
What you do and how other players acts towards you will affect you. For some it might affect them too much....<br>
<br>
But most people playing on a regular basis are affected at least in game by how they are treated.<br>
Just look how mad ks'ing or ninjalooting will get people.<br>
<br>
So what is a guild? A comforting writing some obscure out of the way spot on the screen? &quot;Oh I am in a guild I am not alone, how nice&quot;?<br>
<br>
Some people pour a ton of effort into building a community within EQ working towards the same aims. The satisfaction when the reach a step on the way are immense for them. <br>
<br>
This can be a small guild trying to get an epic piece for their only high level mage.....Or a raiding guild trying to gain access to a new plane.......<br>
<br>
But what if a player in the small guild loot the piece the guild got for their mage? He have a newly rolled mage and want to mq that part? What sanction do the guild have?<br>
<br>
Well they can call on a GM and ask him to get the piece back... <br>
<br>
Trust have been broken and most likely they will turn to the only sanction they them selves hold. They will remove that player from the guild.<br>
<br>
So why is it so bad to be removed? Because it is a punishment. Be it just or not... When you are guild removed it is a punishment. If you look through old posts you will find several players dissatisfied that they were removed because they no longer met the guilds requirements.<br>
<br>
They knew they did not meet those requirements... But their friends, their goals and their ingame identity was tied in with that guild. They thought somehow that they could pickup and get a second chance. Some thought it was their right to do so. <br>
<br>
This is just a game, lighten up....<br>
<br>
The people are real, never forget it. <br>
Your ingame desires are real, and you will work on those.<br>
The satisfaction that comes with achieving a goal is real.<br>
The hurt by being mistreated are real, EQ is a game, but you are real... you can't pretend you are pixels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neffylim>Neffylim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 654<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(9/3/03 2:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .......</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>well, except those of you who do know who every single person is in the game.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Cala, have you been taken over by a pod? You're usually a lot nicer than this. <br>
<br>
I think people are just taken aback at your harshness and total lack of giving this poster the benefit of the doubt before moving the thread with the p&quot;lease please please please use your in game name&quot; comment. She did. Not her fault you didn't know her, and on most boards you'd expect a mod to at least ASK before just moving a thread and totally invalidating your right to rant because you're not a board troll (like me) or a well known player.<br>
<br>
<br>
And just because some people did remember seeing her name around (for instance I have a wacky memory that can remember visual stuff almost photographically, especially the written word but can't do math to save my life) - and then you come out with the &quot;you have no life&quot; bs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Would it have been so hard to leave the thread up for 24 hours with a simple &quot;I do not recognise your in game name. Please confirm that this is in fact your in game name or the thread will be moved&quot;.<br>
<br>
Itcey didn't need to type her name, it's her EZboard login.<br>
<br>
Hell, look at my EZboard login. Would I have my post removed if I posted there? Who the hell is Neffylim? It's my year old retired Necro who is now a Bazaar mule, who maybe 2 people on all of this server have ever seen actually played. But according to this wacky logic, we should post our true in board name on our posts to make it easier on the mods. Hell just bring sigs back ffs then.<br>
<br>
Wtg telling everyone they have no lives because they happened to know a rather obscure player. Maybe you are just having a bad day/week but that's uncalled for. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The rules does state that no anonymous person should post. How do we qualify who is anonymous? Well this person if they have a character, should put their char name on the bottom<br>
<br>
now this isnt fail safe either. Anyone can make up a name to put on the bottom, so maybe the disccusion that comes after it can validate if this char does in fact exist<br>
<br>
Cala was just doing her job(sorry if typo your name). If she didnt do it, someone else would. The person who wrote this didnt follow all the rules, thus she got her post removed. I am not disputing that this person does not exist, only she didnt follow procedure.

<br>
The rule states<br>
<br>
2) No posts may be made anonymously. Your characters name in game must be made known if you are to put another character's name on the Most-Hated list.<br>
<br>
Fortunately for Itcey his main character, the one he's posting about is Itcey.  Hence, he's not Anonymous...<br>
<br>
If the rule stated<br>
<br>
2) No posts may be made anonymously. Your characters name in game must be made known if you are to put another character's name on the Most-Hated list.  This should be done by placing a sig of your main character at the bottom of your post.<br>
<br>
I'd agree with you Calalily.  As it is, your just being stubborn.  So fix the rule or fix the post.  Ask Kelmore or Fimble to &quot;fix&quot; the rules post to reflect the actual rules then.<br>
<br>
Further, even if I put a &quot;label&quot; at the bottom of my post, does that make it a known character or does it just get by the &quot;moron&quot; filter then.  IMO It gets by the newly established &quot;moron&quot; filter.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Anyone can create an EZ Board account, any day of the week with someone elses name and sign it someone else and you, Cala, think its authentic.  <br>
<br>
When here is someone who quite obviously created an EZ Board account with their characters name, and provided a link to the guild website they are still hosting.  Then you hoist yourself up by your &quot;power&quot; to enforce this rule.  Then when people post he is a main character and isn't posting anonymously, you don't have the internal fortitude, to say, <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes I made a mistake, let me move it back&quot;<br>
<br>
Or<br>
<br>
&quot;Your right, it doesn't say a sig is required in the rules, I 'll have that fixed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Instead you fight tooth and nail to keep your thoughtless &quot;enforcement&quot; going.<br>
<br>
So will Kelmore or Fimble to fix the rule to say you need a sig since its the only thing they can do that won't usurp your power and hurt your feelings.<br>

Jas, I am a board troll through and through. Kinda like the norfin trolls but with with less hair.<br>

BTW, just adding a sig doesn't mean you are that person. <br>

Maybe the rules need to be revised to avoid incidents like this.  Someone e-mail the head gnome a long nasty e-mail about this. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/eqjassy/sigs/pixeljasminne.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wilerian>Wilerian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=594596" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(9/4/03 11:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Attn: anyone considering Nectars of Isolation  {moved ha</span><hr size=1> The problem with guilds on a whole is that the Guild Leader has absolute power.<br>
<br>
When you work with a point system for loot that power is augmented because members are unwilling to object or rebel against the Guildleader because they have invested time into the guild and they have a number points invested into the loot system to keep them inline.<br>
<br>
What Sony needs to do is implement a function where a Guildleader can be removed by the majority of the officers and that it will take a majority of the officers (as the GL will considered an officer) to remove other officers.<br>
<br>
This way.  The GL does not have absolute power over the functions of a guild.  I suspect that if this ever happens Many GL will be tossed on their asses and have to answer for the decisions they make.  Giving the officers of a guild the power to remove or elect a GL will make guilds act more like a democracy then a monarchy.<br>
<br>
I am not saying the system I'm suggesting above is what should be implemented..I'm just saying some sort of check and balance needs to be created to insure that Guilds that you invest your time in is more of a community then a kingdom.<br>
<br>
I am sure if this ever happened in EQ many Guildleaders would find themselves deguilded before they could finish downloading the patch.<br>
