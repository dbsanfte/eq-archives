A deep ravine was to my left – it could not be seen, but the stark absence of light gave away its presence just the same. We would be meeting at the southern end of the tundra, where the mountains turned sharply and headed for the ever-frozen river, and I was late. There were more direct path, but the open tundra was deadly to the unaccompanied youth such as I – traveling along the walls was safer, and thus much faster.<br>
<br>
We had met been hunting at the south end of the river for several nights, just past where the mammoths crossed. An adult mammoth could slaughter us all with ease, and none of us individually could handled the unending waves of foes that cross here, but as a team, we could take down a calf, or a bear, or some of the orcs. We had learned quickly which of the orcs could be taken down, and which to avoid. We had also learned of the ice-boned skeletons and their invulnerability to our weapons. More importantly, we now knew how to work as one. The icy schoolmistress of Halas taught her lessons with harsh discipline, but we were willing students.<br>
<br>
I was late. Taking inventory at Mac’s Kilts had taken far longer than I had hoped. It seemed that for every item Cindl sold, she gave away a dozen more, and balancing the books required all my financial juggling skills. But who was I to complain about her generosity, since I was often its recipient. Besides, she would not worry Morra with where I went when work was done - for if she told, it was likely I would be forbidden to leave home at all, and arithmetically minded youths are difficult to find in Halas. I had learned from a gnomish necromancer, who would teach even barbarians such as I in exchange for the bone chips he needed to work his dark arts. No wizardry for me - a simple shaman be I, but the basic sums I could handle.<br>
<br>
Up ahead, where the ravine ended and the path turned left along the curving mountain base, I saw Mothball’s bright orange armor – a beacon marking the meeting spot. The armor was unusual, but not as unusual as it’s wearer, for few wood elves would cross two continents to trade their forest sanctuaries for the frozen wasteland of the north. Fewer still would choose the path of the warrior – but her quick mind, keen eye, and fearless heart showed that it was not brute strength that mattered in combat, but how that strength is used.<br>
<br>
Her sword was new; yesterday’s rusty broadsword had been replaced by steel great sword forged by the mightiest of smiths. She swung it idly, getting a feel for its balance as she waited eagerly to show me. “Last night, after you left, McCleary led us to the giants. This had been left on one of their corpses – the giant killer said I could have it, that they had more than they could carry. We’re going there tonight for more.” I had heard stories of the giant killers and their great wealth – I had assumed them barroom fables. But Moth’s word was as real and solid as the steel she wielded (except when she was teasing. as she was one to do).<br>
<br>
McCleary came into view at the mention of his name. He had led us to this spot, and taught us much of the tundra and the skills for hunting in it– for he had been here for many moons. His great staff was now fine steel as well.<br>
<br>
“We’ll get you one of these tonight, Faf”, he chuckled, “there will be plenty to go around, for the dark elf can not sell them here, and there are far more than anyone could carry.”<br>
<br>
The rogue, Delas, piped in “The merchants will pay in platinum for these. Platinum! No more selling pelts for copper or silver. A dozen swords, and my armor I can buy shall rival Brandl’s!” <br>
<br>
McClearly waved his arm forward, and ran off, confident that we would fall in behind. Off we dashed, across the frozen river and to the northwest. Past towers and temples whose origin we did not know, the builders long past forgotten. And when it seemed like we could run no further, ahead stood a castle fortress whose name we recognized from legends.<br>
<br>
Permafrost. Home of Lady Vox, bane of our kind.<br>
<br>
It seemed deserted. But as we halted our run and walked towards its gates, McCleary held up his hand to halt us. “Stay away from the walls”, he ordered “for the giants will punch right through them if they sense us”. The walls were as thick as a mammoth is long, but the tone of his voice made it clear he did not jest.<br>
<br>
A lone, robed figure sat cross-legged in the entranceway, guarded by a standing skeleton. A necromancer, I thought, for I remembered my gnome tutor had an equally unnerving companion, which guarded him with the same ghastly resolve. Suddenly, a tower-high statue of aquamarine crystal burst through gates, and raised an axe to smite us all. Its size was such that the tallest of us could not have reached its ankle, and I stood there, mouth agape, in terror and in awe.<br>
<br>
The skeleton sprang into combat with a crackly laugh, as the robed figured calmly backed up and waved her arms. Billows of noxious green gas floated out towards the giant, and it staggered, weakened with nausea. It lashed out blindly, unable to see, and barely able to move, as if bound by wisps of smoke. The woman, an elf, perhaps, judging by her ears, although her skin was purple like the feast day wine, simply stepped out from the giant’s path, and out of its reach. She waved her hands again - binding the giant with further ethereal ropes, and then resumed her repose, daintily folding her robes as she sat. The giant stumbled out of the fortress, towards the snow-filled ravine to which we had retreated, with the skeleton assaulting it from behind.<br>
<br>
We scattered as a pack of rabbits before a wolf. The giant had no interest in us, too consumed with anguish, but we could barely outrun its un-aimed footsteps as it thrashed wildly about. Finally, it threw its head back, then forward, emitted a thundering death throttle, and fell to the ground in a heap far larger than any one building in Halas.<br>
<br>
As the tremors from the crash subsided, the evil elf necromancer got up, walked over the corpse, and rummaged through the giant’s money belt – and upon extracting what she wanted, she returned to sitting. McCleary leaned over to her as she sat, whispering to her, but I could overhear her response “Take what remains, man-child, but keep the snow leopards and other vermin away while I rest. Do not disturb me further. And take only from the giants which fall upon these snow banks – venture not into the gateways.”<br>
<br>
We set up camp on the bank, dispatching the occasional leopard or orc with well-practiced ease. A dozen times the scene repeated itself: the giant burst forth from the fortress in a diseased daze as the skeleton mercilessly sliced at it ‘til the monster screamed and fell dead. The blue colossus no longer inspired terror, and avoiding the death throes became routine, as the stack of steel grew. Staffs, swords, axes, and maces stuff our backpacks.<br>
<br>
The night began to retreat before the dawn, and I began to make my farewells. I would need to reach Halas before my mother awoke and my absence discovered. I saw that within the keep, a fallen ice giant had not sought escape outside, but had fallen within the walls, its corpse decaying with a great sword still clutched within its hands. I went to bid goodbye to Delas, but he had vanished, as rogues are prone to do.<br>
<br>
No sooner than I had began my long run back to Halas when I heard a scream “NO! YOU FOOL!” I turned back to see the dark elf shouting at Delas, who was bent over the decaying giant corpse in the Permafrost gateway. Suddenly, from out of an immense archway, a living ice giant appeared. It spotted Delas and charged. Then, another giant appeared out of nowhere and joined the fray.<br>
<br>
The first giant tossed the dark elf aside, interrupting her attempts to cast a spell. Her loyal skeleton leapt to her defense, but being sandwiched between full strength ice giants, was quickly ground to dust. With that, the giants turned their attention to the original perpetrator.<br>
<br>
Delas fled to us, his ill-gotten sword in hand, as we stared in horror at the two giants behind him. There was no need for McCleary to command us to run – we all realized that there was no way we could withstand the onslaught, and off across the open tundra we ran.<br>
<br>
Across the hill, across the plain, and then falling down onto the frozen river we fled. Tossing aside the precious steel, for we could barely carry ourselves. To Bandl we fled: Bandl who guarded the way to Halas, and who slew the mammoths or orcs who ventured too close. For overly adventurous youths to run to Bandl was both a tradition and a disgrace. At this point, we did not care about the disgrace.<br>
<br>
The two towering giants charged across the tundra, crushing anything in their path. The thundering footsteps could be heard for miles. Moth, McCleary, and I all exchange glances as we ran, all realizing in the same instant “Could Bandl kill two giants? Could ANYONE kill two giants?”. As that thought crossed our minds, fatigue set in. The spells which McCleary and I had cast much earlier began to fade, and we felt weak and slow. The remaining steel we carried felt heavier than lead.<br>
<br>
“Snowflake” said Mothball. “Wolf Spirit” said McCleary. “Strength” said I. And with that, a plan was formed. He and I would summon the spirits of the animal world to aid her, and her warrior skills would be tested to the utmost.<br>
<br>
McCleary and I halted on the northern isle where the river forked. Mothball dashed towards the giant, but angled to intercept the one further back. McCleary cast his spell upon her as I cast mine, and suddenly, a burst of speed and strength encompassed her. Bathed in blue light, she slashed out at the giant – her great sword slicing but the smallest nick in his toe.<br>
<br>
Still, it was enough. That giant charged after her, while the other continued towards McCleary and I. We would take our giant to Bandl, and Moth would take hers to the guards at Snowflake. We cast our spells on each other, and then ourselves. By the time we finished, the raised foot of the giant was directly above us – falling like a wall. We darted to the side.<br>
<br>
WHAAM! The blast of wind from the near impact of the giant foot threw me forward. I stumbled as I resumed my run, but regained my footing despite sliding down a steep decline. I could no longer see McCleary, and had a sinking feeling that he might have been crushed. But there was no time to check.<br>
<br>
I could see Moth, now ahead, her ice giant in tow, heading east towards the brilliant red sun. I headed southeast with mine. Delas also heading to Bandl, a short ways behind me, waving his sword as he ran. I could see a pack of mammoths ahead, and turned to avoid them. Delas charged on ahead.<br>
<br>
“Giant to Snowflake” called out Mothball, her voice resonating in across the canyons of Everfrost. Folks would have risen from their slumbers at this hour.<br>
<br>
“Giant to Bandl”, I also exclaimed. <br>
<br>
“Giant to my ass” echoed back some wisecracker far in the distance.<br>
<br>
Nearing Bandl, I could see his reaction as he watched me bring the giant in. A look of intense determination crossed his face, and he tightened his gloves to ensure a firm grip on his sword. He had fought giants before – he knew this would be a close battle, one which he would barely survive. But survive he would, if the Tribunal willed.<br>
<br>
Some days the Tribunal is not kind. For as Delas passed through the mammoth herd, his sword struck a calf. As it howled in pain, the normally placid mother mammoths turned and attacked the foolish rogue. A band of orcs heard the commotion, and they too joined the fray.<br>
<br>
I paused at the base of the mountain where Bandl was posted to watch the epic battle. I saw the swarm charging towards us. Five mammoths, three calves, three orc troopers with a shaman, and lone ice-boned skeleton followed Delas, and perhaps more. It seemed as if every ill-willed creature ever created had decided to join in the assault on Halas.<br>
<br>
“Tundra to Bandl” I hollered, standing beside him. He snickered. “They’re not going to believe you, son. Hell, I wouldn’t have. Better run – this ain’t going to be pretty.” And with that, he rushed out, swinging his sword, to meet the giant.<br>
<br>
“Time to die, ice giant!”, he hollered, launching himself into the attack. They traded blows of devastating force – the expertly wielded weapon versus sheer size and strength.<br>
<br>
It would have been an amazing sight to watch, but there was no time.<br>
<br>
I shouted to Delas “Don’t come here – he can’t fight all of this at once”, but to no avail. He continued his path, straight for Bandl – running past him, and the stampede of mammoths plowed over the mighty warrior. They washed over him like a tidal wave over a sand castle.<br>
<br>
I ran through the maze-like canyons leading to Halas. I saw Mothball ahead of me, yelling “Giant to Halas, Giant to Halas”. Apparently the guards by Snowflake were mismatched as well. Our paths interested – I could see the wounded giant behind her, near death, but still deadly. And behind me was Delas, followed by a giant, and a parade of mammoths and assorted villains. We linked up, now running side by side, and her giant joined with the mob behind me.<br>
<br>
We were nearing the side passage which led to the caves and the river around the village of Halas itself, and many people traveled here. The morning air, normally filled with the quiet sounds of chipping birds and snow falling, was filled with screams and shouts as folks saw the army of destruction bearing down on the city. Those that saw turned and fled back to the town, but for every person who left, a dozen more came to investigate the excitement.<br>
<br>
“Go South”, Moth said to me, and rather than turning right towards Halas, we went past it and headed through another series of twisting corridors through the icy mountains. “The giants won’t be able to follow through to Blackburrow”.<br>
<br>
The run seemed to last forever, and we never dared to look back. We could still hear the shouts of the townfolk, further and further in the distance as we ran on. We bolted past the guard Arnis, through gnoll-infested caverns, past the deep pit within, and then finally out into the sunny grasslands of Qeynos Hills, where we collapsed in exhaustion.<br>
<br>
As I regained my breath, Mothball turned to me and said, “Have you ever been to Freeport? Perhaps a journey is in order.”<br>
