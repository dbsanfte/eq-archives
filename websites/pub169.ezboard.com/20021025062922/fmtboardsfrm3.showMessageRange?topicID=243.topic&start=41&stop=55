(large</span><hr size=1> Ok Guys,  I first attempted to read that mess,  and it was very hard to follow.  So for all of you guys,  here is my gift.  I have edited out all the auctions, and all the combat parts,  and only left in the conversation between Dubbs and Kandyman,  or guild chat about them.<br>
<br>
Scoundral....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me preface by saying I was logged into a little known solo xp spot for several hours this morning, when someone shows up and tells me to &quot;get out of my camp.&quot; I explain that I'd been there all morning, and I get &quot;I don't care, this is my home get out&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't run around with logs on, so I turned log on when it became clear what this jackass was trying to do...<br>
<br>

[Wed Sep 25 10:30:25 2002] You told Kandyman, 'this is obvious.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:30:37 2002] You told Kandyman, 'you don't seem to interact well with others.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:30:49 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'i am staying here, we will share them then but do not ks my pulls because i reported you for the first one already'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:31:16 2002] You told Kandyman, 'lol, i'm loggin all of this, PLEASE do bring a GM into it.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:32:59 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'you know, as fast as you kill you'd be better off at the other camp, there are 8 there, only 5 here'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:33:17 2002] You told Kandyman, 'i know how fast as i can kill. 5 max per spawn'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:33:45 2002] You told Kandyman, 'youd be better off not trying to bully someone out of their camp because you are under some delusing it's your home.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:33:58 2002] You told Kandyman, 'particularly someone who ain't gonna take it'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:34:01 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'thats strange me too, yet i'm a hybrid, i'm sure you'd do beter with 8 to kill'<br>

[Wed Sep 25 10:35:02 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'that sounds like something pretty dumb, why would i do that?'<br>

[Wed Sep 25 10:35:28 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'killing slaves? why is that dumb?'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:35:33 2002] [60 Grave Lord] Kandyman (Erudite)<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:35:57 2002] You told Kandyman, 'you're playing innocent now that you turned log on or something? haha'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:36:19 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'how do you turn &quot;log&quot; on?'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:36:22 2002] You told Kandyman, 'not killing slaves, einsteing, telling me to gtf out of my camp because you are here now and this is your &quot;home&quot;'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:37:15 2002] You told Kandyman, 'funny how you have no interest in guilds, being that you just posted an application on our website.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:38:25 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'i know the rules to eq rather well, its just that i been able to log on for the past 2 months and just kill these slaves unbothered by the ksers and arses of the game and now i log on and someone has not only found out about my goldmine but is in the middle of it stopping me from doing what i have done everyday for months'<br>

[Wed Sep 25 10:39:22 2002] You told Kandyman, 'don't blame me because you can't respect the fact that i was here for 3 hours before you even logged on'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:39:40 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'well i've been here since before anyone came here seen you here for about a week or two'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:40:31 2002] You told Kandyman, 'so that gives you the right to tell me to gtf out of my camp because you're takin it over? great logic.'<br>

[Wed Sep 25 10:41:00 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'like i said i'm used to no one knowing about this place'<br>

[Wed Sep 25 10:42:18 2002] You told Kandyman, 'and thus i took this camp, camped out here, and have been here all mornin since i logged in.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:42:25 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'no i know where the others are this one works best because i have that cleric on my other pc to heal me, kinda hard to move her, i will share this with you though'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:42:42 2002] You told Kandyman, 'gee how nice of you.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:43:03 2002] You told Kandyman, 'maybe ill invite some friends and take all the spawns here with no chance for you.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:43:09 2002] You told Kandyman, 'since i was here first and all'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:43:15 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'well we can share and have a conversation or we can share and be butts back and forth'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:43:31 2002] You told Kandyman, 'you should have thought about that before you told me to gtf out'<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, he kept pulling when he was able to run up and attack one faster than me (how @#%$ annoying is that @#%$, grr) and telling me to &quot;get out of his home&quot;<br>
<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:47:50 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'why don't you just get away from my camp? i told you its mine'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:47:51 2002] You told Kandyman, 'yes, it is clear that you don't care what others think of you'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:49:19 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'who cares'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:50:57 2002] You say to your guild, 'btw, that kandyman guy's app still active, or did we turn him away?'<br>

[Wed Sep 25 10:51:36 2002] Thoruk tells the guild, 'most likly turned him away'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:51:54 2002] You say to your guild, 'i'm going to be posting a rather large log on MT boards'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:52:04 2002] You say to your guild, 'we sure as hell better have turned him away.'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:52:14 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'so you reported my wifes charecter too :P thats funny, she is gonna be like why don't anyone like me no more HAHAHAH!'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:52:44 2002] You told Kandyman, 'i didnt report anyone, i just logged this. GMs mean nothing,just the other players willbe warned)'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:52:49 2002] Kandyman tells you, 'thought you were finally leaving my camp?'<br>
[Wed Sep 25 10:52:58 2002] You told Kandyman, 'its my camp, and ill leave when im ready.'<br>

<br>
this reminds me of another situation i experianced. a certain level 60 bst who will remain nameless was in fg, as was i. <br>
i was passing along killing lotuses for their parts to make lotus pie, when i decided to pull a few shrooms. well OH MY GOD i made the fatal mistake of pulling HIS shrooms!!!111!<br>
<br>
im sooo sorry i didnt log that conversation, but trust me it was too funny... he totally spazzed out. <br>
<br>
me: &quot;ok calm down, no need to get so rude, there are lots of mushrooms in this zone for you to pull&quot;<br>
<br>
bst tells you &quot;what do you think your doing? this is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> camp and you just pulled a mu shroom from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> camp go away!!!!!!!!!!!!! what are you crazy?!1 (insert jab from an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> edgling</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about my guild)&quot;<br>
<br>
this just in: noonie pulls shroom from someones camp in fg, also a monk pulls a spider from &quot;someones camp&quot; in velks, news at 11.<br>
<br>
and i agree, guildless wonder kandyman sounds like a total ebay <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 9/28/02 6:37:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uneext.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NEExt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/28/02 6:49:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=243.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: How to define a &quot;loser&quot; in EverQuest...

<br>
No Camps in EQ? I will remind anyone of this next time I just walk up to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> your</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> camp and start killing mobs in there..<br>
<br>
Velektor? Been there, done that, long before you was high enough to even go there and group there for exp..<br>
<br>
Why don't I pull some other spot is rather obvious... When I sit with a patch with 7 shrooms and I can kill those 7 shrooms and med back as they start repoping I do not want to run around, move my DC'ed pet,. After all, there are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> many</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> shrooms you could be pulling without taking those you see me sit at..<br>

Back to Topic, that Kandyman must be a total retard<br>
