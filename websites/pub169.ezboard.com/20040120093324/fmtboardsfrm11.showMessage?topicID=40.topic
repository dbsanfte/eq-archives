She let her gaze run down it’s length, slightly wavy from the exertions of a long battle, falling over a concerned forehead of azure skin, and amber eyes of a teir’dal warrior.  The lock’s bloodied tip gently, unknowingly grazed over the fallen priestess’ lips and she knew the taste well.  The blood was her own.  Somewhere in the fog she heard her name being called but the throbbing pain in her neck and shoulder pulled her back into oblivion.  <br>
<br>
Jziad felt her body fall limp again and he cursed the gods raking his hands through his hair, pushing that lock out of his face.  The warrior was doing his best to bind up the terrible wound in Malaeli’s neck, where the saber-toothed tigress had caught the meditating priestess by surprise.   He sorely regretted wandering off into the night, leaving the hunting party unprotected, wanting to be alone with his thoughts.  <br>
<br>
Before he arrived back at camp, he knew something was terribly wrong.  The fresh scent of blood cut the air, making the seasoned warrior draw his weapons as he entered the camp, destroyed and empty.  From the tracks, it was clear that the wizard had magically teleported the party to safety.  His eyes narrowed peering at those tracks, there were clearly four people who escaped magically.  Someone else had been left behind… he searched into the dark night for the fallen one.  With a sense of trepidation, the warrior muttered prayer “…<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>don’t let it be her</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->…”<br>
<br>
With a flash, he tore into the sabertooth tigress making her drop Malaeli’s limp body.   Focusing all his strength, feeling the power of Rallos Zek flow through his veins, the tigress didn’t last long.   He left his axe in the beast’s spine and rushed to the fallen priestess’ side. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/malaehi/DEtat1.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

There she stood, a gangly dark elven child, in front of the ruins of the house of the man who said he was her Father, Vri’dril.  Her father’s house was destroyed and his head had been mounted on the spikes of the front gate, dishonored and executed.  In the smokey mist, Malaeli saw her life flash before her eyes.  <br>
<br>
It had been several months since he had rescued her from the mad woman in the forest.  Malaeli had absolutely no memory of the past, her father filled in her history for her.  She flashed back to the evening Vri’dril told her the story:    The insane, outcast Malaeliu kidnapped her and a group of girls from all over Norrath.  The mad woman had been brought to justice, executed for her crimes and all the children were returned to their families.  <br>
<br>
Malaeli just accepted the story as fact, because whenever she tried to remember, splitting pain coursed through her head.  So, she accepted her fate calmly and quietly, following in her father’s path of healing.  <br>
<br>
Vri’dril was a cold secretive man, practically giving his daughter to the Church to raise.  He expected absolute perfection and meted out the severest of penalties if the mark was missed.  She wasn’t the only one to fear him, his name was only mentioned in whispers.  Questions were not tolerated, so the young priestess never knew who her mother was, nor if she had siblings.  <br>
<br>
In her deepest dreams, she saw sisters and a loving mother, but dwelling on that too long made her head ache.  Her only solace was in prayer, her Father became the Prince of Hate, Innoruuk.  In serving him, Vri’dril looked upon her with pride.  <br>
<br>
Malaeli thrashed in her dream as it took her to that fateful summer evening.  Earlier, she had left home, traveling to the Desert of South Ro, to pray upon the wizard portal, rumored to be the way into the Father’s abode.  She didn’t return until it was late.  Too late, in fact.  <br>
<br>
In the wee hours of the morning the smell of death and destruction made the bile rise to her throat, as she caught sight of the evidence of execution and destruction of her father’s house.  Vri’dril’s head was impaled on the long pole of the front gate of his mansion.  Malaeli was bewildered beyond reason, her father was the High Priest in the Temple of Innoruuk.  She knew her father had enemies, who didn’t?!  This was Neriak after all.  The one thing the child knew to do was run.  She cared not what happened, actually felt a peace in her soul, that he was gone… she couldn’t explain it, nor did she want to think of it.  She just wanted to run.  <br>
<br>
Night came again, as she stole into the ruined house and found her father’s safe untouched.  After hiring a rogue &amp; his wizard brother (and paying a fortune for their silence), Malaeli was able to clear out the safe and was translocated to a far away land, where she could hide out.  <br>
<br>
But, there was something that escaped Malaeli’s dream.  Just as silence can be paid for, so can information.  The T’nanr brothers cackled with glee, satchels weighted with platinum, as a cloaked figure followed the young priestess, in the shadows.<br>

They were in the Stonebrunt Mountains and the nearest town with healers was the locked, heavily guarded city of Paineel.  Jziad tried but was unable to gain access to the hidden city, the guards would not cooperate with reason, platinum nor force.  <br>
<br>
Beaten and bloodied, the weary warrior gently laid her down by the river bank Toxxilla Forest, carefully bathing her neck wounds.  The bleeding had stopped but her color was terribly pale, and her body was scalding hot to the touch.<br>

Peering as best he could through the night, K’vael cursed his inherited poor night vision.  He listened intently as the priestess rambled in the old vampiric tongue, jotting down notes in his journal.  The pages of this tome were near full as he had been following the child since Vri’dril’s very public execution had finally reached Erudin.  When he heard the child’s name, it was obvious that she was the lost teir’dal child that Malaeliu had rescued and raised and one of the “sisters”.   <br>
<br>
K’vael was a scholar of Erudin, the Keeper of the histories and lore of the people of Norrath.  He had been thrown into this wild chase of fact finding, chronicling the lives of the daughters of Malaeliu.  She was the former priestess of Innoruuk, and served the House D’unnar, commonly called the “Reapers of Sorrow”.  She had been banished from Neriak for disavowing her service to the Church of the Prince of Hate.  <br>
<br>
K'vael was given a huge collection of diary pages that belonged to Malaeliu, weaving the story of her life and it’s turning point, when she had discovered the High Priest Vri’dril’s crime.  <br>
<br>
Vri'dril had kidnapped scores of young children of Norrath, including some of his own race, and was selling them into slavery, a high crime that even the Teir’dal had forbidden in their lands.  <br>
<br>
Through those pages, the story of how Malaeliu lost her faith in her God, then with a ragtag band of barbarians and dwarves attempted to rescued the children who had been kidnapped by the sinister High Priest of Neriak.  <br>
<br>
Upon being discovered, the majority of the children were killed and the incident was covered up by Vri’dril and his cohorts, sending Malaeliu in to a rage forsaking the Church and being punished by banishment.   <br>
<br>
Unknown to all was the small band of female children that she and one surviving savior had managed to rescue and raise, hidden in the forest of Nektulos.<br>
<br>
However, there was more that was unwritten in those pages, what K’vael had learned from his investigation, and what he had been recording in his own tomes.  <br>
<br>
Vri’dril, in fear of getting found out, had devised a way to exonerate any stain on his name.  He decided to turn the tables, making an alliance with the leaders of Felwithe, Halas and Qeynos all who were still searching for their lost children.  <br>
<br>
With this band, he hunted Malaeliu down, finding her and the children, accusing her of the kidnapping and slaughter of the masses.  <br>
<br>
In front of the children, the teir’dal priestess Malaeliu was executed.  The horror stricken children had their memory wiped clean by Kae, an enchantress of Felwithe.  The confused children were returned to the city leaders and brought home.  All were returned save the one that escaped, and retained all of her memory, the erudite Malaele.  <br>
<br>
K’vael looked down and sighed deeply, pained.  It was that heretic Malaele who faced her own death to see to it that her adopted mother’s diary pages were in safe hands, his own.  He had taken the pages and witnessed the subsequent execution of the daughter, for being a necromancer.<br>
<br>
He was able to track down a few of the daughters, Kaete the eldest was growing up following the ways of the Tribunal.  Motherly by nature Kaete vowed to bring her sisters together again, or at least keep an eye on them.  <br>
<br>
Malaehi, the Koada’dal had been adopted by the Ancients of Erollisi Marr and turned this news into a reason to convince all the teir‘dal to come to the light.  She hunted with Mallo, Butcher of the Karanas for many seasons, then wandered about Norrath with Xxein and his Hall of Heroes before finally finding a home with a band of marauders, Fury's Edge.  She stayed behind the scenes of her sister's lives, helping out when she could.  But, the flighty elf was more interested in her silks and dancing, running from a haunted past.<br>
<br>
But, it was Malaeli, the teir’dal daughter that K'vael had the hardest time tracking.  He had no idea she was adopted by Vri’dril.<br>
<br>
Annually the Librarians of Norrath met together to exchange information, share documents and show off their unique literary treasures.  K’vael had worked incredibly hard to get the Grand Librarian of Neriak to come.  For the most part, teir’dals kept to themselves, and wisely so.  <br>
<br>
However, the new teir’dal Librarian was also the brother of Matron the most powerful House in Neriak, M’riel, granddaughter of Queen Cristanos.  <br>
<br>
M’riel was a diplomat, by Teir’dal standards, seeking to gain trade relations with the other races to boost the waning Neriak economy.  Determined to make a better public image for her people, she was receptive to allowing her brother to travel to Erud for this cultural exchange, even accompanying him, with her entourage of body guards. <br>
<br>
Tensions were high in the Erudite capitol, however the meeting took place without incident.  It was the final day when K’vael choose to share his highly controversial collection of the Diaries of Malaeliu.  Heedless of the warnings of his elders, K’vael openly shared the tome and it’s supporting documents.<br>
<br>
The only sound heard was the turning of the parchments, as M’reil and her brother read.  With a smile of a diplomat, she thanked the Erudites for their hospitality and the meeting came to an abrupt end, with the Teir’dal party taking their leave.<br>
<br>
Once back in Neriak, the infuriated M’reil wanted this business with Vri’dril done and over with.  In an attempt to appear to be a just society, she denounced Vri’dril, had his estate destroyed and publically executed him and his household.  Word spread rapidly across the main cities and outposts of Norrath, all invited to come witness the destruction.<br>
<br>
Hearing the news, K’vael immediately booked passage to Antonica, taking advantage of the open gates of Neriak.  He hoped he could find more pieces to end this Diary.  <br>
<br>
He offered to pay handsomely for any information about Malaeli.  When he found that she had been adopted by the executed High Preist, his heart was crushed.  Standing in front of the ruined mansion, he made notes in his journal of the grisly site.  <br>
<br>
Later that evening, he found the break that he was looking for:  the daughter had escaped.  The T’narr brothers were eager to talk once the gold had been exchanged.  By the rising moon, K’vael was teleported into Faydark.<br>
<br>
Malaeli had escaped Neriak and sought refuge in the lost city of Mistmoore, deep in Lesser Faydark.  Mayong had taken her money readily and allowed her to stay, living a quiet life of prayer, study and meditation, most of all secrecy.  It was too dangerous for K’vael to stay and observe, seeing as though the Brownies were just as vicious (if not more) than Mayong’s minions.  So, he befriended a Fae Drake named Lioe, requesting her just to watch, and to send word if the young priestess leaves.<br>

Malaeli thrashed about and to Jziad’s surprise, she spoke in the ancient tongue that only Mayong’s vampires still used.  At one point, her eyes flew open, flashing bright crimson, ranting in that language unknown to the warrior.  <br>
<br>
Jziad pressed her back down, speaking soothing words, gently kissing her forehead, letting the coolness of his lips ease her heated skin.  The priestess immediately calmed, and Jziad continued to drop gentle kisses, murmuring against her skin… <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“It’s ok, shhh, just sleep now..” </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> With a will of their own, his lips gently brushed across hers and with an electric shock his body leapt to life, responding in a way far opposite from nurturing.  He felt her body respond as well, lips parting in a soft gasp.  <br>

He quickly pulled away, cursing his natural responses.  He had to think, to solve.   Tearing himself away from her side, he peeled his bloodstained armor off, and plunged in the freezing waters of the river, swimming strong, fast laps back and forth across the breadth.   <br>

A year had passed before he heard anything more about the young priestess.  In the meantime, in a surge of religious zeal, the Priests of Innoruuk rose up and disposed of M’riel, seeing her plans of alliance as weakness and shame.  Shortly after this news, K’vael heard from Lioe.  Malaeli had left Mistmoore and was traveling back home to Neriak to take her rightful place in the Temple of Innoruuk, and had allied herself with the House Rea’Morda.<br>
<br>
From the information K’vael had gathered, the priestess should be near her 20th season and would be assuming a surname.  As each of the sisters passed their 20th season, K’vael then made contact with them and showed them the Diary of Malaeliu.  But, approaching a teir’dal would not be as easy as the other sisters.  The news would definitely be a shock.  The priestess embraced the Church of Innoruuk, so news that her Mother was an outcast might not be accepted pleasantly.  So, K’vael decided to take time off from his duties at the Library and find Malaeli, picking the right time to give her the news.<br>
<br>
In the common tongue, he called out from his hiding place  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“The priestess is hurt and I can help.” </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
He was answered with only the sounds of the forest creatures.  Timidly he emerged from his hiding place and stood tall,  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“I come in peace with a message for Malaeli and fresh bandages…”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
His voice was cut off as he felt the sting of a dagger at his jugular vein.  Jziad hissed,  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“One false move, one incantation and …”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
K’vael quickly said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“I am an unarmed scholar that means no harm”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as he raised his hands slowly.<br>
<br>
The warrior released his grip on the erudite’s shoulder and let K’vael turn around slowly to face him.  The blade had not moved from it‘s target.  Jziad could smell fear yet saw a silent determination in the gray eyes of the stranger.  Glancing at the erudite’s bags he said:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Get your bandages, but if you even think…”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Understood warrior”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, he set to work on the feverish Priestess, applying fresh bandages.  After a few moments, K’vael sighed deeply <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“She has lost far too much blood, and infection is spreading.  I can barely feel her heartbeat.  She needs blood… of her own kind.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“What?!”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Jziad blurted out.<br>
<br>
K‘vael sighed deeply <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“You do not know much about her do you, teir’dal!  Malaeli spent at least a year with the blood drinkers in Mistmoore.  I have no medicine with me, nor the skill to administer it.  But, you have the blood that she needs.“</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  <br>
<br>
Jziad immediately felt repulsed, stepping away from Malaeli as if she were a beast.  <br>
<br>
With a stern voice, K’vael said “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>If you will not help, then GO!  Leave!  Your brooding stare is little help.” </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
He then took a small dagger and cut his own forearm, he held the priestess’ head up and put his arm to her mouth, murmuring in the ancient tongue of the vampires:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Take this child, rose yourself and drink now”.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/malaehi/DEtat1.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Endurance is power… hate is strengthened…”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> as her heart hardened in her chest, it’s pressure and weight heavier than any male who pleasured themselves with her.  Not that this act was a violation, she gave no resistance, but remained detached.<br>
<br>
When his passion was satiated, he rewarded her with a chalice of his blood.  This is what brought life and passion to the priestess.  She drank with a bloodlust and an unquenchable thirst, feeling her cold body come alive with energy and life.<br>

Jziad watched, frozen with morbid fascination.  After a few minutes he watched the Erudite pale and sway.  He stepped in and pushed K’vael away from Malaeli before he had two invalids to care for.  The priestess panted in delirium, mouth opened and teeth smeared with blood.  He covered her up and let her rest.<br>
<br>
He turned to K’vael, pulling him to sit upright.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Listen Erudite, I must return to my House soon.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“K’vael, I am called, and she is in no condition to move for a fortnight.” </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> He paused, then determined that now was the time.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“I didn’t just happen across you two in the woods… fact is I have been following the priestess for over a year now.  Wait!  Before you draw your sword, hear me out.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jziad stood over the him and leaned against a tree, impatiently fingering the hilt of his sword.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Go on if you must.”  </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“If you look, there in my bag, the bigger one… therein lies a Tome.  It is the diary of Malaeliu, the priestess’ adopted mother.  It is something that she has a right to know about, and I have been waiting to show her.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jziad’s eye narrowed  “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>And how did such an artifact come to find its way in the hands of a mutant human?”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
In a voice which had a hint of outrage and haughtiness, he answered:  “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We mutant humans are collectors of lore and history of all cultures.  If you know how to read, you may inspect the tome for yourself, warrior.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This brought a hint of a grin to Jziad’s stony face.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“My place is on the battlefield, not perusing scrolls in the park with the weak and invalid.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
K’vael arose to his feet, looking up into the night‘s sky  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Night is well along and the changing of the guard is soon, I have a place we can go to get warm and allow her to heal.” </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
He paused and looked at the impatient warrior.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“If you need to leave, she will be safe in my care if you could just aid me in getting her to my forest cabin.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jziad lifted Malaeli up, into his arms noting that her fever had indeed cooled some.  K’vael gathered the rest of their belongings and lead them northward into the forest.  <br>
<br>
Arriving at a small cabin, K’vael quickly lit a fire and started to prepare food for them.  Jziad stripped her out of the wet rags and wrapped her in a clean linen sheet, then laid her in the bed to rest.  He immediately grabbed some food K’vael had laid out and a bottle of wine then left the cabin, to stalk into the night, keeping guard for any unwanted intruders.<br>
<br>
It seemed like only a few hours had passed, Jziad awoke with a start, cursing himself for nodding off.  Toxxilia forest was murky dark and the time of day was impossible to determine.  His keen ears picked up the voice of K’vael so he walked back into the cabin.<br>
<br>
Malaeli was sitting up in the bed, white sheet wrapped tightly around her and eyes enormously wide as they took in the pages of the tome in her lap.  He quietly moved over to sit by the fireplace, listening to K’vael  summarize the story of the pages and of his search.<br>
<br>
Hours later, she slept.  K’vael took the tome from her and packed it carefully into his bag.  Turning to Jziad who was staring into the embers of the fire, he said  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“I must return to the Library now.  I will arrange safe passage for you both to your homeland.  Feel free to stay here for another night.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Jziad took another long drink from the wine bottle and nodded silently as K’vael left the cabin.<br>
<br>
The following day, an Erudite wizardess appeared to take them back to Nektulos.  At the gates of Neriak, Jziad turned to the priestess and bowed, finally speaking after days of silence.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“You are safely home now, Malaeli.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->”  At the word “home” he saw her cringe slightly.  He moved in to face her,  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Come back to the Rea’Morda house, perhaps Yaskel will have some answers…”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The chill in her voice made the warrior shrug and step back, when after all this time she finally spoke:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>
&quot;My place is in the house of my Father Innoruuk.  He will advise me.  However, send word to the Matron Rusalka that I have other obligations and a debt to pay to the D’unnar house that my…”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  she spat the word <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Mother… defaulted on years ago.  I must seek out the Reapers of Sorrow, see if they will have me serve faithfully, in my mother's place.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The word &quot;Mother&quot; brought back faint memories, a familiar face, much like her own, crimson eyes.<br>
<br>
Jziad nodded and watched the plate clad priestess stride through the city gates with her head held high.<br>

<br>
Krastus perused the documents in front of him and nodded to Puppetm, who gave Malaeli the house insignia to wear.  The pendant was engraved with words in the ancient language “Reapers of Sorrow”.  <br>
<br>
Malaeli bowed her head and accepted the necklace.  Puppetm chanted and made the priestess weightless and float into the air and with a grin he took his leave.<br>
<br>
The indigo clad Shadow Knight chuckled at the Necromancer as he left.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Get used to floating when he is around”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.
