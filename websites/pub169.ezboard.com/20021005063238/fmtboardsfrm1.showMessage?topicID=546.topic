Drack and i have decided to take the bull by the horns and attempt to organize a little player revolt. heres the deal, EQ has continuosly let many players down. even more so lately, as they start to look forward to thier next cash cow. <br><br>now i dont know about you but im about fed up with it. i propose we make a list of complaints we have regarding EQ/SOE/VI, then ill write a letter explaining all the problems we feel are being ignored. ill conclude the letter with a statement that we want change or loose our business. then everyone will cut &amp; paste the letter and email it to VI. then on a given date we will all log off for no less than 24 hours.we will threaten in the letter to cancel our acct permanently and log off for 24 hours to prove it.<br><br> i will do everything i can to contact players from other servers and boards (im a stay at home dad i got time) to build support for this endeavor. what i need from all of you are all your complaints and b.itches about Verant/Soe/EQ. make it short and sweet as im gonna have to parapharse/summarize everything into one concise letter.<br><br>there are other games out there. a couple years ago they could afford to lord over us and dump on us, but enough is enough. we were promised Bazaar with Luclin, how long did it take me to pony up? we were promised better GM support by having universal GM's, ROFL, what they meant was that they were cutting back on the money they put into the game and shafting us in the process. how many years have players and guilds been getting burned by Ninja Looters, when verant could easily solve the issue with just a little creative programing.<br><br>Each of us has paid (rounding up exact prices probably vary) 40 bucks for EQ 40 bucks for each expansion and 10-12 bucks a month for as long as we've been playing. For what? to have our requests for help fall on deaf ears? to get guides who say &quot;sorry cant help ya&quot;? i for one say BULLSHI.T, enough is enough. <br><br>post your complaints and lets fix this crap. <p>DESEPCHUN <BR>EXILED PRINCE OF ERUDIN<BR>Forever Exiled Elite</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uneffylim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neffylim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/4/02 2:30:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gripes about EQ/SOE/VI,please dont move need peeps2 see </span><hr size=1> Go play Diablo 2 for a week... you'll have a much more positive outlook on exactly how good you have it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>The very fact this game still has new content, features, and another expansion coming out, so long after the initial release is incredible.<br><br>I'm by no means a Verant fanboy (girl) and found their customer service to be totally appalling and not even worth the word &quot;service.&quot;<br><br>However when I see consumers getting upset with bugs and issues on a game I always suggest that they really research exactly what goes into the devopment and subsequent maintenance of a game- how budgets are constructed, who makes the decisions on team sizes, etc.  Developers hate bugs. They HATE them. Publishers hate them. But it's all about staying profitable, and it's all about acceptable risk. Every bug or every issue has a monetary value attached. How much  does this cost in terms of lost sales. How much does this cost us in salary to take someone off what they are currently workin on so they can fix it. Etc. Etc.  <br><br><br>Games are a business, and every aspect of them is run as one. For every time you are hitting your keyboard in frustration at a bug, there is a developer hitting his keyboard because he knows that bug or issue is there and he can't get approval to add another team member to fix it.  <br><br>There are not unlimited resources in game development any more than there are in any other type of business. Anyone here who works in software development knows that you do the best you can with what you have, and it's ALL about meeting a deadline.<br><br>In fact, if you ever get a chance to attend a panel where people in the high positions at Sony are present (I attended one at E3 and another at SIGGRAPH) you'd be amazed at how much they DO care.<br><br>The crappy part is that the only people the consumers and gamers ever get to interact with is the ones MOST removed from the real day to day stuff. You get to see questions that some fresh out of college marketing person wrote. You get to see quotes from people SO high up on the management and executive chain that they are completely out of touch.<br><br>I am not saying your pleas will fall on deaf ears. But I am saying that there are certain things that just will not ever happen. <br><br>Yes, you are important. Every customer is. However even if you were to get 500 signatures... pit that against half a million subscribers who are probably totally unaware that any of these issues exist.  <br><br>I agree that the Guide and GM situation sucks. But do you really think these people are paid the kind of money to give decent service? The problem with Guides and GMS (with some exceptions of course) is that they are either recruited from the playing pool (usually someone who likes to lord their &quot;power&quot; over someone else) or hired by an HR department that wouldn't know a pixel from a peanut.<br><br>The people who can and do make the decisions in a machine the size of what runs Everquest, are scores of levels above and removed from the people that would hire a GM or Guide. They have things to worry about like the stock price this week. Not some mininum wage 18 year old who thinks his cack is now 3 inches bigger because he can lord his decisions over the uberguild.<br><br>When it comes down to it, its a business. Like McDonalds. Who doesn't care that I think their new chicken things are total crap or that anyone else does. The great unwashed masses think they are just awesome for the $.99 they spent and that is what it's all about.<br><br>You have to remember that there will come a time when this game will not exist. The dollars it takes to keep EQ running are staggering. The money from subscriptions each month JUST barely covers the cost of keeping it online. <br><br>Yes of course they are cutting costs. Sony is not immune to any of what has happened in the economy the past 18 months. <br><br><br><br>But yes. CS sucks and will continue to suck.

Player/Guide then you will not understand. Yes CS can suck at times. But you know players can suck just the same. People wonder why it takes so long for a GM response. Think about how many stupid things they have to look into. &quot;Item lost after I logged off&quot; Item was in a NO RENT bag. &quot;I was in the bazaar and I went to put an item in the bank. When I came back the item was gone&quot; Well he didn't put in the bank. He gave it to the banker. See stupid things like this take up value time a GM can be using to work on more major stuff. No I am not a Guide, Just know a few. If you want better service, then become a better player. It’s a two way street. Petition ONLY when it's needed. If you died get a res from a cleric. If you can't find your corpse get a Necro, If Necro can't find it, get a higher necro LOL. Most of the things we petition about are really stupid and can be dealt with by ourselves. But there are things that we can't. So its nice to know that Guide's and GM (When around) are there to help. <br>Later<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukyotakoversith.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kyota Koversith</A> at: 10/4/02 9:49:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uteadynthedruid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teadyn the Druid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 973<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/4/02 9:54:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=546.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hello</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Guides are the front line of all petitions.
