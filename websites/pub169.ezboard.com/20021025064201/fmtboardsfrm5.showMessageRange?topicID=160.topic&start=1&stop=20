<br>
we had some nfl games here in sweden.. but i think u can count the sales on your fingers. its much like cricket, rugby or baseball. it doesnt exist here.<br>
<br>
we would like some heavyweight boxing tho, but our controlling society doesnt like the idea of two men beating eachother up proffesionally. instead, they show sexually unnatural hardcore porn (im not against porn. im against double standards of morality).<br>
<br>
we dont get to see heavyweight boxing if we dont pay a hell of a lot money for cable (lewis vs tyson costed $40, IF u had a certain cable system). YOU, on the other hand (i assume you are american).. can watch ULTIMATE FIGHTING for free! ARGHH!! tho.. ultimate fighting is just sick, imo. what happends in the ring aint sick - two people fighting each other on there own conditions and shaking hands afterwards (if they havent passed out).<br>
but the persons WATCHING these fights make me sick. they are simple brutes.. standing there with their beer, farting, screaming, ENJOYING that a person gets a punch or two after passing out (in maybe 50% of the fights, the referee aint fast enough to pull them apart..and u can actually see how the neck swings on the passed out guy taking a beating). its awful, and thats what the audience is enjoying..what COULD happend if a sumo wrestler jumped on a skinny brazil kickboxer. bah.. i hate people.<br>

Let me tell you how fights work in the United States... the Tyson/Lewis fight was $50 to watch... ultimate fighting, is $35 dollars to watch.<br>
<br>
You see, we have this thing here called PayPerView that makes millions of dollars off of our desire to watch fights and movies! And we dont even get unnatural hardcore porn!<br>
<br>
Of course, there are ways around it, but those arent exactly legal! <p><b>Next to the maiden's<BR>Sleeping place<BR>I left<BR>The Sabre, The Sword- <BR>Alas, that Sword...<BR><BR> -Yamato Takeru<BR><BR>

<br>
we dont have this. heavyweight boxing isnt allowed. middleweight is allowed tho, but how fun is that if u arent a die hard fan?<br>
<br>
i think this is due to the rules of protective gear (heavyweight boxers dont need helms).<br>
<br>
during the summer this year, two professional boxers in sweden put up a heavyweight fight in a park. it was rather official with camera teams and a sponsored high quality ring. all the revenues would go to starving children, or something like that.<br>
<br>
..but the police came and arrested the boxers. i think that was lame. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
no matter HOW they twist and turn it, boxing will always be considered a sport. according to them filthy socialists, its about two men beating eachother up..so they have to forbid it. but with that perspective, they could ban tennis, hockey, football and spear throwing as well. people GET hurt in sports.<br>
<br>
i hate my controlling society. we entered the EU (european union) which was a great economical benefit for sweden. but the goverment made up its own rules - alcohol WOULDNT be cheaper cause it would encourage people to drink even more. also, they didnt allow food stores to sell alcohol. only &quot;class 2 beer&quot; (we have 3 classes of beer - class 1 is 1% alcohol, class 2 is 2,8-3,5 % alcohol and class 3 is 4,5%+).<br>
<br>
we still had to buy the &quot;good stuff&quot; in special stores. and these stores wouldnt be open on weekends. and on the pubs, a pint of beer would cost $6 and a normal sized tequila/gin/whisky of average quality brand would cost you $8. ON TOP of this, we have to give 33% of our income away in taxes. and since socialists rule sweden, u have to pay even more if ur income is above a certain amount of uberness. (some people pay up to 90% of their income in taxes..especially high payed doctors)<br>
<br>
now, after a few years.. things are starting to lighten up. the old socialists are getitng replaced by new people, younger than the relics from the 40's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
they have lowered the taxes on wine, so an average quality bottle of wine (i know there is no average quality, since a $50 wine can be crap).. but ok.. lets say a bottle of a normal bordeaux costed $6 earlier. now its $5. also, they changed the tax system on beer. previously, u would pay taxes on the amount of alcohol in the beer, which would lead to a &quot;strong&quot; beer at 7,6 % would cost ya $2,5 or so. now its down to $1,4, so its REALLY cheap to get drunk! i dunno what they changed, but its cheap allright! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
also, they have started to have these special liqurd stores opened on saturdays til 2 pm. better than nothing! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
when they started to keep these stores opened on saturdays, our socialist magazine no.1 (unluckily the most popular newspaper in sweden), came up with diagrams showing that the amount of rapes increased by 8 %. this almost made me cry, cause i realized how pathetic my country is, or at least the gouverment and media controlling it. what kind of person would degrade his/her own species and support the alcohol to be banned? probably a non-drinking, non-smoking, non-fvcking childless socialist born in the 40's or under, preaching about a better life only to confirm his/her own lonelyness.<br>
<br>
they seem to live after a christian ideal that hasnt been of importance since the 50's. i think only 3 % of the swedish population goes to church nowadays. and 90% of these 3% are pensioners! the rest are different sects.<br>
this information is taken from an official research i read some time ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
back to the alcohol..<br>
<br>
tho, the contrast between pub and store prizes are still too high. a pint (bottle or can that is) at the store would cost you $1,3. a pint at the pub (same amount of beer, but served in a glass) would still cost ya $5 - $8 depending on where u go.<br>
<br>
the socialists want to control us. the socialist ladies want to forbid porn on tv (the only porn we got is showed midnights on cable channels). whats next? a law preventing us from having sex in different ways? like.. no doggystyle, it degrades the women. no anal sex, its unortodox. nomore than 2 fingers, anything else is physical abuse etc. etc. depending on what these socialist women thinks is &quot;healthy sex&quot;.<br>
<br>
nonono..i say - if it doesnt hurt anyone, it CANT be wrong! so stick to it! and if it hurts yourself, well..then u better rethink what u are doing. but nobody should think in your place! i hate that. just live and learn.<br>
<br>
<br>
there ya go. a little bit more about the unfair country of sweden. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><HTML>

Here in the US, there are some cities where liquor stores cant open at ALL on sundays =/ (you know, archaic churchgoing places that believe sunday is for god, not for drinking) And in the state of Utah, there are some very restricted drinking laws...  mideval <br>
<br>
We have high taxes on alcohol too, but nowhere near as high as you guys. As for income tax, I thought you guys got lots of benefits from it? Elaborate on what your taxes get you? Ours dont get us jack @#%$, we still have to pay tons of highway tolls, have to pay for medical insurance, and unemployment is very selective in who they pay.<br>

<br>
its not BAD tho, if u are one of the less fortunate in society. and thats the point. the rich people feel punished for being rich. the poor people see no reason to work, since they get more money out of NOT working. the AVERAGE person is the ideal person. swedish socialism. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
personally, i would like everyone to SHINE. do their thing..and enjoy it. but maybe 60% of the swedish population get stuck at an average level. cause anything else would be considered &quot;ugly&quot;. its an old swedish unwritten law..saying you cant be better then anyone else. and it still lives on. especially on the countryside.<br>
<br>
its ugly to be unemployed and take advantage of the system. its ugly to pwn the system and make a lot of money (well.. not as much as you work for anyway, since the taxes).<br>
<br>
but the day your wife is pregnant, or you need to take care of your baby..the system will reward you. on later years, our births are less than our deaths (dunno the word).. so to increase the births, our gouverment added some extra benefits to families with children.<br>
nowadays, as a man, you would HAPPILY take 6 months off to take care of your child. thats gud stuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
THO..then it comes to taxes again.. its still expensive as HELL to raise a child. daycare is expensive. gas for the car is VERY expensive (98% of the price is taxes). its IMPOSSIBLE to find a legal contract on a home in almost every city, and when they build new houses..they are sold out 10 years in advance..for a price an average family couldnt afford.<br>
<br>
so its a bit twisted..an evil circle. you cant just give benefits and on the same time increase the taxes, which hurts the richer people the most. in the end..there would be no point in making money at all, would it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
speaking of liquor.. i like englands system. a beer at the store (normal food store..they sell spirits as well) would be about £1.2 ..thats about.. hmm.. $1,8? a BIT more expensive than the swedish beer, but on the other hand.. beers at the PUB is only £2,2..which is about $3,3 .. stores are allowed to sell alcohol til 10pm. after that, u are forced to go to the pub or club. but in this way, you get to drink ANY time of the day/night for a reasonable price. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
tho, their tax system in general is fvcked up.. just look at the less fortunate immigrants, homeless and beggars. or the enviroments in general.. they really dont know how to keep a city clean and good looking. its so..grey!<br>
<br>
in sweden, clubs are forced to close the doors at 4am. tho, we had a recent election and someone proposed that clubs should be allowed to be open 24/7. lets hope for the best! i just want to be free. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
back to england..<br>
one thing thats good about england is the crimes.. they hardly dont excist if u are comparing to other countries. i think this is due to all the cameras. which leads me to integrity. i REALLY dont like cameras. or the english spirit in general. they show clips on tv showing people revealed when commiting crimes. its either 1. to prevent people for doing crimes.  2. entertainment.  3. both. <br>
<br>
do they have moral at all? i dont think cameras are the solution. well..they MIGHT be if they are VISIBLE. then we have the option to choose wheather we want to be caught on tape or not. but to place them invisible on red lights, bank machines and streets is just lacking moral, imo!<br>
<br>
having warning signs indicating cameras gives u the option to choose.. NOT having them only shows u are ASKING for crimes. its a wrong way of preventing crimes. its entanglement. and it rapes the integrity of people.<br>
<br>
but having them in stores is a complete different thing. people have the right to equip their property with cameras. but society is a public property..<br>
<br>

Sounds like Big Brother to me... I dont like it one bit.

but once we put cameras up..oh boy! women are filthy! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
lately theres been some programs on swedish television, when some comedians grab peoples balls and give women dirty invitations.. and film it (candid camera). then they release it as entertainment on public television. i think this is very wrong and i consider them wh0res.<br>
i laughed SO hard when this swedish producer got some make up on him (he thought it was a normal interview, but the make-up artists put rouge and all that stuff on him instead).. they filmed him after the interview, and he entered an elevator to go up to his room. then he saw himself in the mirror, got SO mad, beat up THREE (3!) of the camera men and stole their camera. LOL..thats when i laughed. that was SO right and i would have done EXACTLY the same.. well.. i wouldnt steal the camera. i would simply stomp on it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways.. skip the bud light, or bud at all! its not drinkable, imho. beer like bud and corrs (sp?) tastes like mineral water.. in sweden its considered ladies beer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and no, we arent mucho macho and look down on women (well..they do in the northern part of the country.. much like the southern countryside in usa..hillbillies that is).<br>
but a woman in my taste would be a woman i could enjoy a good whisky with. NOT while she zips on her bailey's or dooley's or whatever. pure scottish single malt whisky! or some very fine blended. america is not to be underestimated on the whisky front, as well. u got some really good stuff, and im not talking about jack daniels! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
if u can, please try beer like stella artois (great belgian beer, it should be sold in usa..i dunno), grolsch (not a favourite, but most people like it) and any checkozlovakian (sp?) beer. any danish beer as well (&quot;tuborg gron&quot; most of all).<br>
<br>
<br>
if u are interested in some swedish beer, we got some nice brands as well! tho, we prefer danish beer. but anyways.. my absolute favourite beer is mariestads 7.2%. its strong, but SO well brewed u wont notice it. also consider three towns and hmm..what was it called..&quot;falcon bayerskt&quot;. i think they had to rename it, cause it wasnt &quot;bayern&quot; at all (german?).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
my beer list of avoidance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- guiness (i know i know.. but i dont like it. it lacks substance imo)<br>
<br>
- becks (too weak. tho its pretty good if ice cold, but then i would rather have a stella)<br>
<br>
- bud or any of its kind. (too light. tastes like water.)<br>
<br>
- corrs (same as bud). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- london pride (FOR FVCKS SAKE! TASTES LIKE IRON!)<br>
<br>
- any british ale. (since when was beer supposed to be sour? or maybe thats what ales all about.. haha)<br>
<br>
<br>
everytime i go out, i start the evening by ordering a pint of mariestads 7.2% or any second choice &quot;normal&quot; beer if they dont have a wide sortiment, next to a 6 cl (swedish metric system) whisky..preferably bowmore (mmm..), but since i never go to fine clubs, i have to settle for a jameson (pretty good average whisky when u go out). i call this a &quot;snake bite&quot;.. borrowed from the english snake bite - a pint of cider (yuck) with a shot of whisky in it (yuck). whisky must be drunk unspoiled! the lowest i would go would be to swallow it down with a coke. its cheap, but SO tasty.. makes your mouth all bubbly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now mixing beer and tequilla, yuumm! <br>
<br>
I like beer, a lot... but I hate the majority of american beers, they are swill IMHO. Coors is crap, but I think it a notch above budweiser.<br>
<br>
We have several eschelons of beer here, we have the cheap stuff, (Pabst Blue Ribbon, Schlitz, Miller HighLife) this stuff is like $2.00 for a six pack... which is 4 and a half pints to you euros. It tastes like runoff from a sewer, but it gets you drunk if poor or a high school student! I remember when I was in high school, most of the parties had big huge coolers full of Schlitz (shiver)<br>
<br>
Then we have the ones that are a little more expensive, but still mass produced pisswater. Budweiser, Coors, Miller, Icehouse (though Icehouse is the best of the lot in my opinion)<br>
<br>
Then we have the higher beers, which are mostly imports and small american breweries. For example, Sam Adams, that is my idea of a GOOD american beer, one that the US can actually be proud of.<br>
<br>
But you know, I have to say I am not a patriot when it comes to beer, I like the imports. Here's my list!<br>
<br>
Guinness - The top beer, the pinnacle, god among beers, body, a thick head that can withstand an hour of sitting on the table (though mine hardly last 5 minutes), and a complex flavor. I admit, its hard to get drunk on guinness sometimes, its not really a chug beer.<br>
<br>
Grolsch - Number 2 beer! I love this stuff, the Dutch are beer masters. My favorite are the 20oz. bottles with the old style flip top instead of the bottle cap.<br>
<br>
Boddington's Pub Ale - Comes in the yellow pint cans with that little ball in it that makes it pour like a fresh draught (pioneered by guinness I might add!) I like this stuff, and can polish off 8 pints of it without breaking a sweat.<br>
<br>
Corona with Lemon - Living near the beach, I say nothing says relaxation like a corona with lemon while perfecting your tan.<br>
<br>
Amber Bock - Cheap but good, theres a place near my house with $1 amber bock drafts! I drink the stuff a good deal, its suprisingly good for the price, nice dark color.<br>
<br>
Molson Canadian - NOT the stuff we can get in the USA, that molson is @#%$, but the real stuff you get in Canada, thats a nice strong beer, there are some up there that top 8% alcohol.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, we also have the high alcohol but cheap (ghetto) beers. Like King Cobra, Colt .45, and other nice names. Those are usually refered to as &quot;Malt Liquor&quot; probably because US law doesnt allow something over like 6% to be called &quot;beer&quot; Strong stuff, but the taste is too strong. <p><b>Next to the maiden's<BR>Sleeping place<BR>I left<BR>The Sabre, The Sword- <BR>Alas, that Sword...<BR><BR> -Yamato Takeru<BR><BR>

<br>
i have seen a lot of ghetto movies.. the originals, and the comedy versions based on the originals. what ARE those bottles of beer??<br>
<br>
i once spoke with an englishman who enjoyed beer. he said that guiness is a waste if its kept in cans (the ones u mentioned, with balls in it). according to him, the beer loses a lot of flavor when transported. so if u like guiness, u should put it on ur what-to-do-before-i-die-list to go to scotland and drink a fresh guiness, straight from the tap.<br>
<br>
i have no comment here tho, since i dont enjoy guiness. i wouldnt notice the difference. or maybe i would.. maybe im just a spoiled beer drinker! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
one thing i noticed in your post and reacted on was corona with lemon. my friend studied in south carolina a year, and he told me people there were CRAZY about corona with lemon. but according to him, the lemon is just fake. its a relic thats become principle.<br>
according to him, the lemon was there to hold the beer fresh longer in the good old days, but that it had nothing to do with flavor (like coke with lemon).<br>
<br>
my own thoughts about corona.. i dunno. havent drunk it that much. but i *think* i found it sweet and pretty tasteless, and would rather consider it a refreshing thirst killer than a beer. so what you said about relaxing on the beach, might just be perfect. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i wouldnt know, im not used to the miami beaches. those bikini ladies would probably scare me and make me spill beer on the pants.<br>
<br>
i cant stand boddingtons! isnt that the one without bubbles? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
i have to try sam adams. ill see what i can do. one thing about the swedish liquor system is good - they import all kinds of stuff to give their customers a wide selection. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
u can actually walk into some of the liquor stores (its a company which has monopoly, simply called &quot;the system company&quot;, roughly translated) and buy a bottle of wine from -70 or so for $1000. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

indian beer i TOTALLY forgot about..<br>
thers NOTHING better then going to an indian restaurant IN ENGLAND (they are the best, imo) and order some lamb tikka or whatever with egg fried rice (i dont eat chicken), some naan bread and a COBRA BEER or two. that beer is some good sh!t! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

also, while we are at it..

vodka wont affect me (i used to drink a whole bottle of vodka, and just threw it all up before getting drunk.)<br>
<br>
gin.. well.. gin makes me relaxed, but i need to drink a whole bottle here as well. not fun. doesnt taste anything (i mix with grape tonic).<br>
<br>
tequila.. is dangerous. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   i love it.. its my fav drink. it doesnt make me drunk, nore confused. it makes me HIGH. i talk a LOT, and u cant actually see im drunk, but then all of sudden, i fall.. just to get up again 5 secs later, totally in control. it comes in waves..  but the fun thing is the talking. ive never seen myself talk so much before, and i could bore anyone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
i came up to her and said: &quot;i really hate women. u are all evil whores&quot;.<br>
