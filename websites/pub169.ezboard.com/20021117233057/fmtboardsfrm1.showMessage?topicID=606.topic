In case some of you dont know, this Friday October 18th at 8pm ET<br>
the newsmagazine show 48 hours is airing a segment on Everquest. Apparently the topic is &quot;Online Gaming Addcits&quot;. Most people, including yours truely, are thinking it will mostly likely be biased against EQ. Im pretty sure they will portray it as some evil menace that must be snuffed out. Who knows. I was just wondering if any of you were planning on watching it and feel the same way. Also, they will be using footage of the Boston Fan Faire so if you went (I didnt) then maybe you will be on TV! If you see yourself on TV I would be interested to know who you were. Now...set your VCR's!<br>

I know people who have planned their whole day around playing the game and largely ignore their friends.  Its affected their school and social life and even caused problems in relationships.  Just because they are reporting on Everquest doesn't imply they are targetting everyone who plays it but they are targetting the addicts.  If you believe Everquest does not breed game addicts, then you are truly mistaken.  <br>
<br>
Everquest is right now one of the big games related to addicts because of the long times one must be logged on for (raids, spawns, etc.).  Other games such as counterstrike or warcraft are shorter scenarios and a person can quit them at a shorter moments notice.<br>

EQ keeps us off the Streets.  <br>
<br>
You never see a guy on the street corner begging for coins to pay for his EQ fix.<br>
You never see anyone selling their bodies to pay for this month's EQ bill.<br>
I would say that you can't leave your wife because of EQ, but that would be a lie.<br>
You can't commit crimes, because you can't leave your room since you are camping Hadden.<br>
You don't drink and drive, since you never leave your room.<br>
The only governments you are disenchanted with are Freeport and Qeynos...and those you can get even with.<br>
When you tell your honey &quot;TO THE MOON ALICE&quot;  You are not threatening her.<br>
If you fantasize about Betty Boop, Veronica and Betty, Roger and Jessica Rabbit, Bugs Bunny in Drag, well then, Sony has a game for you!<br>
You are spurring the economy on, as you are ordering more expensive take-out, you HAVE to have at least 5 phone lines, all the latest hardware, and by my reckoning, spending twice as much on cigarettes, thus putting huge tax dollars into the USA.<br>
You are not transmitting any strange diseases, unless you consider Toon Obsession Syndrome a disease.<br>
You are not driving, thus Carbon Monoxide is reducing, so by playing EQ, you are HELPING the OZONE hole. <br>
You don't bathe, as you are camping Ragefire, thus you are saving water.<br>
You are helping keep strays off the street, because you will take in any pet that wanders by, as you need some sort of live contact.<br>
<br>
So what is wrong with EQ anyway?  You are HELPING the world by playing it. <p><CENTER>

Hey thats life, if they were that unhappy they would have left because of something else.  <br>
My reasoning why I play?  Easy, I left the casino industry thinking it was the right move after graduating college.  In short, Stock market goes to hell, 9/11 hits, and the job market gets blown out of the water.  Although I have been playing longer then when all this happen, that is when I realized that I can play EQ, meet up with good friends in game, and have fun on a qaurter of what I would spend to go out drinking at a bar.  Dosn't mean I still don't go out, but if I wasn't playing I know I would go out more, and right now I don't have the money to be doing that.<br>
