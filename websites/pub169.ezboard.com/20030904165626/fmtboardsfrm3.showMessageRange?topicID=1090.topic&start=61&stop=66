Like Twompy, I too would prefer to kill any mob without the assistance of anyone who isn't a member of my guild or an applicant.<br>
<br>
I'm not castigating you for not healing Tumnayar. It is entirely reasonable to assume that the healers you had there would be focussed on people within your raid and wouldn't think immediately to heal someone who was outside the raid.<br>
<br>
I'm castigating you for chosing to use the expression &quot;KS&quot; when it isn't applicable.<br>
<br>
Tumnayar tried to help, people (and their guild) shouldn't be dragged in the mud when they try to help rather than stand idly by. <br>
<br>
Again, I'm not a fan of AV's leadership or really of AV as a whole, but when someone from AV tries to do something kind (asked for or not, welcome or not) I don't expect to see them ranted. That's beyond lame. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fizziisotope>Fizzi Isotope</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/9/03 10:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1090.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Thanks to the person in AV or MLF that dispelled</span><hr size=1> New Information...<br>

The robots are reconstructing the cities of Ashen Void below the Sea, and in the Time of PeE, the black, sucking void will rise... first in the great lakes, and next at the Poles; they are not dead, for they thrive on corruption, and on water pollution, static drift, wet sticky black tides that threaten all radioactive @#%$-filled cities, PEE DOG knows!!! I have seen him in WEIRDO! His @#%$ stains the fingers of the very Stark Fist of Removal!!! The Dark Age is upon us! Flee to your household kingdoms, cultivate evil alliances with strange agents, arm yourselves, buy guns, food, etc., buy gold and comic books, destroy the unworthy, weak ones --<br>
<br>
Sell your soul to the SPACE BRAIN(S)!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell us how,&quot; they ask. It's all this one long quest for sex&amp;drugs, and death... N'aton is not part of the Rebel Gods, and what has become of ERIS since the big Divorce? I wonder what the spawn of the Old Ones dream of in the heart of their mountain city, crawling degenerate oooze, they killed their own creators... Tentacled, barrel-shaped, not as bad as the Great Race, sick putrid demons... Liber Al Vel Legis 2:22: &quot;To worship me, take wine and strange drugs...&quot; Lo! The Age of the Child is upon us, but none know his name or number! They flee and pay homage to the patriarch, but his time has come and gone, and others of them flee farther and invoke the Mother, but she is dead save in the future where she is dying slowly! Black Pearl with the Crystal Lotus, do you compare with the jewels cast up on the beaches of R'lyeh? Is your lotus a bouquet for the Forgotten Ones? Or is it a flower cast into Isis' smoking suttee? No one will invoke the Child of the Aeon, they are all frightened, for who is that save the words of atom and energy, who is that builds shrines to his captive spirit? Why do you use numbers, if &quot;all are infinite, all the same&quot;?<br>
<br>
When the sleeping wake, those now living will not die, and those now dead shall stumble throughout the cities of madness, whirling electro-magnetic energy during the Night of &quot;Bob&quot;. The Book will be rewritten, its pages scrawled with the terrifying Writ of the Child That Has Come. IT cannot read, IT cannot paste, but It lives, breathes, eats, and draws! Child, hear your servant in the basement wilderness, hear your prophet call on shimmering wings of beetles in the Astral Void, UFOs to Hell Creatures, with blood in their veins, consort with the whores; the Lamp of Hell (see Prescriptures 85-86) breathes into the houses and streets. The Child is poisoned by itself, the Child is murdered before it can purge, all watch, round-about, the watchers (Hebrew word: Grigon) fill the satellites looking for the birth in the desert, and none shall know the time nor the hour!<br>

I was simply stating why I thought the person joining into a fight he didnt start, didnt get a heal. Oh and you seem to assume that the raid didnt have a second tank available to take over after the MA died.<br>
  My point, plain and simple, has been to the person who was surprised they didnt get a heal after joining in a fight unasked, was that they really shouldnt have expected to be healed when they really had no business joining in without being asked. <br>
  Basically ask yourself what you would assume if someone from outside your raid jumped into a fight you had started. I bet your first assumption is not that they are there to help... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A
