<br>
Fury`s Edge still kicking ass and taking names, leading from the front and achieveing.   All this whilst putting up with morons, people that have no clue and folk that have no relevance beyond that of a mosquito.<br>
<br>
Thunderkittens still attempting to struggle your way up the food chain,  having the relevance of a mosquito and carry on the low skill Zerg fest that always marked a TW kill along with disrespect for anyone else that might actually have a clue, even though youd never admit it. <br>
<br>
Best of All, its good to see Thunderpussies are still recruiting from the Shallow end of the Gene Pool<br>

When racing for a mob and 80% of the first guild to engage wipes the other 20% is able to basically kite the mob (fighting with 1 tank and doing no damage with NO intention of killing it) until everyone is rezzed up and more people are coh'd in? Sorry that doesn't fly, you jumped the gun and wiped and tried to gimp your way out of it. You want to race us for emp spawns everytime to keep us out of vt? Fine, but when we have a raid force ready to engage we're not gonna sit by and let you rez up after you die. This is NO different from those people sitting in iceclad kiting lodizal claiming it while they buy time for their friends to port in. <br>

I think perhaps Hurtyu should go back to the IceClad encounter and play in Kael some more, as he is obviously clueless about anything else, and more to the point, tried to con a GM into believing it to.<br>

Sigh, another person who &quot;likes&quot; a band when they are not so well known, but once they get popular, &quot;Oh, I don't really like them&quot;.<br>
<br>
(Not really slamming ya, it's just something I noticed some people do.  I had a good friend of mine who would like bands/movies/books, as long as they were still 'underground'.  Once they became popular he said they 'sold out'.   Here's a hint: Any band making records is 'selling out'.  Otherwise they'd give it away for free) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukreket.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreket</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fimble Adorer</span><br>  Posts: 807<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/1/02 8:22:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=583>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: see</span><hr size=1> &quot;Garaddar says 'Man I love Creed and linkin park and blink 182! and theres this new chick coming out sometime, Advil Lasagna!

<br>
and on a side note. i personal believe u cant come up with anything new from here on. all the good stuff is to be found in the 70's - 80's. the daily music is just CRAP. over-produced prostitution. even the hardrock is over-produced. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    there just aint no spirit anymore!<br>
<br>
the daily punk music in based on one thing - money. and even the punk rockers are fvcked up! (duh). they go around hating the world, the society and economy, yet they buy their steel toe shoes in certain stores that add an additional $20 to the price so they will look cool in their $8 t-shirt! punx turned into capitalism..oh my!<br>
<br>
a musician might be pure. he wants to deliver somthing to the audience. its his way to communicate. he get signed. his record label send some stylists to fix him up. they manipulate his words (lyrics) and choose his personality to attract as many 14 year old girls as possible. to sell.. all of sudden, he isnt that pure anymore. he is part of the big evil capitalist company which doesnt give a flying fvck about his message. they are just another way of making money.<br>
<br>
rock was once rock. the quality of the rock was measured on the quality of the musicians, and you didnt have to use all the fancy equipments to produce a well-sounding album. it was all in the fingers/minds, and you can really hear that if u listen to daddy's records. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
today, its a c0ck contest. its all about pumping the sound as hard as possible!<br>
listen to linkin park's latest, slayers latest and dimmu borgir's latest. WTF!? the sound is SO pressured a normal stereo cant play the cd without getting digital noises (a scratching sound, at least this is what i got from slayers &quot;god hates us all&quot; and &quot;linkin park&quot;).. and the sound..YUCK! it makes my ears soar, cause its so cutting CLINICAL and bright!<br>
<br>
pop music.. i wont even go there. we all know what pop music (radio hits) are all about. can u name one radio hit that has been popular for more than 6 months? its hard.. cause they come and go. someone release a single, and when the complete album comes, the single feels old and wont fit into that album.<br>
also, in this category, u dont have to be a musician. having big boobs and blonde hair and a fvckable look in general is more than enough. the rest is just not important. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
..all this is much like fries on mc donald's. its not only fried potatoes with salt..oh no.. its way more than that. its an own RELIGION. or more like a sect. created to addict people..and make money that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
i stick to my eternal heroes. they were created 35-15 years ago, and still are as topical as back then. if u are into the genre, that is. im talking about all those old geezers from the 60's and 70's. they are still around. dead or alive!<br>
<br>
also..the early sex pistols, ramones, guns'n'roses, misfits, iron maiden and even early metallica are pure!<br>
the factor here wasnt about money in the first place. money was a big part off course, cause much like now a company needed money to survive.<br>
but back in those days it was a creative competition between the different record labels..which gave people the possibility to express themselves! and evolve. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
for example..where do you think elvis came from? elvis was the answer to the black record labels back in the days.. the genre was a mix of black cant-remember-what-the-category-is-called and white blues. but it wasnt about money. it was about black vs. white..money came second.<br>
<br>
if a band today, lets say a pop band, doesnt sell..it disappears. cause its considered a bad product/an investment, not a band.<br>
<br>
i cant stand this, and stick to my old geezers. i live in my own musical world, and i dont want the daily crap to stain it.<br>

<br>
but the punk wave started in uk in -76 i think, with bands like sex pistols and the clash. there was a general disapprovement of society, and people (the working class at the most) were angry. and so punk was formed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
in -78, the wave grew so big that companies realized the economical possibilities to be drawn out of punk and started signing the bands. end of punk. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
punk was punk when it was about live concerts delivering a message to the audience.<br>
<br>
how could u sing about your disbelief in society, and yet make big money on that record? its hypocracy, not punk. and punk is NOT about just hating and smashing things. its a revolution that questions society.<br>
<br>
the punk music has nothing to do with the american word &quot;punk&quot;, as in: &quot;do you feel lucky, punk?&quot;.<br>
if thats what people consider punk today, well..then maybe blink 182 IS a punk band, after all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ugaraddartheweezard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garaddar the Weezard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 413<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/1/02 9:40:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=591>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: give up already</span><hr size=1> Actually, its when i took up the guitar that i started disliking all these &quot;nu-metal&quot; and blink type punk bands.

I also listen to alot of Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Randy Rhoades, Zakk Wylde, and Eddie Van Halen stuff now, where as before, that type of stuff never really interested me. Guitar has replaced EQ as my new addiction! Oh well, at least it's a bit healthier.<br>

I&quot;m not here to debate the fact that blink 182 isnt a real punk band cause they aren't.  If you asked any member of the band they would say they aren't.  I was merely stating that they have been in the game for awhile and, it's funny how ppl hate on a grp once they hit &quot;pop culture&quot; or mainstream......kinda silly considering ALL(99% of them) bands come togehter with dreams of mabe somday making it big.  And once they do they have &quot;soldout.&quot; Record companys have alot to do with the marketing on bands  today.  Besides do you think any band that has sold 5 million copies of an album really cares that there are people out there who think they suck, obviously not cause 5 milllion people love them enough to purchase their album.  IE they are rich so who gives a damn when your cruisin in a convertable with to hot chicks with fake BOOBIEs in the back seat.<br>

Tauren, FE has done some pretty crappy things to TW as well. Yet you maintain the FE leadership can still be honorable. Maybe you're wrong about TW, or at least admit your oppinion is biased. 99% of all of our guilds disagreements with one another have been misunderstandings. <br>

It wasn't so long ago that these boards were smeared with anti FE BS, and I didn't support that crap either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukelmore99.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kelmore99</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/1/02 10:51:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=594>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leeches</span><hr size=1> nm <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukelmore99.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kelmore99</A> at: 10/1/02 10:52:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukalran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/1/02 11:06:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=595>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: give up already</span><hr size=1> Sobal is a leader in TW?  Clearly I don't know the internal workings of your guild (nor do I truly care).  What I know about your guild, I see in the results.  You fail to kill creator repeatedly.  You fail to kill AoW repeatedly.  You fail to kill (from an outside perspective mind you)... a good 20% of your targets.  Isn't Rumblecrush a 15 person encounter?  Failure is admirable... it's a learning experience.  But what kind of piss poor leadership allows its members to fail repeatedly on targets that should be little more than routine?  I mean christ... AoW is a tough mob, but once you get it down... it's all raw formula... YET YOU STILL FAIL almost as often as you win!  If I could use something like tintin++, I could program the damn encounter... the only variable being ENRAGE.<br>
<br>
I can't think of any other top end guild that repeatedly fails &quot;easy&quot; encounters and can still claim good leadership.  Have you even killed High Priest yet?  Ssra is an amazing prooving ground.  Can your guild kill Rhag 1?  Rhag 2?  Creator, Exiled, Arch Lich, Cursed, High Priest, Emporer.  If you want to determine how good a guild is, simply look at what their top accomplishment is.  TW still wipes to Creator!  I was surprised to hear that Rev failed to kill him.  They have what it takes to get the job done... and they learn from their mistakes.  I'm fully confident that Triune can kill Cursed, but I realize that Jordaan has a different, and more long-term productive plan for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=troller666>Troller666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/1/02 11:07:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=596>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leeches</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.myshit.net/images/member0678/daggenpic.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sobal>Sobal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/1/02 11:21:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=597>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: give up already</span><hr size=1> Kalran you can belittle TW's accomplishments all you want.

<br>
I havn't killed rumblecrush in at least 6 months. Yes AoW is a tough mob and i so agree he's a simple formula and only lag/ld can really kill ya once you're AoW capable. Yes we have killed AL, HP, Creator, and Cursed multiple times. Emp is the logical next step for us, you do not have to like it.<br>

Tempers on both sides were hot, and understandably so. There were a few thinsg said by both sides at that point.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to point out that the very next night, FE made a totally unnecessary deal with TW, trading a clean shot at Emp for every other uber mob in Ssra... .on a night when TW wasn't even raiding. We could have easily cleared all spawned mobs in the zone uncontested, yet we made a deal. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/umorinkhanmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorinkhanMT</A> at: 10/1/02 11:34:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uqkasflah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qkas Flah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/1/02 11:42:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=599>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leeches</span><hr size=1> bogga, nothing new in music? wtf did you miss? check out idaho, tool, at the drive in, ...and you shall know us by the trail of dead<br>
