<br>
I am Lvl 57 now and thought all my way this level up about weapons, damage/delay, DPS and how dual wield works. And in result of this im really not thinking of doing my epics....<br>
Let me just say, sure, these weapons are great for those who solo much, but for me personally these weapons make no sense.<br>
Lets take a look at the damage/delay stats on those:<br>
Primary: 14dmg 24dly<br>
Secondary: 13dmg 21dly (plz correct me if im false)<br>
<br>
Well, Earthcaller...... cough .... come on, 14 24???? The damage delay really sucks on this. There are a LOT of weapons you can get really easy or can buy with money, that are way!!! better than this. Personally for me im using a 12/20 weapon atm. Sure, its not an uber weapon, but the DPS is better than on Earthcaller. <br>
So, i would NEVER use Earthcaller while grouping in the Planes for example. Especially the proc is only a big aggro drawer.<br>
The slow proc makes it a good solo weapon though. But after the slow proced i would switch back to my better DPS weapon.<br>
<br>
Ok, Swiftwind....hmmm. î really thought long, long nights over this weapon and if i really should get it.<br>
Some people told me, come on Deecey, this weapon has 40% haste, you must get it.<br>
Well, ok, 40% haste is really much, but i personally gave it up to solo 90% of the time. I switched that, now im grouping 90% of my time and because of this there is mostly a high level chanter that hastes me up to the skill cap with his spell adding to my item haste. So it doesnt really matter now, if i have 22% or 40% haste unbuffed. So the haste is again only a good solo effect. No use for raids or grouping with a good balanced group.<br>
And about the damage delay. 13/21 isn´t really good stats for an offhand weapon, what i found out about the way dual wield is working.<br>
Now comes the part where im not really sure, if you found out something different or you are sure it works different please correct me here!!!<br>
In my eyes i found out, that the check for the offhand attack only happens after your primary attacked. If you ever wondered about, why Swiftwind is faster than Earthcaller, this is the reason. EC has a delay of 24, that means EC attacks every 2,4 secs without haste. SW has dly 21, that means it would attack evey 2,1 secs if you would wear it in primary. But SW is an offhand weapon, and offhand weapons have always to wait till the primary weapon attacked. So EC and SW would attack every 2,4 secs. In fact, the dly of Swiftwind could also be 15 or even lower, it would only attack after 2,4 secs because it has to wait for the primarys attack.<br>
 I tried out this theory with switching my weapons. Im using a 12/20 piercer in primary and 22/34 slashing in offhand. I switched the slower weapon to primary and so the faster weapon was in offhand. I noticed that my piercer attacked much lesser than before in primary. And that is now the point where im not sure anymore. Did it attack slower or lesser because it had to wait 3,4 secs for the primary or was it because my character failed the dual wield (at 230 now i guess) check a lot of times?!?<br>
Because of this lack of knowledge im using a hard hitting but slow weapon in offhand, it only attacks every second turn after my primary, but does a lot of damage that makes it worth it.<br>
But, regardless if the first theory is right or the other one, 13/21 arent good stats for offhand, because you lack very often the dual wield check, attacking only every second or even third turn and so youre not making much damage with your offhand. I guess and i hope this will getting better when i reached lvl 60 and have higher dual wield skill then and after you got the AA Ability Ambidexterity. <br>
Because of this i would really appreciate feedback of some high end lvl rangers with this ability, for example, Tegamyen, Tressia, Lendien or someone else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Ok, the last thing, i really can´t say anything against it, are the extra stats on the epics. They are really very nice and can help a lot. But for me extra stats on weapons don´t count. Im looking for the best DPS combination and would never use the epics because they give me more hps for example.<br>
<br>
So, considering all this, in my eyes, the Ranger Epics are made for the lonely Ranger out there using his most time with soloing. There are not much better weapons out there if you want to solo much. <br>
(Sure there are, but not every Ranger is member of FE =P)<br>
<br>
So, plz give me feedback what you think about the Epics and if im missing anything in my theory, that could change my mind and feel free to gimme a tell in the game to discuss about that.<br>
So far, i belong with saying: I´m not planning in doing the Epics, because i have no need for them.<br>

The dual wield check on off hand has nothing to do with your main hand. It is done every time you would swing based on the offhand delay timer. <br>
<br>
Now on epics. I take tremendous pride in wielding Swiftwind and Earthcaller. There may be better weapons out there now but I will always be very proud on having achieved these weapons. It took the work of myself and many friends inorder for me to wield these swords and that experience far outways whether there are better available. <br>
<br>
Just my humble opinion.<br>

<br>
The effect Swift Spirit not only gives you 40% item haste but also adds about 30 or 40 to your attack rating (I forget the exact number atm).  The increased attack will increase your DPS with whatever weapon you hold in your main hand and with your bow.  <br>
<br>
This is the main reason most rangers never give up Swiftwind.<br>
<br>
Earthcaller gets bagged more often because of the aggro drawing, mezz breaking proc and because you can find things with better DPS on them.  Not to mention Earthcaller is the more difficult of the two blades to get. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deeceyriverwind>DeeceyRiverwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(11/25/02 5:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Lauri</span><hr size=1> Lauri, you can contact me under FuttererJ@t-online.de <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pricecheckgirl>PriceCheckGirl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(11/25/02 6:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   you got mail</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 <br>
Well.... do you actually want to do a bit of work and build a relationship with people to achieve something or do you want to just whine and complain it isn't worth it.<br>
 <br>
I use my earthcaller when soloing, I switch it out with primal, a proc 40% slow is very nice.<br>
I've also used it in a raid situation, when slow was having a hard time sticking for a shaman, hell 40% slow beats no slow whatsover.<br>
<br>
And 14/24 Good god man that is still freaking awesome compared to other weapons of that time, hell it still is good.<br>
<br>
Swiftwind... 40% permanent haste and atk bonus's.... hard to beat, by almost any other reasonably attainable weapon.<br>
 <br>
I'm sorry but why don't you just say, &quot;hey I'm lazy and don't want to do the epics, I don't want to put the time and energy into it&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't give this bulls<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->hit reason of dps being it.<br>
 <br>
When these came out they were the best things there were, I remember actually working with other rangers serverwide to complete the quest, getting those weapons was probably the proudest moment of my EQ life.<br>
<br>
This is coming from one of the first 10 rangers on the server to have the epics.<br>
<br>
That's my 2 cents. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.insightbb.com/~marncrs/xanthsig3.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
I was astounded by the concept that 14/24 is being considered lousy DPS.  No it isn't the best in the game, but its still very good.  I still use both epics.  Lately I've been considering buying something to swap out with Earthcaller, but its not really a priority.   I do a lot of damage with them still.<br>
<br>
That slow is certainly nice to have.  Even on raids at times, to reiterate your point.  I also love it when it procs first swing and get to see the worn off message later when the shaman<br>
lands theirs to overwrite.  That 50% slow for that time helps.<br>
<br>
The ranger epics perhaps had (or have) the longest usable life as EQ expanded (well excepting the pure utility of the clerics).  They are still perfectly usable by most to this day.<br>
<br>

Now take a look today into the bazaar. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
So you are right, when they came out, they WERE great weapons.<br>
<br>
And Xanthias, you don´t have to say sorry with calling me lazy, if i would read this post i would really think the same about that person.<br>
But actually i have most parts of my epics already and i would have only one step left if i wouldn´t have rejected the Jade Reaver drop while we were doing the Epic Shaman Quest in CoM, cause there was a Druid who was already waiting a very long time for the Jade Reaver.<br>
So, i´m definately not lazy.<br>
And FYI, after Lauris E-Mail, which was a really long and very good one, i`m considering finishing at least Swiftwind. But that will definately NOT be my personal goal in this game.<br>
Hell, what is Verant thinking they are doing here???<br>
Sure, you are right, the Epics WERE THE UBER weapons in this game when they came out and it WAS the goal of my first ranger to get those. But now, after the latest expansions came out there are a LOT of weapons that are better than a 14/24 weapon and fairly easy to get. And in fact, i know a LOT of Rangers who do have Earthcaller, but not using it while grouping or raiding, cause 14/24 IS definately lousy nowadays! <br>
<br>
Ok, Swiftwind is hard to beat, 13/21 isn´t too bad, BUT should be a primary weapon in my eyes, and with the haste of 40% only beaten by the Tolans Longsword of the Glade.<br>
But in my eyes a offhand weapon has to have at least high damage, as long as you don´t have the ability Ambidextirety.<br>
I´m using one piercing and one slashing weapon. In this way i can see how often the Dual Wield check fails at Lvl57.<br>
I found out that you have about a 70% chance of using your offhand weapon at lvl 57. When i put my piercing weapon into offhand i suddenly read ..you slash... nearly as often as .. you pierce.. though my piercing weapon is nearly double as fast as my slashing weapon. <br>
So 13dmg is in my eyes not enough dmg, cause you are not hitting that often with it as you think.<br>

WHEN you all this now have read, what you apparently haven´t done with my first posting, you will see Xanthias, that i´m thinking a lot of DPS, or i wouldn´t waste my time here, about what i have found out about Dual Wielding and wouldn´t have wasted my time in using LOTS of several weapons, switching them from primary to offhand and back, just to find out, with which i would do the best damage per second. Hell, this wasn´t really fun. So, plz don´t call me lazy anymore.<br>
<br>
By the way, apparently Verant suddenly remembered that they introduced Epic weapons a LONG time ago and hell, it seems one of the developers even checked their damage/delay ratios, or there wouldn´t be rumors now, that there will be a quest or any other way in PoP to improve the stats of your epics. Because not only the Ranger epics DPS got lousy over time, take a look at the other epics. Best example, Pally Epic. There was from the beginning on a lot of ranting about it and i think i have only seen 2 pallys in my EQ life who use their epics and i know much more who decided not to do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
At final statement, i´m playing this game for fun and i´m paying a lot of money for it every month, so i have the right to decide if i put a lot of time into achieving the epics and making it my personal EQ goal or if i decide to do the steps for the epics over several months just for fun, so that i can be proud of having them though i will probably not using them.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.: When i made some Rangers very angry about me with  the topic post, i just can say sorry. And Xanthias, i understand you fully. You must be very proud of being one of the first rangers who made the difficult way through the epic steps without any Epic Walkthroughs and now there comes a young Ranger who says it´s a waste of time concentrating on the Epics which were definately great weapons in ancient times!   <p>56th Outrider of Tunare</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deeceyriverwind>DeeceyRiverwind</A> at: 11/26/02 4:44:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cosmodeous>Cosmodeous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(11/26/02 1:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Do I really need the epics??</span><hr size=1> Just a small correction and comments:<br>
<br>
Earthcall<br>
<br>
Slot Description <br>
2:  Decrease Attack Speed by 20% (L1) to 50% (L60) <br>
3:  Decrease Hitpoints by 20 per tick <br>
<br>
1 ticks @L1 to 2.5 mins @L50<br>
<br>
So Earthcall landing on a target is a 50 percent slow and 500 point DoT. (at level 60+)<br>
<br>
<br>
Just the other day in PoV, I was in an XP group where the Shammie and Chanter died due to a train...  I had to snare off the cleric (who had to DA) and start the parking to get it under control while the tank handled the unrootable one.   I swapped in the earthcaller and landed procs while fending them off in my running and rooting parking frenzy.  The cleric was not happy because the mob on the tank wasn't slowed, the slowers were dead, and mana was dumping pretty fast.  I slide in behind the mob after getting the others in control and one Earthcall proc and a couple of jolts later we had drastically turned the odds in our favor.  Swapped the Earthcaller out for my DPS weapon and went back to work, only swapping it back in when the proc wore off on the mob we were fighting.  This coupled with dumping Chloroblasts for healing between mobs taking some of the load off the cleric and giving the other group members more time between fights made all the difference.<br>
<br>
I will never regret going through the trouble of getting both my epics.  I feel it's the same thing with any ranger quest out there.  Ivy Etched?  I did 'em...  SSoM?  Did it...  Trueshot/Raincaller... Yeap.    Quest spell?  You betcha.    Orc Impaler?  Yes.  (the list goes on)  Only ones I haven't done are the VERY new ones (Trueshot Armor/Twlight Armor, etc.) because my gear is better than those atm.<br>
<br>
I guess it's just a matter of what you play the game for...  I play to be the most well-rounded Ranger I can be.  When I'm not raiding or helping someone, I'm questing or grinding AA... <br>
<br>
<br>
If you put the time into it to develop the core people who will be interested in helping you ... then I'd have to say getting your Swiftwind is a MUST.  Earthcaller is a luck of the draw thing on the Mini's not being a pain every time you go.<br>
<br>
<br>
No one can tell you the sense of completion you'll get when you finally have both epics.   It's just something you have to experience for yourself.<br>

<br>
Ok anyway - there should be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no question</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about getting the ranger epics or not.  <br>
<br>
earthcaller:  you need to take into account that the dmg/delay are supported by the 40% haste.  Only higher haste in game to my knowlege is 41%.   Great when on a raid and all of the sudden the only shaman that showed up gets instagibbed and the ranger whips out earthcaller and hits the hotkey &quot;EMPEROR CRUSH IS SLOWED, BITE ME!&quot; heh, this actually happened on a sleeper raid once ( and um, no emp crush was not in the zone).  and yes, i use it (or used to) soloing.  I also use it when MAing in exp groups.  The funnest group was w/out any enchanter or shaman and the only slows on the mob were coming from earthcaller - god help the poor cleric that got a workout that day <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   and who cares about agro, that's why the gods gave us jolt. if agro is your concern keep jolting blades up instead of call of fire or whatever proc spell you use.<br>
<br>
swiftwind: hello, 40 attack 40 haste.  yes I have tolans longsword of the glade, and for a long time swiftwind was bagged and forgotten, except on the rare mob where I could actually do more than 2 damage with archery, or they weren't walled, or rooted.  pre-PoP yes, swiftwind was bagged alot - but NEVER OMG NO NEVER GIVE UP 40% HASTE WHAT ARE YOU THINKING /wig off.  anyway, i tend to wield swiftwind a majority of the time now for the haste and the attack used with archery.  <br>
<br>
ranger epics flat out own, not to mention they look bad ass.  whether you bag and use on occassion or all the time, i will never regret the countless hours of foraging, nor ever forget the help I received in the last few steps /tacklehugs teggybear <br>

DPS means damage per SECOND. I doubt that you can do much more damamge than 30 to 35 damage per SECOND with using both epics.

You gave us numbers, DPS, and yes, I think we all know what DPS means.  <br>
<br>
We asked for more information, you chose not to give it.  It's hard to believe that the rangers with swiftwind were not doing at least the same damage as you as long as they were equipped decently in their primary hand or you have top end swords yourself.   That's what doesn't add up.<br>
<br>
You specifically asked that someone like Tressia respond to this thread, she did and other experienced rangers did to, and you just blow off their opinion.  Why did you ask the question in the first place?  You've decided the epics are not worth your time, fine, no need to rub in what you perceive as the worthlessness of them to others.<br>
<br>
Simply put, the ranger epics are not the best weapons in the game, but they are very far from worthless, and I still contend their duration of usefulness exceeds many other classes epic and remains useful to rangers to this day.<br>
<br>
I am still proudly using mine.  Shopping for an Earthcaller replacement to use each in the correct situation, just as I pull out my windblade when its appropriate to use that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Modified my statement comparing epics. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=exidorgangleri>Exidor Gangleri</A> at: 12/12/02 9:28:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalaiswarbringer>Kalais Warbringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/11/02 2:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=50.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Do I really need the epics??</span><hr size=1> Need Attk stats, str, dex.  Have to look at all this stuff in order to figure out the numbers.  I agree that the stats just don't look right, sure if you have endgame weapons you will beat the hell DPS wise out of a epic ranger, but I most don't have anything like that. <p>Only one who's powers are great and pure can gain knowledge on the ancient art of the Ranger Gate!<br>
