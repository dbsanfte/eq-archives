Hmm Sorry, the sad story about the poor family doesn't work for me. We already have so much government assistance out there that its' not funny. If there is a family that can't provide the basic needs (basic needs, not luxury) to its kids then its their own fault.<br>

Personally, Im glad the rich are getting some of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>their</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> money back. When (yes, when) my family becomes rich, I'll want to keep every penny from the governments hands that I can. And no I'm not being greedy, I just belive its not the governments job to play Robin Hood to the masses.<br>

I grew up on welfare too, and I've made a great life for myself despite that.  That doesn't mean that I think it should be abolished, or that anyone with low income is poor because they're &quot;lazy.&quot;  If you hadn't been there to help your wife and her child, would you say she's &quot;lazy&quot; if she were on assistance to support herself?<br>

$1000 dollars doesnt even pay the mortgage on my house for a month, and its only a 2 bedroom 2 bath. Tell me how 1000 will save the sinking economy and whopping unemployment rate for an average family. <br>
<br>
Also, 40,000 is enough not to be considered eligible for ANY government aid, as you are not considered impoverished by government standards. You are mistaken if you think I am talking about welfare families here, there are plenty of families not on welfare who earn 40,000 a year because both members of the household are unskilled workers (exploited by the rich) who bust there ass 8 hours of every day, some even have to work 2 jobs to make ends meet... <br>

I know, I was one of them for a long time up until a couple of years ago. I started my &quot;career&quot; in lower management for a Drug store chain, 50-60 hours a week, 19K a year. But I worked hard and got raises as I made myself irreplaceable to the company, then I was able to make lateral job changes in different fields once I had a resume built up. <br>
<br>
At no time did I feel the Government owed me anything. Or that the rich were stealing from me. Its all about attitude I guess.<br>

I'm sorry if thats how I came off, because thats not what I belive at all. I belive all the poor have potential and don't have to be poor. It may require working two jobs whille they take classes on the side, but they can do it.<br>
<br>
I belive the welfare system is a good thing. It should be advailable to give a helping hand up for those that have stumbled. But the way the system works now, you get punished for working, and rewarded for having more kids.<br>

You don't have to move to Greenland to do that, Quiss. Canada is much closer.<br>

<br>
Lest you get the wrong idea, I'll clarify.  War is a necessary element of human existence.  This is a no-brainer; we can no sooner eradicate base human aggression than we can eradicate the need to defecate.  I'm not anti-war...far from it.  I'm anti-unnecessary war.  <br>
<br>
When we repelled Iraq's aggression against Kuwait 12 years ago, I believe we were justified.  I believe that industrial interests were still a mitigating factor for the conflict, but I still believe we were preventing imperialist aggression nevertheless.  Today, WE are the imperialist aggressor.  Iraq hasn't invaded anywhere, and if they're in violation of UN policy, then the UN is responsible for the policing action.  That's why it exists.  Yes, American soldiers should be ready to lay down their lives, but not like this.  This time, we can't even blame the spread of Communism.  This is not going to be Bastogne, or Chosin, or the Mekong Delta.  It's going to be a debacle, and a foreign relations nightmare.<br>
<br>
Hussein is a maniac, clearly.  That doesn't give us the responsibility of ousting him, any more than it gives us the responsibility of ousting any of the other petty banana republic despots throughout the world.  Would I lay down my life to fight what I thought was evil?  Absolutely.  That doesn't mean I think we need to take the morbid responsibility of rooting evil out worldwide, or step in to take the brunt of the casualties in such a search, particularly when Kofi Annan is practically BEGGING us to back off a little and let his organization do its job.  Yes, the UN can be impotent (and incompetent), but that doesn't change its existence or the need to adhere to policies we agreed on.  The hypocrisy of bearing down on Iraq while simultaneously and systematically ignoring the gross disregard of UN policy by Israel is astounding.  If Hussein himself is the primary reason for this aggression, then send Delta, or Seal-6, or whomever...but don't make this out to be Hitler invading Poland, because it isn't.  Hussein makes Hitler look like a MENSA scholar. <br>
<br>
If you've seen combat, and watched men you love or men you command die, then you MUST understand how hard it is to hear people clamoring to support a conflict like this when they know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that their own lives will NEVER be in danger.  The world has enough armchair generals.  Does that mean that I think that civilians should have no impact on military policy?  Of course not.  It does mean, however, that if I see people spewing half-informed, spoonfed opinions that might lead to people I know dying while those same ignoramuses stay at home watching &quot;American Idol&quot; and lamenting the fact that they have to be up at 8 AM for work, you bet I'll claim that servicemen should have something to say.<br>
<br>
Yes, it's part of the job, and anyone who signs on the line knows it.  Dying is the sh!tty part.  If I worked at McDonald's, and my manager told me to empty out the scalding hot fry oil 5 minutes after it had been changed with very few good reasons, I'd have something to say then too: I'd tell him to do it himself.  <br>
<br>
That's all I'm saying to Ripert.  If you're going to vocally express an opinion like that, be prepared to put your money where your mouth is.  Don't simply agree that it's a good idea to send thousands of people to their potential death because a politician on TV said it's a good idea.<br>
<br>
Who knows?  Blix and his crew found missiles today--maybe they'll have legitimate, worthwhile evidence to justify action.  At this point, however, all I see is the loudmouth posturing of a pair of buffoons who are going at it outside a bar.  Until I see something a little more convincing, I don't think it justifies the death of any American soldiers, nor I do see any reason for a ground-based invasion.  Pave Lows and Predators are one thing...an entire battle group is another.        <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rodomatic>Rodomatic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My other horsie<BR>is a Bronco</span><br>  Posts: 660<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/16/03 9:19:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=382.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> I want to see Bush's fuckin ass out there with an M-16 on the front line.

It's easy, like Ayerish said, to sit in your chair with an ice cold CocaCola watching the news and agreeing with this bullshit. It's another thing when you don't agree with it and have a good chance of getting drafted to go fight in something that you don't believe in nor give two shits about. Not to mention pay taxes to fund Bush's hard-on for Hussein. We'll end up blowing the hell out of Iraq, then spending billions repairing what we blew up.<br>
<br>
Bush is going to catch lead if this escalates. I can almost guarantee it. (obviously this is just an opinion, so you pansies don't report me to the FBI or something)<br>

Does it mean every family getting it can now live the Life of Riley, nope.<br>
 My opinion on the Iraq issue and folks saying it is all about oil, is that it isn't. Even with Iraqs oil reserves it just isn't that big  a deal. I believe I saw/read that at most it would be  5 year supply of oil. I do believe Iraq (Saddam) presents a danger to the world community. Saddam has shown he is an unpredictable nutcase coupled with the fact that he has ( I believe ) WMD and that to me sets him apart from many other despots around the world. Is going to war with him the best way to solve this problem? I don't know. I am sure that I do not have all the facts and that no one else posting here does either. No amount of sifting through the media is likely to generate all the facts. Everyone mouthing off how bad Bush is for wrongly going after Saddam are as guilty of lack of facts as those stating to go blast the hell out of him. I do ask this. Who actually thinks that there is going to be a huge loss of American lives if we go to war? Most people thought that the last time we went there and were totally wrong. The only way that will happen is if Saddam has WMD. Just my 2 cents worth... er 2cp. This is after all an EQ related board.<br>

er, right.  you seem to be able to acquire some lovely factual information.  please check to see which corporations were involved with the reconstruction on the oil fields and the cities.  furthermore, please check to see who the board of directors were for these companies.  this is repetitive.  it has been proven before but ignored by the blitzkrieg of media attention to other unrelated matters.<br>
