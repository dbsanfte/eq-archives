I definitely agree with you.  I don't think we really have any comprehension of just how much hate there is there.  Neither side is the &quot;good&quot; side.  The Israelis are just as guilty as the Palestinians are.  The thing I find sad is a majority of us have this angelic view of Israel and this idea of the nefarious Palestinian.<br>

After all, my ranting about this subject has always been about how its the JEWS that are killing the MUSLIMS, and how the JEWS are getting American money, and how its always the JEWS fault for getting themselves in this mess to begin with.<br>
<br>
I dont know what your problem is, because I never look at it as an issue of Jews vs. anything. Israel isnt quite a theocracy, and there isnt anything in the Torah that says &quot;Go ahead and brutally occupy whoever might be in the Promised Land at the time.&quot; Its a political thing. It doesnt boil down to an American who just hates guys named Greenburg for no reason, its boils down to said American who sees a problem with America morally and financially supporting a government that does nothing but perpetuate a whirlwind of violence around itself. <br>

Would you people call the guy in Tiananmen Square an idiot? He was doing the same thing, standing in front of something heavy that represented whats wrong. He was, of course, a little luckier, but basically the same. This wasnt a peace protester trying to get in the way of a guy with a nail bomb in his vest in Tel Aviv, this was peace protester standing in front of a government bulldozer.

If the woman in question had been a Palestinian, I might feel a little more sympathetic toward her, what with it being HER fight and all.  Instead, I feel like she's an American who wanted some attention, and was willing to give her life to get it.  If she had just been one more Palestinian, you wouldn't have read about it. <br>

I don't think Rustem is saying he's anti-sematic at all.  You're completely reading him wrong.  What I get from what he's posted is that he is trying to make a point that the Israelis have their faults also.<br>
<br>
Basing an argument that someone is &quot;evil&quot; because they're Muslim or Jewish is a pretty pathetic argument.  That war has everything to do with religion, but neither of those sides represent the majority of people involved in the religion.<br>
<br>
IMO they're both symbolic of two little children who are too immature to share.  There will never be a resolution because neither countries' government will ever agree to a joint ownership.  <br>
<br>

I will leave it to you all to decide if there is in fact a fine line of difference between the two points of view.  I, at least, am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on this point.<br>
<br>
Rustem, I understand the point you are trying to make; that Israel is not without blame in this conflict, and that more Americans ought to recognize this fact.  You seem to feel that the United States should withdraw it's military and financial support from Israel because of this.<br>
<br>
However in my opinion, aside from being overly simplistic on that point [perhaps to the point of dangerous naivity], you seem to be as guilty as those you rant about.  You SEEM to have tunnel vision as far as Hammas, Hesboulah(sp?), and the PLO are concerned.  If Israel has been arbitrary, heavy-handed, and at times unjust in this whole quagmire; then how much more so are the Palestinians?<br>
<br>
A number of posters here have made the point that the hatreds there are very very deep, and it is doubtful that any of us have an appreciation for that unless we have experienced it.<br>
<br>
The whole point of this thread was about the young woman who placed herself into the middle of that situation and died as a result of it.  I hope she knew what she was doing and was willing to make the sacrifice that she wound up having to make.  If she was over there just PLAYING the outraged liberal standing up for what she considered to be the [poor, downtrodden, oppressed, yadda yadda yadda...] Palestinians, and didn't really understand what the cosequences of that meddling might be, then what a WASTE of her life!<br>
<br>
If you're going to talk the talk, you better be prepared to walk the walk.  The tragedy is that even if she knew what she was doing, and even if she was willing to make that sacrifice, it will change nothing at all over there, and her life was thrown away meaninglessly!  That, in my opinion, is sad.<br>

<br>
I guess that's the way you rationalize things.  If the media potrays a country as being evil, then every person within that country is evil! <br>
<br>
You obviously know nothing about the mentality (I don't think any of us really do) of these people who do the suicide bombing.  The people who usually commit into this are very poor, un-educated young people who are brainwashed to believe what they're doing is the right thing.  The Muslim religion is warped by some sick people that are heading the Hamas and other similiar organizations.  They use this warped religion as propaganda to coerce these people into doing these type of things.  They are promised a great life in heaven with all the things they lack in life.  They are also promised that their families will be looked after and well taken care of financially.  <br>
<br>
I don't think any of us could ever come near rationalizing the state of mind these people are in.  I very much doubt any of us have been in that awful of circumstances.  If you want to place blame anywhere, place it on the organizations like the Hamas, don't place it on the many civilians who were not as lucky as you to be bred into a family who could provide their children with the better things in life.<br>
<br>
You're condemning an entire country of people by the actions of a few.  In my mind, you are the pathetic one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I have two, in fact, which cannot always be said of the victims of the people who decide to strap on a bomb belt so they can spend eternity eating purple bananas in Amenthe, or changing bus tires in the Elysian Fields, or playing tiddlywinks in Valhallah, or otherwise indulging in whatever ridiculous fantasy they subscribe to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garduk>Garduk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 403<br> <font color=#628CBC>(3/19/03 12:34:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: American killed...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This woman's action is exactly the kind of meddling that should NOT be happening on behalf of the U.S.<br>

The world have taken Israels side in the conflict. Perhaps all the media, i wouldn't say propaganda but the media usually dont show the entire truth, have guided her to her decission to stand infront of the bulldozer in the first place.<br>
<br>
To stand infront of a truck loaded with explosives is sure suicide aswell. A person driving a bulldozer might stop. A person driving a truck with bombs wouldnt, heck the driver is sure to die in the blast, why would he stop for demonstrants?<br>
<br>
Usa, or the rest of the world have no right to take sides and expect mercy. But still we do. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ancientsaga.com/images/sigs/Signature.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

You obviously know nothing about the mentality (I don't think any of us really do) of these people who do the suicide bombing. The people who usually commit into this are very poor, un-educated young people who are brainwashed to believe what they're doing is the right thing. The Muslim religion is warped by some sick people that are heading the Hamas and other similiar organizations. They use this warped religion as propaganda to coerce these people into doing these type of things. They are promised a great life in heaven with all the things they lack in life. They are also promised that their families will be looked after and well taken care of financially. <br>

     Look no further than the Smart case and you'll see that this kind of religious fanaticism is not unique to Islam. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=finnigan@mtboards>Finnigan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#628CBC>(3/19/03 1:50:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: American killed by Israeli military</span><hr size=1> Hallelujah!<br>

The veneer of civilization is thinner than most realize.  It does not take much of a scratch to expose the fear and superstition that lies just below the surface.<br>
<br>
That is not to say that I am condemning anyone for their religious beliefs; far from it!  In many ways I am envious of the comfort they derive from their faith.  [Taking the shirt off someone else's back will not make yours any warmer.]<br>
<br>
However when those beliefs, from whatever religion, are forced onto others, nothing but disaster follows.  It is sad and ironic that so much evil and so many millions of deaths throughout the centuries have been at the hands of those trying to force their beliefs onto others in the name of 'good'.<br>
<br>
Sadly that religious intolerance seems to be alive and well as we enter into the 21st century.<br>
<br>
Call me a pessimist, but I do not foresee that it will ever change.  And the beat goes on...<br>

Actually, I probably would have. I have CNN, and I read the newspaper daily. Theres really no point in bringing up every time a terrorist attack or military retaliation goes on in Israel, because its almost daily... I would flood this board if I brought the subject up every time something like this happened. I read the 'Israeli military guns down IRF leader down in bloody shootout' articles with just a desire to see where theyre standing, and the 'Israeli military accidentally shoots ten year old boy at funeral' with a little more interest.<br>

Actually, its pretty much just the United States. Look on any Israeli political webpage and youll see that the world has taken a from the fence point of view about the whole thing, if not openly supporting the Palestinian point of view.<br>

As far as the 'well theres bad on both sides' thing, theres a difference between Hamas and Hezbollah, and the Israeli government. One is a recognized state that does this daily, and the others are rogue extremists who do the same. One is a member of the UN, the others are trying to carve out an actual country to begin with (abysmal methods yielding abysmal results). My tunnel vision isnt as narrow as you think, nothing will come of violence to stop violence. Awhile ago I supported the PLO, but after over half a year of watching the outcome of their MO, Ive taken a more 'get Ghandi in there' point of view.<br>

hmmm. what i remeber from the coverage of tienimen square was that when the big guns started rolling in the people started running out. unfortunately its pretty hard to out run a 50ton slab of steel moving at 50mph or greater.<br>
