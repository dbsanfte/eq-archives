Here are some people I always thought did sweetly in their class:<br>
<br>
Bard - Bofa, Ive seen him pull some crazy $hit and walk away saving the day.<br>
<br>
Beastlord - Beata, can fill in for a shaman in a pinch and knock out some fine DPS too.<br>
<br>
Cleric - Toss up between two healers who have made damn sure I never joined the purple club.  Tissa and Hvyarms have insane healing prowess<br>
<br>
Druid - Phalnobor, most druids who are familiar with their class end up being the same, but Phal could fill in as a cleric in a pich and is damn quick at catching heals.  Awesome puller too...<br>
<br>
Enchanter - Calera ... Smart &amp; sexy<br>
<br>
Magician - Sassy, I knew her with my first toon.  I havent kept in touch but I know she is still damn good at what she does.<br>
<br>
Monk - I thought Feigning was one of the best monks I ever saw.  Not sure he plays anymore, but Caball makes a very close second, almost indifferent between the the two.<br>
<br>
Necromancer - Hands down before his banning it was Scrapa.  I hated him with a passion, but I respected him.  Elandria makes my list as still playing and best in class.<br>
<br>
Paladin - Tantrik being one of the only paladins I know and he MAs for us on many encounters.  He is a little stiff sometimes, but he is kind and giving as well, making him one of the most sacrificing players on the server.<br>
<br>
Ranger - Curyllic makes top of my list.  One of the few rangers I can honestly say does not fall into the classic &quot;paper tank&quot; role.<br>
<br>
Rogue - Dubb, one of the very best rogues on the server hands down.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knight - Thoruk or Torah, both know their classes and can make even warriors scream &quot;hey, give me that back...&quot;<br>
<br>
Shaman - Litgruv, I have long respected his shamanistic abilities.  AV is lucky to have him.<br>
<br>
Warrior -  Nwinki ... nuff said<br>
<br>
Wizard - Only wizard I ever ask questions to is Tulinx.  I respect his time sink into quite possibly the most boring class in the game (yes, my own class too).<br>

<br>
Bard: Lyissa, only grouped with her once in my my lower to mid 50's, but she was outstanding. Not to mention the fact that I live in constant fear of her.<br>
<br>
Beastlord: Bengali. Even though I haven't grouped with many beastlords, I'm pretty confident with this statement.<br>
<br>
Cleric: Olauf. Before the Navy stole him, he was the most insane cleric I met. He'd nuke, he'd melee, he'd keep everyone healed and he didn't have the best gear.<br>
<br>
Druid: Jaysen. Always quick with a heal, a damage shield, a nuke, a DoT, whatever you need. He never went into a raid guild, but any raid guild who wants a druid would want him.<br>
<br>
Enchanter: Aephrodite. Quick on mezzes and buffs, willing to rune, stun, do whatever to keep the group alive.<br>
<br>
Mage: Too close to call between too many<br>
<br>
Necromancer: Tinlain. The man is a monster with charmed undead. He even got rid of his pink dress with LoY dyes.<br>
<br>
Paladin: Personal experience would be Tingling/Tiralle. Respect for knowledge of the game via posts on various boards would be Tram.<br>
<br>
Ranger: Skykam. Damage? Of course. Timely tiny heals? Of course! Pulling? You know it.<br>
<br>
Rogue: Tossup between Wydow and Domn. Both were ROGUES. Both wanted to explore all the abilities of the class and not just be DPS. Probably a nod to Wydow because Domn cost me 2 hours of my life because he swore he could get our corpses from a bad pull by me past the Herbalist.<br>
<br>
Shadow Knight: Syrous. I'm surprised that more HoH people don't mention him. He was an outstanding puller and tank and knew how to be a gimpy DPS provider when necessary.<br>
<br>
Shaman: Xeera. Quick with slows, debuffs, DoTs, buffs, DD, pets, whatever. She's just awesome.<br>
<br>
Warrior: Janson. The man understands his class and the game. He also has to deal with me more than anyone else, so he get bonus points for that.<br>
<br>
Wizard: Chrissepwoz. The most arrogant person you'll ever meet. The best and most loyal friend you'll ever meet.  The nukingest person you'll ever meet without seeing a bloodstain on the ground. He got that much more scary with his Maelin's Leggings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thematisse>TheMatisse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(8/21/03 2:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www3.telus.net/jz/4icon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Q</span><hr size=1> This is not a hard game to play, so unless you have a bad computer and are always laggy, or you're not very bright and can't understand simple game strategies, or you have damaged your wrists beyond repair and can't move your hand anymore so you're playing with your feet, it is very likely you are a good player no matter what class you play.  Therefore this post would be better called: &quot;The people I had a good group with at some point or another&quot;.  It would be much easier and a much shorter list to name people who really suck, but you see that in rants all the time, so there would be not point for it. <br>
<br>
Yes, there are those people, who do more than they are expected to do and would be worth mentioning. It's not often I get healed by a ranger, or have a wizard take agro from my charmed pet so I can charm it again at my leisure.  Most people out there are lazy like myself and rarely go the extra mile and that's great.  For me the entertaining group chat matters more than the speed the group kills at.  <br>
<br>
So, if I ever grouped with anyone and I didn't snap at them or found myself a replacement a bit too quick and stayed on line afterwards, I probably found them to be outstanding players of their classes and enjoyed their company.<br>

Folks from Bad Faction will most likely not have grouped with anyone from Burn at any length so it's unlikely they will stand out.<br>
<br>
Like Fourier said, the game is not hard, and those that stand out as amazing players of one class would most likely be at the top of any other class were they to play one. That being said.<br>
<br>
Rogue: Wydow. I have always always asked Wydow when I needed any advise about my class. Asking me how to do something is one of the best compliments she can give. We race each other to corpses that need to be dragged. Wydow always seems to steal a corpse out from under me.<br>
<br>
Bard: Aledark. Try kiting a red con mob in circles while twisting 5-6 songs, and chatting with your group. Then do that for several hours on end.<br>
<br>
SK: Torahdane. Amazing SK.<br>
<br>
Pally: Tram.<br>
<br>
Mage: Cydmab. On almost every named fight Cyd will have his aggro calculated so precisely that he ends up getting summoned just as the mob dies. I've never seen anything like it.<br>
<br>
Shaman: Lupuri. Buffs when you ask. Debuffs when they are needed. And every once in a while when the pullers would slip up, there would be 4-6 mobs in camp running loose and all of a sudden Lupuri would pull an AE slow out from no where save most of the raid and live through it.<br>
<br>
Cleric: Ceri. People just do not die when Ceri is around. All of FECU is amazing, but Ceri stands out. While I'm trying to limit these to one each, I feel I should also mention Mulanna and Kuroni.<br>
<br>
Chanter: Aerial. One tell for haste at the begining of a raid and I would have haste just as it started blinking all night long. Not to mention the insane number of things Aerial can keep mezed at once.<br>
<br>
Monk: Solthan. If it could be split, it was single before it got to us.<br>
<br>
Warrior: Boogalooga. <br>
<br>
Ranger: Tegamyen.<br>
<br>
Wizard: Tulinx. As loud and obnoxious as he is, he's rarely afk and he knows what he's doing.<br>
<br>
Necro: Ripert. The few times I've grouped with Ripert he's done the job of half of what a normal group would do.<br>
<br>
Druid: Strax. I've seen Strax do so many insane things I can't begin to pick one to tell.<br>
<br>
Gultan Stormrider<br>
A Gentleman Assassin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xanitamt>XanitaMT</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/uk_anime_fan/hellsing/alucard_tounge.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(8/21/03 4:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=885.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Q</span><hr size=1> Just approving on some points, I'll try not to list half my guild's roster.. uh hu.<br>
FE definitly as incredible clerics, makes me feel jealous of the whole guild! Rock on FECU.<br>
I'm sure Wydow has to be an excellent mentor for anyone that plays around her. Bettencourt always impressed me for his skills, too. Nuno just never died, and was great fun to talk to.<br>
<br>
No offense to others but Bluudson is the best shaman you can get in a raid with you. Same goes for Treantil on druid matters, and Kaymar is of course the funniest damn person on Morrel Thule.<br>
<br>
Finally, no one hydras like Magikhan/Ibbuny/Mollax, takes a while to get used to, but start exping with the Magician, you'll see the cleric heals from outside the group as she nukes with Ibby, all the while chatting with you and you'll see what I mean. I owe him some of the finest groups I ever had. <br>

Best 2 boxer would have to be Hurtt, playing MA and only shaman on raids and still holding conversations with several people at once night after night never ceased to amaze me.  Chrome is a close 2nd.  TW had an awful lot of 2 boxers (1/3 of the raid many days)<br>
