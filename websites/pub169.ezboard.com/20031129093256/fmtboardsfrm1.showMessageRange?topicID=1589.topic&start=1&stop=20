<br>
Since my computer died, I've not played EQ really...rarely at all..mostly cause Garad has the most awful colors for everything, and I can't change them, so I just don't play.  But I realized tonight, there's no desire.  At all.  Zero, zilch, nada.  Now, a year ago, I thought I was quitting, and didn't after a few weeks break.  So...it's been a good 3 weeks now...just wondering how y'all decided to quit, not play anymore.<br>

I'm usually not one to do the same thing over and over and over again, or sit around and wait and wait for a spawn or an opportunity.  Sad thing is, I'll probably hit EQ2 when it comes out just to see.<br>
<br>
I miss some of the friends I made, but I keep in email or IM contact with most.  <br>
<br>
Since quitting, I've gotten much better at my dart game, and my son gets more use of the computer (though I hate listening to Blue's Clues music so damn much) <p>http://www.geocities.com/drackster2003/<br>

First time I quit was due to Family issues. I came back around 3months later because i missed my in-game friends. <br>
<br>
I quit a second time (with another character) was due to my DSL going out. During that 1 month time, I had no desire to go onto EQ. Only to talk to my friends(see above).Thats When EQim came out, so I just gave my account away not wanting it back to my friends. I use EQim and other Messangers to talk to them, and I joined the army soon after I quit EQ. <br>
<br>
Funny thing is right when I quit, I got invited to SWG(another Sony game and planetside on the same day)<br>
Played for 4years before i quit, never reached 60. but had a blast along the way. No intensions of coming back only for friends sake, but for the game itself nada.<br>
<br>
Youll just know when you want to leave. It will just click, if you get the urge to come back just spend your time somewhere else.  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:teal;font-family:georgia;">Retired Conjuror of MT v1.0 Varissa<br>

But that's not the reason I want to leave, its just the means to stay gone and not come back again:P The reason to leave is always the same reason, no desire to play.  The reason to come back is also, always the same. Missing EQ friends and lack of anything better to do.<br>

i know sony is cooking up some new thingies but i wont be part of anny of em,it all begins with respect towards those who play the game,or so i feel<br>
<br>
why go play eq2 if they show behaviour like they showed us in the last 4 years?&gt;example&gt;i think that nerfing monks ac because warriors feel gimmped is insane ,why not upgrade the warriors instead of taking ac from monks that worked so dam hard to get each of those ac points?,why not compensate wizards for there lost porting abilaties,why make skills more easy and why hook em to other stats then int and wis????,i for one have worked years to get my 247 int and i always felt that the int items where far more harder to get then other stats because int was hooked to the skills,sure wisdom was hooked to em aswell but there was an diff between int and wisdom,,so afther 3 years i got high enough in skills to do almost all,i had enough int scrapped together along the years to get good combines,ONLY to find that now my lvl 25 ogre with his 230 str has same or beter succes with smithing,i am all for changes and a game should evolve and no u cant take a allround populair desision if u are as big as sony ,BUT i am sure that manny know what i am talking about,i feel like i am ripped of alot of time i could have spended in a more productive manner,playing eq was my choise ,true,as it is my choise not to play anny sony products in the future<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> THANKS for letting me rant here:P<br>

<br>
I have nothing bad to say about the game, it was lots of fun while it lasted but the fun started to wear very thin the closer I got to level 60 and frankly the time sink to accomplish anything 60+ isn't really worth that much of my time. <br>
<br>
 My typical EQ evening lately consisted of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>run here, buff, med,heal,die, buff some more, heal, heal, die and 6 hours later= you have gained 2 yellow in AA!!!! </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Tomorrow's game day= rinse gargle and repeat     HOORAY!      <br>

The repetitive nature finally got on my nerves I guess      =p<br>

Raah is 2 frikkin years old, and should be level 1000. First time I quit was 6 mos after starting, when I was disenchanted by the backstabbing, double-talking drama queens of the entire community I was involved with. Second time was because I went between level 50 and 49 repeatedly for a month due to my ISP disconnecting me only after pulling 4 wyverns in CS. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Ask anyone I know IRL. I love having a RL, doing stuff with friends, camping, happy hours (yum!) and just fiddling around in my woodshop... when it get to the point where logging in is a JOB, and no longer fun, that's when I quit.<br>

Mostly I find I haven't logged in for a while. Usually this has to do with getting interested in another game--either DAOC or UO. <br>
<br>
Other than the release of DAOC, I think the other times where twice where the servers were down so often that I simply started to play something else while MT was down and that ended up being long enough to get hooked. And last time I simply could not buy a group for cash money and after the third straight night of spamming LFG, I found better things to do.<br>
<br>
I usually cancel the account when i realize I haven't logged in for a few weeks. If you're not playing save your money. Your characters and items will be here when you get back. <p><table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><td><img src="http://www.webcom.com/lstead/numtini.jpg" width="64" height="100"></td><td><table style="font-family:verdana,arial;" border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;"><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66813" title="<insert popup caption here>" style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:700;">Numtini Lightheart</A></td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">51st Season Champion of Ak'Anon</td></tr><tr><td style="font-size:10pt;">Member, <A HREF="http://pub96.ezboard.com/beqcivismacto" title="Civis Macto Website" style="color:#ff0000;">Civis Macto</A></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>

<br>
Quit the 2nd time on a 45 Enchanter (Pead) 2 years ago due to just getting bored of the same old exp grind, and was also when I was getting ready to go to college.<br>
<br>
Quit the 3rd time on a 65 Enchanter (Toopik) 6 Months ago, because I was tired of playing an enchanter, and mainly...because I needed some money for school. =P  Sold him to make sure that I didn't come back.<br>

Quitting the 4th time probably in a week or so, because I'm moving back to Florida - and will be back out of this redneck, inbred state of Ohio : P Also, 57 is a pretty damn boring level for a necro...killing big ass bugs in PoD 15 hours for no loot, and just to get a level is pretty gay.  Will probably keep Nimzzors account active for rainy days, and late nights...but I definitely won't be playing regularly like I have been.<br>
<br>
So, I think quitting and coming back is more regular than people think..but my suggestion is if you feel that you are addicted to the game, and truely need out.  Either delete the toon, or PA it.

<br>
I could'nt just log in and play for an hour at level 61 anymore. It was either log in and speand 1hour or more assembling a group, and then speand multiple hours EXP grinding.. or it was speanding multiple hours prepping then raiding then recovering corpses.<br>
<br>
So basically it became a second job.. there was no ability to just up and leave whenever i wanted, because i always felt a sense of responsibilty to the people in the group/raid, to stay. (someone had to prance nimbly!)<br>
<br>
Still miss all those great people in EE and GoB.. <br>
