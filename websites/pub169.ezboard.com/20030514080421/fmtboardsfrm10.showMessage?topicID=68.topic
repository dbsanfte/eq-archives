Grouping guilds</span><hr size=1> I find an occasional (once a week) raid fun. When you are level 60+, I just do not see how raiding advances your character all that much. <br>
<br>
   Any exp I get is usually negated by the loss from wipeouts.<br>
It is extrordinarlily rare anything drops I even want and if it did I would be outbid.<br>
      Experince groups are primarily how you advance your character by gaining levels or AAXP.<br>
<br>
    I seem to be always wasting time LFG.<br>
I just wonder Is, are their a guilds (on this server) whose primary focus is grouping together with other guildmates for exp.<br>
<br>
     Am, I weird or asking too much, for thinking grouping together should be the number one priority of at least one decent size level 60+ guild.<br>
<br>
        I quit my first guild because a group of 5 guildmates,  chose a non-guild member to join there group because that characters class was slightly more advantageous to the group than mine. They invite this non-guild person, and all go running off to SEB and I am left spending the next hour LFG.<br>
    The second guild I was in, disolved. But I remember the guild leaders preaching; 'its not the guilds job to help you find a group.'  The group leaders all grouped together but never had a space for anyone else in guild.<br>
<br>
       I have asked a number of people in different guilds, and they always say &quot;we group with other guild members when we can&quot;<br>
I guess I am looking for more of a focus on grouping than that.<br>
I do not think it is asking to much that if a guild member logs on and is having difficulty finding a group; and you are in a group with say 4 guildmates and 2 people from other guilds, that the four of you excuse your self from the group and then start a new group including the guild mate who was lfg.<br>
or<br>
that you log on and wait 10 or 15 minutes for other guildmates to logon so you can form a guild group.  <br>
<br>
       I wonder why guilds do not work out some schedule for guild members to log on at a set time and form guild groups.<br>
<br>
    I know one thing that makes this a problem more difficult, is everyones play schedule is diiferent, time zone, start time and play lengeth are rarely the same.<br>
    Also no matter how good the intentions a small guild has a problem having enough players of the same level on at the same times day after day.<br>
<br>
          This is just my impression, and frustration.  I would love to be able to log on 5 nights a week at 8:30 EST and be able to find a group quickly and start racking up exp for the next 3 or 4 hours; but I have been unable to accomplish this. <br>

My guild was about to target Vindi and like mobs when we had a backslide, so we're still trying to best Gore.<br>
<br>
I know (or at least I think I do), Elder Servitor has in their bylaws that if a guildie is looking for a group, you are to group with them above all else, even if that means leaving your group.  Please someone correct me if I have the wrong guild here.<br>
<br>
But level dispersement does play a factor I know.  With my guild, we went from a mid-high 50's guild to a mid 40's guild within a few weeks time.  We're teaching the younger crew how to raid so hopefully in several months we will be close to where we were strength wise.  Once you hit 61, exp outside of PoP doesn't happen as often - in Fungus at 62, almost all mobs turn light blue to you.  That forces the higher lvl folks to group in different places than than younger folk, where as before you could still group together.<br>
<br>
Now, 60+ are getting flagged for tier 2 zones, which other folks are struggling in tier 1 zones.<br>
<br>
It does seem that there are no high level guilds that are not raiding guild; like Elder Servitor's non-NBG motto, it is a new concept and one I bet a number of other folks would be interested in.  <br>
<br>
You might have just found a pocket of opportunity.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One if the most important reasons that Elder Servitor was created was to facilitate grouping for experience. Guild members should never feel like they have to play an alt because they cannot get a group for their main in guild.<br>
<br>
Groups of ES members are expected, in fact required, to break their groups if another ES member, or Applicant, zones in and wants to group and hunt. Work it out amongst yourselves who goes with who to maintain the best hunting ability possible for both groups. Simply saying &quot;Sorry, Full Group&quot; is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
Synergy when this occurs can be enormous, and GREATLY increase exp gain. A single enchanter can keep two groups in clarity very easily, while a single cleric can keep all MA's in their best hp buffs at all times, while sacrificing nothing for their own groups efficiency. Two small groups, utilizing this efficiency gain, will gain far more experience between them that a single large group.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We group more than we raid. But when we raid, we do some crazy hunts.<br>
<br>
Seeya in game, and look me up if you want to hunt, anywhere, anytime.<br>

<br>
Example one (This is my personal point of view only) with regard to ES 'requirement', which I think is admirable in philosophy. <br>
<br>
I am in a group with 5 quildies and a player from an outside group, all within one or two levels of each other, who happens to be doing a kick arsed job. A guildie comes on who is the same class as the other player but 5 levels lower. What do you do? Take the guildie, skew the XP and dump the other player (Which personally I feel is rude) or or appologize to the guildie, you are in a full group atm, but if a spot opens up will be sure to invite them. <br>
<br>
I love my guild and my guildies, but my personal choice would be to keep the group intact as it was. To me it's only fair to the 6 people who are already engaged in the battles. That being said we always look for a guildie to fill that spot first. Always. <br>
<br>
Example 2 Raiding VS Grouping. Is there a balance? I think there can be, however, I know nothing from personal experience about the 60+ game yet. Ideally, for me, what I would like to see with in my guild is a strong core group of people who can hold successful raids on a regular basis, but also have the time to group XP if they so choose. I don't feel that it has to be one or the other. <br>
<br>
Personally, I love to raid, I also love to group and sometimes I just want to sit in the Nexus and hang with my friends and not do anything. The guild I am in and have been in since shortly after I started playing the game is as close to ideal as I can see coming. <br>
<br>
We are also growing, with more 55+ people than we have had before, many of us having been with the guild since we were in our early levels. We have a strong sense of commitment to our fellow players and endeavour to strengthen the guild as a whole by doing alot of XP grouping in tough zones with fellow members. We choose this, it is not a requirement. By doing this, we have a terrific force of people to raid with. <br>
<br>
We're doing our first Hate raid soon. To many higher level guilds this will seem like a cake walk. To us it's a big deal and a big step for us. We're pretty damn proud of it too. We've worked hard, all of us. Our people who aren't quite high enough level to zone into hate have been working together constantly to achieve that goal. Personally I find that kind of team work impressive as heck. <br>
<br>
It's a quarter till two in the morning, so I am rambling a bit. Please forgive me.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is, grouping and raiding should be a part of any guild IMHO. I think it's possible, not always easy but possible.  <br>
<br>
<br>
This is true for any guild out there. A very wise person once said &quot;You can please all of the people some of time and some of the people all of the time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time.&quot; More true words were never spoken. <br>
<br>
I think we all have goals we would like to see achieved in the beginning. However, as the game changes we change with it. Our focus changes as our toons develop and people come and go along with those changes. It should all be good, there is after all something for everyone out there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's also good to group with your guild mates, you learn what strategies they use, what their weak points are, strong points, and over all the person behind the pixels.<br>
<br>
Im guessing you're asking if you should join which?  Whichever you feel suits you.<br>

<br>
And Nishal, As far as &quot;breaking groups&quot;: the point was not to dump anyone, ever. What is done when others zone in to hunt, is to reform to make sure two groups can hunt... That was described in the rest of the post. Thus the point of saying &quot;Sorry, full group&quot; is unacceptable.<br>
<br>
If 5 ES were hunting with another out-of-guild invite, we wouldn't dump them, ever. If a guildie were to zone in, we would break into two groups, of 3 and 4. It's happened... It's documented on our website. (play find the links in my ghey sig to hit our WEBSITE, not our msgboard (though that's in there too.))<br>
<br>
Though, I have dropped my current group to hunt with guildies, in the same zone. I can't be blamed for that, tho... If you hunted with these guys, where 10 of us killed a dark master in umbral with our 52 ranger MA (just one of dozens examples), the skill level I need to hunt effectively where we hunt I just don't see, out of guild, very often. (WARRIORS: MAKE AND USE /SHIELD HOTKEYS. It boggles my mind how FEW actually DO!!!)<br>
<br>
Our balance is skewed toward grouping, epic hunting, and mini-raids... No big raids right now, but those are in our future (and planned, we are simply preparing for that hunt, now). We are also going to guildwar MLF starting on the 8th thru the 10th. That should be fun! Check our website early and often for MLF corpse pics.<br>

And you HAVE done this as it happened one night with one of my guildies.  You zoned in and the group was full so you demanded that the ES members leave and join you, leaving my guildies and another non-ES member with no group.<br>
<br>
I am not trying to start a fight.  These are your guild rules so as long as people are aware, there is not problem.  But don't sit here and say you don't do it.  Its clerayl stated and I ahve seen it myself it be done.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
AS for the original poster......There ARE guilds that do focus on grouping rather than raiding.  Our guild many, many times will take a lower elvel member or an odd class to soemplace just becasue they are a guildie.  I have seen members sit around waiting for more to log on rather than get a  pick up group.<br>
<br>
We are not the only ones either.  Usually the role-playing guilds.....okay I can only think of one that is left, but usually the smaller and mid level sized guilds harp more on guildies grouping and exping and/or having fun than raiding.  THose are the ones to look for.<br>

It means that if there are seven people who want to hunt, then you make sure that all can do so, and accommodate accordingly, while never saying &quot;Sorry, Full Group, go somewhere else.&quot;<br>
<br>
Example, in Umbral Plains:<br>
<br>
Full group of:<br>
<br>
Enchanter<br>
Warrior<br>
SK<br>
Druid<br>
Cleric<br>
Ranger<br>
<br>
A wizard ports in, and wants to group. We might break as follows:<br>
<br>
Group 1<br>
SK<br>
Ranger<br>
Enchanter<br>
Druid<br>
<br>
Group 2<br>
Warrior<br>
Cleric<br>
Wizard<br>
<br>
Both groups would have the benefit of added Haste, C2, crowd control from me, even a slow here and there for group 2, HP buffs from the cleric, and Druid DS.<br>
<br>
This happens all the time. In fact, it has worked out much better that I expected. It lends a raid feel to simple hunts... It also allows a couple small groups to be able to stay in same zone and hunt... And take down larger, two group mobs when the ranger spots them on track. (The Dark Master we aced with our 52 ranger tanking comes to mind here. Dralkenr/Raldukan are much easier when two groups are fighting 'em.)<br>
<br>
Nobody ever gets dumped. If I am in a full group with a single non-ES member with us, that person would never get dumped in favor of an ES member who just zoned in. We would split into two groups, of 3 and 4. It happens, all the time.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, it doesn't work that way... A group of 6 enchanters would have a tough time in Umbral Plains. A guildie zoning into Seb, while I had a full group in the crypt, would probably not be able to join us for a split group hunt.<br>
<br>
I know the night you speak of... And, it did NOT happen the way you have been informed. I demand nothing. As it turns out, if people want to leave their group, to hunt with ME, that is *their* decision. It happens. And, I can't blame them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
<br>
We dont dump others to form all ES hunting groups but try to make sure all ES has someone to hunt with.<br>
Even if that means that an ES member sits and waits for the next open spot.<br>
<br>
Aaldari... I was there the night you speak of and would like to clear something up.<br>
<br>
When myself and the other ES members left the group it was to join other ES members and go to ANOTHER zone.<br>
We didn't stay in UP and watch your &quot;guildie&quot; have to LFG while we were hunting.<br>
<br>
We went to another zone to hunt and explore a new place.<br>
<br>
We apologized as soon as we degrouped and wished the remaining people good luck .<br>
<br>
<br>
People leave groups all the time for guild raids..hunts ..and other guild functions.<br>
<br>
We've all done it and had it done to us.<br>
<br>
Most of us except it and move on .... It's part of EQ.<br>
<br>
What is not exceptable is the two hour barrageof tells that I got from your &quot;guildie&quot; telling me that I F%$k people and how can I sleep at night among other things.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leaving a group is one thing ...harassment and personal attacks are another.<br>

For being in such a fun loving guild you sure are attacking Aaldari and the facts she heard in a harsh manner Mystis.  Imz pointed it out pretty directly, but Mystis certainly needs a chill pill.  No way to build mutil guild comraderie by just jumping on the bandwagon Mystis and seeming to attack without giving her a chance to say if she was sorry she misunderstood or anything else.  Maybe that is what she understood and thus Imz figured so and explained it.  <br>
<br>
Aaldari has always seemed fair in my conversations with her and she seems very good hearted.  Dont go be an jerk for no reason.  Take it to rants if you feel the need to jump someones case - she just mentioned the &quot;facts&quot; she was aware of and at no time said she had a character of hers in the zone.  Maybe you should read her statement before showing how little of the #%%@$ you have any idea about using your words.<br>
<br>
And also, maybe you should follow these words of your guildmate Ladanya:<br>
<br>
&quot;Leaving a group is one thing ...harassment and personal attacks are another.&quot;<br>

<br>
#2) My point Mystis was that your guild leader had handled the situation and quite appropriately, along with lysa.  Your point was just so you could throw yourself around.  You ignored the fact that Ailadara did present a truth. Her members were with your guilds members and they left and she understood they were asked to join their guild then by Imz.  Imz followed through.  So you tell me, what was the point of your post if Imz had dealt with the issue appropriately?  The only thing you did is attack Aald directly for stating what she understood from her guildmembers.  She didnt say your policy is wrong in the least.  She said that she believed you do break up groups.  Nothing was made up, and if it was made up by her I would like you to point that out since you are now making stuff up about her ethics.  You can go rant yourself away and take it there if you wish, however if you are having an anger management problem, like we all do somedays on EQ, then just admit you shouldnt have attacked her because she was just a leader saying what she believed happened.  If your anger management problem is a permanent one, I would suggest finding a solution somewhere.  I could point you to a few 1800 numbers.  Once again I state, Aaldari seems to be a nice, good hearted person as I bet even Imz probably knows if he has hung around her. <br>
<br>
Sorry Imz for the tangent, but I just hate to see a nice EQer like Aaldari getting bashed and put as a liar when she was just pointing out facts she believed true. I believe you would do the same if it were your guildmates and you truly believed them.  Who is right? who knows, but at least you dealt with the situation appropriately and I hope you ask the same of your guildmates.  Unless of course this were the rants section...Then its all about the RANT. <br>

This was just about Raiding Guilds vs. Grouping Guilds.<br>
<br>
Part of the joy of ES is that I *don't* speak for its members... That is not my responsibility. They all have brains, and they use them to their fullest capacity (all except Thurbrannd, but he's 'special'. So say his teachers.) They slaughter me daily in guildchat, in groupchat, in shout, with and without non-guildies in group/zone/raid/vicinity. And I wouldn't have it any other way.<br>
<br>
Let it die, Virest. Mystis didn't deserve a 2 post rant detailing his need for 'anger management' etc. for a single simple line with regards to Aaldari's knowledge of the situation. And to be frank... You know even LESS.<br>
<br>
If I might risk an opinion on the matter, since I was there (and you and Aaldari were not), I will venture that the facts are as Ladenya and Mystis put out there. There are plenty of examples (Last night in Sebilis, was a good one) where the exact opposite holds true. I sincerely would like to see this die HERE, since anymore would cause undue heartache to people trying to keep the past in the past. It was one night, a month ago.<br>
<br>
Key point coming:<br>
<br>
In fact, I am quite certain that the affected parties have moved on, and are having fun in EQ again.<br>
<br>
ANYWHO....<br>
<br>
ES is a grouping-focused guild, who always makes room for guildies who zone in and want to hunt, whenever possible. Can we comment on the existence (or non-) of that elsewhere and in other guilds? Are there any others out there?<br>
<br>
Without a doubt in my mind, ES has the greatest grouping members on the server I have ever encountered. Comment on that, if you will. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/theharters/ImzySig.jpg" ALT="Exported picture" USEMAP="#PreviewImzyMap" ISMAP="ISMAP">
