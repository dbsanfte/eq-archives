If that isn't the right literally growing government to legislate morality, I don't know what is.  Let's add that conservatives have also been the strongest voice in pushing prison sentences for drug possession by users to include marijuana.  Combine that with the three strikes laws, &amp; you definitely have an increase in government spending (enforcement &amp; incarceration) to jail these hardened criminals.  Abortion laws; conservatives what it illegal.  Again, government would have to be expanded in order to enforce it if it were.<br>
<br>
Both sides would like to legislate their interpretation of morality.  The difference is that conservatives claim to be reducing the size of government at the same time.  The irony is that in the last four decades, only Democratic administrations have managed to balance the budget.  Don't give me that it was the Republican congress’s doing, either.  Every budget passed had the president's signature on the bottom line. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6347">Veteran Draxus Diablus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

1) Agree.<br>
<br>
2) I was thinking about picking up that very book.  I also heard that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The God Makers</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was good.<br>
<br>
It is a very interesting experience living in Utah.  Not being raised here, it is definitely a &quot;stranger in a strange land&quot; kind of experience being an agnostic with no previous Mormon exposure.  The most incredible irony is the state's appointment of our Porn Czar while turning a blind eye to the many polygamists in the rural southern part of the state.  Interesting priorities... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6347">Veteran Draxus Diablus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Bill First (Frist?) is proposing a bill in the house to add a CONSTITUTIONAL AMMENDMENT banning homosexual marriage.  Now, granted, I am not up on every amendment to the constitution, but the only one I can think of off the top of my head that LIMITED rights is prohibition, which has its own dubious distinction, no?<br>
<br>
Bush, when asked, said that he had White House lawyers looking into the legality of the issue to see if there was a way they could enforce their assertation that gay marriage is illegal.<br>
<br>
How is that not legislating morality?  From my observation right wing conservatives, Republicans (whatever they want to be called) are the ones pushing for limiting rights and choices.  Gay marriage and abortion to name two hot button issues.<br>

<br>
Well first let me say that the original point I was making was that yes, Republicans like vouchers.  They like less government interference in choosing where their kids go to school.

So in case you are skimming this, HERE IS WHERE I SHOW YOU AGAIN THAT MY ARGUMENT IS NOT A NON SEQUITIR.<br>
<br>
And secondly, just as a side note, tell me how directly taking money away from a public school and giving it to a private school is going to help that public school (which is all ready behind) catch up to the private one?  &quot;flawed logic&quot; indeed.<br>

<br>
Republicans have a laissez-faire attitude economically.  Economic interest and morale interests are two seperate issues.  Democrats want to heavily get government involved in peoples economic interest while having the same laissez-faire attitude to moral interests.  <br>
<br>
Democrats believe people can't take care of themselves economically so they need someone to look out for them. <br>
<br>
Republicans believe in a market model where people are provided with the information and can make appropriate choices.  This does not mean no market intervention.  There will be places for market failures, and there will be situations for legislation.  Warnings on tobacco, for instance, to make sure people have that information. <br>
<br>
The difference being Republicans believe market intervention should be to provide people with the information to make good choices without getting to heavily involved in determining how a business must run its business.  Democrats want to legislate how a business performs its business, gives the consumer information, and who can compete in that business (adding costs and providing new market failures). <br>
<br>
On morality, of course there are differences.  The reason Republicans believe in legislating morality is it is a SMALL GOVERNMENT rational.  If we raise a moral society, then we have to spend less money later fixing problems with social issues.  If we encourage hard work, family values, good ethical standards, etc... then you spend less money later on welfare, children without parental support, crime, and other issues.  <br>
<br>
Lets look at France - after all, people love to bash the French here.  France is about as close to socialism as you can get and still be leaning toward a market economy.  France has socialized healthcare, public welfare, etc...  It takes those liberal values farther then we do.  In France, unemployment has been on the rise, healthcare costs for the state are rising at the same time, and employees are battling to work less and less hours a week.  Last I looked, I think they wanted a 30 hour week now.  <br>
<br>
Thats not productive.  Your source of production (workers) have lost the desire to work.  You are giving them everything.  At the same time, the productivity of your country is falling.  Can you see how this is a problem? No money means no more services.  No more services and a now unemployable workforce means mass poverty unless things fix. <br>
<br>
In order to have a productive society, people must feel a sense of ownership in what they do and that they are rewarded for working over not working. <br>
<br>
To carry this essay even further, since thats what it seems to have become, I will talk on governments growth.  Every industrialized countries government since the dawn of industrailization has grown at a significant pace over time.  Including countries who operated under authoritarian based governments (which should need less government because its one central authority instead of the thousands of governments a country like ours has).  <br>
<br>
You know why government will always grow? Because no matter how much you say you want a smaller government, there is one more demand everyone will have that their government satisfy. <br>
<br>
You will want that extra road so you can get to work faster, you will want cleaner water, you will want your childrens daycare center to have regular check-ups by state regulators, you will want to fly on a plane where you feel safe from terrorists and mechanical errors, you will want that extra half-a-percent less chance of cancer so more studies, you will want less noise from the overpass, you will want more environmentally friendly cars, you will want more educational programs for your kids at school, etc... <br>
<br>
Its quite simply the nature of the beast.  People always want more but want to give government less. <br>
<br>
That is the dilemma of government.  Believe it or not, government is many times more efficient today then it has ever been.  When you must not only do all the above but do it while making sure people are involved for equity reasons, enough time is giving for appropriate public response, and everything must be approved by many differenet agencies due to standards the people want (environmental and other regulatory) - it makes government big.<br>
<br>
Government doesn't just make itself big - citizens make government big.<br>
<br>

That is such a cliched straw man, it damages the credibility of any other more reasoned arguments you try to make.  Saying Dems are for big government is like saying Republicans are for big debt.  The Dem's goal is no more to grow government for it's own sake than it is for Republicans to drive up the debt because they want to bankrupt the country.  Granted, Dem's generally advocate greater government involvement than Republicans, but the mantra that liberals want to ultimately control every aspect of people's lives paranoid &amp; comical.  Also, before you reply with the &quot;I didn't say that,&quot; no you didn't but that is the implication whenever this point is brought up, and it has been explicitly stated by nearly every popular conservative commentator.  The line is getting old, and anyone with a room temperature IQ won't buy it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Democrats want to legislate how a business performs its business, gives the consumer information, and who can compete in that business (adding costs and providing new market failures).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
While we are on the subject of government economic involvement, the whole black &amp; white, less vs more, argument has to be put into perspective.  Saying Republicans are better because they uphold the less government is better ideal, is naive.  Any rudimentary understanding of the economy and government's involvement in it, will include an acceptance of a clear law of diminishing returns here.  Reasonable people will agree that some government involvement is necessary.  Without pollution control, we would be back to walking across Lake Eire.  Without the FDIC and banking regulations, people would be stuffing their mattresses with their savings.  There is such a thing as good government involvement in the economy and how companies do their business.  The question is, what is the optimal amount of involvement and regulation?  Who's ideal is closest.  I happen to think that Dem's come closer than Republicans.  This is an arguable point, but the thing that ought to be clear is that neither side really believes that the extreme (non or total control) is what's best.  Again, the straw man argument fails.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The reason Republicans believe in legislating morality is it is a SMALL GOVERNMENT rational. If we raise a moral society, then we have to spend less money later fixing problems with social issues.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> There is no way you are going to get this one to fly.  You mean to say that laissez-faire economics produces the best environment for businesses, but that legislating morality produces the best environment for individuals?  I see a huge contradiction there.  Besides, Republicans wouldn't pay for those social programs even if the were needed.  <br>
<br>
There is a good argument that every law is based on a moral value.  From that point of view, every law is legislating morality.  Again, we are back to the diminishing returns principal.  How much, and what, values do you legislate?  What is the overall benefit vs cost?  A good example is the three strikes law that includes non violent crimes.  California now spends more to jail inmates than on post secondary education.  Personally, I think both parties go too far here.  Environmentalists, for example, have prevented us from tapping our own natural resources &amp; reducing our dependence on unstable foreign countries.  On the other side, Legalizing gay marriage is not going to lead to the demise of the family unit in the US (divorce rates have skyrocketed completely independently of this issue).  Where has this conservative outcry been as the divorce rate rose exponentially from the 60s onward?  The notion that legalizing gay marriage is somehow going to destroy the family unit is ridiculous.  There is absolutely no basis for this claim other than outright homophobia.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lets look at France<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, France (and most of the rest of Europe) is a very good example of countries providing more social services than they can afford.  Whatever happened to the idea of a balanced budget amendment?  If conservatives were sincere in what they stood for, this would be a platform with a far greater profile than tax reductions.  You want to reduce the size of government?  Great, but cut expenditures first.  It's called starving the beast.  That is how you truly reduce the size of government, not this debt &amp; spend tax reduction model that has left us facing the greatest budget deficit in history (thank you George Bush).  You are robbing the economic future of your children &amp; their children.<br>
<br>
Conservatives like to say that liberals never saw a tax they didn't like.  Well, conservatives never saw an economy where they didn't think they should cut taxes.  The popular argument behind tax cuts are that they are needed to stimulate the economy.  Assuming that they could be put into effect while an economy is still in recession, that would work well.  There are two problems with Republicans belief about taxes, however.  The first is that they push the populist tax cut issue no matter what the state of the economy.  They argue that the economy could always be doing better.  The problem with that idea is that not only are you increasing the debt load of the government making it harder to cut taxes when you really need to, but you also risk causing inflation.  You simply can't grow the economy faster than the rate of production.  Everything else is speculation and inflationary.  <br>
<br>
The second is that they try to target tax cuts towards the wealthiest.  This trickle down economic model fails to produce expected results.  The idea is that that rich guy is going to increase investment in business through investing in their own business, or buying stock in another.  The problem is that without demand, no business will invest in equipment or employees.  What they ignore is that the lower your income, the greater percentage of your income you spend.  Targeting tax cuts to middle &amp; lower income tax payers increases demand because they are more likely to spend what they get back (or don't have taken out).  Only when a business sees more demand, will they invest in buying more equipment and hiring more employees.  The business' profits increase, &amp; the wealthy benefit from greater dividends.  The rising tide lifts all boats. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6347">Veteran Draxus Diablus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I can't say much about the Porn Czar thing, since my state didn't do it. However, I will say if an action is illegal, then it should be enforced.<br>

Same on marijuana; if the use of, selling of, and buying of is Illegal, then it should be enforced.

<br>
Well, I hate to inform you that you are off base because I did not say anything about Dems being for bigger government.  The quote you are responding to says they like heavy government involvement in business. There is no straw man.  Its a fact.  I agreed Republicans like heavy government involvement in morality.  I was pointing out that morality and economics are two seperate issues. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Without the FDIC and banking regulations, people would be stuffing their mattresses with their savings.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, and as I said, there are places where government intervention must happen.  This is basic economics 101. <br>
Why don't you look back which parties roots started that stuff too while you are at it. <br>
<br>
The reason economic bases cant be heavily regulated is it interrupts the markets, adds costs, and drives down production.  If you want to have the best production, costs, and all around gains - you need to have less involvement. <br>
<br>
What my point was - since you missed it though - <br>
<br>
Democrats want heavy involvement in economic areas but stay out of morality areas as much as possible. <br>
<br>
Republicans want heavy involvement in morality but stay out of economic areas as much as possible. <br>
<br>
Government will be big no matter what - the difference is where that growth happens and how much. <br>
<br>
If you missed those three points, I am sorry. I felt they were clear. <br>

Wrong.  The environmentalist movement championed by Dems is as much an issue of morality as Republican's pro life movement.  Republicans certainly don't corner the market on legislating morality.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Republicans want heavy involvement in morality but stay out of economic areas as much as possible.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
