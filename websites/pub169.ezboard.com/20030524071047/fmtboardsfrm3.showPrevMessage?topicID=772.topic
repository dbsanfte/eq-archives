<br>
Anyway...<br>
<br>
I awhile back, in the middle of an intoxicated haze, an idea struck me.. rather funny... and somewhat stupid, but none the less, amusing.  <br>
<br>
At the age of 18, there would be a standards test(that everyone had to take, no matter what), in every country, or something like that.  Basically a semi intellectual test, but also an aptitudes test.  People who scored high, had some use in society, they had some part to play out.. and could be generally useful to the promotion of life.  It would be a simple test, 0-100 in score.  Those who scored an 85 % or better would be deemed productive and/or having some use, and to be qualified members of society.  These people would then be given a single gun, and 13 golden tipped bullets.  The use of these 13 bullets would not be punishable by standard law, and would generally be considered to be used to rid society of the dregs, legally.  Emptying out the shallow end of the gene pool so to speak.  (Sometimes it might have been worth it to use more than 1 bullet on a person... if you really thought they needed a good killing)<br>
<br>
Anyway.  Translate this over into EQ terms... who would you use this on, if you could simply get rid of 1.. or more, up to 13 I suppose, people in EQ.  Just altogether server move them, without an option, or delete the character.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps the... idea itself is a bit dark, but it's still amusing, and I am interested to see who people would get rid of, and why/how. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shorrtstuff>Shorrtstuff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PeeWee Shorrty</span><br>  Posts: 1101<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/2/03 2:38:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=780.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 Bullets</span><hr size=1> I cant remember ever hating anyone in game.<br>

<br>
If given the chance I probably wouldn't delete them,  but servertransfer would be nice,  but as far as I know 2 of the 3 aren't here anymore anyway.<br>
<br>
I have had tons of minor things with tons of people,  but in the end,  it was probably just a bad day for them,  or me.  I mean you can't play a game for 2 years and not have arguements and disagreements.  There is always 2 sides to every story,  and what not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pidmaster>pidmaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/2/03 4:27:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=780.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 Bullets</span><hr size=1> If forced to abide by the conventions of such a society, I would of course, being a gnome, get high scores.  So it goes without saying that I would have to first consider how I would choose my victims. <br>
<br>
Having no one worthy of being my enemy, I would have to resort to randomness. <br>
<br>
Everyone on the server would have to /ran 5000 all those in the top 100 would have to gather in a crowd in wich a device would be centraly located. Then my pistol would be mounted on the device wich is exactly 3.6 ft tall (so as to ensure no intellectualy superior gnomes would need be disposed of in such an untimely fashion)  with the pistol aimed level into the crowd, this device would rotate 360 degrees firinig all 13 shots in its arc.<br>
<br>
And If any non gnomes were smart enough to calculate, begining with the point on the arc at wich the pistol begins its revolution, and then calculate where upon the arc the 13 shots would fire (assuming that the weapon fires upon the begining of said revolution and compensation for the deviation in speed as  the device accelerates towards its maximum speed) they would still be killed because I assure you the workings of this device are much more complex then this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS I bet you think you are clever, but no, be confident that I will take measures to prevent people from doing any sitting crouching, laying down, casting shrink, or doing anything that would make them of gnome like stature. It would be absurd to go into this much detail and make such an embarrasing ommision.<br>

I think a better solution is that anyone not making over *a certain income per year* and *below a certain IQ*... should be forbidden to breed.<br>
<br>
Yup!  you guessed it!  No kids!  If you get preggo's, and don't meet the requirements - enforced abortion!  This would work best with some form of mandatory birth control (maybe air based - apply for an antidote if you meet the requirements).  In just a generation or two... we will have a substanially reduced population of SMART attractive people!<br>

I think that whatever ghey ass rock band wrote this, said it best:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Everywhere I look around I see that only stupid people are breeding<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Or something like that.  Anyway, my basic point is that stupid, broke people breed stupider, broker kids... and stupid broke people have 50 kids for every 1 kid that a financially stable, intelligent couple has.  Stupid, broke people need to stop spreading their genes throughout the world.<br>
<br>
Natural selection is dead, and it is going to kill the human race eventually.<br>

Hmm people i would err..get rid of so to speak on EQ if they were still around or I knew what char they were on..<br>
<br>
Blux teh &quot;gansta&quot; ,Daarkside, Lorakthor(Do i *really* need to explain why with these 3?), Torlorb(I think thats his name..someone please correct me if im wrong? Im meaning the guy who stole the CoF from Neonights kid bro). Now these would fall on my delete chars or if im in a good mood at the time server transfer...actually scratch that..no transfer for them. I wouldn't want others to go through same thing with them the rest of them like MT has.<br>
<br>
Hmm I wouldn't mind silencing (read shutting up..not killing or deleting thier chars) all the useless beggers in bazaar, and nexus. Dewd r U able 2 PL me plz? Got any spare phat lewts to help a tru newb out? Got money so a newbie can get his spells? k thnx bye<br>
