<br>
I grew up in Texas (which some would say is not the south, but believe me, it is) then moved to the West for about 10 years.  I came to TN over 2 years ago and was reminded of how different things are here, and for me it's different in a good way. Too many great things to list here but you can keep your desert, veggie wraps, smog and rude ass people always in a hurry. I always wondered what all those people were hurrying to......rush rush rush to be mediocre in middle america.<br>
<br>
The confederate flag doesn't represent racism to me, it represents the southern way of life and what that stands for.  I suppose you can make anything hateful if you're a person wrapped up in hate but without that flag it will be something else we need to do away with. <br>
<br>
 Should we stop cotton production and ban all cotton clothing because slaves were once forced to pick it? I didn't think so! That flag does not stand for racism in most cases and if it does, than I assure you that person has more going on in their twisted backasswards mind than I'd care to know about.<br>
<br>
 I'm not at all uncomfortable with the Rebel Flag blowing in the breeze on my car or in my front yard. If you are, I suggest you just keep on driving and don't allow me to influence you whatsoever!<br>

This is the GA flag, not the USA flag. It's not a matter of what the flag represents to the rest of the US, as much as what it represents to Georgians.<br>
<br>
I grew up in Macon - spent close to 30 years there - and I can tell you that the confederate flag does not represent racism to me. It represents local pride and local traditions despite defeat, it represents lessons learned and a helluva lot of history.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It seems almost painful for some of you to see what it actually represented at the time. Ya know, the &quot;real&quot; reason for that little Civil War thingy that happened.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Please enlighten us about the &quot;real&quot; reason the civil war was fought.<br>
<br>
<br>
What cheeses me off the most about this debate is the &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;. After the civil war, carpetbaggers moved to the south loudly explaining they were there to help &quot;rebuild&quot;. In reality, they came to exploit. They especially came to exploit the newly-freed blacks, for they saw cheap labor and lots of cash. Carpetbaggers decimated an already hemorrhaging economy, and only made worse already strained racial tensions. 100 years after the war, most southern states had still not recovered from the economic damage and racial tensions were at an all-time high.<br>
<br>
In the 1970s, Georgia made significant strides towards rebuilding the economy and resolving the racial problems. The Georgia of today is is a thriving, productive member of the US, and while there may still be racial problems, they are no worse (and in many respects significantly less) than racial problems found elsewhere in the US.<br>
<br>
Now the carpetbaggers are back. They're relatively recent immigrants who have gotten all offended by the confederate flag, and now they'll help &quot;improve&quot; GA's image by redoing the flag. Thanks, guys! <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/btheshoemakers"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/sigs/6Fims.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Also, I don't doubt that there are people who have a rebel flag and are not racist. Again, that is not the point. I love the flag on the General Lee. I would love to have that car!<br>
<br>
The point is, a vast majority of the people in support of the rebel flag are racists, even if not outspoken about it. They look down on black Americans and many other non-white people. I see it. I see it everyday. I hear too. You see them, in their local bars speaking of non-whites with disgust. And those people, yeah, they would love to have the rebel flag till the end of the days. <br>
<br>
It's all around. You can choose to see it if you want...or just look away.<br>
<br>
Either way, I suppose there is no need to post on this topic anymore. We all choose which side of the fence we want to be on. We all choose what truths we wish to see.<br>

Jacy, I have no doubt of your convictions. Again, I believe you when you say you aren't racist. Just wish more people were like you.<br>

The term &quot;African-American&quot; is the stupidest label of all and it demonstrates a clear lack of intellect on the part of the user.  Do Benjamin Franklin's descendants run around calling themselves &quot;British Americans&quot; ?  Why not?<br>
<br>
You're not an African anything unless you were born in Africa.  It's an odd irony that a great many &quot;African Americans&quot; are actually light skinned (white, if you prefer) people who have left South Africa and Kenya. <br>

Check your calendar.  It's not 1866.  It's not even 1966.  Check your map too because I said this happened in Canada, which never had the full force of race issues that the US did.<br>
<br>
And I'm sorry, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY, that any person, of any skin colour, can fairly say that they are suffering from the after effects of slavery in a racially divided country as they attend a heavily state-subsidized university after a state-subsidized high school education, with state subsidized medical care in a country where the quality of life of even the most destitute is better than the quality of life of most people in the world, in a country where speaking out against any minority can land your arse in jail.<br>
<br>
Any slavery effects that people feel today are purely imaginary.<br>
<br>
In Canada, at least, you're more likely to find prejudice based on your inability to speak French or English (depending on where you are in Canada) than on the colour of your skin.<br>

<br>
Reasons why I respect Robert E. Lee:<br>
1) Graduated 2nd in his class (1829) from Westpoint - without a single demerit<br>
2) Though he opposed slavery *gasp* he still fought for his state. (Background - I'm a big state's rights supporter)<br>
3) Lee did not practice total warfare.  He opposed &quot;wanton injury to private property,&quot; <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/Willis/Civil_War/documents/LeeGenOrders73.html" target="top">(Lee, R. E.

William T. Sherman, September 17, 1863).<br>
4) He served as president of Washington College (Washington &amp; Lee University)<br>
 <br>
Lee is more than just a general who fought for his state.  He was an amazing gentleman.  Anyone who denies that can't get beyond the fact that he was a Confederate general (hence my revisionist history comment).  Do I need to keep going?<br>

I'm glad that I can be so resourceful, Ragnon. In fact, I'll even go so far to say that you ALSO have put the word HATE in my mouth, along with other trivial thoughts you have interjected as to my reasoning and my reasons for being APPREHENSIVE.<br>
<br>
I hate everyone, not just Muslims. The people I love are the ones I know well, and know in their hearts they're not going to strap themselves with explosives and blow me up, or anyone for that matter.<br>
<br>
Now, that last comment sure sounded PARANOID, right? I would say the word hate in your post should be changed to paranoia.<br>
<br>
If we're going to blast someone on their opinions and views, the least we could do is define their thought processes correctly rather than interject some rudimentary words into their thoughts.<br>

<br>
I know you put it in quotes, the part about real, but just to be clear -- The war had nothing to do with slavery at the outset.  That initial issue was preserving the union and then the moral high ground of slavery was raised later as just a way to get more backing for the north in the war since England could not give help to slave states by their own law.  The war was, at the outset, really about states rights versus national government power. It was transformed, after it began, into a battle against slavery (which happen to be the key issue the southern states rights advocates were having trouble with the national government on: how they should be counted for representation, how many owners could have since was their source of income, etc..).  The emancipation proclamation was a great action by Lincoln because as mentioned previously, it removed Britain and many other European countries from any war support for the South.<br>
<br>
There was no sudden calling for war by the north to free the slaves of the south.  The call to war was to protect the union by not allowing a rebellion to continue. <br>

He was, in short, a great man.  He led a fight he knew that he could not, eventually, win, and through superior leadership went farther with less equipment and less people than anyone could have though possible.<br>
<br>
He was everything his descendants are not.<br>
<br>
Today's supporter of the rebel flag may not be an overwhelming racist, and I certainly do not believe they wish to have the african descendant in slavery.  But I do think they were brought up to minimize the pain the flag can bring to some people.  Similiar to the swastika that was in an earlier post, it just hurts some people for very good reasons.  Not empathising with these pains doesn't remove these pains from others; and it only adds to tensions that maybe don't need to be inflamed.<br>
<br>
In addition, the 56 flag was instated during an extremely tense racial time; Jim Crow was being torn down, Civil Rights leaders were coming into strength(MLK,MX,etc).  I fully believe that the leaders of the time were instating this flag as a slap in the face.<br>
<br>
For every die hard Confederate flag supporter there is, there is another who was brought up to believe it was the flag of a time of horrors, of atrocity.<br>
<br>
Oh, for some of my personal background, I'm from CT, which does bias me against some southern traditions(I'm not going to deny this)and have lived about 20 minutes south of Atlanta for the past 5 years.<br>
<br>
I believe the 40 acres and a mule or whatever tax break the NAACP wants is a load of bullshit brought about by manipulative people who want capitilize on someone else's misfortune.<br>
<br>
I don't like most political correctness and believe most stereotypes were brought about due to an overwhelming tendency for the people of that stereotype to act that way.<br>
