<br>
It's always pissed me off when getting a group together to toddle off to a camp and have someone leave in 10 or 15 minutes to go raid.<br>
<br>
What the @#%$ were you doing joining a group when you have to go raid in 10 minutes?  Why aren't you moving your pathetic arse to the raid site?  Why are you @#%$ with 5 other poeple who are expecting to settle in for some xp, only to have your sorry arse bow out for SOMETHING YOU KNEW ABOUT BEFORE YOU STARTED.<br>
<br>
In LDoN it's even worse.  3 times it's happened to the group I was in for LDoN... halfway into the dungeon &quot;oh, I have to leave for a raid.&quot;  Here's a clue for you hard of thinking raid monkeys:  It takes 2 hours to run through an LDoN dungeon... if it's 5 PM and you have a raid at 5:30 or 6 PM, you are a whipped cream asshat with a steaming turd on top if you join an LDoN group, and just a steaming turd (no whipped cream) if you join a regular group without informing them.<br>
<br>
Ordinarily, I'd complain that it happens that most of the cretins who have done this lately have been Fury's Edge/lings, but I'll spare them the brunt of this because Soulthirst stayed to the end of an LDoN group yesterday even though he had a raid and based on what I've seen, that appeared to take some guts and showed respect for the other people in the group.  So I give a little rave to Soulthirst!<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, grouping right to the last second before a raid probably makes that person late for the raid too and piss the raid people off.  Presumably that makes the people who do it get a second asshat.<br>
<br>
Now to calm down, I offer you Laura Prepon:<br>

People that are in raiding or even a semi-raid guild should have some idea of what time they usually start. However, there are also times when impromptu raids may be called. Things happen unfortunately. Perhaps it should be kept in mind what time you start looking for others to join you and if anyone from say, FE, Rev or Triune say yes...they MAY have to leave soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aelfgarraintree>AelfgarRaintree</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 399<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/18/03 9:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1156.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: RE: If you have to raid, don't @#%$ join an LDoN group</span><hr size=1> Jord, you are such spoiled a spolied little biatch.

<br>
Also try some groups with less than perfect set ups... some work awesome, some not so good.<br>

Here's a better idea, how about informing your group if you have any possibility of having to raid within the next two hours.  It's a simple matter of common courtesy.<br>
<br>

That depends on your role in the group.  If you're not the puller, then you likely have minimal influence on the pace of the group.  I am generally puller for my groups, so I get to set a brisk pace through the dungeons &amp; 40 mins is pretty easy.  When im playing my BST, however, I am usually at the mercy of whoever else is pulling. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sasarella>Sasarella</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 830<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/18/03 10:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1156.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: RE: If you have to raid, don't @#%$ join an LDoN group</span><hr size=1> Neh, I don't think Jord is spoiled.

<br>
Yes, it is usually done in less, but if you're planning you should factor the max 30 min to get there and 90 min for hte mission:  2 hours.<br>
<br>
Sure, realistically, it's 5-10 min to get there and 40-60 min for the mission, or just over 1 hour.  I think anyone who has 1 hour to play and joins an LDoN group is an inconsiderate idiot though.  There are a billion things that could go wrong, no matter how uber your group is.  For every mission that is done in 30 minutes, I bet there are 50 or more that take 80 minutes.<br>

<br>
No, it's a rude way to get out of it.  The respectful way is &quot;you guys don't meet my expectations and I am leaving.&quot;  Based on what I have seen, these people did, in fact, go to raids (you could /who them in raid zones later).  So if people use that lie on YOU, perhaps we can draw our own conclusions...<br>
<br>
In any case, it's never happened in a group I set up, only in groups I've been invited to.  I rarely set groups up myself because I am extraordinarily picky about who I'd invite, so I normally just join groups that ask me.<br>
<br>
One might also wonder that if this person has such high standards for a group - so high that they'd lie and leave if their standards are not met, why they bother with pick-up groups at all?  Seems to me they're just setting themselves up for frustration and pissing other people off.<br>

Agreed.  Fury's Edge/lings are filtered out of my /lfg for this reason.  Lately I've heard a few other people complaining about this as well.  And to be fair, AV folks seem to be just as bad for this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If the issue is pick-up groups in general, why do these people even bother joining?  I guess that is the most basic question.<br>

Bwah has the right idea, but I still think that if &quot;soon&quot; is less than an hour, even a regular xp group probably won't want you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vperez>vperez</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/18/03 12:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1156.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: RE: If you have to raid, don't @#%$ join an LDoN group</span><hr size=1> People having to leave for raids is nothing new.

(now invite me to some of your damn groups! hehe) Most people who have groups that can finish a mission that fast make regular groups of a cliqu-ish nature, which, in this case, is a good thing. Some people don't have that luxury. I don't. People of your level of competance are really in the upper 10th percentile or so: put your self in the other 90% of peoples shoes. Only online for a couple hours, quickly get 2 or 3 good friends together... now search for extras to fill out a group. I'm about 50-50 with these types of groups...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=camaenmt>CamaenMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/18/03 1:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1156.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: RE: If you have to raid, don't @#%$ join an LDoN group</span><hr size=1> The simple solution to this is to let your group know ahead of time that you have to raid in &quot;X&quot; number of hours. And to pick the &quot;appropriate&quot; mission for that time frame.<br>
<br>
Hell I've had some really nice groups with awsome Dps that have almost lost collect missions due to bad drops. But a low 50's mass kill mission can be done by most groups in 40ish mins and a really good group in 30.<br>
<br>
Never ever join a group with less than 80 mins to raid...you might think you have enough time to finish something, but LD's and people getting lost ect can mess that up.<br>

The folks that are joining those groups have no idea how long it will be before Krushh, Jaered, Montero or I call a raid.  It all comes down to when we have critical classes online and a target.  <br>
<br>
They may think they have 2 hours and end up having 45 minutes, thats not their fault it is what it is.  <br>
<br>
FFA is the standard the raiding guilds live and die by that means first one there with a credible force gets it, the means I don't have 75 minutes to wait for your LDoN group to finish up.<br>

Then again I pretty much avoid pick up groups and tend to either group exclusively in guild, or at least with people in guilds of similar caliber. When I play on my twink, I find myself telling a lot of people how they could possibly do better. This leads to people getting pissed and telling me to &quot;stay in my class&quot; or something to that effect. After that happens I usually tell them that I would rather drink gasoline and piss on a brush fire than group with them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neffylim>Neffylim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 698<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/23/03 1:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1156.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: RE: If you have to raid, don't @#%$ join an LDoN group</span><hr size=1> The problem is too, when you're on your alt or twink in these 40's and 50's groups is- these are not the same type of 40's and 50's people a lot of us grew up playing with in Seb, etc. LDoN has tossed people into Dungeons who have never fought indoors before. You can get to your 40's or 50's in a matter of days or weeks now in these &quot;fast chain pulling don't worry about anything because if we mess up we just train our mess to zone&quot; groups. <br>
<br>
And sometimes you can't even attempt to explain what's going wrong because you have no idea where to start. I've found it's at its worst in the sub 55's. Sometimes they're so clueless that they have no idea that things are as bad as they are.  <br>
<br>
At least if you got a crappy Seb group you knew that places like that ran on Darwinism. If the group sucked, the group was gonna die and your problem was solved.<br>
<br>
With LDoN, if the group sucks, its a long painful trudge through 90 minutes of hell. The *only* way out of those groups is to be the bad guy and say let's call it. <br>
