(Ok, maybe im exageratting)<br>
<br>
Did you all know that words never physically murdered or hurt someone? A word, whether it be one of the explicit colloquialisms, or Child Molestation, or Satan Worship, or Christian Right, or any of the many compound cursewords invented on this board.<br>
<br>
So what does hurt people? Ah, the inability of folks to handle hearing words. When you get right down to it, to the very core of it, its the most rigoddamneddiculous thing there is.<br>
<br>
Israelis and Palestinians fighting over a dusty patch of dirt because of words that say it belongs to one of them. Some book filled with parables that people have taken to mean more than their very souls. The crusades, book burning, all these things came from people taking words too literaly (and money, always money)<br>
<br>
Now ask yourself, Im talking to all of you who freaked out at Sunmina's comment (Im not saying I approve of it, so relax) what exactly are you getting so mad at? <br>
<br>
Did Drack molest his Son? do any of you trully believe that? No. Does Drack? No. Does Sunmina? Of course not... so WHY are you all screaming &quot;shennanigans&quot;<br>
<br>
Honestly, I find the &quot;I'm gonna track you down with a stick and beat you to death&quot; retorts more disturbing than her initial comment. Commedians on TV make jokes about child molestation, hello, EIGHT YEAR OLDS MAKE THE SAME JOKES ABOUT CHILD MOLESTATION. Hell, 8 year olds make jokes about unloading aborted babies from a truck with a pitchfork for god's sake.<br>
<br>
The fact that people start wars and commit murder over sounds that come out of their mouth, or are written on paper is all the commentary we need on this society.<br>
<br>
Its socially acceptable on this board to say &quot;Cuntrag&quot; or &quot;Go back to taking it in the ass&quot; but a textbook term like &quot;Child Molestation&quot; causes the advocate in all to leap forth like some sort of self-righteous spiritual erection? Come on people, seriously now...<br>
<br>
Parents, you may be disturbed by the THOUGHT of it (which is what you are thinking, not what was said...) and some have some past trauma about it, which is very sad indeed. But the facts remain the same, it was simply another slur in the MT Messageboard wheel.<br>
<br>
Seriously, Sunmina's comment didnt make me cringe as much as half the drivel i've read on these boards. Vulgarity streched to it's limit, so bad NEW terms had to be invented! Apples and Oranges you say? Fruit, I say! They are one and the same. <br>
<br>
To be banned for words IS nazism, it is a parade through the dark ages. I often find myself wishing that people didnt take things so personally, that they shrugged them off with a smile, a knowing smile, a smile that says &quot;lol, you are full of @#%$&quot;<br>
<br>
There was a time, many times when people were executed for saying the wrong words... We have evolved much since then (some places) why not treat a sentance for what it really is folks?<br>
<br>
The fault lies not in what is said, but in how it is taken.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uanonandproud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anon and Proud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/28/02 10:12:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Ranting anger.</span><hr size=1> Canna,<br>

I agree with you but regarding Sunmina I can't.  For the amount of strife she claims to have endured, it seems hypocritical regarding how she responded.  Resorting to Drack's post (of her coming back to the boards) with malicious child abuse accusations (knowing well that Drack has a little boy) is beyond belief.  Those words were MEANT to harm and nothing else.<br>
<br>
Rustem's words before were meant to antagonize and harm and we all saw what she resorted to then.  You may state it was different because of the political implications but it isn't.  She believed only what she wanted to and used every measure possible to get what she wanted (and yes, i do believe she lied about certain things).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The fault lies not in what is said, but in how it is taken.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If Wikkiwkwiksjksjld had responded to Drack's post in such a manner it wouldn't be nearly as bad.  Sunmina's previous actions regarding Rustem speaks for itself.  <br>
<br>
On another note, I tried to point out the exact same thing you are pointing out on the old boards.  I used the example of the stormfront boards and their hate mentality and their claims of hurting &quot;muds&quot; and &quot;niggers&quot;; but those boards are still operational and the people are not tracked down and arrested since words are only words.  At that time she chose to ignore those comments because of her pride, arrogance, and her refusal to listen to others' opinions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/28/02 10:13:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ranting anger.</span><hr size=1> its really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> accurate to say words are meaningless. <br>

<br>
 I don't agree with what's been said by Sunmina and yes it is a little disturbing to make comments like that but on boards such as these comments like that will be made. Anytime you can hide behind a screen makes it easy to say things that are harsh. I belive in free speech and the right to voice an opinion however there are MANY laws that can be broken over words such as slander, uttering death threats (is illegal and done on a regular basis on these boards lol) etc....<br>
<br>
 Pretty good post Canna although I gotta say I think you we're a little off on the whole Israel/Palestinian example ).<br>

<br>
And you are right, those words were meant to harm... but it only works if you let yourself be harmed by then, thats the thing about words. If someone puts a gun to your head and pulls the trigger, you are dead. But if someone calls you &quot;nigger&quot; you have two choices, be hurt, or see it for what it is, pure ignorance, then you are free to walk on relaxed leaving the person who tried to insult you vexed.<br>
<br>
And Anon, you are right, it was immature, and insensitive, completely so, but that doesnt mean people should reciprocate with the exact same. Especially that Moon person, I cant remember the full name, she posted in two forums and then went to the FE forum and posted there also... but the posts were actually kind of freaky, it was like they were frothing at the mouth, all caps and very strong terms...<br>
<br>
It's that sort of angry retort that I am ranting, as it does no good. Sun was trying to piss people off, and she apparently did a damned good job at it. But its kind of disturbing that Drack was the least upset (on the MB that is) of all of them, if anything he is the one who should be frothing, but he didnt flip out (which I applaud)... I find that most interesting of all.<br>
<br>
Bah Yagar, I dont think im off on the Israel/Palestine thing, whatever has happened throughout history, it all started with religious difference, which is all because they choose to follow a different book, now it may be MUCH more than just words, but I think words started it all =)<br>
<br>
And noonie, thats what i meant, just worded differently =D<br>

I understand what you are trying to say Canna and I agree with you for the most part.  The angry retorts don't help much and only help Sun since she was trying to piss people off.  Personally, I wouldn't care much about it excepting it WAS posted by Sunmina.  Perhaps its a personal issue, after the incident on the other boards.  She claimed to have stooped to their level but after having gone through the events she claims to have experienced, and the personal insults done to her by the words of Rustem, I can't accept it. <br>
<br>
For me its not really the comments but who posted the comments.  I will admit I had little to no interest in the TW/FE post till Sunmina returned to the cesspool, which admittedly implies my extreme bias and personal vendetta.<br>

  Wow I hope that is not the case, and as far as a Salme witch trial? MESS with innocent kids more like this and you will see alot worse and I'm sure not only from me<br>
these kinds of comments have NO place in game on a message board that kids as young as 13 years old READ.<br>

  You as adults NEED to be more careful and take a bit more responsiblity for what is being said by YOUR people especially being that alot of people LOOK at your guild and thier accomplishments a bit closer than others...<br>

After Sunmina's psycho fit over Rustem's political views she has the gall to say something like this.<br>
<br>
I was only guilded with Drack for a very short period of time before I retired from EQ, so most of my exposure comes from this board, I dont always agree with what he says, but at least up front about it.<br>
<br>
A little advice for Sunmina.<br>
<br>
Log off EQ, back away from the computer. Go outside and get some air. Go play competitive camel jumping, throw some rocks at tanks or whatever passes for exercise in that third world s<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>h</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->ithole you live in.<br>
<br>
And then maybe, just maybe, with the application of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  LOTS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of alchohol, you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  MAY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> meet a guy who is drunk/stupid/blind enought to actually stick his di<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>c</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->k in you. <br>
<br>
I guarantee you will be a better person for it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ubrytar1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brytar1</A> at: 9/28/02 12:24:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/usarothiasmoonrunner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarothias Moonrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 288<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/28/02 12:42:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Canno</span><hr size=1> Very well said Moonleaf..couldn't have put it better myself.

FE as a guild condemmed the post and demanded immidiate action, the general public was in agreement with some of the actions requested but not all and that is where the controversy stemmed. Fe felt that becazuse Sunmina had not had the instant full backing of the board that this place was a cesspool and unworthy of your attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now when it is in FE guildmate who has made what many consider to be a FAR worse comment we are preached at to show tolerence? Where was the tolerence for Rustem?<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sorry Canna, but I do not believe you see this issue with eyes unfettered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucannabulon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cannabulon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secret Master of the<BR>Marshmallow Silique</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/28/02 1:32:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Canno</span><hr size=1> Did I ever comment on that entire issue with rustem, ever a single post? Did I ever say I was leaving and never coming back? And have I ever been malicious to any mod on this board in my history of posting here?<br>
<br>
Fact is, I wasnt even in FE when the &quot;we are leaving and never coming back&quot; comment was made. I dont play EQ anymore, I  havent for a good 3 months.<br>
<br>
I see the issue with eyes as unfettered as humanly possible, as someone completely detached from the MT rants. In fact, this thread was my first post in the rants section in a while, and my last post here had nothing to do with guilds or EQ.<br>
<br>
In fact, my post is titled &quot;Ranting Anger&quot; not &quot;ranting the angry bashing sunmina&quot; and if you notice, I use broad terms in this post, I even refer to myself as being one of the people who gets mad and defensive.<br>
<br>
So, I disagree with your assertion that I am biased, but your opinion is yours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/umoonleafwyndancer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moonleaf Wyndancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/28/02 1:46:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Ranting anger</span><hr size=1>    I am not so sure you would have even posted this had I not gone to your message boards to rant about the seriously sick post of one of your members, even provided the link.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Would you have posted here had it been someone else?No, are you biased ?sure you are.<br>
<br>
 Would I have posted this same anger had it been anyone else and gone to thier message board ?HELL YES!!!! <br>
  <br>
  These kind of post are about children who cannot defend themselves, so nothing you can say here can justify this.<br>
<br>
  You go ahead and Rant Gays and people of different races, they can defend themselves , Children cannot..<br>
