Again, I'm not sure if this is the best place, or about even a decent guess at a time-estimate per LDoN mission, so please forgive my ignorance.  Original message follows.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
(Question: How long would it take to get X item (a fully-aug'd BP for a melee) (cost=4,455 LDoN points).)<br>
Answer: Roughly 90 hours. (guessing)<br>
<br>
4500 LDoN points is, most likely, 88 missions on Normal difficulty, earning 51 points per win, granting you 4488 points.<br>
<br>
Each mission takes a decent chunk of time - I am NOT sure on the average amount, I usually take note of &quot;time left&quot; but not the total time elapsed start-to-finish.  You'll need to find a group, get a mission, get to the dungeon, buff, do your mission (and any secondary-missions once your adventure is complete, like named mobs, &quot;I need 6% to ding&quot;, etc), get back to the camp, sell, split, and start over again (possibly recruiting people as you go).  My estimate is just over an hour per mission, which may be overly high.<br>
<br>
Anyone with better data on average mission times (including outside-the-dungeon) step up!<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
Personally, While I admire LDoN for offering non-raiders a chance to gear up, I do not see ANYTHING that I would actually wear at the shops, even fully augmented.  Granted, there is some stuff I would use that is from RAIDS or rare drops from HARD missions perhaps, but my LDoN points will probably all go to enhancing gear I get outside the dungeon.<br>
<br>
For instance, my hardest piece of gear to upgrade raiding right now is probably my Breastplate:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Chestplate of Vindication <br>
AC: 45, STA: +15 HP: +100<br>
SV FIRE: +15 SV DISEASE: +15 SV COLD: +15 SV MAGIC: +15 SV POISON: +15<br>
Effect: Aura of Battle (Worn), Slot 1, Type 7 (open)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The best LDoN upgrade for me would probably be:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Incorporeal Chain of the Specter  (1492)<br>
AC:61, Str:13, Dex:11, Wis:10, HP:100 (or 112), Mana:100<br>
FR:12, CR:12, PR:12<br>
type1: (Used for a +12 hp aug or +7 resist aug, both DROPPED)<br>
type2: (open)<br>
type3: Shiny Sandstone of Reconstruction (510)<br>
          Effect: Regeneration V (Worn)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
TOTAL: 2002 LDoN points.<br>
<br>
LDoN BP = +16AC, +11 Dex, +10 Wis, +100 Mana, NEGATIVE 39 Resists.  Plus 3 hp/tick regen, minus 10 attack, Plus one Type 1 slot (12hp/+7resist). <br>
<br>
In my opinion, a modest AC upgrade, minor stats, mana, and HP regen are not worth the expense.  I'm TEMPTED to swap the Regen V for Burning Affliction IV (another 640 points), but this aug could go in ANY type 3 slot (regen5 is only CHEST), and it would appear that I'm spending 3000 points just to get a focus effect that Sony added in to &quot;balance&quot; classes.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOTES:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Some Ability-score stats are not included (i.e. Strength, Stamina) since they are MAXXED with self-buffs.  DEX is included even though I am 6 points away without Primal Essence/etc and will likely be maxxed with my next gear upgrade anyway.<br>
<br>
I am not filling the type 7 or type 2 slots in this example since either would just be filled with a +40hp aug for 1150 points (they have the same worth).<br>
<br>
I could sacrifice the 40hp on the LDoN BP to gain +25 resists for the same cost, but this seems ultimately less benificial.<br>
<br>
The two best &quot;any&quot; slot resist augs (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24877" target="top">+8 poison, +8 disease</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24935" target="top">+5 fire, cold, and magic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, both 663 points), are not included because as 'ANY' slot items, both will probably go on current gear (earrings!).<br>
<br>
IN SUM:  LDoN is great for gearing up non-raiders or offering casual raiders a place to gear up while exp'ing, but for the hardcore player only serves to enhance existing gear.<br>
<br>
And I'm STILL pissed about how hard it is to get Burning Affliction IV, even with the addition of the LDoN (type 3) aug (1150 pts). <p><br>

You may want to consider doing Hard adventures.  Considerably better return on your time investment.<br>
<br>
2.  You compared BP's which is a bad point of comparison.  The Vindi BP is a way too good for how easy it is to get from a mob that is almost always up.  Even with this item though, the end LDoN BP, would be about 100 more mana, 40 more hp and a better effect.  That's significantly better than the Vindi BP.  I know that there are currently 2 FE clerics, one of them a long time member, wearing the LDoN plate BP fully augmented.  The non chest pieces are even better since it's often hard to find good non chest pieces.  Again, you compared one specific item that is rather unique, a 100hp BP with an effect that's found on an easy to kill, easy to find spawned mob.  That's not true of most slots.<br>
<br>
3.  You forgot to mention focus effects which are hard to find on non high end raid level gear but which the LDoN merchant bought gear offers non raiders.  For example, damage focuses, spell haste and mana preservation are all available on good stat / hp / mana items instead of having to sacrifice stats to get the same effects on things like ornate.  Your LDoN chain BP for example could have extended detrimentals or range focus added to it, making it far better than Vindi BP.<br>
<br>
4.  LDoN hard drops items that are an upgrade to many people.  These are dropped items, not merchant bought and you'll see them on people in even the highest end raiding guilds.<br>
<br>
5.  Depending on loot system, the LDoN items are a great way for people in high end raiding guilds to fill missing or weak slots with good gear without reducing their loot claiming ability.  FE for example is on a points system.  An FE member might choose to fill a weak slot with LDoN gear, which is pretty close to elemental quality, rather than spend points on claiming raid dropped gear in order to save up for other items.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm currently wearing 1 dropped item from LDoN hard adventures and contemplating getting the int caster gloves from the MM merchant.  When fully augmented, they would be better for me than any other choice I could make, including PoTime gear.<br>
<br>
So LDoN has quite a bit to offer hard core raiders in any guild, besides just augments to upgrade existing gear.  And, no offense, but looking at your gear, I would say LDoN has quite a bit to offer for you too.  Not sure if you understand the situation currently in the elementals on Morell Thule, but your chance of personally seeing a large amount of elemental gear in the next few months is somewhere below my odds of winning the nobel peace prize.  So you could gear up quite nicely in LDoN and make yourself a far more effective shaman.<br>
<br>
Your primary item blows and should be replaced.<br>
Your boots are outdated and should be replaced.<br>
Your belt is outdated and should be replaced.<br>
Your non PoE A bracer is not fit for my level 30 rogue twink and needs to be replaced.<br>
Your sleeves need to be replaced.<br>
Your solstice earring needs to be replaced.<br>
Your rings could use an improvement.<br>
<br>
You may get boots, sleeves and bracer at some point.  Chain elemental patterns are common and rot frequently although your guild doesnt do many elemental targets.  Odds of ring, belt, earring and primary upgrades are hovering somewhere below my odds of developing tact and empathy.  <br>
<br>
By the way, I notice you're working on the Seru earring quest.  The work involved with that one is far more than the work you would do to get yourself a nice LDoN earring with a far better effect than Acumen.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's just my opinion, take it or leave it. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14533">Sunmina</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

<br>
BTW i totally agree that Vindic BP is not a good exemple as it has really decent stats and drops off an easy always-up mob !<br>
<br>
If you look at the jewerly LDoN has to offer (Trueborn Elite Ring - hard mission drop - or the rings from NRo or SRo camps) considering you can add Burning Affliction 4 (which is not really what i call a &quot;useless focus&quot;) or some nice fT2, then you can't say that LDoN items are not worth it.<br>
<br>
Of course, hard-core raiders will always have better gear, but LDoN offers a way to equip even if you don't raid elems.<br>
<br>
Back in the Velious days: a raiding shaman would wear a Vindic BP, compared to the Barbed Ringmail from Velks Village for a non-raiding one (or a Trakanon BP if you are rich). Nowadays the comparaison has moved to a Time Chainmail compared to a fully augmented LDoN one (with the resist, HP and regen augment). You must agree the gap shrinked. Of course it still takes a lot a of time to gear up, but you are not obliged to raid if you dislike it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=37762" target="top">Ginormus Sakapus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Prophet - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eq-aurore.org/forum" target="top">Aurore</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azerraakshadowfiend>Azerraak Shadowfiend</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(1/2/04 11:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2164.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx?path=%2fArachdeus%2ffullsize%2fAzer1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: High-end SHM LDoN rantings (Info)</span><hr size=1> I don't see a big problem with the points. You said an upgrade to your BP would cost you 2002 points total (Thats less than 20 hard adventures @ 105pts each). In a good group you can usually complete one in about an hour depending on the map/puller/dps/etc. Throw in an extra hour over the course of those 20 adventures for the odd time that a pull goes bad and you're up to 21 hours for the upgrade.<br>
<br>
For the equivalent of 7 raids (3 hours each), you're guaranteed a major upgrade and don't have to worry about it not dropping or others bidding on the item you want (/rude LMM and his druid scimitars). LDoN can also be done anytime you feel like it at your own pace. I don't find it that bad. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=675382">Marauder Azerraak Shadowfiend</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Yeah 20 hours of boring ass, 4-map LDON to get <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> item (completely unaugmented) versus 100 hours of raiding multiple zones, seeing many different mobs and probably collecting an elemental suit of gear (minus BP) along the way.

<br>
100+ hours of raiding 1 or 2 of &amp; or 8 zones... with say.. 50 other people.. if not more..  You MIGHT see 1 drop come into your possession.<br>
<br>
20+ hours of 1 of 4 instanced-zones.. You might see 1 piece you BUY.. and 3 or 4 others that drop plus a few Kpp also..<br>
<br>
Hmm.. while I personally don't raid for loot, nor do I group for loot, I play to have fun.  (yes, loot does help).<br>
<br>
Sound like LDoN is still a better deal than JUST raiding.<br>
<br>
I like both, but, that's only my opinion.<br>

It was actually my question on the private boards that brought Paghk here.  I am currently using the Tae Ew Chain Tunic, really a piece of crap, lol.  Soooo in the case of the Incorpreal chain tunic, i fugured I could augment it and have a hella better tunic without having to take a lot of time raiding, and then hoping I win IF the tunic I want drops IF the mob pops when I am on playing.<br>
<br>
Have only had LDoN since Christmas and have only received 2 LDoN invites, 1 of which I went to and the other my computer crashed as I was going to the camp.  So it looks like waiting on a raid BP may be the way I go with the rate of LDoN groups i get.<br>
