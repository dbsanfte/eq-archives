<br>
Admin came on tonight, and is enforcing the list the guide made when he had four of us clerics random... Anyone who ganks it from those on this list will get perm warnings or be banned... The list is now protected by the Admin... So I guess all that want to discuss whether they can do that, can do so, but obviously they can because they are doing it... Admin has threatened to kill this spawn till tempers cool if more problems arrise, once this list is gone through... So keep that in mind!<br>
<br>
I don't agree with this list myself and I'm one of the four on it, I think the guide was out of line threatening us with warnings ourselves if we didn't random to make this list... Yet now I'm stuck with it and I loathe it, I feel very guilty for any other cleric that wasn't there to random as its not fair to them... I feel guilty that my guildmate Tariden, who I would have liked getting my Epic at the same time as, has to wait four more days before even trying to get his pearl swapped... I didn't agree with it for fact that I was there a day and a half before the spawn that was ganked by the cleric that got it early this morning... I arrived 20 minutes after the cleric that got it the morning before the ganking... While the others arrived around the time that the guy got his swapped, and those three I had to random against when I thought in fairness the Guide should have called the spawn mine for camping it longer... Guess things aren't always handled fairly by the guides, and even though now it appears I'm guaranteed my turn soon to swap my pearl, I'm still not a happy camper... <br>
<br>
The list that is being enforced by the Admin is:<br>
Elara<br>
Boraf<br>
Reigna<br>
Bigjon<br>
<br>
Now as for being lazy, yes some clerics were just outright lazy in doing this... Anyone in the top ten for sure should have had this done, top 20-30 also should have been done... So many merchant RFs were wasted because some were too lazy to get this done... If Epic was important enough it should have been done, but I was way above 60 on the list and knew I had over a year to wait, that's my excuse, what's the excuses for those in the top 10 or 20?  Yes its frustrating cause they were closer to completing their epics they should have had this done, we shouldn't be competing with people that just didn't get it done... It has made this whole prob, a lot bigger in my opinion... <br>
<br>
Last thing I wanted to comment on was Izelin's post, I was the cleric that camped out to take a nap... Cephas had the camp 20 minutes before me, I took a four hour nap when Cephas still had 6 1/2 hours before his spawn was due to pop for him to swap his pearl... I was logged on before the merchant spawned though... Elara, Bigjon, and Boraf all arrived during the time I was napping... Cephas told them that I was next and he was holding camp for me to get some sleep... Everyone though that after Cephas swapped I should have gone next except one, the person who petitioned and ended up being forced to random by that guide that came... <br>
<br>
Elara's belief was that I logged out and thus lost my spot so she should get the swap done next... I won't go into badmouthing Elara, because simply put we both agree that it was just something we both disagreed on, we do not hate each other and I know I bear her no ill will for the most part... I'm sure there's more I'm leaving out, but darn it, since this started over two days ago I've had less than eight hours sleep and I'm off to slumber...<br>
<br>
Goodnight folks!<br>

Prior to the RF changes, lots of clerics did not even care to start their epic as they thought they would not have a chance on RF. Now the ones who did not care want it done ASAP. There were about 80 people on the RF list, now there are maybe 300 waiting for the SolB spawn.<br>
<br>
The new *bottleneck* is only a 24 hours spawn. The previous one was a 24 to 144 hours repop. And some clerics complain...? LMAO <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120912" target="web">Ewenae Goldleaf</a>  -

Not a GM.  Guides will show up as GM's when you do a /who in the zone.  Out of the zone, they should show as a guide.<br>
<br>
Second, I'd guess that the guide did what s/he could at the time.  The mob hadn't spawned, correct, but much like the RF spawn pre-patch on other servers, people will and do camp things that are static spawns.  It's not uncommon for guides to ask guilds/groups/people to random for the rights for the next spawn.  It saves a lot of headaches for guides, and for players.  <br>
<br>
Thirdly, I believe that the GM-Admin did institute this list of sorts....remember the 5 spawned RF's on that other server?  It happened guys...and I think it's part of the nicer, gentler, we listen to you, Sony Customer Service.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, as a cleric who was excited about the new changes, I quickly sobered up after I realized that the spawn in SolB will be a mess for a bit yet....granted, a lot of it could have been aleviated had those who were able to do the turn-ins did when they should have, but did ANYONE anticipate this change being made to the cleric epic?  I don't remember seeing even hints of it anywhere.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, people probably won't get their epics any faster for the first few weeks, then things will level out.  Some may get it sooner than others, but the majority of those?  They weren't going to get their epics for months yet, so I don't see what the big hassle is at the moment.  I think the RF list that is currently going should be adhered to, in all honesty...you don't do your pearl turn in when you should, then the next on list gets it...sooner or later, the list will be gone (in what..a month maybe)..and that will still beat what your spot would be on that list if you just got on it (over a year?)<br>

<br>
I have an idea for the Cleric epic - since the changes introduced in last patch have made it so that everyone is being really mean to each other.  The quest would go something like this:<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;Hail, Guild_Leader_01&quot;<br>
Guild_Leader_01 says, &quot;Greetins %T.  Are you a Cleric?<br>
You say, &quot;I am a Cleric&quot;<br>
Guild_Leader_01 says, &quot;You are worthy.  Take this sprinkler and go water my lawn!&quot;<br>
<br>
This works for any guild leaders in any city.  City NPCs are usually on 6-18 minute timers.  So at this rate, you would get (just making up numbers) 10 cities x 5 guild_leaders x 5 spawns per hour = 250 epic Clerics per hour.<br>
<br>
Sorry guys - All I see is a lot of whining from a group that was willing to wait 3 months for their epic.  You were willing to wait 3 months+ from your existing spot on the list.  Someone took your spawn.  Yeah, it sucks, some people are just assholes.  Do what monks do on the Raster camp:<br>
/ooc Camp Check<br>
/tell monk_01 lemme know when you're done, eh?  I'll be FD at zone in<br>
<br>
BTW - when you log out, you lose your spot in line to everyone else that shows up while you were gone.  Sorry - just the way I see it.<br>
<br>
If anyone has a right to complain about their Epics, I'd like to nominate the Ranger Community as the group with the right-to-whine. <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/nap0leon/ish_avatar.htm">Ishinru</a><BR>

Vyrance may be wrong about yah being lazy, but you definately had different priorities then working your epic.<br>

As far as a force multi day order, a GM doesn't have that authority.  He's not going to stay online long enough to enforce the first swap, let alone one four days from now.  And if you petition it again, anyone who responds will tell you the mob is FFA.  (Correctly so)<br>

<br>
You want a bottle neck in your epic? <br>
<br>
Talk to mages, Rare/uncommon drop form Magi Ptasa which require partial clearing of hate, 3 day spawn.<br>
<br>
Phinny- Some wizard have killed him like 20 times with no staff.<br>
<br>
VS- Vi tells a_random_wizard &quot; Bend over ima gunna screw you&quot;. Uncommon/rare off a 3 day spawn<br>
<br>
Warrior- Highly Contested 3day spawn for green scale. (not garunteed)<br>
<br>
Bards- Highly contested 3day spawn for white scale (not garunteed)<br>
<br>
Necromancers- Nearly the whole damn thing<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
a Garunteed 24 hr spawn is NOTHING of a bottle neck. @#%$, the Rogue epic is harder then this farce now.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Outside of the 4 appointed GM /random forced spawns, the rest will be FFA.</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
Of the clerics who were there and who suffered through that one night of ganking (both the 4 on the list as well as the other ones in zone to do their swap) - they agreed FFA was the way to go on this mob.  <br>
<br>
The clerics weren't trying to institute a list for this mob for everyone to come; they knew it would be futile.  Sure it came up as everyone was discussion ALL the options, good or bad.  But it was veto'd.<br>
<br>
So please, don't keep harping on that fact because it's not quite true!  <br>
<br>
The only &quot;list&quot; has and always was the one that was GM appointed (and apparently backed up by the Admin on last night's/this morning's spawn).  <br>
<br>
From the sound of it, anyone who tries to take the next 3 spawns away from the folks on that list could have as severe a penalty as getting their account suspended/banned or having the privilidge of being the one who caused the Admin to STOP spawning the RF merchant for a while.  (I'm assuming Elara did in fact get her swap.)<br>
<br>
Does anyone want to risk that?  ~ Drack, do you?  I know you talk big and love getting a rep, but is it worth it in the end?  <br>
<br>
As you said, wait a few days and it's completely FFA but these folks have been through a lot in the first few days after this change(yes partially of their own making).  <br>
<br>
Solb will go back to normal shortly (zone in, check camp status, claim if not taken, leave if is); and believe me, the clerics there were glad for the RF change and acknowledged they were lucky, even if it does take a while to do their pearl swap.  <br>
<br>
The issue was more specifically related to the fact that someone disregarded a GM issued order and took the spawn out of a GM ordered turn.  I'd like to know what type of penalty, warning, etc. the ganker received.  Anyone know? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uaramelusredblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aramelus Redblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/9/02 2:36:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New bottleneck in cleric epic</span><hr size=1> The whole GM-Admin story reeks of BS.  I don't care if the GM-Admin DID zone in and tell you that, it's still BS.<br>
<br>
How are people supposed to &quot;know&quot; that the spawn is &quot;reserved&quot; for 4 spawns ahead?  What if I'm Joe Bob cleric and zone in, do my turnin, and leave?  Now I'm gonna get warned/banned because I don't troll the community boards and hear this BS story?  I don't think so.<br>
<br>
Did the GM-Admin put up a sign by the spawn that says &quot;Don't gank this or I will warn your account!  The list is Cleric1, Cleric2, Cleric3, Cleric4! -- they must do the turnins in that order!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Somehow, I bet not.  The fact is, the guide was just flat-out wrong to try to make four people &quot;roll&quot; on the spawn (especially since MORE people apparently showed up later that wanted a shot at it).  The GM-Admin was ALSO wrong, and tried to patch things up using whatever rules were at his disposal, but that's just complete bull when you boil it down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ureignastormraven.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reigna Stormraven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/9/02 2:50:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New bottleneck in cleric epic</span><hr size=1> The ganker received an official perm warning attached to her account...
