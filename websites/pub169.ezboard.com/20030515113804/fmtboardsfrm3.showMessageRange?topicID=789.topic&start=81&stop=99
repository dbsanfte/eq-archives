If you aren't sick then you are fat because of laziness. Sure some will argue about it, say its genetic or other @#%$. I totally believe it's genetic, thats why you see fat families walking down the street. But alcoholism is also genetic, but you dont see everyone with an alcoholic dad drinking. Just because you have a disposition to stuff your face doesnt mean you HAVE to, it just means it comes naturally to you, that its comforting or pleasurable. <br>
<br>
Over 60% of this country is overweight, over 40% of the 60% are morbidly obese. It is due to many factors, parents not cooking enough anymore or buying premade or prepackaged food. Also it is due to the &quot;supersize&quot; craze... Current studies show people are taking the indulgance and portion sizes of restaurants home with them, and that is a BAD thing. Fact is, your average restaurant meal contains enough calories for an ENTIRE DAY. Taking that home 3 meals a day is one of the causes of the alarming rise in overweight people, especially children.<br>
<br>
We have a generation now becoming parents, who were raised without the proper nutritional background, many who cant cook and eat out 4-5 times a week. Many schools now have vending machines in the cafeteria, when I was a kid you couldnt get snack foods during lunch, it wasnt allowed. <br>
<br>
So now, people seeing themselves and their little ones puffing up like bags of Orville Redenbocker start making excuses, saying things like they &quot;eat right&quot; Hell, if the average american saw what &quot;eating right&quot; means I'm sure a majority of us would find ourselves in the wrong. Truth is people have been led in all sorts of false directions by weight loss claims and fad diets. That, mixed with good old fashioned american overindulgance, laziness, and gluttony are responsible for a generation of people suing left and right because they cant sit in a stadium seat, cant put on their seatbelt, and didnt know McDonalds was BAD for them T.T.T.T<br>
<br>
Nothing makes me angrier than Fat people who feel the world owes them something because of something they have done to themselves. It's a sickening attitude to have.<br>
<br>
As for not being able to exercise, thats not true unless you are a quadrapallegic(sp?) And even then, @#%$, Bruce Lee rehabillitated himself from a vegetable with every muscle in his body atrophied from paralysis back into a fighting machine. Guys in wheelchairs play basketball, there is no excuse for anyone short of someone with no physical limbs.<br>
<br>
I saw an episode last week of the Penn and Teller show &quot;Bulllsh*t&quot;, it was all about diets and nutrition. Some of you folks making excuses should try and catch a repeat if you can, it'll set things straight.<br>
<br>
In the end it comes down to 2 things, either you are motivated or you are not (lazy). It's much easier to sit on your ass eating cheetos than to actually do something about it. Take it from someone who knows, sometimes you have to make big sacrafices in order to get something done. So the skinny people at the gym make fun of you, big @#%$ deal, get a walkman and you wont hear @#%$, concentrate on what you are supposed to be doing there and you wont notice them pointing at you. It's very convenient to blame others' actions but not always legit. It's not that hard to ignore someone you dont even KNOW when they are making fun of you, who gives a @#%$...<br>

They order the house omelette. I make this with 3 eggs, sausage, tomato, onions, and peppers. It also comes with homefries and toast. A pretty big meal, one I can only eat if I'm starving.<br>
<br>
But get this. They order extra egg (for both) double homefries (for both) and double toast (for both). Normally, I couldn't care that they're eating enough food for damn near 6 people but they go and top it all off with two diet soda's... At this point I felt like saying what the @#%$ is the point of ordering diet soda's? You think its going to do any fuckin good?<br>

People that are grossly overweight tend to have more health problems which translates into:<br>
<br>
1.  More absenteeism from work, which means lower productivity for the company as a whole.<br>
<br>
2.  Increased insurance costs for the whole company that these people work for.  They're going to the doctor more frequently, some of them, and those that aren't are at very very high risk of developing very serious, chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, that cost more to treat in the long run.<br>
<br>
3.  Increased health insurance costs may mean that salary increases must be capped for that year and/or the employee contribution for the health insurance premium is increased, or the company decides not to offer health benefits at all anymore because they can't afford it!<br>
<br>
This article excerpt says it better:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Obesity has a great number of negative health, social and economic consequences. Mortality and morbidity rates are higher among overweight and obese individuals than lean people. Increased BMI is linked with a greater risk of CHD, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia (Figure 5), NIDDM and certain cancers. Furthermore, obesity has been recently identified as a major independent risk factor for CHD by the American Heart Association (1997). Modest weight reduction can significantly reduce the risk of these serious health conditions. <br>
<br>
In addition to the physical consequences on health, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>obesity creates a massive social burden.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Obesity has been described as the &quot;last remaining socially acceptable form of prejudice&quot; (Stunkard &amp; Sobal 1995, p 417). This prejudice does not only exist among the general public but also among the majority of health care professionals. Negative attitudes of health care professionals can seriously impede the treatment of overweight and obese patients. <br>
<br>
Often over shadowed by the health and social consequences of obesity is the economic cost to society and to the individual. In 1995, for example, in the USA <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>the total economic cost attributable to obesity was estimated at $99 billion (Wolf &amp; Colditz 199<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . In several developed countries obesity has been estimated to account for 2-7% of the total health care costs (WHO TRS 894)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>In addition to the direct costs of obesity are costs in terms of the individuals (including ill health and reduced quality of life (intangible costs)) and society in terms of loss of productivity due to sick-leave and premature pensions (indirect costs). </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Prevention is clearly more cost effective than treatment, both in terms of economic and personal costs. Health care providers and policy makers need to appreciate the importance of obesity and its prevention, and develop effective polices and programmes to prevent obesity.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yes, people got fat because of laziness and stupidity, but at the same time, those of us that are dieting and exercising have to find a plan that works for us. Not what everyone else thinks will work. <br>
<br>
If that plan includes going to a gym and being a vegetarian that's great. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BUT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if that plan includes counting calories, eating more healthy things, and exercising at home instead of a gym, and it works, that's just as good. <br>

I am in a perfect place to say, Hey YOU are fat.  Why because I am not.  I didn't your less of a person I just said your fat.  And yes contrary to popular belief here, fat is NOT pretty.  Sure you may have a great personality, but most of the reason for that is cause your making up for the lazck of looks.  Ya I am a dick, but I am honest.  <br>
One of my best friends in this world is a big guy, but I don't judge him on that.  He knows he's fat and just rolls with it, hell he even has fun with it.  He tries to get skinny but it just down't work for him.  Key word is he TRIES.  All I am saying is if you at least try, there is less of a reason to be judged.  I see a fat person sitting in Mc Donalds, I laugh.  I see a fat person out trying to excersize(walk,jog,lift,whatever) I go hey right on.  Don't be lazy, get skinnier. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=prismata>Prismata</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/21/03 11:46:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=789.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Obesity - a study</span><hr size=1> LOL!

The problem is my parents<br>

They didnt name me Mike.<br>
<br>
Because if they named me Mike,<br>
<br>
I'd be able to say:<br>
<br>
&quot;Everyone Wants To Be Like Mike~&quot; <br>
<br>
But no<br>
<br>
My parents suck, <br>
<br>
And they named my Cat Mike<br>
<br>
And my cat is fat<br>
<br>
And noone wants to be like mike<br>
<br>
That is my story<br>

<br>
Regular exercise is the key to losing weight. Best thing is to &quot;force&quot; yourself to exercise. For example, if you gonna study at university, try to live at some student house 10-20 min away from your lecture hall, in that way you will be forced to walk/run everyday maybe even more than once per day! If you are overweight, you would reach normal weight in no-time, even if you eat unhealthy food. <br>
<br>
Regular exercise &gt; unhealthy food<br>
<br>
Believe me, I have tried it myself, eating junk food alot but running/walking 5 times per week, and I have seen it on others. To try change what you eat in order to lose weight, I do not believe that. I believe in exercise for sure. I gained weight after 1 year of EQing, but I always take longer breaks (2-3 months) and can easily catch up with my fitness again. That is no problem for me. <br>
<br>
<br>
Its when you sit down and play EQ for 7 hours per day (which you can do if you are in AV, LoV, Aurore, Reviction, Triune, FE, TW, ZH) that is dangerous... especially if you do not exercise.. cuz you will feel the need to raid everyday to get more uber and to get more keys for cod, tt, pot etc.<br>
<br>
So sooner or later I think everyone of us will need a little break, to realize we need some physical exercise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )) <br>
<br>
Personally I am having a EQ break now myself, gonna do lots of studies and physical exercise during this time. prolly a month or 2, spend some time with my gf and enjoy RL a lil. I think everyone needs that from time to time.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=789.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=789.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=789.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=789.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=789.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=789.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=789.topic&index=99><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=789.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.threadControl?topicID=789.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=789.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=789.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3>Rants</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
