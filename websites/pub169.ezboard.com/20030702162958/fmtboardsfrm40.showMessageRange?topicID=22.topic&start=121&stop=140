PAST HISTORY<br>
As a refresher, I was NOT naked. <br>
_______________________________________________<br>
<br>
If you were NOT naked, why did you just post previously that you were?<br>
For your information, the Evil Raiders were not there.  The events as you describe them do not match any time that we were there.  There was a time when a monk by himself was there and got trained and it sounded like you were talking about that time.  But there was never a time when the Evil Raiders as a group was there because we have always handled any trains that runners make through there.<br>
<br>
I could post each time that we were trained by others, but what would it achieve?  Times when we were PURPOSELY trained by Phrozen and his group of idiots in Chardok simply because he thought we were one person.  We easily killed the train mobs while one of his members monks stayed FD and watched.  <br>
<br>
As I have stated before, the Evil Raiders have never purposely trained any one.  We have never ooc'd anything against any others in the game or came on here and ranted about anyone without first being done so by others.  In our view, you guys are all idiots that believe lies from Phrozen, Teadyn, Jambolina, Yenadil and Athelas.  They have all posted lies on here simply because they did not know what really happened with one event.  Even when the logs backed up what we said and we proved that Jambolina was lying, they kept on without admitting they lied to begin with.  The irony of the whole Faydedar thing is that nothing was taken.  The druid that went there (Malitzia) got her item from the Faydedar that she spawned.  People even posted into that message thread asking what was taken?  The liars that posted there didn't answer that question.<br>

RAID RULES<br>
I suggest highly that you actually read the rules and the respawn times, wherever they are currently located because those are considered &quot;binding&quot; for the MT server. My post gave 8-12 hour range with no zone specified in that portion of the response because different zones have different respawn times. <br>
_______________________________________________<br>
<br>
Key point: 'wherever they are currently located'<br>
Where are they located?  <br>
I will give you a little hint here....<br>
No where!  There is no place that states an 8 to 12 hour range for Plane of Fear.  Before you make posts like this, you should find out if they are posted some where.  Look at the calendar, look at the scheduling posts on this message board.  You will not find a range posted.  This is exactly my point as I've stated.  If there are going to be rules posted about a scheduling of a zone, please post the rules for the scheduling clearly.<br>

So, Evil Raiders ONLY groups with you, and never on their own?  You are in every single group an Evil Raider guildmate is in?<br>
<br>
And you know each and every time that an Evil Raiders guildie is in a zone, and what happens?<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, please note - I'm giving you a chance to possibly prove that maybe you aren't the entire ER guild, as is commonly believed you are judging by posts here.  But if you aren't...wow.  I mean, y'all live in the same house and just log on at the same time?  Or call each other and go &quot;ok, logging on now&quot; type thing?<br>

Gotta love it when the response is &quot;we weren't there.&quot;  <br>
<br>
...well, where was your response when the initial accusations were thrown against you by myself and two of my guildies (please go back and read the actual accounts before you go off and spout nonsense).<br>
<br>
You nicely recognized Aaldari's account of an incident earlier and pointed out you had some different memories; go back, read our account and tell me what you &quot;know&quot; or don't know.<br>
<br>
Thx Cal, for pointing out the obvious.  Notice how many times Sun says ER has NEVER done this or that.  Unless Sun is online with &quot;his guild&quot; 24 hours a day, no one can make that claim (well they can but they'd be laughed at).<br>

Again, go back and quote me where I EVER said I was naked.  Not once did I say that.  I was the cleric that chased your lil guild out of the zone (presumably so you didn't get your arses handed to yourself) because I was protecting my guildies who ER trained.  Find that quote; I dare you.<br>
<br>
Go back and read the account posted by someone else (Lyliani) who said Druvtal was the naked cleric.  I never gave names.  I was the one who saw Druvtal trained with my own eyes.  <br>
<br>
Nice try, but you're gonna have to come up with something better than &quot;wasn't us...we weren't there.&quot;  Funny how a guild who wasn't there, can have xx number of petitions made by the group who died AND have a GM follow them around Kael on the day this &quot;supposedly&quot; happened.<br>
<br>
Nice try but there was more than just a monk in zone.  It's happened on more than one occasion that ER decided they wanted the camp so did what they had to to ensure that the current campers wiped.<br>
<br>
***<br>
And, FYI, I know what the respawn rates were in zone.  Do you?  I brought that to your attention because of your initial post outlying being in there before hand was &quot;acceptable&quot; but during was &quot;not&quot;.  You opened that door.  Different zones have different respawn rates.<br>
<br>
Whether the info is currently on these boards with the respawn times or went down with the old calendar rules is a separate issue (that yes, I agree with should be added to the rules so folks are clear), but has no relevance whatsoever to this argument. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmoon@mtboards>Sunmoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/24/03 3:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Communication</span><hr size=1> <br>

Obviously I'm missing something here.  What questions are you referring to?  I've seen one question four times.  The question that I have seen is:<br>
Why did the monk FD in front of you when you were naked in DR Hall.<br>
<br>
In case you missed it, I answer this with:<br>
The monk FD'd because he didn't want to train the High Guardians which was the subject you brought up earlier.  Obviously if the monk trained on purpose, he would have done what others had done in the area which was to continue running through the High Guardians area and get everyone killed in the area.  He stopped so that others would not get killed.  He was trained himself that is why he was running to begin with.<br>
<br>
Was there any other question you had ?<br>

<br>
No other logical excuse for what I saw with my own eyes and experienced myself a second time shortly later by the same person. Can someone explain why one lone monk would train mobs OUT of DR, into DR hallway, and FD at the foot of a naked person (who was trying to get back into DR to loot their corpse because they were killed by ER the first time)? No high guardians involved in either of the incidents I'm referring to that are addressed in previous posts of mine.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have a question. Sunmoon, you repeatedly claim that all members of Evil Raiders, your guild, the one you are Raid Leader of, are different people, meaning, they aren't different parts of one person, but actual different people, much like my husband and I are very different people. Giving you the benefit of the doubt here.<br>

Why then, has no other member of Evil Raiders shown up on this message board to prove this claim of yours, and refute everyone else? Also, why, on your guild message board, are there no messages? It's been up for 2 years now...you'd think it would be a good tool for communicating amongst 12 people who don't live in the same house. But only 4 or 5 posts in 2 years? By people not in the guild?<br>

Now, you did say that others have tried, but Fimble blocked their IP addresses.  We have yet to hear from Fimble if this is true or not...but let's assume it is.  Now, on the 2nd part?  Your own message board?<br>
<br>
<br>
Welp, that seems to be the only unanswered question <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'm not trying to be mean....I'm seriously trying to give you opportunities to prove that you aren't all those people.  You keep saying you aren't...but too many people have seen actions that would show that you are.  And you, and no one in your guild, not doing anything to show otherwise?  Well..it just seems weird.<br>
<br>
You know, I did a little boredom experiment the past few days.  I made a hot key that says  /who all 'evil raiders'   ...and I would have it set to go off whenever I healed, or anything.  Amazingly, no one in your guild would be on, then suddenly, in the space of about 4 minutes, you'd have 6-9 people show up at once.  I'm sorry..but coupled with everything else others have said...it just seems funny.<br>

Aye, Sum, not only that, but if you had EVER once read the initial account and replied to it, then and the 2nd time I mentioned it, I referred to a naked cleric who was in my eyeline (as was the monk who stopped on the naked cleric, not before or outside of aggro range but ON the naked cleric).<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm obviously not the one who has problems with communication as I addressed issues as they arise, to the correct person, with accurate information from prior posts (or when I'm paraphrasing from someone, I note that for the record or ask to have someone confirm if I'm right/wrong).<br>
<br>
I enjoy checking these boards and seeing what is gonna spew next on this topic.  It's alleviating a stressful week at work.<br>
<br>
And I'll stand my word against yours on whether ER was in zone on the aforementioned occasion.  Guess would would be believed without a doubt.  Guess there isn't too much for to say since you say this &quot;never&quot; happened. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmoon@mtboards>Sunmoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/24/03 4:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Answer is an answer</span><hr size=1> <br>
