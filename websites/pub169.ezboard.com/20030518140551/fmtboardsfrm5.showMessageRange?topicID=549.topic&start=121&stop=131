<br>
although if they in fact are not covered by the Geneva convention then doesnt the media have the right to access?<br>
maybe thats why thier being detained off soil.<br>
<br>
<br>
also i dont think Iraqi media was the only place that circulated those pictures, werent they followed up on Al'Jazeera? i thought that was Qatar news, not Iraqi.<br>
not certain on that, granted.<br>
<br>
even if they were though, does the genevea convention prevent ANY news media from using them, or just those from the govt thats holding the POWs? im asking cause im not really sure, and someone here may know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ciba>Ciba</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/10/03 5:59:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=549.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: subject</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And no, I dont have links, but I know I am correct b/c i sat stupified in front of the TV wondering how there can be &quot;rules of war&quot; .. heh, just doesnt make any sense. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's real easy to understand.  Rules of war are to prevent the total warfare seen in previous wars.  For example, Spanish conquest over Latin America was in part so easy because of the practice of total warfare.  Indians warfare was more ritualistic.<br>
<br>
To have rules of war, nations must agree to them prior to conflict.  Any country that agrees to the Geneva Conventions is bound to this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=siannemaximus>Sianne Maximus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/10/03 7:43:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=549.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: subject</span><hr size=1> Sorry Lokar, if someone is shooting at you you are in danger. And I wouldn't find it hard to believe that the sniper picked that exact spot JUST so the US would be accused of causing a civilian casuality, just like the Iraqi forces have been using neighborhoods to fight in, hide their arms in, and civilians as human shields.<br>
<br>
How about taking a look at the other side of the story instead of being so Anti-American. I think they have killed a hell of alot more civilians then they have, take a look at their wrong doings inside and outside the war.<br>
<br>
There is no way to have a war with zero civilian casuality, no matter how &quot;precise&quot; or &quot;accurate&quot; our targeting is. Nothing is perfect. Especially not war.<br>
<br>
And the person that said that the Iraqi people are conqured is not true. The sadistic Regime of Sadaam has been conqured, and I hope that bastard was blown to pieces in that 60 foot deep crater. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faloon>Faloon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/10/03 9:06:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=549.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   the phucking idiot that returned sniper fire with a TANK.</span><hr size=1> Silly Iraqi brought a rifle to a tank fight <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=brutuzmaxximuz>BrutuzMaxximuz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/10/03 9:22:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=549.topic&index=125>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: subject</span><hr size=1> We should just nuke em ... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fogelxanedu>Fogel Xanedu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1338<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/11/03 12:10:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=549.topic&index=126>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: subject</span><hr size=1> In the words of the infamous Nelson Muntz<br>

Yes, the US military has let reporters on the front lines.  French media wasted no time accepting invitations.  There are indeed French reporters embedded with US forces.  Why do we have reporters from the US and abroad there?  To dispell Iraqi lies and propaganda.  We let you see the good and the bad.  <br>

<br>
US troops across the bridge (roughly 1 mile from the hotel) were taking mortar fire and small arms fire and had been taking incomming rpg's.<br>
<br>
Iraqi troops had positioned spotters to direct the mortar fire in several of the taller buildings on the hotel side of the river.<br>
<br>
The tank that fired on the hotel's gunner was scanning for enemy troops when he spotted that he was being observed from a building by what he thought was binoculars. (It turned out to be the journalists trying to take pictures of the action)<br>
<br>
Capt. Philip Wolford, after a gunner from one of his tanks scanned the building and saw someone observing with binoculars made the decision to fire. (again while taking incomming mortar fire from unknown locations)<br>
<br>
Upon learning later that this was a hotel full of journalists, the tank troops had an AP reporter they were in contact with call some of the journalists in the Palistine Hotel and instruct them to hang sheets from the window of that one building so it could be easily identified by the troops on the ground.<br>

You are quite correct being in combat of any type raises anxiety levels, urban combat makes it worse, add to that the fact that the soldiers fighting there havent had a full nights sleep in almost a month and it still gets worse.<br>
<br>
 IF YOU HAVENT BEEN IN A COMBAT ZONE SHUT THE @#%$ UP NOW!!!!<br>
<br>
Lokar, damn man you are so close to actually sounding like you have a good argument then you say something that makes me think you are just a kid looking to argue.<br>
<br>
I was as U.S. Marine on the ground in the first gulf war, Somalia shortly after our soldiers were dragged through the streets, and yes kiddo we did have to go into Haiti as well, a very good friend of mine was shot at by a 19 year old kid with a .22 pistol in desert storm and if you think that for one second I wish my friend would have thought twice about mowing the kid down with an M-60 your sadly mistaken. Im glad he did becouse he got to come home alive. I dont give a damn who was in the area or what was going on at that hotel, if that sniper was shooting a pellet gun under the right circumstances it could have made American soldiers just as dead.<br>
<br>
The rest of the reporters that were in that building had best be glad I wasnt commanding that unit, I wouldnt have stopped at one round, and shortly after I did stop shooting I would have called in artillery strikes. Now Ill tell you why, I got to know alot of scout snipers in my time as a Marine and let me tell you a good sniper is hands down the MOST effective and lethal weapon in the arsenal of any armed force. 8 well aimed rounds in 5 minutes my ass, a blind man can do that. It takes no more than 10 seconds to find a target in your crosshairs and about 4 more to pull the trigger, and at 500 yards or more there is no way to find out where the shot came from or pinpoint it, especially in an urban area. <br>
<br>
At the risk of being redundant, IF YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN I A COMBAT ZONE SHUT THE @#%$ UP NOW!!!<br>
