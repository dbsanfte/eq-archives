<br>
EULA translated.........<br>
<br>
Some thoughts on the EULA<br>
 <br>
So, I'm rereading the End User Licensing Agreement for personal reasons. For the reading impaired among you, that's the big honking block of text you see when you load the game, under which is a set of buttons indicating your acceptance or refusal of the terms described. You thoughtfully read the text, and click the button signifying your opinion. NOT! More like you grab that mouse, and click furiously, thinking come on come on, I gotta get my fix, come on come on come on, gimme the game here, I'm gonna die if I can't have my game.<br>
<br>
I shall translate the document for you:<br>
<br>
THIS AGREEMENT MEANS WE'RE LETTING YOU PLAY OUR GAME. If you keep clicking &quot;decline,&quot; that could be the reason you don't get to play. Stop calling the tech line, you gimp.<br>
<br>
1) Only grownups get to play. If you're a kid, your mom has to be watching. If your mom isn't watching it's her @#%$ fault and she can't sue us if you get cyberlaid.<br>
<br>
2) You have to buy the game, and we don't buy the internet for you. We patch the game a lot. The really BIG patches are called expansions and you have to buy those. Also you have to pay for the action figures. When we make them.<br>
<br>
3) We can change these rules whenever. You don't read them, so who cares?<br>
<br>
4) Pick a password. Don't tell anybody, and don't make it easy. Hey, what's your password? AAARGH! We said you aren't supposed to tell anybody!<br>
<br>
5) This game costs money to play. Like feeding quarters in at the arcade, but you don't notice how much you're spending because it's a credit card, and not really money.<br>
<br>
6) We don't HAVE to let you play our game. If you hurt our feelings, we can make you go away. Well... technically you have to break one of the rules we put on our website, but since you don't read this big block of text everyone THINKS we can make you leave whenever and you gimps believe us. So STFU.<br>
<br>
7) No fair making copies or hacking our code. We don't want you to know that this is basically a MUDD with pretty pictures.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's our game. We sold it. Not you. So STFU.<br>
<br>
9) ShowEQ is bad, mmmkay? Oh, and no selling stuff on Ebay. Because we made this stuff, and only we can make money from it. There's not like a law or anything, so we're going to sound real stern here.<br>
<br>
10) The name of your pretend person can't be Luke Skywalker because then George Lucas would get mad and his lawyer can beat up our lawyer.<br>
<br>
11) Don't put viruses in chat rooms we run. Also your pretend person can't be an @#%$. Well, it can, but not anything that might make the FCC beat us up.<br>
<br>
12) We might tell people who you really are and what your personal information is. Also, if you ask tech support for help, you might want to take ShowEQ off your machine, because we can do anything we want to your computer. Like check all the files. We're allowed. Oh, and Sony can tell you gimps what to do, too.<br>
<br>
13) We sold you the game, but if it goes kablooie it's not our fault. Just cause you can't play due to lag or gremlins or our jizz in the server, it's not our fault.<br>
<br>
14) If your year old character goes kablooie, it's not our fault and you're @#%$ out of luck. Well, in some states we might have to give you a hundred bucks.<br>
<br>
15) There's like, laws and stuff that back us up. So STFU.<br>
<br>
16) If you're going to sue us, it has to be in California. Oh, and just cause we didn't bust your friend for ShowEQ althought we knew about it, we can still bust you.<br>
<br>
17) Send mail to this address. Well, don't do that. We just throw it out. Here's the long distance number you call to get the exact same recording as 1 888 STATION. We can change how much we charge you whenever. You can call 1 800 952 5210 which is the consumer affairs place in California if you think you have a real problem. Oh, and here's how to get stuff to keep your kids from seeing the porno that is an elf in newbie gear. STFU.<br>
<br>
This is Tweety, speaking. Look at #17. See that 800 number you can call if you think you have a real consumer complaint? IT DOESN'T WORK. You get the &quot;you cannot dial this number from your calling area message 5802&quot; voice.<br>
<br>
The mind reels.<br>

Y'know, it's really kinda silly, though. I have been told by most law-type folks I know that EULA's really aren't worth the paper thay aren't written on, and couldn't hold up a helium in court.
