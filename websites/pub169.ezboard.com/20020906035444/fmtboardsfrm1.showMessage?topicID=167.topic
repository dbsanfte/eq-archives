<br>

<br>
I started a rant on BaM the other day, because I was sick of constantly being asked to reapply, or told how missed I was in the ranks.  It was set off by an e-mail I recieved from Booke, and from there grew into something I am not proud of.  I was very hurt by being rejected, but the rant was because it seemed that the majority of BaM did not approve of my removal, which didn't add up.  I was told I was removed for lack of raiding in the guild, and knew that was total BS.  It was my guild chat, and abnoxious personality.  That isn't something that any person wants pointed out about him/herself I promise... especially not me, I can't take critisism.  The responses pointing out how truly awful I was put me (pathetically) to tears, and I am so sorry I was that way.  Given my reputation on these boards I'm sure even this apology thread will be seen as a plea for attention; I cannot stress enough that this is not the case.<br>
<br>
I am sorry for the things I said about everyone, because upon hearing similar things said about me I broke.  For that reason only I am truly sorry.  I won't quit the boards or quit playing Sweett to avoid the confrontations, I'd like to think I am above that.  I will, however, try to be a bit less vengeful and put whatever energy I had channeling into my bish mode into fixing my attitude.  I will also try to be more alert of the fact that even though I cannot see any of you - I am not the only person here; I should respect that everyone does not share my opinions or veiws on life.<br>
<br>
Don't base your opinions of me on either the aforesaid rant or my website - both are terribly misleading.  I don't even know who I am, otherwise I would try to set the record strait.<br>

We believed someone who had been in the guild since its creation. Helped create it even. Who would you believe? Even tho deep down I didnt believe that person, IMO she was jealous. You came into the guild and everyone liked you. EVERYONE. Except this person ( I am sure you know who it is, so lets keep it that way you know everyone else doesnt except the people this relates to).<br>
<br>
Your chat, your chat was funny. Your chat is the stuff I and others get in trouble for all the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am sorry I over reacted. But I hate seeing something we all worked so hard for put down. Over a huge miss understanding for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
To me it seamed like you were just trying to make us look bad. <br>
<br>
Booke has cleared some things up with me. That I did not know beforehand. <br>
<br>
So I am sorry I over reacted. But I was also kind of hurt, that I called you a friend and chatted with you at times, nothing about the guild just wanted to be your friend and talk to you. Then you came here and ranted us for it.  <p> <a href="http://home.rconnect.com/~lgable/sharpers.jpg" target="_blank">
