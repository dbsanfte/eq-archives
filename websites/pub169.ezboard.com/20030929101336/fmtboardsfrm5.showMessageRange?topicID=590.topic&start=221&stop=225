I have just a  too diverse taste in music. If i could make a 10 cd compilation then perhaps i could call it my favourite songs. But on one CD? That would take me a year to produce and the songs would change all the time. <br>
<br>
Leonard Cohen - The Partisan.<br>
Nick Cave - Ship Song.<br>
Portishead - Pedestal.<br>
Tori Amos - Winter.<br>
Opeth - Credence.<br>
Lynyrd Skynyrd - Free bird.<br>
Jimi Hendrix - Castles made of sand.<br>
Soundgarden - The day i tried to live.<br>
Faith no more - Smaller and smaller.<br>
Smashing Pumpkins - Hummer.<br>
Jeff Buckley - Grace.<br>
Tool - Fourty-six &amp; 2.<br>
Turbonegro - Suburban princes deathsong.<br>
Entombed - To ride, shoot straight and speak the truth.<br>
Kyuss - Hurricane.<br>
Pixies - Debaser.<br>
<br>
Ok i don't know why i post this cause seriously it sucks. But perhaps ill finish a proper one in about a decade heh.<br>
<br>
Anyway. Leonard Cohen - The partisan. That song is a must for me. My mother have listened to Cohen as long as i can remember and ive heard that song since i was a kid. I still listen to it from time to time and i still think its an absolute mastepiece. When they start singing in french i get goosebumps.<br>
<br>
Dinosaur Jr - In a jar. The song is from one of my favourite records, You're living all over me. And it is... PROBABLY my favourite from that record. There are some other contestors to being my favourite on it. But In a Jar is the one i've been listening to the most. It's trashy indie pop/rock as only John Mascis can produce with his guitarr and broken voice.<br>
<br>
Portishead - Pedestal. Another song from one of my favourite records. Its from the record Dummy wich was released in 94 and i have actually listened to that record ever since i picked it up in about 95. Every track on this record is stunning. Anxiety is evident in every song on the record and when im down this is my record of choice. The song itself is great and its probably my favourite on the album now. But it didn't start out like that.<br>
<br>
Nick Cave - Ship song. This is one of my favourite ballads. I usually have this track in my mini disc and the MD is usually with me at all times. When i go home drunk from the pub this is a song that frequently get played and i tend to sing with him in the lyrics heh.<br>
<br>
Lynyrd Skynyrd - Free Bird. When i did military service this was my platoons song of choice. Military training is compulsary in Sweden and not a single one wanted to be there. This song got played every day in 10 months and when we marched through the gates for the last time we were singing &quot;Cause im as free as a bird now. And this bird you cannot change!&quot;. The guitarr &quot;solo&quot; at the end of the song is probably one of my favourites aswell. Normally i can't stand guitarr solos but this one is special.<br>
<br>
Opeth - Credence. What can i say. Opeth is my favourite band. I wanted to put in Drapery Falls, The moor or Deliverence but the songs are too long and i had to delete somethign else. Anyway Credence is the best acoustic song they have made. Well thats my oppinion now. My last one was either Face of Melinda or Benighted. When the record Deliverence was released it was A fair judgment. Anyway its an awsome song.<br>
<br>
Turbonegro - Suburban Princes death song. This was probably the first Turbonegro song i heard. I loved it then and i still do. Just a great song.<br>
<br>
Jeff Buckley - Grace. Another of my favourite album and the title track is fantastic. I just love his voice and the lyrics are great. &quot;Grace&quot; was the only album that got released when he lived. <br>
<br>
Jimi Hendrix - Castles made of sand. This is without a doubt one of my favourite songs. I love the lyrics and the playful guitar delivered by Hendrix is amazing.<br>
<br>
Soundgarden - The day i tried to live. From the Superunknown album. A great song that ive listened to since the album got released. Sadly i don't care much for Audioslave but Chris Cornell is one of the best singers out there imo.<br>
<br>
Entombed - To ride, shoot straight and speak the truth. Heck what can i say. I just love this song.<br>
<br>
Tool - Fourty six and 2. Been awhile since i listened to Tool but that song have been played so damn much on my stereo it isn't even funny. Great song.<br>
<br>
Tori Amos - Winter. Now i seriously love Tori Amos and can't wait until she comes to Sweden again. But to pick out a song that i love more than the others isn't easy. Winter is one of the songs ive listened to most so i guess its the one i like the most. Piano is imo the most beautiful sounding instrument and you get alot of it in this song.<br>
<br>
Faith No More - Smaller and smaller. Angel dust is their best album and this is perhaps not their best song but it have evolved to my favourite with them. Mike Patton is another absolutely amazing singer. Perhaps the most versitile in rock.. Ever? <br>
<br>
Kyuss - Hurricane. One of my favourite bands with a bad ass track. Probably my favourite music genre atm aswell. But there isn't room to toss in Slo Burn, Fu Manchu, Unida, Hermano, Queens of the stoneage etc. So this song have to represent all of them. Hurricane have worked its way up on my list. But heck is it a favourite song? No idea heh.<br>
<br>
Pixies - Debaser. Brings me fond memories that song. It is a great one and the song is &quot;furiously happy&quot;. Francis Black is a great singer for this kind of music. <br>
<br>
Smashing Pumpkins - Hummer. Great band and a great song. One of the first albums (Siamese Dream) i bought that i still care alot for. <br>
<br>
But i can't call the album my all time favourite songs. Cause it really isn't. There is no Godspeed you black emperor in it cause their songs are too long. Not my favourite with OPeth either. And since i do listen to a shitload of different bands i tried to pick songs that have a somewhat special meaning to me but that didnt work out either. Still though i like every song on it but it doesn't really represent what i listen to now.<br>
<br>
Oh and i wan't to freeze my post count thank you very much! 666 how evil is that! <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqfaces.com/photos2/broken.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qkasflah>Qkas Flah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Epic Poster!</span><br>  Posts: 2062<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/26/03 7:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=590.topic&index=222>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/qkasmt/hope.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> This will be impossible for me. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
