    I was there.   I wore the Titan Lords tag.  I got to see its horrible internal political problems first hand.   Titan Lords wiped out on every other mob in HoT, mostly because of Torturedone's poor raid leadership.   It took a guest before the break up to tell him how it should be done.   It may have been different when Shakkar was in charge.  For heaven's sake, they didn't want debuffs announced either.<br>

Once there u encounter problems pressing on and leaving time consuming epic raids behind u and trying to take on the stuff beyond HoT. Things can turn into stalemate real fast and you need a lot of patience. So leaving for better guilds, merges etc. become tempting.<br>

That would seem to me to be more of a transition to a new organization than a guild continuation seeing that HF brought much to the FE table (viva Kardz/Daggen and others). However, I am not the long-term knowledge base you are on the Hamp/RA/FE saga so I may be off base. Sorry to LOV I did not mean to forget you just on a bit different time zone. I believe your old guildleader helped to provide a nice transition for you.<br>
<br>
And your point is well observed. If you have a strong core of excellent officers (which I feel we do in REV except for me who cant spell and forgets his own name), your guild will flourish. I expect, as you gave the TW/FE example, strong guilds will continue if they strong membership and leadership that was my point above.<br>

<br>
The first couple of times we went to HoT, we DID wipe (or come to near wipe) roughly every other pull because a) we were inexperienced there, and b) we tried bringing too many people who were a tad too low of level, or did not have the proper resists.<br>
<br>
On the flipside, the last couple of times we did HoT (which by that time, Lara had either stopped coming on HoT raids, or had left TL altogether) we did very well considering we only pulled mobs to the front door.  During those last few raids, we instead had just a couple of deaths each pull.  Unfortunately, having to rez and rebuff 3 or 4 people after every mob slows things down considerably, so I wouldn't go so far as to say we were a well-oiled machine.<br>
<br>
As to any leadership issues in TL at that time, well, I know I didn't really do anything to try to make the situation any better, so I don't think I should really make any comments concerning that. <p>After working out the kinks of his new incantations, Knobby decides a Poo Elemental wasn't such a good idea after all...

As for TL, it started to fall after Shakkar left. Although Shakkar was his own set of problems and created loads of strife at times, he was willing to put forth the effort, he was dedicated, and he was a stern leader. Much as I love Raydin she the guild was basically forced upon her. She really didn't have the time available and wasn't cut out to lead a guild emerging into the high end like TL was.<br>

They were FAR from a well oiled machine, Avenge was a cool guy and really the backbone of the guilds raiding structure, cudo's to him. But as far as saying the guild was even anywhere near efficient, is just the words of someone that doesnt know any better. IE, HoT = easy pulls, easy kills, and generally 2 hours of fun filled raiding and jokes and @#%$. <br>
<br>
Deaths shouldnt happen unless someone does something really stupid (yeah yeah been there done that, hate it when you click /corpse then forget your not on a monk when you hit your fd key and it goes to your spellbook), or the rules arnt set straight.<br>
<br>
As for Torturedone, well for a 60 monk in a level 50 guild he sure made himself seem like a god, but really he was just run of the mill, still an ok guy though. Yenadil is right about TL having the family thing happening, and also the hmmm. . .potential to grow if only people put their attitude one one common goal. Priorities and leadership is what keeps a guild together. Noone can argue that, may it be fun, loot, uberl33tness, monopolisation of the server, chatting etc, Its all about the members sharing the same common attitude.<br>
<br>
As for DM, well personally I think that mass recruitment is a joke, but in this case it seems to have made a sort of powerhouse. Time will tell whether things sort out though, GL to em though, I withdrew my app a day or two after I posted it when I saw the guild roster go up by about 20 members at least. IMO a bad move, but I chat with a lot of members almost the whole time im online and they share the same thoughts. Still I laugh when they made one of their 60war's change his pwd so I couldnt steal guild secrets and strats. . .lameness considering what I know.<br>

<br>
No one actually thinks that you know anything useful, and if you do, it's because you cheated someone's PW or watched a real player accomplish something, then claimed the feat as your own.<br>
<br>
If they made someone change their PW so you couldn't get to it, it's probably so you couldn't log in, act like it was the 60 war and lead the guild to a whipe in Droga. <p>Baron Kyepez <BR>

<br>
And yes I have to say that Titan's clerics worked amazingly well together, and some of those clerics I met, while in TL, were simply, some of the absolute nicest clerics I have the privledge to know to date.<br>

We went to HoT like 20 times and only on the first couple did we have problems until we figured out what we were doing wrong just like any other new guild to HoT. Heck we spent 9 hours there one day and had ZERO wipes. Yes we were far from a well oiled machine but we could handle ourselves there. And we had very few deaths also. Hell we had over 20 armor drops and a couple were Bp's and one was a robe.<br>
 And yes when Avenge Left TL it hit TL hard along with me leaving also. If i remeber right U and Tort argued alot in Guild chat and umm both thought u were right. I personally don't like u saying bad things about my old guild. Titan Lords was a great guild and had a very nice family feeling, We had alot of potential it just didn't happen for TL for various reasons. And Titan Lords is still around just not HoT capable or VS capable anymore. <p> <a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=175828">Boraron_Eagleblade_Proud_Member_of_Desperate_Measures</a><BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=166.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=166.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=166.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=166.topic&start=81&stop=83>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=166.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=166.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=166.topic&index=40><img src=http://sevendragons.net/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.threadControl?topicID=166.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=166.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=166.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1>General</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
