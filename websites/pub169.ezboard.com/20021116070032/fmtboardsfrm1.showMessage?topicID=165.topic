The ones who you can ALWAYS count on, those you enjoy seeing everyday. This is what can make something you cherish in a game very special to you.<br>
<br>
My something special died tonight. <br>
<br>
Will it be reborn, I don't know. Can it? Possibly, but in case it isn't, I personally wanted my own thread to make mention that I, Booke..a lowly 53 mage was allowed to join the ranks of Blades and Magic and flourish in ways I never had seen before. Sure as a Ronin there were new places to go. But BaM had that extra fire to them. When 35 Ronins were knocking out ToV, BaM was doing it with 16-18. Gorenaire? Knocked out with about 13-15 (and this was before manaburn). I never had so much envy as when I was a Ronin and would talk to Nalyanaa and hear their accomplishments. It was incredible storytelling about what wonderful people there were in their ranks.<br>
<br>
I apped, Hate the first raid, 1st and 2nd floor and Inny..all zapped in under 4 hours. no wipeouts. INCREDIBLE i said to myself, having died over and over again up there with less coordination.<br>
<br>
I will not be joining any guild on MT, I think, unless it is a reformed BaM. I mean no offense/disrespect to any other guild on our server, but to me, nothing can compare to the friendships in this guild that were formed, the organization and the gung ho attitude of all involved. Sure, other guilds may have it, but I don't want to spend a lot of time getting to know others styles of play.<br>
<br>
I thank BaM for dedicating so much time on a weekend in june to get me to 7th island. It literally astonished me with the perseverance that everyone went through, for what? For me. WOW. how do you repay that? I am not talking a bridge, I am talking a full weekend raid of 20-30 people dedicating their weekend to ME! You CAN'T repay it.<br>
<br>
But no BaM, no Booke. (yes, i know the name BaM is gone, but BaM wasn't a name to me, it was the people and that is what I mean by &quot;no BaM&quot;). If the guild chooses not to reform, I am likely headed to Vallon Zek with Booke. It pains me to do so, but like I said, I lost something very special to me tonight.<br>

Way to slip in a little guild bashing there you moron.  If you are trying to paint Ronins as some bumbling clown show, you've got it wrong and you know it.  If you want to make this a pissing contest, we killed both Gore &amp; Rumblecrush before BaM.  We also did RC with exactly 3 clerics.  How many did you have on your kill?<br>

<br>
It wasn't a bash against Ronins Drax. Nowhere in there did I say that Ronins was bumbling clowns. Ronins was a great guild, WAS. Leadership greed and the &quot;its my way or the highway&quot; dictatorship killed Ronins. Every Ronin knows that, except you.<br>
<br>
I stayed Ronin, due to my loyalty to Alhazred and my MI fellowship. Once the gauntlet was dropped by Cec (in the middle of a ToV pull nonetheless, while fighting) about a change in policy, questions were met with &quot;don't like it, you can be ported out&quot;. Sorry, I play to have fun, not have someone act like an asspimple.<br>
<br>
Now, my beef in Ronins was ALWAYS with Cecilia, not you, not anyone else, and not any other member of the guild. I still respected Ronins members, but the leadship was for @#%$, and every member who has since disbanded knows it.<br>
<br>
I apologize if you took my message about Ronins the wrong way, it was not meant to be. I only stated that when I was a Ronin (and this is true, please don't try to argue it, because you were not around, you had gone to Stormhammer), it was new to us, and we were learning, so the entire guild would always be there..about 35 people.<br>

Ceci didn't tolerate whining &amp; lootwhorishness, and I hardly blame him.  Once you go out there and start &amp; lead your own guild, then you can come back here &amp; criticize the job Ceci did.  Until then, you frankly have no clue what it takes, &amp; have no right to play armchair quarterback.  <br>
<br>
I was there for the first HoT raid &amp; I was there for the last.  Don't try to snow me &amp; tell me that you were not trying to imply that BaM members were so much more talented than Ronins members.  I'll tell you the same thing anyone else has said when they have been compared to another guild who did something w fewer ppl:  were we supposed to tell ppl to leave so our kill would look more impressive?  Hardly our fault that we could attract ppl to our raids.<br>
<br>
I earn my respect with an iron fist.  Ceci is no different.  IMO, Ceci's leadership is why Ronins got as far as it did; I've seen what happens to guilds that lack strong leadership.  <br>
<br>
Next time you want to make a goodbye post, leave Ronins out of it.  Next time you have a problem with someone, don't make some off handed slam against an entire guild that is better than you, or even me. <p><br><font size=2>

he left Ronins for Stormhammer.<br>

his opinion matters?<br>
<br>
real proud member.<br>

<br>
anyways Draxus..yer right. Ceci did run things with an iron fist, making sure that her, and all of her alts and her friends and her friends alts and those who buried their nose in the crack of her ass..her his..i dunno anymore, don't care..Cec made sure they were WELL stocked.<br>
<br>
And lootwhoring? yer talking to the wrong person about lootwhoring. I am so not a lootwhore it isn't even funny.<br>
<br>
Simple fact is, Ronins died, because Cec killed it. No, not the same way that BaM died, but by Cec his/herself being a lootwhore? Why you think BaM broke away from Ronins? Why you think the second exodus occured?<br>
<br>
Now, I totally understand yer backing of Ronins and Cec, don't think I don't cuz i would do the same for Matt/Bik and BaM, or Alhazred and MI/Emergence..i stay loyal and I see you do too. It's a good quality to have, but you took something I said the wrong way, and really went overboard. That isn't my fault.<br>
<br>
Do a /who all Ronins (There are 2 players connected.) sometime..and then tell me a great guild didn't get destroyed? Much like BaM.

<br>
1) Cecilia did announce to try a new loot idea.  But I remember it being said that only for that night.  But to argue GL in guild chat over loot during the a raid is not better IMHO.  I didn't know about it beforehand, but after I think about it, the policy would speed up the guild growth.  I agree that Cece was trying to test some loot policy, sometimes you can't really keep the loot policy from raiding lguk, after you are trying to get pass HoT.  But it's a past point.<br>
<br>
2) Drax was trying to move his SK, did I mention SK?  But VI mess up and moved the warrior instead.  And StormHammer only allow player to move back after one month is up, I believed Drax when he says that's what happen.  And Draxus did move back after one month.<br>
<br>
3) Before Cece was taking a hard line on the GL leadership, we were still raiding PoH and some other crap.  Then with Cece pushing us to do HoT, we were attracting more recruits to HoT.  Do we need 35 regularly to do HoT stairs, no.  But we do need 35 to roam inside HoT with good kill rates.<br>
<br>
4) Timing of Cece wasn't able to play due to IRL for 2-3 months, and many of the leaders either not playing or few left was and is why there are few /who Ronins.  But with the heart of who's left, and what not, it may or may not be the same, who knows.<br>
<br>
One fact that was not mention.  I cut down MT's play time from like 40+ hrs a week to like about 8hrs.  So many times Cece was triple box with MT and Raylia and Laeorn and Cecilia, or combo; especially at the beginning.  So when Zechz gets pwned, MT can tank to avoid a wipe.  Raylia wasn't playing, Laeorn plays very few, Drax got screw by VI, Moren was on long vacation, Amp &amp; Kunz was busy with school, and other older members were either getting tired when we keep doing PoH/PoF, or just needed a break.<br>

you always were a classy one, and it is a well put post<br>
<br>
(note to Draxus, see Mags lack of flames)<br>
<br>
I agree, that in the swing of things, Ronins kicked ass and took names later, and I remember the nights of over 20 apps joining us on raids to Kael of all places. Yes, Ronins had the drawing power, and was DAMNED strong. I would say Ronins was within a whisper of NToV.<br>
<br>
But the issue of Cec making the change about the min pts bid for ToV armor was not only in mid raid on ToV, but we had a mob in the camp and were fighting at the time it appeared in guildchat. Bloodmore and I were the most vocal. Not that loot was the important thing, but the fact that no vote occured and we considered the guild a democracy where ideas were shared and votes were taken. Suddenly, when we voice our concerns, in guildchat Cec says, &quot;if you don't like it, you can be ported out&quot;. uhm..ok..i blew my remaining points I had with Ronins on the next silk drop and bailed to think about it. Thought about it, decided to stay and saw an attack by Cec on the guild board, going off about my RL. /guildremoved.<br>
<br>
I had 0 problems with any other person you mentioned in your post from Ronins, Mags..and certainly not with you. You are one of the greatest tanks to ever keep me from seeing LOADING..PLEASE WAIT.<br>

While you're at it be sure to include about how I was personally responsible for no less than two other members getting their epics at my own expense.  Be sure to include how &quot;WELL stocked&quot; I was.  Be sure to include all the phat loot I got for being part of that inner circle.

You have some gall trying to impeach my character.  Maybe you would like to edit that comment now.<br>

Ceci wasn't perfect.  Ceci did a lot of things I didn't agree with.  If you think I didn't speak my mind with him every bit as openly as I have with you, I invite you to ask him on any of the rare occasions he plays.  You will never see me putting down Ronins on these boards because of it, though.  Not ever. <p><br><font size=2>

Now, like i said..i posted something, you read it the wrong way, and it burrowed under your skin and festered. READ MAGS POST. I never said 35 people was a BAD thing! I was saying the fact that going into ToV, we always had plenty of people, with members, apps and guests. Now, this sucks, why? Loot..with so many people, the loot is spread thin. BaM knocking out ToV with 16-18 people = more loots.<br>
<br>
You make it sound like i tried to put Ronins in comparison with the Keystone Cops or something:<br>
<br>
&quot;duh, where da complete heal button at&quot;<br>
&quot;what does 'assist MA' mean?&quot;<br>
&quot;oh, duh..you didn't want me to pull the WHOLE zone??&quot;<br>
<br>
NO! I am not insinuating that at all. I don't think you were there for it, but *I* made probably the biggest goof up there when Ronins was raiding ToV.<br>
<br>
Cecilia tells you, &quot;kill pet&quot;<br>
You tell Cecilia, &quot;ok&quot;<br>
click wrong hotkey (not one to make pet go bye bye)<br>
didn't notice pet was still up and did not gimme the &quot;as you wish&quot; message<br>
Laeorn shouts, &quot;pulling&quot;<br>
Everyone screams &quot;WTF? ADDS!&quot;<br>
LOADING..PLEASE WAIT.<br>
<br>
yeah, i was a bumbler in ToV, but not once did i try to say Ronins were. <br>
<br>
Now, you can feel free to DROP this petty beef you have with me, and MOVE ON.<br>

Simple: BaM did @#%$<br>
Other guilds did @#%$<br>
@#%$ died<br>
@#%$ stinks<br>
@#%$ will respawn<br>
@#%$ will die again<br>
Who gives a @#%$, but someone's gotta stop feeding the trolls or even more @#%$ happens. You dont eat, you dont shi.t, you dont shi.t, you die. Let the trolls and flamers die. <br>

Accept the fact that I have a 13 foot penis, and that one day you might have the pleasure of sucking it. But till then, fighting over who's dick is bigger than whoelses is useless. Because soon enough you gotta buy a whole new tape-measure. Level, kill, move on. <br>
