<br>
Ok to clarify things.  I handed him gloves in trade window.  This is when he said he had a pair.  I said he should let me have them(my roll was next highest in this case), they were twice the gloves that I was wearing at the time.  He laughed at me.  No he did not give me a 'huge GRATS' he laughed.  Blabberpauss had already logged before the 5th in the group had rolled, it was getting late for her.  It was late for me as well, and so I gave the gloves to another group member (I didn't want to haul them to the baz for him) and logged out.<br>
<br>
Jorrell, I thank you for your offer, but I'm not here asking for pp.  Had I known you were going to roll on them when they dropped (already having a pair yourself), I would have left the group then.  Keep your plat, upgrade yourself, and maybe just keep this in mind next time you group with people.<br>

Obviously this was a communications failure.  When in a group with people I do not know or are non-Guild I simply make sure everyone knows and agrees to how loot will be distributed.<br>
<br>
Separately I always prefer someone who can actually use and enjoy the gear to get it rather than just have it sold.   But that is just me and I generally defer to someone who will actually equip said item.<br>
<br>
But IMO there was no reason to bring up this individuals Guild unless said person failed to comply with the agreed to loot arrangement.   That is just mud slinging.... OH wait that is what rants are for....<br>

Everyone (including a mage and a shammy) rolled for those gaunts; and after winning the roll and your offer of 1k for the gaunts, you said that you were going to stay at that camp until you got a pair for yourself. Since you don't want the plat to go buy yourself a pair as you stated above. I wish you luck on your next roll. The gaunts you want are fairly common at that camp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eeook>Eeook</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/03 3:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Jorrell/Blurd of MLF</span><hr size=1> Jorrell keep the money.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kasalic>Kasalic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/03 3:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Jorrell/Blurd of MLF</span><hr size=1> Borimorg,<br>

You obviously misunderstood my post. I have no issue, nor have I ever had an issue with anyone in MLF. Either when I was a member or since. The right or wrong of what happened is none of my business, my point was that you were effectively stating that Flintrok and the officers of MLF would not care what any member did outside of a guild event. I merely found this surprising.<br>
<br>
It was never my intention to try and make this into a guild thing, and as for the 'typical' remark, I hardly ever post on these boards, so I take it that was not aimed at me?<br>

I asked if I could have them, and then I even offered you 1k for them (not knowing baz value), This was all I had on me, but you said no, they're worth 10k.  I did not have logs running that night either, as I did not expect someone to do such a thing.  But, i'm pretty sure you threw a 'hehe' or a 'lol' at me when i said i wanted them and offered you the 1k.  That made me upset, and rather than keep playing for another 4 hours or so, hoping for gloves to drop (then only lose them to a member that just joined the group) i logged.  It was late.  You say that those gloves are common, but in the few days I've camped their, and the hours I spent that night waiting for a pair, those were the only ones to drop.  If they were such a common drop, why not have the courtesy to let someone who could use them have them?<br>
<br>
I guess I'm just mad that not everyone in this game has respect for other players.  Is 1k such a bad offer for an item that I helped the group kill, especially since you had a pair?  Your guildie makes it sound like you would have gladly handed them over, had someone said they needed the item, or had a problem with them going to your alt.  I did, and I offered you some money.<br>
<br>
I do believe you are a great player, I just don't agree with the way you loot.  My intention was not to sling mud at MLF, if this was the way it has been interpreted, I give my apologies to everyone in that guild, which I still have respect for (as stated in my original post).  I just wanted to inform them of the acts of one of their members, especially an officer.  Had one of my guildies done this, I would expect to see my guild tag in the rant as well, so that myself or another officer, could be alerted to this action.<br>
<br>
I thank you for your response Jorrell, and wish you the best in your future huntings.<br>

<br>
2. The other half of the community that play by rules (and nothing wrong with that at all, just couldn't figure out what to call you folks) see nothing wrong with it.<br>

Personally the right thing to do, IMO, if I won the roll, then I decide what to do with them. If I had a pair and someone else in the group could use them as an upgrade I would pass it to one of those people. Its just the more respectable thing to do, and hell this is a game, if I want one for my alt, I would play my alt for it. I most certainly wouldnt run her over to loot it when someone else in the group seriously needs them for their main. Thats just the way *I* feel. <br>
<br>
If no one in the group could use it as an upgrade and I won the roll then maybe I would have run my alt over. But Im a lazy ass, I prolly would have passed. <br>
<br>
But serious do I care what the guy did with the item?

<br>
Should Jorrell have put his gloves on his alt before hunting at that site, so he could loot if they dropped? No, that's retarded. He should hunt in the best gear he owns, of course. Keep in mind that Jorrell played just as large a part in winning that gear as anyone else there.<br>
<br>
Just be happy for Jorrell, he won some fine gear that will help him upgrade. And why aren't the NBG morons bitching about the casters rolling for the gloves, when all they were doing was selling them? LIKE JORRELL WAS DOING???<br>
<br>
This rant is retarded. I'm taking notes. I don't want to group with anyone who believes I shouldn't roll for gear I can't equip myself. Or state the NBG part of the group before joining. Of course, at camps where only melee drops happen, don't expect to see too many non-melee desiring to hunt there with you.<br>
<br>
I think that irritates me more than anything. Calling NBG implies that a camp has equal drops for all who hunt there. However, we all know that is never, ever the case.<br>
<br>
Instead, just roll for everything. EV. ERY. THING. And if someone who can't use the gear wins, give them a gratz, and go about your business. And, help them, with a smile, if they need an alt to loot that they are trying to twink, or sell in bazaar. In fact, in that way, will we all get along. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=leiph>leiph</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/03 6:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: well</span><hr size=1> Bowz said:<br>

I'm sorry, but if you are in a group that was clearly not a NBG group (all casters were rolling), your default expectation should be that you win if you have the highest roll, you lose if you don't.  But to whine about someone who did get the highest roll not giving them to a random stranger in a pick-up group, and then rant that person as being greedy because he did not give them to you, or give them to you for a ludicrously low offer, shows a distinct lack of perspective and class.<br>

As for trying to hitch your rant to the &quot;its' Lore&quot; discussion, note that, in a pickup, non-NBG group, the only relevance a &quot;Lore&quot; tag should have is with respect to the inconvenience to the group of having to take time out to accomodate the transfer of the item to the winner.  Otherwise, loot is loot, and if its not NBG, the item should have the same value, similar to a cash equivalent if you will, to each and every member of the group.  Since your original post was not ranting the inconvenience of the transfer of a duplicate Lore item,  I can only assume you tried to use the &quot;Lore&quot; angle to get another swipe at the apple -- that is, to try to discount Jorrell's legitimate winning roll so you could be defaulted the item.  <br>
<br>
Putting it another way, if you discount the &quot;Lore&quot; argument (since you did not raise the inconvenience factor), how would you have reacted if the item was not Lore?  You would never have presument that Jorrell shouldn't be entitled to the drop if he had the winning roll.  (I am sure that you and everyone else in a non-NBG group had rolled on and looted duplicate non-Lore items, whether it is a blue diamond, a fine steel sword, a thurg/ss gem, or uber_item_1).  So why do you become righteously indignant simply because it is a &quot;Lore&quot; item?  What key facts have changed that make this such a morally repugnant action?   Nothing.  The item holds the same value to everyone in the group when it is decided that rolls will not be made on a NBG basis, and to profess otherwise in the case of droppable items is logically inconsistent. <br>

I hope you can see the perversity of this statement.  Or are you seriously suggesting that, regardless of the loot method agreed to by a group from the beginning, regardless of who had the highest roll, I (or you, or anyone) should be able to override all of that by simply asking after the roll that the item be defaulted to me for a ludicrously small token payment (maybe a roll tax?) akin to 1/10th of the item's market price. Hmm, come to think of it, that Wizard in BoT last night already had uber_staff_1 before we even started the group - I can't believe that he didn't give it to me for 1 Fuzzlecutter 500 formula, even though I didn't have the highest roll -- after all, I did fling arrows into the mob (think I may have even sow'ed the bastard too).<br>
<br>
In any event, the believability of the facts underlying your story came into question for me when this:<br>

I'm sorry, but if you are in a group that was clearly not a NBG group (all casters were rolling), your default expectation should be that you win if you have the highest roll, you lose if you don't.

Don't expect NBG when the group was clearly established as FFA. I do, however, want to comment on the: <br>
<br>
&quot;Every type of group is either greed, or NBG&quot; statement. <br>
<br>
That statement is so riddled with biased spin its rediculous. I would argue that NBG allows for MORE greed to take place and is completely unfair. Unfortunately everquest does not have equal drops for everyone at every camp in fact there isn't one camp in the game that has exactly the same value upgrade for every class, even all/all items can be better or worse for certain classes. Even without people lying about needing stuff, this system is incredibly unfair. <br>
<br>
With the &quot;greed&quot; system as that person put it, every single droppable item is a potential upgrade for everyone in the group. The fact that you need to barter via item trading or currency to obtain the upgrade is IRRELEVANT. Everyone &quot;needs&quot; upgrades. <br>
<br>
Its called &quot;everyone roll&quot; or &quot;ffa roll&quot; vs &quot;NBG&quot;, and again I'd argue that even the term &quot;NBG&quot; is full of spin and ought to be changed, but hell everyone knows it by that term so oh well. <br>
<br>
Finally, of course friends/guild groups are a different story much of the time, each guild/group has their preference and this is rarely an issue. NBG will NEVER be as fair to all in pickup groups as ffa roll, NEVER.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moayin>Moayin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/8/03 3:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Excuse me scrappy,...<br>
