<br>
everything comes to an end and now it is my turn to turn in my robes and lay down my magic. I have been thinking a lot about this and I already have regrets of doing this, but I have to be strong...<br>
<br>
I had three great years in this game and met many wonderfull friends. One person will always stand out among the others and that is Karelyn. I met her when I was about to quit the game but she kept me playing. Over and over she kept me playing and her friendship meant everything to me.<br>
<br>
I have tried to remember all the wonderful friends I had in this game, please do not take it personal if your name isn't listed here as I met so many friends that my old brain can't remember all the names <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Aaelyania<br>
You were the first to ever ask Aeries to group and I found in you a great friend that I will never forget. We had a lot of fun together back in the first couple of levels and I always treasured that very high. I will always remember the orcs slowly trying to run away, followed by the “I love being a Wizard! BOOM!”. Or when you invis'ed me in South Ro near the undeads, to protect me from adds. I lost my pet and they still saw me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      Seeing you getting back into the game made me very happy again.<br>
<br>
Ariey<br>
You and I were supposed to get married in the game but your RL BF didn't approve of it and we stayed friends. I was very sad to see you leave and loved your little tells when you occationally logged on to say hello.<br>
<br>
Boezool<br>
Boe, you SWG ... Silly Wizard Gimp ... I will miss talking to you and hanging out with you. Stay cool and go slay Tunare <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Clee<br>
I met you a long time ago when you were playing Kaminsky and saw a very good friend in you. You were greatly missed when you left the game.<br>
<br>
Donador and Drahnak<br>
I enjoyed your little fights in Saga and always liked you two. Now only Donador remains in the game and I hope he will sit down at the campfire and remember us all.<br>
<br>
Erlis and Wailen<br>
Wailen, I remember ripping you off by selling you a Lockjaw Hide Vest a looooong time ago, made you pay 10 pp more than it was worth (blush), still you turned out to be a good friend. It made me happy when I heard that you and Erlis got together and from my little time with Erlis, I know she's a great friend. HUGS HUGS HUGS<br>
<br>
Gaiygre<br>
Bunny man ... You were one of Saga's funniest characters and highly skilled at the same time. Many are the times I had the honor of fighting at your side and I always had lots of fun doing that.<br>
<br>
Garduk<br>
My scaly friend who, like Gaiygre, always brought joy and fun to Ancient Saga. I was happy to fight by your side.<br>
<br>
Geoffers<br>
I met you in my level 20ies, or lower ..., where we fought together in North Ro a little bit. Fun little group. And it was fun to meet you after you became a decent wannabe tank in my Plane of Valor group :-)<br>
<br>
Goladiel<br>
There are two types of enchanters. Enchanters and Goladiel. You always made me laugh, especially when you told me that since you liked girls in RL, you had to be lesbian ... Go Lesbi! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Gwaro, Hetfield, Kemito<br>
Meeting you in Knights of Arcane Lore, we had tons of fun together. Especially when we raided Dalnir and got to the boss ... who ate us all alive! I remember the screenshots of us all standing together on the table. Those were the days <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Garduk<br>
You and I never got &quot;real close&quot; as friends but I always liked and respected you and was very happy to see that you were app'ing for the Legions of Valhalla. I know they will get a very good player in you. And you will always remain a friend of me.<br>
<br>
Hobby<br>
The 3rd best mage in all of Norrath (we all know Sasarella is numero uno). You were great fun and we had so much fun together. By the way, you still owe me like 50,000 pp for all the free spells I gave ye <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Iluvia<br>
You were not like my other friends. While being guilded with you in MLF, we didn't talk that much. Wasn't until one day when I met you again that we began talking. And we kept chatting quite a lot afterwards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Iskra, Pascal<br>
One mage that I miss for sure! I remember fighting with you in the Oasis and Eastern Karanas, how you and Pascal became a couple and all the wonderful mobs we killed together. <br>
<br>
Jaidin<br>
You are one hell of a cleric MA/Tank and if I had been in a US zone I wouldn't have thought twice about following you into another guild.<br>
<br>
Jazst<br>
You were one of the first persons to make me used to summoning stuff at the beginning of a raid. You just came to me and I began summoning focus items and your heatstone since the coldstone messed up your display <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Karalin<br>
My suicidal friend ... First time we grouped, you were in a group with 3 mages. Being kind enough, you sang your invis song so we could med without adds. Finally full mana and we pull a mob. Only ... none of us have a pet up as your invis song has killed them ... /panic. Still I enjoyed your company and the chats we had, going to miss you very much :/<br>
<br>
Karelyn<br>
I don't know where to start or end when it comes to you. While I never expected you to be a friend when I invited you to my own guild, I couldn't have been more wrong. For three years did we partner and basically duo'ed our way to level 65. Thanks to you I often stayed in the game instead of quitting and I owe everything to you. You are the best friend I ever had in this game and you will be missed more than anyone else in here. I wish you all the best and hope to stay in touch with you. The loss of your friendship is what has scared me the most during these three years and I hope my fear won't come true now and that we can still stay in touch. No matter what happens, I want you to know that you have given me a friendship I never thought possible and that these three years has been the best three years of my life. The best of luck to you and may the Gods of Norrath bless you and keep you safe.<br>
<br>
Kayugh<br>
No matter how hard I try, I cannot seem to find some good words for you. So I will make this short: Bye <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      But to be honest, I did consider you my friend. You were fun and we had lots of fun when we were guilded together in Knights of Arcane Lore. I will miss that.<br>
<br>
Keerily<br>
My first EQ Wife ... well, sort of. I was working hard on reaching level 20 so we could get married and get our lastnames, and was kinda dumped right before that. I guess you saw the light and didn't want to spend your life in EQ with a grumpy mage :P i will still miss you though.<br>
<br>
Keldora<br>
Lady Keldora, a really close friend of mine. After you left the Guardians of Truth, we both signed up to join the Mystical Lightfighters and have stayed close friends ever since.<br>
<br>
Kurul<br>
Always the quite Necromancer, you still proved to be both powerful and skilled. Often did you surprise me with your skills and I was very proud to be among the forces that you lead to Victory against the Mighty Klandicar.<br>
<br>
Leyla, Sadia<br>
You both have proved to be good friends and I will miss you both.<br>
<br>
Louhi<br>
Louhi? Allow me to say things as they are. But you are nuts ... in a wonderful way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      You never could stand still for more than 1 second and by Innoruuk they should have given you ports. It was so sad to see you tripping over your own feet because you didn't know which mobs you should go track :-)<br>
<br>
Miriel<br>
From the first time I saw you, at the Trakannon Raid I think, I noticed something special about you. It didn't take long before we were chatting  away during raids (well, I was doing the chatting since you were singing hehe). I am sad to leave you all alone in here but have a feelings we'll stay in touch <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Mistikal<br>
One day I met a newbie Dark Elf Magician who happened to become one of my friends. I liked this Dark Elf and soon began spending a lot of my time helping you getting gear and giving you tips for the game. Much later I discovered that you weren't a noob at all but had another character, and was doing what Dark Elves do best - used me for their own purposes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Yet you were one of my most trusted friends. Even after discovering the truth :-)<br>
<br>
Mithran<br>
We never grouped much and yet you are one of my best friends here. Leaving you behind makes me very sad and I hope that you will eventually get level 60 with all your characters. As for the money I owe you, I will either contact you ingame or have someone hand them over when you are online <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Nandara<br>
You and I had a very special friendship that I will miss a lot. You were always there for me when I felt bad and needed to talk and I knew I could trust you. I will always miss seeing your name online.<br>
<br>
Osheen<br>
A great tank and a great loss when you left Ancient Saga. It was not only a loss for the guild but we all lost a good friend too.<br>
<br>
Phuntic<br>
An annoying little Gnome who kept following me around until I could finally shake him off. For some odd reason I happened to like this little Gnome and called him a friend <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
Shadora<br>
Being the best Raid Leader on this server, it was a great honor and a priviledge to have served you in Ancient Saga.<br>
<br>
Starqui<br>
Despite a few indifferences, you were always a very good friend of mine and I was very happy to have met you.<br>
<br>
Superhexer<br>
I will miss your company as well, Super. Often did you ask about focus items and even more often did I bonk you for not having room for a bag. But we always found a way. May the Dragons guide you to safety in the future.<br>
<br>
Tasslehoffy<br>
Merhaba Tass! I hope you will be doing well and with you all the best.<br>
<br>
Xipat<br>
Xippy, I am so sad to say goodbye to you. Fighting together in raids, groups and keeping eachother updated in tells when one of us grouped was always a lot of fun. We had many great adventures together and I will miss that a lot.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if I have missed anyone, but that do not mean that I don't have any feelings for you. There are just so many people to mention here.<br>
<br>
The best of luck to you all and thank you for giving me the best three years of my life.<br>

I still remember that raid to Dalnir with KoAL - one of the greatest times I ever had in the game, bar none.  =)  My experience with that whole crew in that guild are one of my treasures from EQ.  <br>

Best of luck in RL, have a great time, and do well!<br>

I can't believe this. I expected you to be still hammering away at the login box long after they switched off the last server. Truly shocked but then there's a lot of it about.<br>
<br>
There are always people leaving the game but they seem to be leaving in herds these days.<br>
<br>
The funniest time I had with your good self was back in our 30s with all the usual suspects above (/wave guys) and seirea the 34 druid was the MA. Did quite well too until a pet went walkabout and brought back a skele train that would have made even Kurn's Tower blush. <br>
<br>
I think we have all known each other for well over 3 years which is quite amazing when you think about it especially as most of us had already been playing for quite a while before we came together when MT opened. Ahh those were the days.<br>
<br>
I feel sure we will see you in other games sooner or later my friend but if I don't I wish you all the very best with whatever you do.<br>

I never thought I would see the day you would hang it up! You were one of the coolest people ive met always offering to help out others. You always had time to talk, you really keep reminding me how much this is as much a social game as anything else.<br>

You are a good guy, abit grumpy at times but a great guy none the less. I hope you will join in on the adventures in WoW once its released. I seriously hope everyone that retires from the game tells me what server they will be on so one can have fun with familiar &quot;faces&quot; once again.<br>
