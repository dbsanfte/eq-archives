<br>
The stereotypes aside, the French are nice enough individuals.<br>
<br>
I feel bad for the French people who are being stereotyped by the voices of the &quot;Outspoken Parisians&quot;, or the French who believe what has been said about the &quot;American Cowboys&quot; heading for Iraq.  Neither is the typical person you find in those countries.<br>
<br>
Defacing war memorials (IE Graves) of WWI/WWII Veterans located in France shows a lack of class that goes far beyond what the usual tactless American pulls.  My family as a whole did nothing to the French to deserve that.  But you certainly deserve the backlash your going to reap from it.<br>
<br>
As an American I will patriotically support my troops overseas that are fighting to &quot;liberate&quot; a country where in 1988 the government used nerve gas to quell its own people, in 1991/1992 killed 100000+ people to quell an insurrection, drained a swamp the size of the everglades to hunt rebels, and countless other atrocities.<br>
<br>
I regret to see that the French people support a tyrant such as Saddam Hussain.<br>
<br>
Of course, the French paint us as the &quot;Illiterate Unwashed Heathens&quot; to excuse the acts of the &quot;Civilized Country&quot;...<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, things America has done first or second that the French only wish they could have done first or second...<br>
<br>
Aids Test, Airplanes, Computers, Cotten Gin, Electricity, Human Genome Project, Light Bulbs, Mass Production, Nuclear Power, Put Man in Orbit, Put Man on the Moon, Silicon Chips, Television, Telephone<br>
<br>
Our only real competition in science (and they usually won the race) was the USSR.<br>
<br>
Admittedly a lot of these things were developed or pioneered by immigrants.  On the other hand, France has had the same opportunity to attract immigrants.<br>
<br>
Either way, this country of &quot;Uneducated Heathens&quot; has pushed science a long ways in 200 years or so of existence.<br>

Chirac Apologizes to Queen Over Cemetery Attack <br>
Thu April 3, 2003 09:04 AM ET <br>
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Jacques Chirac on Thursday sent a letter of apology to Britain's Queen Elizabeth over the defacing last week of British World War One military graves in northern France with anti-British slogans.<br>
&quot;These unacceptable and disgraceful acts are unanimously condemned by the French people. In the name of France and in my own name, please accept my deepest regrets,&quot; Chirac wrote.<br>
<br>
In words aimed at soothing the rift over France's opposition to the war the United States and Britain are fighting in Iraq, Chirac said: &quot;Know that at a time when your soldiers are engaged in combat, the thoughts of the French are naturally with them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Vandals last week sprayed anti-British slogans across the base of a stone cross at the entrance of the cemetery in Etaples, near Calais.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dig up your rubbish, it is contaminating our soil,&quot; one read. Written in large red letters beneath a swastika, another said: &quot;Saddam will win and he will make you bleed.&quot;<br>
<br>
As a party of war veteran officials headed up to the Etaples cemetery to lay a wreath there, Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin wrote to his British counterpart Jack Straw to express his &quot;emotion and indignation at this unspeakable act.&quot;<br>
<br>
The graffiti was cleaned off by the French branch of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which manages the site, but not before it was seen by British tourists on two coaches.<br>
<br>
Of the roughly 11,000 graves at Etaples, most are British but other nationalities include Canadians and Australians. There are no U.S. graves at the site.<br>
<br>
France's relations with the United States and Britain have been soured by French opposition to the war in Iraq but officials in Paris stressed this week this was no excuse for venting hatred.<br>
<br>
&quot;France knows what it owes to the formidable devotion and courage of the British soldiers that came to help it free itself in the fight against barbarity,&quot; Chirac wrote to the queen.<br>
<br>
The war dead have been sucked into the bickering between pro- and anti-war camps.<br>
<br>
Some U.S. newspaper columnists have asked whether the French have forgotten who liberated them from the Nazi invasion during World War II. A U.S. member of Congress is even drafting a bill that would encourage American families to exhume and bring home the remains of World War One soldiers buried in France.<br>

Chirac fury over cemetery vandals<br>

PARIS, France (AP) -- President Jacques Chirac expressed outrage Thursday at the desecration of a British war cemetery in northern France by opponents of the war in Iraq. <br>
<br>
In a letter to Queen Elizabeth II, Chirac described the scrawling of anti-war graffiti on monuments at the World War I cemetery as &quot;inadmissible and shameful.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;From the French people and from me personally, I offer you my deepest regrets,&quot; Chirac wrote. <br>
<br>
British tourists discovered the graffiti shortly after vandals struck last week, using red spray paint to make offensive statements about Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bush. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dig up your rubbish, it's contaminating our soil,&quot; read one insult at the base of a cenotaph. <br>
<br>
France has been an outspoken opponent of the war in Iraq, while Britain has joined the United States in military action. <br>
<br>
The graffiti has been removed and an investigation is under way to find the culprits. <br>
<br>
In London, Blair's official spokesman welcomed &quot;both the content and sentiment of President Chirac's letter.&quot; <br>
<br>
About 11,000 British and other soldiers are buried in the cemetery, which is in Etaples, about 150 miles north of Paris. <br>
<br>
France's minister of veteran affairs, Hamlaoui Mekachera, traveled to Etaples on Thursday for a wreath-laying ceremony, accompanied by officials of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which looks after the graves. <br>
<br>
&quot;Despite circumstances that might disturb in other areas, we are tied to our allies and we have marked that in a solemn way,&quot; <br>
<br>
Mekachera said after the ceremony, which opened with the tolling of the death knell. <br>

You're wrong.  Lot's of folks here in the US are against the war despite the US 'standpoint.'  It's their right as Americans to have their own opinion.<br>
<br>
I personally fully support the President and the US Military and have found a new passtime: making note of the schmuck celebrites in this country who are so outspoken in their antiwar antics.  As if those of us who buy tickets to their movies and their cds won't remember and make a point of not spending our money on them. <br>
<br>
Anyone who's willing to go to a Vomit-In like they had in San Francisco and stick their finger down their throat to puke in public to 'show how the war makes them feel' is an embarassment to our country.  No matter what their position is.<br>
<br>
MY opinion is that anyone who is antiwar is an @ssmonkey fooktard, but again, it's my right, as an American, to think that.  <br>
<br>
Saddam is a bad man, too put it lightly.  Most of those who recognize this and support the war cannot understand the NATO Security Council's turning a blind eye to the fact that this dictator has laughed in their faces for 12 years.  And, let's be blunt, the French make an easy target. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So if I want to laugh at the them and point fingers of disgust at them while they're pissing on and defacing the graves of dead people, you can't stop me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raahvin>Raahvin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/5/03 2:55:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=548.topic&index=51>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: France.</span><hr size=1> But Eli, we are talking about the French here, not liberals.
