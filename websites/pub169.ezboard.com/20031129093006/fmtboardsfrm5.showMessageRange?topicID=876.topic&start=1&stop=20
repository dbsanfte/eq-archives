&quot;Qurie told Arafat he will not form the cabinet and doesn't want to be prime minister anymore,&quot; a Palestinian official said after the indefinite postponement of a session of parliament that was to ratify an emergency government sworn in on Tuesday. <br>
<br>
Arafat's response to Qurie's statement was not immediately clear. <br>
<br>
<br>
Palestinian officials said Arafat wanted to dismiss Nasser Youssef, who as interior minister would have security powers crucial to a U.S.-backed peace &quot;road map,&quot; and that Qurie opposed the move. <br>

He appoints moderates to the position of Prime Minister in order to look like he does, but he then retains control of the security organizations.  These organizations are the ones responsible for policing the west bank and gaza.  Under Arafat's leadership, these organizations do nothing to crack down on terrorists like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.  So as much as the new Palestinian PM wants to make peace, and I honestly believe that Abu Mazen (the previous PM) did want peace, it's impossible for them to do so while the Arafat controlled police do nothing about the terrorists.  All the peace plans go to hell after one bombing.<br>
<br>
That said, the situation on the Israeli side is not too different.  Sharon is as uninterested in peace as Arafat.  He just goes about sabotaging the peace process in different ways.  Any promising truce or moment of quiet is eventually wrecked by a terrorist attack led by organizations that have Arafat's tacit approval or by raids permitted by Sharon.  The other side then retaliates and we're right back where we started.  <br>
<br>
So we have the current situation.  Two sides led by men uninterested in peace and influenced by extremist minorities and the majorities of both populations suffer.  I honestly think Arafat needs to be gone before peace can be made, but I also think Israel needs a new leader as well.  Get rid of Arafat and Sharon and reform both governments and you'll see just how fast this supposedly &quot;impossible&quot; peace comes about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/9/03 9:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=876.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Arafat flame bait...</span><hr size=1> Not sure if it's flame bait though.

In my view, Sharon is just as bad as Arafat.  Arafat allows the conflict to go on by not doing anything to the terrorists.  In fact, there's some proof that Arafat actually supports the terrorists financially.  Sharon allows the conflict to go on by guiding Israeli policy in such a way so as to provoke the Palestinians.  He does it with raids into the territories and through policies like the new security fence or or authorizing the expansion of current settlements.  Both men stand to lose their positions of power if the conflict were to end.  I don't believe either wants flat out war but both work towards keeping the conflict as is without trying to come up with a long term peaceful solution.<br>
<br>
Can Sharon remove the settlements while still keeping power?  Not sure.  His current coalition would certainly not hold but he could for a new one with less extreme elements.  Removing settlements has been done in the past in the Sinai so it is possible to accomplish.  I just don't think he's interested, regardless of how easy or hard it is to achieve.<br>
<br>
Take a look at some of his actions, from the &quot;visit&quot; to the the Dome of the Rock three years ago which had a large part in starting the current crisis to the Israeli army raids during the ceasefire a few months ago.  I think he knows exactly where his power comes from and he doesn't want to lose it by working towards peace.  <br>
<br>
Keep in mind, I have the same opinion of Arafat so I'm not condemning the Israelis and or blaming them for the whole situation.  Arafat and Sharon aren't very different as far as I am concerned.  They're both soldiers and military leaders who commited some acts that could kindly be called war crimes in the past.  Both know that they came to power because of the military conflict and both know they will lose that power if the military conflict ends.  Neither wants all out war OR peace because both choices will bring an end to the conflict.  They both like the situation as is, low level warfare bad enough to keep their population scared and themselves in power.<br>

As much as any Palestinian PM tries to work towards peace, he is hampered by the fact that the Palestinian security forces do NOT enforce laws or crack down on terrorist organizations.  That means any peace initiative is automatically doomed to failed since Hamas and Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martyr's have the freedom to torpedo it at will with terrorist attacks.  Maybe if the Israelis were willing to see beyond this and work with the Palestinian PM they could achieve something, but now we're right back to the Sharon issue.<br>
<br>
Sharon sees a terrorist attack and blames the Palestinian PM.  The PM is powerless to stop the attacks since he has no control over security so Sharon claims they are not really working towards peace and raids the territories.  If the terrorists do not strike, Sharon provokes them a bit with raids into the territories.  If Sharon does not provoke them, the terrorists provoke Sharon with a few suicide bombings.  Sharon reacts, Hamas and the rest strike back and we're right back where we started.  Vicious little cycle.<br>
<br>
I honestly think both Sharon and Arafat know EXACTLY what they're doing and that both of them are responsible more than anyone else for the deaths in the last three years. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=srie>Srie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/9/03 10:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=876.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Arafat flame bait...</span><hr size=1> I guess my opinion of Sharon isn't as bad as yours.

I don't see that as provocation, since if there was no Intifadah none of these things would occur. The IDF doesn't target people at bus stops or in discoes. They don't go shooting up Birthday parties. The terrorists in Hamas have done so.<br>

They have gone after Hamas people in cars, or at thier offices. I think they have not goes far enough. I think if you have a Hamas flag, martyr outfit, or are at a Hamas rally, you should be considered a combatant. They have said they are not political, they are a militia, so treat them like an enemy army.<br>

mm... yes and no.  Do I have an issue with killing off Hamas militant or Islamic Jihad leaders?  Not at all.  As you said, they want war, they have to be willing to pay the price.  However, while in theory this is fine, in practice it doesn't work so well.  The Israeli army may try to minimize casualties but civilians can and do get killed.  These deaths then create more martyrs willing to die for the cause.  The woman who blew herself up last Sunday had lost a brother for example.  I'm not sure if he was a militant or just a bystander but did his death accomplish anything?  In return for her death, the Israeli army will now bulldoze her house and make her family homeless.  Does this benefit Israel in some way or just create more martyrs?  Why do you think Israeli soldiers refuse to serve in the territories now and refuse to fly combat missions to kill Hamas leaders?  It's certainly not because they believe their side is morally right.<br>
<br>
Lets take a look at another example.  During the recent truce, hostilities seemed rather low.  Then the Israeli army raided the home of a Hamas leader and killed him.  They said it was because he was planning attacks but the end result was an end to the truce and a shattering of the peace process.  Now Israeli leadership is not stupid.  They knew EXACTLY what the results of this raid will be, so why do it?  Is it worth killing one Hamas leader if the end result is no peace?<br>
<br>
Again, I don't mean to condemn the Israelis or pretend like everything is Israel's fault.  As an Israeli myself, I don't feel the Palestinians are free to blame here.  Both sides have a responsibility.  During other lulls, it was the Palestinians who struck first, destroying the chance for peace.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, both sides claim they are just &quot;striking back&quot; knowing this will spur the conflict on.<br>

<br>
This is the hardest issue of all for me to address.  Do the Palestinians have a right to a country?  Do they have the right to strike at civilians targets as part of a war?  Who was originally responsible for the mess that is the West Bank and Gaza?  Did the Israelis have a right to conquer these areas and hold them?  Do the Palestinians have a right to better living conditions than the Israelis give them?  Does the treatment of Palestinians by Israel justify a war for independence?<br>
<br>
I don't know how to answer all this.  We can go back all the way to the early 1900's trying to find if the Israelis or the Palestinians are at fault here and I still don't think we would find a conclusive answer.  You say that there would be no need for raid if it wasn't for the Intifada but there would be no need for the Intifada if the Israelis didn't occupy the territories and mistreat the Palestinians for the last 30 years.  Then again, there would be no need for the occupation if the Palestinians didn't try to fight against Israel in 1948.  Then again, there would be no need to fight in 1948 if the Palestinians did not feel threatened by earlier Jewish actions.  Then again... <br>

Do you see where I'm going with this?  By the way, do you have kids?  If so, have you ever seen them fighting?  Ever try to find out who started the fight?  This conflict is like two kids each yelling &quot;he hit me back first&quot;.  As an Israeli, I would love to tell you that my people are completely innocent and we're the good guys here but I can't.  All I can tell you is that I wish it would end already, and right now I don't think the Palestinian OR Israeli leadership is looking to accomplish that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/9/03 11:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=876.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Arafat flame bait...</span><hr size=1> I don't feel the Palestinians are free to blame here.<br>

<br>
The Israeli's took over Palestineans land s when the leadership of the occupied lands make it clear they would do NOTHING to govern themselves, and let terrorists run the nation. I think it is the height of irresponsibility to gamble your natio with an aggresive invasion in 1947, and then decide well we lost, so everyone flee and abdicate the responsibility to govern your area, while at the same time maintain you have the right to rule your area. <br>
<br>
Indeed it is a complex issue. Don't get me wrong, I don't think the Israelis are free from blame either, however, I have no patience for people who would not stone, pitchfork, and run terrorists out of thier neighborhood when they pose a clear danger in of themselves. <br>

Because they have already made claims that they want more, as in unrealistically more, if not all.  They are, still, highly popular with the general Palastinian population, as well as the police force (all thanks to Arafat).

Not really.  The entire area was under British Rule until 1948.  The UN resolution that was supposed to create Israel was also supposed to create a nation for the arab natives but this never happened.  Hard to explain why it didn't but it was mostly the chaos of war.  Should I blame the Arab residents for taking up arms against Israel?  Hard to say.  The Arab nations declared war.  In such a situation, I can definitely see the Arab natives siding with the Arab side and hoping for the best.  They're stuck in a bad situation and they're hoping to go with the winning side that would seem to support them.  Does this absolve them of guilt?  Absolutely not, which is part of the reason I don't support the right of return, but it's at least understandable.  To be honest, the whole thing would be a lot better if the British had the foresight to try and create a lasting solution rather than just dumping and running but it's hard to blame the Brits.  They just got done with WW2 and were trying to rebuild their own country.  I doubt they had the resources to create a lasting solution.<br>
<br>
Anyway, another misconception you have is this separation of Palestinians from Arabs.  It's not a real separation, these are not different people to be honest.  It's sort of like saying Texans aren't Americans (Yah, I know, perfect setup for Texas jokes, but you know what I mean).  The term Israeli Palestinian is sort of impossible.  A muslim who had stayed in Israel would be an Israeli Arab.  One who had not, would be a Palestinian.<br>

This is a very common misconception.  Before the 1967 war, the territories were NOT a Palestinian state.  The West Bank belonged to Jordan and the Gaza Strip belonged to Egypt.  The refugee camps were already there and included arabs (now known as Palestinians) who had been removed or ran from their homes in Israel.  Israel conquered the territories from Egypt and Jordan and annexed them.  Jordan and Egypt have both officially relinquished claims to the territories and are not asking for their return.  Both countries have already signed peace treaties with Israel and Egypt did get the Sinai back.  So as a point of fact, the territories never had their own government.<br>
<br>
In regards to your second point.  The Arab nations did indeed declare war in 1948.  This state of war has lasted until today in case of some Arab nations such as Syria.  However, as I stated above, both Egypt and Jordan signed peace treaties.  As part of this peace treaty, Egypt received the Sinai back.  both countries relinquished their rights to the occupied territories because they didn't want to handle the issue.  As a matter of fact, many of the Arab nations like to harass Israel about its treatment of Palestinians but their treatment of the refugees is no better.  There have been several armed conflicts in Jordan and Syria between the goverment and the Palestinians resulting in the deaths of thousands.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough of the history lesson.  Bottom line, since 1948 (and technically before that dating all the way back to the conquest of the holy land by the Ottomans) the local Muslims / Jews have not had their own nation.  You can't say they forfieted their rights to one because they never had one.  Israel has had the distinction of being a conquered land since the times of the Romans and the Greeks so it's very difficult to decide who owns what and who has the right to what.  Palestinians, or Arabs that were displaced by the creation of Israel are indeed at least partially responsible for their current situation since they took up arms against Israel in 1948.  Were they justified?  Not sure.  Would I have done the same if I was in their place?  Probably.  Does any of this matter today?  Not really.  It's just more excuses for more violence.  Peace is not going to come while either side is still playing blame games.<br>

The Security wall is a stupid idea intended to calm Israelis.  A secure border is one thing, the security wall however meanders all through the west bank in what is essentially a land grab maneuver.  It's stupid and it's going to provoke more attacks than it stops.
