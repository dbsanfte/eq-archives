for the cleric epic.. I don't even have a cleric..  I guess I just like you guys so much I wanted to know what was up.<br>
<br>
Well as I said.. I read in to all the hundreds of post that have popped in so far and still have not gotten to the end yet *sigh*.  I think too many people are harping on the wrong subject and need to look at what the real issue is here weather you really want to admit it or not...<br>
<br>
First and for most this chatter about what the GMs/guides can and can not do... Well the GMs/guides can boot you out of the game for a bit or forever so that right there makes the point for me that we all might as well live with what a GM/guide says and deal.  Its called life we don't always get it our way. &lt;this is not the issue&gt;<br>
<br>
I hear all kinds of people both cleric and non-cleric alike saying &quot;get over it&quot; &quot;Its your fault for being lazy&quot;.  Well, that's just rude and not needed.  I'm sure each and every one of the clerics waiting in line for this have a reason they waited till now.  Be it good or bad.. it is still a reason and is not for anyone elts to judge. &lt;again, not the issue&gt;<br>
<br>
Here, i feel, is the true issue that should be looked at and talked about...  Putting aside for a moment the whole GM/guide made list. Did anyone ever stop to think about just being nice in game?  If someone has been waiting by a camp for X amount of hours and you show up after them then its just common courtesy to say &quot;hey you were here first.. that's cool i'll wait my turn&quot;.  Now the whole logging out for a nap thing.. well that's a little iffy but again if there was someone there that said &quot;hey he/she was here, he/she just need to rest for a few&quot; then be a good person and respect that.  Your doing the same quest so you of all people should be able to understand and respect that person needing a little cat nap.  Granted I was not there so I do not know wht was said... but this should have been able to be handled between you and not eve had to have a GM/guide come in to fix a fit over a mob. (last time i saw an issue like this i was lvl 9 and it was over who had rights the orc camp in EC.)<br>
&lt;start of rant&gt;<br>
As for the person who did the &quot;hit and run&quot; on the camp. Well if I am understanding it right then they just showed up and took it with out right of time or anything...  If that is the case then he/she is the kind of person that does not bring heart to the game but instead fudge it up for others who try to enjoy the game.  Again if this is indeed how it happened then to that person all I can say is F*CK OFF, sell your EQ account because you have shown that your nothing more then a stupid, low brow simple minded wonder sh*t that is such and @#%$ that just being around others would lower there CHA!!!! GRR I'm so sick and tired of people like you ruining the game for others in the name of accomplishing your own goals.  This is a game.. something that others, like my self, play to &quot;get a way from it all&quot; for a bit.. something for us to enjoy and you pea brained, mentally deficiant dunderhead come in a ass over a good thing turing it in to a A+ class 1 cluster f*ck!  God, have you always been this much of a cretin, and if so how may times have people trained your sorry worthless ass because you pissed them off so much?  <br>
<br>
Ok now that i got that out i feel a little better, moving on...<br>
&lt;end of rant&gt;<br>
I am sorry that clerics are having such a hard time with there epic quest just because of the way the quest is set up.  Having some hair brained ding-dong toss a monkey wrench in the works sure doesn't help ether.  /cry<br>
<br>
To all the rest of you wonderful healers good luck to you on your epic questing.  <br>

P.S.<br>
<br>
PLZ PLZ PLZ to the person that has the logs of the cleric that did the hit and run send me a tell in game and let me know the name of that cleric.   I will not tell spam them, I will not slander them anymore then what I have said here.  I just want to be sure I never aid them in anyway.  He/she will never get a port or any aid from me and will be red tagged in my guild. <br>

<br>
Hey, that's me!<br>
I got lucky and the zone went down for a minute, about three hours before my anticipated spawn.  When I logged back in the merchant was there and no one else was, so I got my pearl.  I like to think that some GM took pity on me and &quot;accidentally&quot; tripped the cord on the computer that holds SolB. =)  On top of that, my guildmates immediately rushed me out to skyfire to kill Ragefire.  So I now weild my clicky stick. *Hugs Discordians and guests*  Just a little happy story for you all.<br>
Oh, and another nice thing.  After one &quot;stolen&quot; spawn I logged off to sleep and came back to see Drackore sitting there.  Long story short, he GAVE UP HIS SPAWN for me when he heard my sob story, and basically well out of his way to help a total stranger. *Hugs to Drackore again*<br>

<br>I am <B>a Light Cycle</B>.
<br>
I drive fast, I turn fast, 
<br>
I do everything fast. 
<br>
I even breakfast. 
<br>
I tend to confuse people with my 
<br>
sudden changes of heart.  
<br>
Sometimes I even confuse myself, 
<br>
which tends to cause problems.
