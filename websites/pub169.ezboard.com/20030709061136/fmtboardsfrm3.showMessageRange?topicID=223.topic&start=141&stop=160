ummmm.....no. You were screwed in the head before Vox incident, a complete and total nutjob. You were one of the few people that made it to ignore cause I couldnt put up with the constant idiotic rambling anymore. As much as you might claim to be, I dont think there was ever a time that you were a &quot;model&quot; anything except for maybe a mayo clinic research subject.<br>

I thought I would try to get a hold of a few people to see what is going on with everyone and try to track down old friends also. Then I came across this post... and I thought I would add a couple more cents to it.<br>
<br>
Well, since I was from TR- and I was the actually officer that sent the guild invite to Pardus to join TR. I actually talked to Pardus quite a bit in game before the whole Vox incident- which I'm not going to put on a forum or really talk to anyone else about- but was just general chit-chat during a camp. What's funny was I was in Mistmoor with Jos (long before Pardus was in TR) before and in Mistmoor with Pardus before camping the Pally mob. Just from my experience- they are two different people.<br>
<br>
Anyhow- Pardus, it's good to hear you are getting laid and not ratting the loot, just have to stop using other people's accounts to rat loot now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   . Jos- would you like to buy a vowel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You'z given wes Rangers a baaddd name wit dem Ranger Ubonics. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
P.S.- Forgot to add a couple of things. Fimble the IP match might because of the switches it might be coming out of and what network they are using. Even if they have 2 or 3 different dial-up providers in their area- they might still be only using the same network hardware (ATM switches, muxes, routers, etc.,). Anyhow- that is if they were both on at the same time you know. Seperate time- it's hard to say who is on at that exact moment you know.<br>
<br>
Anyhow- that was my two cents...<br>

I hope they add a 15 minute &quot;your unable to loot this corpse at this time&quot; extention or something to stop the  log on log off ninja looters. Increase the your not in group or raid-group you cannot loot timer on the &quot;named&quot; type mobs. 15 to 20 minutes would be nice. I do see the prob with someone actually going ld and coming back joining raid again to loot what they won on roll and possibly not being allowed to loot thing. Maybe if they are in the raid-group (taking about the new thing on test server) rather they were in it for the kill or not might allow them too (legitimate linkdead members).<br>
<br>
The other suggestions incl. a local or area say from /anamedmobscorpse says i had topmace backscalp robinscale looted from me just now by the ld member of your raid who did a /q after taking those items...  <br>
<br>
Like respect for others exp mobs and item camps (what there are no camps? what kind of newb are You?) (( you tell me that when your epic mob with item &quot;camp&quot; is open and jobber and flobber and trobber move and in and kill it infront of you that there are no camps)), eq - Sony  didn't expect mean players who take advantage of others to the point of being crooks and setting up sham shops scam classes and entire guilds of scammers (was a person who &quot;Said&quot; they sold eq account keys etc. for the purpose of scamming others for different accounts advantage of getting the items) and on top of that was under the age of 17 (go figure), so its up to us you the non-crooked players to remember and continue posting this info so the rest of us will not be a ripped off by habitual ninja looters and professional scammers whos soul purpose is the next HIEST to gain pleasure from. They don't  care if they lose and account or get suspended. The items / pp / borrowed under false pretenses items are already handed off to someone else or a 2nd account, 3rd 4th whatever, prob also stolen cd game keys for purpose of playing 30 days free and ripping off others.<br>
<br>
I'll be glad to return to raiding and grouping on such things soon as they can no longer do things like this. The game people can program in locks and prevents to unauthorized looting of items. Unless all the ninja events  that happen like this are reported, Sony will only work on adding 1 item to ssra loot table and some other zone I cannot go to (things that don't matter to me) instead of fixing a series of things like this that destroy others enjoyment and even the entire game. Make it a pain in the butt for Sony to have to Constantly seek out ninja-looter-whore-0911101.<br>
      Many quit from being scammed or like nl on raid items. I had fun on raids I was with (not many raids), knowing the time it takes to set one up, get there get in, knowing 14 here can roll for that and I am one or I am not one (class race lvl - current completions of epic) was always fun. If I saw a warrior in our guild won roll then a lvl 4 char suddenly setting next to the dragon and looting it I would practically die...<br>
<br>
Its just its up to common decency and player to player respect for any future in everquest and for everquest.<br>
<br>
I'm posting again on a NL thread because several friends and nice people recently and long ago quit due to things like this. I miss them and chances we might have had grouping and leveling and learning zones together.<br>
I also know again at least 80 percent of the accounts on MT are very nice people who wouldn't do any thing like this and hate it much as I do.<br>

Apparently this <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Murder She Wrote if folks are still debating about this! So let me lay it out straight...<br>
<br>
1. Jos knows Daarkside in RL. Old logs I have of guild chat seem to verify this.<br>
2. Jos says she's a female in RL. A couple of phone calls have verified this.<br>
3. Jos says she's 17. The phone calls <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> definately</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> verified this! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
4. Meeh is one of Daarkside's alts. He posted this fact a little while ago, so... <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> *check*</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
5. Jos says Daark occaisionally used Meeh to give her stuff. So do you ever transfer gear to/from a RL friend? This don't seem like a tough stretch.<br>
6. Out of about 100 IPs for both Jos and Daark, I found one that matched. I'm not sure what to think of this - that's a lotta IPs to only find one match in.<br>
7. I've known Jos from in-game from a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> long</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> time ago. She's very sweet, innocent, kind and completely incapable of NLing spiderling legs.<br>
8. Jos and Daark both claim that he had access to her account.<br>
9. It's obvious that Daark pulled off this NL. He's not exactly decrying his innocence here.<br>
<br>
So what's so tough to understand? Daark used a RL friend to NL a bit of gear!<br>

 On Joselyn, her in game speech is more literate and respectable than her mesage board banter in my experiences, she did throw in the occasional D3wd speak but most people I know in game do.  <br>
<br>
  I find it comical that people who don't know her insult Joselyn, insult her character, and her intelligence simply because of Ninja looting allegations.  It's understandable at first.  I believe the Joselyn toon Ninja looted naggy; I believe that information to be credible.  However in light of Fimble's investigations it should be pretty obvious that daarkside did the act using her account.  I won't claim that I know this for a fact, but I wouldn't claim to know anything for a fact when dealing with online personas.  I will attest again that the two players are separate Human beings.  I'm not very active in the comunity, so my Credibility is dubious at best I'm sure, but either way the little things add up to one conclusion in my mind.  <br>
<br>
  Daarkside has lied in the past, he has done this sort of thing in the past.  Both people, admit to him having access to the account.  So I believe he did it, period.   I will continue to believe that until more concrete evidence is presented to the contrary.  <br>
<br>
  My advice to Joselyn is to change the account password, log in explain the situation to a gm.  Take the likely suspension, and move on.  It's not in daarksides character to do such a thing.  This would be further proof that the original Joselyn is innocent.  And such a sacrifice will need to be made to do this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucadinthemage2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cadin the Mage2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/15/02 2:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=157>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: NINJA LOOTER  JOSEYLN TREEHUGGER on spet15th naggy raid</span><hr size=1> Korendor, bor alone did not decide to make me GL.

I run two comps myself. I know the first conversation would be a physical impossibility for me to pull off. The second would be so tough, I wouldn't do it unless there was a real reason to.
