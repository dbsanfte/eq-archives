<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Let me learn you something : in 1995, Paris was bombed several time by Algerian islamist peeps. Did we declare war to Algeria??<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
None of those bombs killed thousands and notice you said several times.  Maybe you should have rooted out the problem from the start but wait... <br>
<br>
Maybe 100 years of tyranny in algeria had something to do with that, humanitarian crimes by your generals against Algerians (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1675992.stm" target="top">general on trial for algerian humanitarian crimes)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, and the fact you had a treaty to not have further military intervention in Algeria.  <br>
<br>
However, we havent commited tyrannical actions in the middle east and colonized countries for 100 years much less any time period, we havent commited torture and other sadistic crimes on middle easterners, and we never signed a treaty (we had a cease fire) not allowing further military action. <br>

More than any other country in the world, France has engaged in trade with Saddam Hussein's regime. Their close relationship goes back to the 1980s and have simply improved after the Gulf War and the election of Chirac to president of France. Today, France accounts for about 25% of all goods exported to Iraq and to almost 100% of all weapons sold to Iraq. In return, Iraq has signed contracts for billions of dollars with France. France is the main importer of Iraqi oil. <br>
France has been in violation of United Nations sanctions since 1991. During the 1990s, France repeatedly helped Saddam Hussein hide the weapons of mass destruction before United Nations inspector could find them. France was also the country that helped terminate the United Nations inspections in 1998. While the current crisis is going on, France is still selling weapons to Iraq (weapons that will be used agains the USA). <br>
France is doing this not for charity, but because Saddam Hussein has promised France the oil fields: there are unsigned protocols between Saddam and Chirac that would grant France the rights to exploit the largest oil fields in the Middle East, and become de facto owner of Iraqi economy. In other words, Saddam would turn Iraq into an old-fashioned French colony in return for staying in power. <br>
Chirac would find more understanding in the world if he just came out with the truth: the oil fields of Iraq are the future of France as a power. There is, unfortunately, nothing to be shocked about this statement: the USA does the same thing with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (support dictators in return for the right to exploit their oil fields). By denying what is obvious and well-known, instead, Chirac is behaving like the old European colonial powers that exterminated entire peoples in the name of Jesus Christ: pretending there is a noble excuse for enslaving the rest of the world. <br>
Chirac, it's for the oil: just admit it, and (if nothing else) you will force your enemy George W Bush to admit that he is doing the same in other parts of the Arab world.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=estephe>Estephe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/8/03 8:15:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=512.topic&index=184>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pour les gens intelligents.</span><hr size=1> Lol VTW why do you quote that ?<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Congratulations Mr Bush. <br>
Unemployment keeps growing: two million Americans lost their jobs since George W Bush became president <br>
The stock market is crashing (the numbers tell that Bush's economic policies did more damage than Osama's terrorism), and is poised for its first three-year losing streak since 1939-1941 <br>
Crime has increased for the first time after ten straight years of decline. Murders increased 2.5% in 2001 (FBI report), robberies 3.7%. <br>
The dollar has plunged worldwide, for the first time in a generation, and Americans can't afford a coffee in Rome anymore: since Bush became president, Americans became 20% poorer compared with the rest of the world <br>
Since Bush became president, the US governmenst has lost more than a trillion dollars, due to a combination of pork-barrel spending and tax cuts for wealthy Americans: the US government is in debt again after several years of surplus (the US debt has increased to 6 million billion dollars, i.e. each American would have to pay about $21,000 in order to pay off the national debt) <br>
The U.S. trade deficit widened to a record $37.6 billion in May (i.e., each American owes about $10,000 to foreign countries) <br>
The average American household is indebted (as in &quot;credit cards&quot;, &quot;mortgages&quot;, etc) like never before in the history of the USA <br>
Corporate corruption is rampant (spearheaded by the president and the vicepresident themselves). In October 2002 Bush vetoed the nomination of John Biggs to lead an independent investigation, thereby killing corporate reform. <br>
Bush lied about the recession: the revised numbers show that there were three quarters of recession in 2001 (not just one). Thus this is already one of the worst recessions ever This is becoming (as we predicted two years ago) the longest world-wide economic crisis of all times. <br>
The trade deficit keeps increasing. Even the IMF and the World Bank (both controlled by the USA) warned that this huge debt cannot be sustained forever. In order to pay its debt to the rest of the world, the USA has to come up with 4 billion dollars a day (a day). This has worked in the past because foreigners were investing in US stocks and real estate. But now US stocks are worth less than the paper they are printed on. Eventually, the USA will have to start paying those 4 billion dollars a day in some other way. The easiest solution will be to devalue the dollar, which is what third-world countries do. Bush may preside over the demise of the USA as a world's power. <br>
The terrorists indicted for September 11, including Osama, are still at large <br>
The leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, is still at large (in fact the Taliban have already murdered two politicians of the new Afghani government) <br>
The vast majority of the people killed in Afghanistan by USA bombs were civilians, not Taliban or Al Qaeda <br>
The anthrax terrorist has never been caught, but there is growing evidence that the anthrax came from an American laboratory <br>
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is worsening by the day <br>
Relationships between the USA and Europe have never been so strained (so much for the &quot;coalition&quot; that Bush promised to build) mainly because Bush has violated all sorts of economic and social treaties <br>
The prestige of the USA around the world has never been so low after the USA refused to sign: the Kyoto treaty on reduction of carbon dioxide, the international court, the anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia, and even the treaty against torture <br>
The USA government has never spent so much money to finance pork-barrel projects (mainly benefiting the lobbies that elected Bush) and so little money for aid to poor countries (AIDS is killing 4,000 people each and every day in Africa alone, as many as were killed on September 11 in the USA, but Bush thinks those 4,000 Africans are worth only 1% of what the American spends on subsidies to farmers) <br>
One disaster that Bush has not been allowed to cause is investing social security in the stock market. It was one of his main campaign promises. The events of September 11 changed the priorities of his administration, otherwise today the whole treasure of social security would be invested in the stock market, and Americans would have lost their pensions. Thankfully, some of Bush's craziest ideas have never been implemented.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

<br>
Trade deficit is not debt.  Trade deficit means we bought more foreign goods then we sold. See, thanks for showing we support the world economy. <br>
BTW by those calculations there would only be 3.76 million Americans BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!<br>
<br>
And I am glad you say VTW style because my point was to do two things exactly like the French here and was waiting for you to respond. Of course, you missed one: <br>
<br>
1) Giving a link that just slams another country without any real proven factual information, just pure bias (Arka, Doobe, and you have all pulled that one..But thanks for recognizing your own style)<br>
<br>
2) Citing all the incidents that make terrorism in your country happen, even though those actions are far worse then our peace keeping actions, as if it is then justified or called for.<br>
Terrorism is not an answer for anything, and any terrorist group, supporter, or otherwise needs to be rooted out and removed -- not just sit and wait to see what they do first.  <br>

BTW, didnt anyone just catch that huge set of interviews with the anti-war protest groups. The interviewer went around asking them some simple questions since they are so well informed.  Questions were: <br>
1) Who is the Secretary of Defense?<br>
2) Who is Colin Powell?<br>
3) Who runs Iraq?<br>
4) Who is our major ally and who is its leader?<br>
Plus a bunch of other funny ones. Like showing where Iraq is on a map. <br>
<br>
Some samples of the fun answers given (there were other absurd ones but I didnt have a pen to take notes):<br>
1) Tommy Franks, Wolfiwitz, and a ton of I dont knows.<br>
2) Im not sure but know he is one of those white guys, vice president, and a bunch of I dont knows. <br>
3) I dont knows and fortunately, this one most got correct. At least they know who they are protecting. <br>
4) Some we dont have any allies this is unilateral, most knew Britain but who was the leader got funny: Queen Elizabeth, some I dont know, and at least 60 percent got Blair right <br>
<br>
They only showed a few trying to find Iraq on a map, some got general region and others just kept reding aorund the map hoping to catch the name.<br>
<br>
Some of the best clinchers were two people asked about how informed they thought anti-war protestors were (one of these two gave the Colin Powell white guy answer and the other got at least half wrong also):<br>
<br>
The girl who said Colin Powell is a white guy: We are well informed. With the news today things are 24/7. How can we not help but be informed. <br>
<br>
The guy who got at least 50 percent wrong and way off base: I think we are informed. At the risk of sounding biased, I would say the pro-war people are the real ones misinformed. <br>
<br>

HEADLINE: Arab leaders hasten to congratulate Chirac <br>
BYLINE: Henri Mamarbachi <br>
DATELINE: PARIS, May 25 <br>
<br>
BODY: <br>
Egyptians, Saudis, Kuwaitis and even Iraqis seeking help in emerging from international ostracism are hastening to Paris to congratulate <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>President Jacques Chirac, the &quot;Arabs' candidate,&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on his election victory... <br>
<br>
France took part in the US-led coalition to force Iraq out of Kuwait, but an Arab diplomatic source said Chirac was also anxious to put the war firmly in the past and eliminate the possibility of a threat to regional stability if Baghdad's isolation continues. <br>
<br>
He thus has a delicate balancing act in keeping friends with Kuwait, whose claims France supports, and in working for the long-term reintegration of Iraq in the international community. <br>
<br>
In this respect France is at odds with the United States, which wants to keep the sanctions screw tightened on Iraq with the aim of bringing about the fall of President Saddam Hussein. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Saddam welcomed Chirac's election at the beginning of this month with the hope that Franco-Iraqi relations could return to the special place they held 20 years ago.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BYLINE: Pierre Briancon of Liberation</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
BODY: <br>
In the reptilian brain of every French president there slumbers the spectre of Gaullism. The French condemnation of the American bombings of Iraq - which managed to be at once strident and unspoken - is the most recent example. Jacques Chirac is, after all, the first Gaullist president to occupy the Elysee Palace since the death of Georges Pompidou in 1974. By refusing openly to support the actions of Bill Clinton (the man whom he describes as his &quot;friend&quot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , Mr Chirac seized an opportunity to display to the Arab world the difference between French and United States' policies and sensibilities. <br>
<br>
There was also, for sure, a European irritation at being presented with a fait accompli and being asked to play along with a domestic US political game. There was something typically Clintonesque about making the rest of the world hostage to the US electoral timetable - something which irritated even his most faithful allies. But the French disavowal of the Iraqi escapade flowed also from a mixture of old diplomatic traditions and new commercial interests. <br>
<br>
French diplomacy has long been haunted by a rather tired notion - &quot;French policy for the Arab world&quot;. According to this, France - by virtue of its history, its location, its interests, and above all by its (Gaullist) tradition of independence from the US - has a unique role to play, from Morocco to Iraq, from Lebanon to Libya. <br>
<br>
Ideologically, the lobbyists for French Arab policy can be found in the usual bastions of anti-Americanism: from Gaull-ism to Communism. Sociologically, it springs from a certain tradition in the Foreign Ministry which tends to view relations with American colleagues as a kind of rivalry. Culturally, the lobby is rooted in nostalgia for France as a &quot;great power&quot;, capable of going toe to toe with US influence in any part of the world. <br>
<br>
The French Arab lobby is, with a few exceptions, synonymous with the forces which laboured for a more sympathetic attitude to the Serbs during the Bosnian war. It also occupies the same ground as those calling for a normalisation of relations with Cuba. Mr Chirac is not himself part of this lobby. But many of his advisers are and it can usually count on his support. <br>
<br>
This tradition lives comfortably with the commercial interests of French companies. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>It is no secret that French oil companies were the first to dash to Baghdad to negotiate contracts after the easing of the United Nations embargo on Iraq.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>There was a time when Iraq was one of the best customers for French exports and the leading supplier of Iraqi credit. More than 20 years ago, a young French prime minister, called Jacques Chirac, welcomed to Paris the Iraqi number two, proclaiming affectionately: &quot;You are my friend.&quot; His guest was the upwardly mobile Saddam Hussein.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
During the Gulf war, France was a loyal member of the coalition against President Saddam. And since he came to power in May last year, Mr Chirac has even announced a rapprochement with Nato, to the consternation of many old Gaullists in his own party. <br>
<br>
But in Arab policy it was inevitable that Mr Chirac would one day noisily assert his exceptionalism. The opportunity was muffed when his Foreign Minister, Herve de Charette, tried to negotiate a settlement after Israel attacked Hizbollah in south Lebanon. The fury of the US Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, cast doubt, even ridicule, on the French initiative. The attack on Iraq gave Mr Chirac the perfect opportunity to mark out his differences from the US. The surprise is not that he distanced himself from the operation; the surprise is that he did not do it sooner. <br>
<br>
It is by no means certain, however, that Mr Chirac will draw political benefit from his decision. French public opinion is hard pressed to understand why we should prefer President Saddam to Mr Clinton. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>In any case, the French have become increasingly uncomfortable with the apparent eagerness of successive governments to cosy up to the most dictatorial regimes in the world.<br>
<br>
The starkly commercial dimension of French foreign policy reinforces this public unease. It seems that French officials are ready to ignore a great deal for the sake of a contract.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
Independence from the US can still score points in French domestic politics. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>But America-bashing has little value when it takes the form of a self- interested friendship with the likes of Saddam Hussein.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
