I took a slightly different route.  Initially I went strictly hps - ND3, PE, PD3.  My next decisions were governed by bang for my AA buck (I'm a semi-casual player and only have so much online time to raid/aaxp), agro management and AA skill availability (availability ranges from always there, ie ND3, to activated with a reset time, ie AE Taunt).  Key warrior AA's focus on either damage mitigation and/or agro management.  I backburnered AE Taunt because it seemed a situational AA and once used had a reset time.  If what has been stated in the other AA discussion thread is true - &quot;AE Taunt immediately gets you agro and KEEPS it&quot;, then I will have to rethink that.  So I went after the AA's that provided me a multiple bonus in mitigation and agro management - CS/CA, Tactical Mastery, Stalwart Endurance.  I made sure I had CS1 and CA1 to take full advantage of PE.  Tactical Mastery mitigates damage by avoiding ripostes (definitely a bonus for us fast dual wielders and on enrage) and improves agro management by increasing the amount of times you strike a mob by penetrating his defenses.  I am currently at TM2.  For us smaller races (I'm a hummy) stunning blows during a fight are a pain.  When you are stunned you are unable to defend yourself and you are also unable to damage the mob.  Stalwart Endurance changes that.  Not only do you avoid the stunning blow, but your defenses are still functional and able to deal with follow up attacks (aka quads).  You are also still damaging the mob which enhances your agro.  I am currently at SE2.  At this point I felt my agro management needed improvement more than mitigation so next came Ferocity.  For a warrior Ferocity or any other AA that increases dps isn't about the dps.  It's about agro management.  Agro management is achieved through taunt + dps + weapon procs(stuns, debuffs, hate-aka enraging blow, snares, dots).  AA's that improve the number of times you hit the mob improve dps AND increase the number of chances for your weapon to proc.  Ferocity does that.  So does Ambidexterity, Flurry, Double Riposte, Tactical Mastery and Stalwart Endurance.  Other than TM and SE, Ferocity had the least number of prerequisites.  I'm currently at FE2.<br>
<br>
I'm now at a crossroad where I feel I could go mitigation or agro control.  I can go one of three ways:<br>
<br>
1) Finish out SE, TM and FE.<br>
2) Get CA3 and at least LR2.<br>
3) Get AoE Taunt and then continue with either option 1 or 2.<br>

I just finished up with Archetype and was wondering what to do next for AA and was debating whether AETaunt would be the next step or not. I still have yet to decide and have concentrated on Leveling to 65 so I put that on the backburner for now. Those that have AETaunt swear by it so it may be worth it.<br>
<br>
Another good offensive AA is Punishing Blade. Its only useful if you use 2handers a lot, and since I didnt see any 2handers in your magelo this probably isnt really something you would need but Ive been using a Greatstaff of Thunder 95% of the time so it will be one of my earliest AAs. Its on par with Ambidexterity in terms of additional dps, if not more.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I like your path and it looks similar to the one I want to do. Good advice.<br>

<br>
In my opinion, it is a class defining skill.  Basically gives you a get out of jail free card once every 15 minutes (less if you get PoP AA's to reduce).<br>
<br>
As for AA's in general, I would concentrate on the AA's that increase HP's, Combat Agility and Combat stability skills.<br>
<br>
I did sneak in combat mastery in my AAs, but more for avoiding ripostes then for added damage.<br>
<br>
I have about 70 aa's right now.<br>
<br>
As a MA, you want to take less damage ... if I had a choice, expecially in raids, to do 100 percent more damage, or take 10 percent less damage, would go with the 10 percent less damage each time.<br>
<br>
Except for Combat Mastery, I have spent no points on offensive AA's and have no problem with keeping agro equiping a 2 handed weapon.  The times when I do I have my trusty Area taunt up to save me.  <br>
<br>
Another thing nice about area taunt, is can have slower slow the mob faster, knowing that you can get agro off him with your area taunt, but because of the reuse time this is mostly on raids.  The start of big mobs before they get slowed can be bad, and normally when we die. <p>Veteran Plumppoopsie<br>

The sooner the better.<br>
<br>
It's incredibly powerful.  Useful in both raid and exp group situations.<br>
<br>
Instant, automatic aggro, anytime you want it (provided you didn't already burn it within 15 minutes ago).  The only thing which trumps it is low health aggro, which cannot be overcome except by a) death of whoever has it or b) healing them.<br>
<br>
It's often the key to smooth tank transitions on raid mobs.<br>
<br>
If your debuffer or cleric has somehow really angered a mob and you think they're about to die, you hit AE taunt, and they are saved.<br>
<br>
It's useful in CC situations if you know what you're doing, as well as split tanking multi pulls.<br>
<br>
As for holding taunt, well, honestly, that's going to be mostly a function of your weaponry as well as how others play when they're with you.  <br>
<br>
If I were you, I'd pick up AE taunt, then combat stability 3, followed by lightning reflexes 5.  They seem to make a huge difference in the amount of incoming damage you actually receive.<br>
<br>
That's quite a bit of AA, and should keep you busy for awhile.  :P<br>

<br>
Combat Mastery is mostly an offensive AA.  it does however let you avoid ripostes ... example of this is when a mob goes enraged, some hits will still land .. fun to do with mobs that don't hit for a ton.<br>
<br>
To me that is a big benefit, since with fast 1handers with haste and all, going to have alot of Riposte damage, and being able to avoid some of these can help alot on big mobs.<br>
<br>
Not sure what you mean when you say:<br>
&quot; I thought tactical mastery was an offensive skill, it allowed your attack to go through special defenses like ripostes, but has no effect on their riposte attack hitting you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Going through special defenses like ripostes, means you don't take the riposte, since you bypass it, unless they hit you with riposte, and you hit them still ... will have to pay attention to this. <p>Veteran Plumppoopsie<br>

Was still nice to hit enraged mobs when I use to use a 2 handed weapon ... hurts to much now that I am duel weilding again...<br>
<br>
Reread this thread, I still believe warriors should get there defensive AA's first ... I now have about 115AA's and just got CF1 ... going to go to CF3, furry, then the 2 PoP aa's that increase Furry and CF... will tell you later if I think I went the right way ... but in the end, job of an MA is to stay alive before the clerics go Oom (or a miss heal), HPs and defensive skills do this ... Even with a 2 handed, no proc weapon, I was able to call assist almost on engage, and keep agro.  How I have 2 enraging weapons, so just makes my life a little easier.<br>

What use are defensive skills if you can't keep a mob agro'd?  Agro is generated from taunt + damage + weapon procs + proximity + bash/kick.  Warriors have control over proximity, bash/kick, taunt and to some extent damage.  Weapon procs are random.  But to have a chance to get a weapon proc you have to swing at the mob.  Your weapon can proc on hits and from what I understand even on misses.   But can a weapon proc on a riposte?  What if you can swing more times in a combat round?  In deciding what aa's to do you need to take into account what your greatest needs as a warrior are not just think defense defense defense:<br>
<br>
  1) is your AC low? boost mitigation<br>
  2) are you a little on the thin side?  beef up the hps<br>
  3) having difficulty keeping the mobs attention? need more<br>
      offense.<br>
<br>
Just to recap my original post, I went with option 2 and now have LR1.  I think enough of a case has been made for me to go for AOE taunt now and I'm halfway there.<br>
<br>
On a side note, one thing I was disappointed to learn was that with the flurry AA we don't get a message like mobs get:<br>
<br>
    mob_01 executes a flurry of attacks on player_01<br>
<br>
Necros get WTD, pet classes get those packs of pets, what the heck do warriors get AA-wise to have fun?  I wanted to eventually be able to see:<br>
