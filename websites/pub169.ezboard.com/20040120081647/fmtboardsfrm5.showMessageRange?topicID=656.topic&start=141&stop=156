<br>
Right off the bat Evergrey had two strikes against them when I casually picked up their album off of a friend’s good word. Problem one: They play under a power metal structure (remember the problems I had with the Nevermore album? Yeah.). Problem two: There is a very prevalent use of keyboards. Trust me, that’s enough for me to throw an album in the trash without second guessing myself but I decided to give this album a chance, and much to my surprise, I kind of like it.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Recreation Day</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I mentioned what the band had against them right off the bat but when I actually popped this bad boy into my CD player I was happily surprised to listen that while this is power metal in every sense of the word, the vocals aren’t the same shitty operatic crap that plagues the genre. The next biggest surprise would be the fact that they have some songs that contain bad ass stutter stop breakdowns, a true rarity for such a progressive leaning band to incorporate some very math oriented stuff. The heavier songs are very well constructed and while they do fall into clichés every so often (the gothic choral stuff) it’s still a pretty good listen and a surprising one considering this came via a progressive power metal band. Think of it as Opeth’s Blackwater Park played through a power metal structure heavy on cliché and cheese.<br>

When the album slows down, much like it’s power metal peers, it’s pretty grating on the nerves. I’ve never been a big fan of power metal ballads and these aren’t going to make me want to embrace them anymore than usual. The keyboards are uniformly sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it and don’t serve much purpose beyond pissing me off to high hell. Trilogy of the Damned is pretty disappointing as album closers go. I love songs that stretch past the conventional time allotment for songs (3-5 minutes) so I’m normally so much more receptive to nine-minute album entries. This however is too slow moving and reminds me of everything I hate about power metal. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth after a somewhat credible performance from a band that calls a genre I dislike to a great degree home.<br>

Yeah, when I say depressing I mean depressing. Still, they have some nice qualities about them, like all the allusions to dreams, which ties in with the dream-like quality of the music. If not completely original, it’s clever.<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Here’s the skinny on the vocals: they don’t really suck. Now, they have some suckish qualities to them (over dramatization, a laughable attempt at growling) but for the most part, they don’t make me want to beat the sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it out of the next kid that tells me Iced Earth is awesome or tells me to “up the irons.” Considering this is power metal, it’s refreshing to hear someone that sounds somewhat normal and Tom Englund does that to great effect. He sounds fairly human-like instead of some primped drag queen that has his nuts in a vice. <br>

When I wished that Soilwork would start adding more solos into their songs early this year, it appears that this album has answered that prayer. While not as technically astounding as Nevermore’s Jeff Lomis or quite as fun as Himsa (two of the best guitar efforts this year), they are very enjoyable and just plain good. Englund and Danhage play with flair and have a fun little interplay, be it the stutter breakdowns or the beautiful rising solos that they provide. Unfortunately, the rest of the band isn’t up to the greatness showcased by the guitars, but they are hardly a let down. The rhythm section proves to be above average in it’s delivery and even though the keyboards are nothing short of annoying, he does have a lot more skill than fellow boardist and album destroyer, Bleeding Through’s Marta.<br>

This album just sounds so…so…big. For all the people that thought the Cradle of Filth album sounded epic they should give this a listen, it just sounds so full and huge. The guitars sound fantastic (especially the acoustic guitar, wow!) and are worth a listen on their own. The vocals sound great as well except that some of the gothic choir parts sound downright silly considering they are fairly weak, could use some beefing up. The bass also doesn’t sound too terrible but you’ll have to go digging to find it. I could’ve been spared the keyboards, but oh well, that’s just me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
They have some other albums out which have received various critical praise and might be worth a look considering how much you like this album. Nothing in their catalogue really compares to this album though, so this is where you should start, working your way back. Considering that power metal has become such a joke to the rest of the metal world it’s interesting to hear a band that has some redeeming features about them, kind of makes you wonder what else you’re missing…then again, if it has keyboards in it I’d rather stay ignorant. <br>

If there are two black metal bands that the general music populace has heard of, it’s got to be Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir. Hey, a Dimmu Borgir song even appears in the appropriately titled “Hellboy” preview, if you can’t consider that reaching the mainstream then I’ll have to rework my definition. Still, as proven before, wider public attention does not translate into credibility, as black metal is often considered to be one giant joke, with good reason. Over dramatic elements still plague the genre on the whole, be it the songs that praise the devil, the dense arrangements, or the gimmicky live shows. The question is, would Dimmu Borgir step outside the box and do anything to change the limiting style? Read on.<br>

Well, to...uh…start, the…uh…drums are pretty good. Trust me, I looking really hard to find some good things about this effort. Nick Barker is a talented dude and provided some eyebrow-raising drum fills throughout the album. If only this man could pick a better genre of music. That being said, the clean vocals are okay and make the music rise above the usual dirge in all the right places. The first single, Progenies Of The Great Apocalypse, is about as accessible as the band gets and is the only song I truly showed much interest for.<br>

The metal community must be digging at the bottom of the barrel if this can be considered one of the year’s best. First off, the vocals are god-awful and encompass every element of stuff I hate. You want to really piss me off with you’re vocals? Here’s the blueprint. Okay, now take a break from reading and go “chugga, chugga, chugga,” over and over again and throw a high “wah” in there every few seconds. You know what you just accomplished? You sound like the guitar on EVERY single freaking track. Maybe I’m being too harsh, but I really can’t stand mainstream black metal. I don’t understand how people can get so crazy over this crap. I’m from the school of thought that if you need a gimmick to sell the music, chances are you’re not trying to make good music. The music should sell itself. For every blasphemous lyric, over dramatic structure, and every time the freaking Prague Orchestra is used it just echoes that sentiment over and over again. It’s like music is screaming, “I am a gimmick,” and while the puesdo-goths that live in Hot Topic may love it, it’s far far away from the land of credible music.<br>

When ever you have something that’s more, for lack of a better word, “extreme” in your car and some jackass starts to bark “Satan!” over and over again in a complete show of musical ignorance it’s because of these black metal ass<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->holes. For the most part, I didn’t care enough to listen to the lyrics as I tried in vein to find something worthwhile about the album, but let’s just say that it’s rather heavy on the Satan praise. Is it really evil or just a lame attempt to pick up those disillusioned fans that are fed up with Christian values? Well, I’ll leave that for you to decide but remember that every time some co<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->cksucker yells “Satan!” along to your heavier music, you have these as<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->sholes to blame and the questionable taste of fans that brought them to the mainstream.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
While the clean vocals are okay (and criminally underused) the “scream” vocals are mercifully painful to take in. They are the equivalent of a dog that won’t stop growling at a door coupled with the annoyance of a baby that won’t shut the hell up a plane. Put your finger down your throat and record yourself gagging. Congratulations, you just made a demo tape for a black metal band. Honestly, I’d describe them more, but that requires me actually focusing attention on them and that’s not something I’m willing to do right now. I’ll just say this; they’re bad, really bad. <br>

Like the majority of metal bands they are competent at what they play, but that doesn’t mean that they are able to write intriguing arrangements. Generic at best, truly pathetic at worst, you could do a lot better than these guys. If you’re a drummer you should consider picking this up for the drum work since Barker is consistently excellent throughout the record and provides the albums best moments. It worries me that the Prague Orchestra shows up for a few tracks, which only leads me to believe that they need money, really badly. Still, it beats the crap out of the Frankenstein Monster that Metallica created a few years back.<br>

It’s decent sounding enough but it doesn’t really bring much out of the songs considering they are so densely layered. As if this album wasn’t cliché enough, it gets the typical sample driven intros thrown into the mix, all oddly enough having to deal with Satan. Glad to see you guys aren’t redundant!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
The only reason I picked this album up was due to strong reviews from every metal source I went to. I can only assume that the rest of their catalogue is much of the same crap. Truthfully, I could care less; I have yet to hear some mainstream black metal that makes me think different of the genre. Am I being too ignorant and not opening my mind? Yes, yes I am and until the day that someone floats some decent black metal my way I’ll stay the same. As for this review, I think it’s time that someone said it: mainstream black metal is a gimmick plan and simple and if you’re looking for artists that care more about the music than the buck you’ll have to travel elsewhere.<br>

With a name change few things remain the same and it can either change the music for the better (Norma Jean) or the worse (Audioslave, offshoot my ass!). Give Up the Ghost (formally American Nightmare) belongs to the first grouping but to be honest, besides some minor tinkering, their sound has in large remained constant. Still, is consistency in the Give Up the Ghost camp a good thing? Read on…<br>

Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>We’re Down Til We’re Underground</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
After subjecting myself to a few albums that bring new meaning to overproduced it’s refreshing to hear an album that is so stripped down yet is able to rock so hard. This had mostly everything I look for in a record, passion, sincerity, intensity, and intelligence, it’s all there in one way or another. And it rocks, I can’t say that enough! It’s a thoroughly enjoyable listen through and through and while it does have some minor flaws it doesn’t bring down the fact that it succeeds in it’s task of making a simple yet outstanding record. Also, check out the closing instrumental as it’s quickly rushing up my list as one of my favorite songs of the year, great stuff! <br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Bad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Well, they certainly cut the fat away as this album clocks in at a brief half hour. There are points where I felt the band could stretch some of the songs out a little bit without losing the momentum but that’s a fairly minor complaint. It is true that every song sounds the same and it took repeated listens until I could really pick them apart. Whether the first track is needed is debatable but it’s certainly the weakest track here since it really doesn’t add much to the record besides giving you some time to prepare yourself for the attack.<br>

Sweet lord yes. Even though that’s only a sampling, the rest of the record follows suit and is just as good, if not exceedingly better, than those lines posted. It’s a rare album, one that rocks out but is thoughtful with a great set of intelligent lyrics. It’s one of the better lyrical efforts in hardcore this year if not in all of music.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Fantastic stuff! Why you ask? I can answer that very quickly in three ways. 1) It actually sounds like Wes is screaming. He definitely isn’t a studio screamer and if I’m wrong, well, shows what I know. His performance is credible because he’s not trying to do too much with his voice, it’s straight ahead and it rocks. 2) You can understand what he’s singing. As much as I hate to agree with people that say this, there’s no point in writing deep lyrics if you’re aren’t going to offer them up coherently. Case in point: Even though I love Curl Up and Die to death, it sounds like the lead singer is just saying “Bah ba yeah yeah, Bah ba yeah yeah,” over and over again. 3) Emotion and sincerity is key to hardcore. Wes’ vocals exude this in buckets; I actually buy the fact that this guy is pained.<br>

The phrase less is more certainly applies here. Nothing is too outwardly technically demanding but it all works since it sounds like they are playing with a certain passion. This is a call back to the simpler days of hardcore, when straight ahead driving rock that people could release some aggression too was more important than placing off time mosh parts after running up scales. This album is the epitome of good rock, it’s fast, simple, and energetic played by young kids that don’t give a sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it about anything else than rocking out.   <br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I love the fact that the guitars are relatively clean, when the guitars are overly distorted it tends to make the record sound synthetic, like it was meddled with too deeply in the studio. A lot of records today also seem to trade bruising simple rock for dense production. If We’re Down Til We’re Underground does anything it should make people reconsider how a band should be produced. This record is simple in its approach but it doesn’t need anything more and it makes it the all the better. Like I’ve said before, this album’s production is great because there isn’t that much comparatively. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I wasn’t too big on Background Music since it just felt like it was missing something (still can’t put my finger on it) but I really enjoyed this record. I like records like this, stuff that’s simple but still demands repeated listens. Still, this album’s biggest asset is the fact that it rocks so hard, and that’s all that really matters in the end. If you want a real rock record after listening to the absolute crap that masquerades as such on rock radio, do yourself a huge favor and pick this up. <br>

<br>
This has to be a joke. From the hilarious beginning (using a very recognizable choral classic) to the fact that they actually thought a ten-minute death metal song was a good idea…this just has to be a joke. So of course I had to swing by their website to check if tongue was planted firmly in cheek and this is what met me: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The definition of extreme can be interpreted in many ways, <br>
VITAL REMAINS, however, takes its meaning to a whole new level, <br>
be it through using their instruments as weapons for mass annihilation <br>
or through unrelenting, blasphemous lyrics that display their hatred <br>
of religion and all that it stands for.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Yep, this a joke and now I almost feel guilty about seriously reviewing this album. <br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dechristianize</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Well, the guitars made this album somewhat worthwhile. They do provide the only melody and come complete with some eyebrow raising solo work, the only problem being that those moments are too far and few between. Like a lot of music coming out today there aren’t any good songs (since you’ll have a hell of a time trying to separate one track from the next) but there are some good parts. Dechristianize can be considered the best song since it’s the most melodic thanks to some decent guitar work. Elsewhere Devoured Elysium has an okay groove break that sounds like something straight from a Dying Fetus record and Unleash Hell is just plain funny.<br>

You know, unless you’re a giant fan of death metal, want to hear some half decent guitar and drum work, really hate Christians, or just plain want to piss off your parents this album only serves one purpose and that is to win arguments with your friends over what is the evilest sounding music you’ve heard. While the songs really don’t have much in the way of redeeming features beyond some pretty fluid guitar work and the usual death metal double bass lightning fast earthquake, they do, however, provide some damn hilarious moments of faux evil. Check out the beginning of Unleash Hell, and while it does sound fairly sinister, it’s also so terribly over the top that it’s damn hard not to bust up laughing. For those of you that want a return to the death metal of yesteryear than give this album a go, everyone else should pick up the last Nile album, hear death metal done right, and give thanks to the fact that the era of Cannibal Corpse gore splattered death metal has past us by. <br>

Good? No. Hilarious? Haha, that would be a definite yes. If only the lyrics were more understandable I’d play this to every Jehovah Witness that found their way onto my doorstep. Even though they encompass about every death metal cliché they are fairly well written and utilizes the same old world scripture-like technique that makes some of the lyrics feel like an ancient rebuttal to the bible. Then again you have lyrics like, “Now my hands will tear your fu<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->cking god apart,” which doesn’t incite anything except a full belly laugh. I’d break this album out for a party and laugh it up with my friends, taking it anymore seriously than that would mean that you have reality issues. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
No real surprises here, this is pretty much the same sock in mouth variety of vocals that was done to death (no pun) in the early nineties. Would you expect anything different from Glen Benton who also helms vocal duties for Decide? While they are deep, there sounds like there’s too many damn effects put on them. Here and there there’ll be moments where some annunciation comes through and then that’s quickly righted, as Glen will slip back into the usual monotone growl. You also get the higher “evil” sounding vocals that have been used on every cookie cutter death metal record since the beginning of time. It’s been done before and it’s been done better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
The big surprise here are the guitarist that seem like they get tired of playing the same cliché death metal riff over and over again and suddenly break out into some fantastic In Flames style guitar interplay. It’s when those moments pop up, and those moments alone, that it almost makes the album bearable. They are damn good guitar players, why they want to waste their talent on something of this caliber is beyond me. Like most death metal outfits, the drums are also outstanding as they race to see how quickly they can wear out their double bass pedal.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
The drums sound decent and while the guitars get buried most of the time though they are allowed to shine when solos come around. The vocals sound god awful, are over produced, and are mixed way to high in the recording. If they were set more towards the back then this might’ve been a more enjoyable listen. It’s not like you can understand a god<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->damn word the guy is saying in the first place, I don’t understand why they need to be mixed like they are the focal point of the music. Somewhere there is a bass in the mix, but predictably, finding the bass would take more work then I really care to do and would require me listening to this sludge again. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
They do have other albums out but I’m pretty sure they are about as uneventful as this one is. Normally, when I give something a bad review I’ll say it isn’t my bag, but death metal <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> my bag which only makes this album that much worse. As I said all throughout this review, you can do better than Vital Remains as this album can only be considered bearable by novelty standards. This is definitely not the place to start if you want to get into death metal considering that this album, in all likelihood, could end that desire in a heartbeat. Skip this and go pick up some Cynic, Nile, or Suffocation and be happily surprised…you owe it to yourself.<br>

<br>
Love them or hate them it’s an undeniable fact that Trustkill is one of the most successful labels in hardcore today and while you can now find their samplers in Hot Topic and some of their more major releases in places like Target and Wal Mart they still live up to the reputation of having a solid line up coupled with an expected high quality of material. Of course, every label has that one band that hasn’t really proved themselves to be a great seller or just a great band no matter how great the rest of the label is doing. Enter Nora, who after an EP debut and a full length in 2001 still haven’t proved their worth. Will Dreamers and Deadmen be the album that shows me why the reps at Trustkill believe so highly in them? Read on…<br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Dreamers and Deadmen</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Ah, New Jersey, producing some legendary bands including the Dillinger Escape Plan and Drowningman, so it’s natural that you’d hear some of those same sounds in Nora’s music. They sound a lot like Drowingman with a more hardcore ethic, meaning there’s a little more in the way of breakdowns and the vocals aren’t as emo. It can be a pretty decent mix especially when they bring in some tight southern rock riffs in I Should Have Sent Flowers and even some dreamy female vocals that float in the background of Dreamers. It’s not the best stuff I’ve ever heard but that doesn’t mean it’s not enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Best Songs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Scars Are Supposed to Last Forever, I Should Have Sent Flowers, Dreamers, Two and a Shot of Jack, That’s a Good Looking Machine</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Bad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
A lot of this stuff is a tad on the predictable side, be it the lyrics or the basic song construction. While I mentioned they sound a lot like Drowingman, they also have moments where they sound a lot like DEP without the math influence. There’s almost nil in the way of melody which brings the album down a few notches in my book, they just want to come and smack you in the face which means this sounds more like a hardcore record from ’98 instead of ‘03. Some of the breakdowns are less than exciting and they bite an awful lot from other bands (try and tell me that That’s a Good Looking Machine doesn’t have a Poison the Well intro). While most of this album sits comfortably on the line between mediocre and above average, it’s when the band falls into long-standing clichés that make the album fail. Why can’t talk over vocals die? <br>
<br>
Worst Songs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Nosferatu</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Lyrics</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
It’s predictable hardcore stuff, broken relationships, broken hearts, and broken trust all tied together with the usual violent overtones. I suppose if you need a record to work out too or you had a shitty day this might work but there’s better out there. A lot of this stuff sounds like the antithesis of the lyrics of Throwdown or Hatebreed, while the bands share the same penchant for violence there’s nothing uplifting about Nora’s message. It seems <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>just</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be about the violence. Reminds me a lot of the A.18 record that came out earlier this year.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Severson sounds like fellow NJ natives Steven Broady and Dimitri Minakakis and I mean a lot. Maybe it’s something in that New Jersey water. Severson doesn’t put on much of a show and while I don’t expect to be blown away with amazingly versatile vocals in hardcore, I do expect some great screams that make me want to yelp along. You don’t really get that on this album as Carl gives a strictly average performance all around. In places he sounds a little weak which is a problem when you’re singing tough guy hardcore, you know, you kind of have to sound tough. Still, the pinnacle of Carl’s vocals efforts begins and ends on Two and a Shot of Jack. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
When it comes to hardcore, and hardcore in this vein, I don’t look for great technical feats, I just see how many times the record makes me go “holy sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it!” While there were breakdowns a plenty on this album they didn’t register very high on the “holy sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it!” meter. That’s not to say they’re all bad as Scars Are Supposed to Last Forever contains a pretty meaty ender that will definitely make some fans in the pit, but the good breakdowns are hidden in the songs that don’t exactly have enjoyable openings. It’s almost like they thought, “damn this song isn’t that great, let’s drop a kick ass breakdown in here.” The rhythm section isn’t as tight as it’s been on their previous albums but the bass fares pretty well and Hay comes up with some fairly creative guitar lines, most notable being I Should Have Sent Flowers.<br>

Trustkill records all have the distinction of sounding great and this is no different. The bass is high up in the mix (thank god) and the drums have a nice heavy feel to them. The guitar sounds pretty good, thankfully not over distorted so you can clearly hear all the lines being played but has a deep enough tone to bring out the aggressive qualities of the playing. I wish the vocals were a tad deeper but that’s more a problem with Severson than the production. The boards here were handled by pros and it shows, strike up another well produced record for Trustkill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Yet again, Nora puts out an average record and thus expectations are let down. Unless you are a huge hardcore fan looking for a record to satisfy your hardcore needs while waiting for a better record to come along or just a big Nora fan that’s dead set on having their full catalogue you can give this record a pass. It’s not bad, but it’s definitely not as good as some other records that have come out this year; a year littered with some fine hardcore releases.  <br>

You know a band is doing good work if they get name checked in a completely different review. NYC’s Skinless has been at the grindcore game since the early nineties but it wasn’t until this year that I really took notice of them. One reason would be Origin’s John Longstreth joining the show and the other would be the fact that they have subtly added some much needed melody to their sounds, not unlike Nasum, the other grindcore standout this year. So who is the winner this year when it comes to grindcore, Skinless or Nasum? Read on…<br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>From Sacrifice to Survival</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Skinless has always been known for having sick breakdowns and nothing is different here. I’ll even go as far as saying that there is a strong Pantera influence on some of the breaks in this record. If groove breaks aren’t your thing you only have to look as far as the drums, which could get nods as the best drum performance of the year. Pure insanity! I’m also happy to report that a little melody has been added in here and there, be it the clean vocals (and fantastically used clean vocals at that) or even the uncharacteristic quiet early Metallica-like instrumental A False Sense Of Security. Check out the first track, The Front Line Of Sanity, that song just doesn’t let up and contains the album’s best vocal work and some of the best riffs.   <br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Bad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Well, a lot of the humor has disappeared from past recordings. There are no songs titles like Tampon Lollipops, Pool of Stool, or Fetus Goulash and there are no humorous samples (one of the few bands I could stand samples from) like the closing sample to Crispy Kids. The song structure though is thankfully a little more restrained meaning that there isn’t that many oddball time changes just for the sake of off time breaks but then some of the songs have riffs that are questionable as a base to a song. Despite having a great drum intro, Escalate Discord just sounds stupid, as the riff doesn’t do anything for me. Webber’s vocals get tiring after awhile and you start to wish that he’d employ the clean vocals more.<br>

All the lyrics look at the corruption of man and it’s fairly clear that the boys in Skinless don’t see much hope for the future. It’s not the best written stuff I’ve ever read but at least they’re trying to sound more intelligent than the rest of metal that only seems to have violence on their minds. It’s not going to open your eyes to anything that you probably haven’t heard before but it’s a competent rebuttal to society at large today.<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I really wish there was more in this department. Surprisingly, clean vocals show up on three of the songs here and they sound great. It really makes me wish that someone would experiment with extreme music such as this and clean vocals further; it deserves to be given a chance. While the vocals have grown a lot since their ’98 debut it’s clear they still have some room for growth. For the most part they are more understandable than the past gurgle but they just aren’t that exciting. The problem with growl vocals like these is the fact that while they can hold my attention for one song they really struggle to keep me interested across an entire album. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
John Longstreth, from Origin, is a god among men on the skins. He delivers and makes this album worth buying just on the strength of his drumming performance alone. If you are a drum enthusiasts you have to pick up this album for the crazy work that Longstreth brings. He is far and away one of the best drummers today in metal. Elsewhere the bass puts on a pretty decent show and even gets to show off in a few spots (think the short solo in Cannibal Corpses’ Hammer Smashed Face). The guitar has some pretty decent lines here and there, they’ve always been known for their strong breakdowns. While there isn’t much in the way of guitar solos you still get some great groove influenced breaks. If you can tear yourself away from the drums you’ll find there is enough to make you happy if you’re a tech metal guy and enough to keep you interested if you’re a big fan of Pantera-like groove breaks.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
They cleaned up the sound a lot making it so you’re able to hear every aspect of the recording clearly, of course this sacrificed some of the brutality. It’s still a heavy record but it could be so much heavier. Still, the production turns From Sacrifice to Survival into more of a tech record instead of your basic grindcore release as you focus more on the outrageously hard song arrangements than the pure destructiveness that’s usually put across. The drums sound excellent, as does the bass making this record one of the strongest sounding rhythm sections to come out this year. The guitar could use some work, not really digging the tone here and the vocals could be mixed a tad better. I like how the clean vocals are shoved way to the back, could’ve done the same with the scream vocals. It’d bring your attention more to the music and that’s where it really should be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I skipped over Foreshadowing Demise but this album holds up against their debut, Progressions Towards Evil. There are aspects of both I like and in turn there’s stuff about both that I hate. Still, compared to some of the more extreme releases I’ve reviewed recently, this is one of better releases of the year for extreme music. It satisfies my need for heaviness and technical ability even though it’s becoming clear that it’s about time that Grindcore, Death Metal, and the sort really need to evolve to stay important in today’s music scene. The Nasum release is still the answer if you’re looking for grindcore in the 21st century, but From Sacrifice to Survival is decent albeit somewhat redundant.<br>

<br>
There have been some good metal releases this year (Frail Words Collapse, Silent Circus, Hidden Hands of a Sadist Nation, and As the Palaces Burn to name a few) but this one takes the cake. I’ll say it right off the bat, yes they sound an awful lot like Isis and Neurosis (even a slight touch of Pelican) but this album is so wonderfully written and solidly constructed that it can make me throw my normal gripes about originality aside as I have nothing but praise to shower upon Cult of Luna. Could this earn an album of the year nod? After listening to this record constantly this past week I wouldn’t be surprised.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Beyond</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Wow, that’s all I can say about how great this album is. It truly is hard to explain the greatness of this record without hearing it or without me breaking it down into sections. From the song structure to the vocals to the production it’s all uniformly great and while you do encounter minor flaws every so often, those flaws are made bearable by the fact that this album is performed with such emotion. These guys love music and I love hearing them play.<br>

There are some slight problems to this album. Does Inside Fort Meade really deserve separate track listing? No. While I’m all for ambient noise and intros to records, this really wasn’t needed and while it may tie in with the rest of the record (just mainly the end of Further) I felt that it was only included to bring the total number of tracks to the uniform number of ten. While the last song Further does have some great moments (killer guitar riff) it doesn’t end the album in the fashion I’d expect it would, i.e. a giant crescendo. <br>
<br>
Since I really don’t have a section where I can delve fully into Cult of Luna’s constantly used comparison to Isis, I’ll do that here. While on the surface they sound wholly similar, they are completely different beasts, compared to Isis’ last album (Oceanic) anyway. Isis is more about creating a mood and building up to crescendos while Cult of Luna is all about full songs that keep their single minded approach of bone crushing aggression. The Beyond is just an intense listen with a few breaks scattered here and there while Oceanic doesn’t have these rest spots, it keeps building and building. I would like to see Cult of Luna follow Isis towards building crescendos and not being quite as dense. If Oceanic was like listening to the rise and fall of the sea than The Beyond is like being hit by a giant tidal wave. In time they’ll evolve and that is the scary part, while this album is one of the best of the year they could be so much better and deliver the best album of my life. Exciting stuff!<br>

Not the best stuff out this year but it certainly is interesting. While a lot of this stuff isn’t the most intriguing read, hearing it performed is entirely different. Some of these lines are fantastic when they are screamed, case in point the song Genesis. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Somewhere along the railway a body divided in two<br>

Holy good god, the vocals rock! Listening to Rydberg’s deep scream is pure bliss as his vocals do something that most metal leads can only hope to do; he makes songs instead of breaking them. His voice is full of emotion; you can just hear the anguish and pain as he brutally tears away at your self-control until you find yourself screaming along with him. Talk about some great moments! Hearing Rydberg scream the lyrics to the lead single The Watchtower sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it. “Walk down to the watchtower!” Heck yeah!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Nothing is too terribly showy meaning that they sacrifice eye-popping technique so they can build solid songs, and nearly every moment on this disc is especially solid. The guitars have some spots where they show off a tad (the pedal guitar in Circle is magnificent) but it still fits well within the confines of the songs. If any instrument deserves the most credit it’s the synths that create some fantastic hooks. It’s shocking to hear me say that isn’t it? Not only can I stand the synths on this record, I love them, but then, when you use the same kind of synth texturing of Neurosis how can it not be great? It’s nice to hear a band actually care about making great songs instead of great parts of songs in today’s modern era of metal. <br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Holy crap the guitar sound on this album is bone crushing, as is the bass. I have to give it up to whomever the genius was that decided to mix the vocals that way. They are perfect in every way imaginable. Thank you god for the vocal work on this album! I have a slight problem with how the drums sound on a few tracks, if you heard the stand out record from Dead Poetic last year then you’ll remember the unusual drum production. Works in spades for the poppy sounds of Dead Poetic, doesn’t really work for a dense noise-metal band like Cult of Luna but I’m more then willing to forgive that due in large part to how perfect the production is elsewhere.<br>

<br>
Okay, it may have taken me almost a year to get around to reviewing this EP but that’s not because I never heard of it till now. If there could be some award for the band that got the most underground buzz, the most word of mouth praise, and the biggest impact on a genre without having released a full length yet it would go to Terror and it’d be renamed the Terror Award every year after that. This record has been huge this year and after it made a few appearances on some early top ten lists I decided it was time I wrote about Lowest of the Low.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lowest of the Low</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Bridge Nine have built themselves one heck of a label and they also have the distinction of having their whole roster made up of old school hardcore legends (Sick of It All) and bands that follow in their mosh pit inciting elders (Give Up the Ghost). Terror brings some of that old school mentality and freshens it up a little bit with some absolutely sick mosh breaks. Its pretty much all here in one very tight (and brief) little package from the great vocal work, to the anthemic lyrics, and to the great breaks. It’s a fun walk down old school lane.<br>

While this all pretty enjoyable it is rather light on substance and they are certainly lacking in diversity. It all depends on what era of hardcore you call your own. If you enjoy the more socially conscience uplifting new era (post Victory’s questionable roster decisions) than this album will really be a hard sell. It’s very violent and very short as the longest song just barely makes it over two minutes. Terror comes in, says what’s on their mind usually with a lot of “fu<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->cks” and “sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->its”, and then exits, leaving no room for unnecessary soul exploration or instrument experimentation. It’s music that begs for a cathartic release of anger not a record that is meant to be deconstructed to find it’s hidden meaning or it’s technical achievements and if that’s not up your alley then you’ll have a hell of a time getting into this album.<br>

Pretty typical stuff for a moshcore band. Nearly every lyric here has to deal with rising against and the occasional ass kicking of the people that wronged you. I did, however, find that Nothing to Me is an interesting rebuttal of the lifestyle of kids that inhabit your local Hot Topic. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Searching and searching just to find yourself,<br>

Strangely enough if your area is seriously lacking in culture and doesn’t provide underground record shops, as is mine, then Hot Topic is fact the easiest place to pick this album up. To bring the coincidence one step further, this album was available to listen to in the shop for quite a few months.<br>

I’m probably going to get a lot of flak for this but Vogel sound a lot like other moshcore standouts Jamey Jasta and Dave Peters. Bruising and rough, Vogel is still able to be understood clearly on most of the tracks which means he’s an asset to the record. That being said, I also enjoyed the group vocals on this album a lot as they were used correctly and showed up at the right moments to really bring out the anthemic quality of a lot of the material. It’s always refreshing to hear a hardcore band use vocals with annunciation rather than some sock in mouth “Gaarraaag!” type sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it, leave that to the metal kids.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I’m proud to report that there’s a guitar solo on Don’t Need Your Help. That’s about it for showy stuff and the fact that songs don’t really evolve instead of racing to the end as fast as they can means that it’s kind of hard to pin point any real standout moments from the instruments. They are mighty cohesive though and do provide some great breaks to mosh along too. The drums are a tad on the weak side, would’ve loved to hear something more creative from them but the bass does a nice job bringing the rhythm section up to snuff.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
It’s decent sounding and thankfully it isn’t clean which would take all the energy out a band like this. It’s got a really dirty side when it comes to the guitars and drums but thankfully effects are left off the vocals making them sound even stronger. It’s also nice to hear group vocals mixed at the right levels so they don’t overpower the lead and make him sound weak.<br>

<br>
If there ever was a testament to using the internet and free mp3s to a band’s advantage it’s The Early November. Building their legions of devoted fans off of a few offerings on MP3.com, The Early November were quickly snapped up by Drive-Thru records and cut a competent EP late in 2002 which not only boosted their audience but it seemed to put them on the front line poised for Emo domination. Nearly a year later they have issued their full-length debut to some critical praise and delighted Emo kids everywhere. Will Room’s Too Cold start a new age of Emo ruled by The Early November? Read on…<br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Room’s Too Cold</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Like the EP, I really enjoyed a lot of this album musically and when Enders doesn’t employ his off key howl it certainly hits the spot when it comes to late night easy listening. Call it a guilty pleasure, it’s light and entertaining and comes in handy when I need a breather between listening to more complex stuff. It also doesn’t hurt that they sound a lot like the Emo bands I loved throughout my high school and early college years so I get a strong sense of nostalgia whenever I listen to a lot of these tracks. The songs have hooks, some great sing a long choruses, and some great quiet moments to compliment the louder ones. If you’ve outgrown Emo and pop punk this is still a decent albeit flawed listen for those elements listed above. They should go far in the genre.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Bad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Even if you’re really into Emo, Room’s Too Cold has some major flaws, and I mean major ones. Firstly, they fall into all the usual Emo trappings that have been wringed for all they’re worth by label Drive-Thru. That means that The Early November effectively comes off like brokenhearted whinny pussies that need to cry about their loses instead of moving on. Just the mention of their name on any fairly repeatable punk message board will bring throngs of people who will question your taste in music by asking, “You actually listen to those pussies?” I’m not saying that if you had a shitty day or just broke up with your girlfriend yesterday you can’t use this as some cheap ten-dollar therapy, I’m saying that you shouldn’t be in the mood to listen to this album everyday or relate very heavily with it. Is it really necessary to dwell on the past so heavily that you can only find solace in crying along to a record of largely mediocre pop? I say no but than maybe that’s why I’m not an Emo kid or really understand them at all. While I could go on for days about how the originality of this album is severely lacking (this section has already reached a new high in self indulgence) I’ll simply use the old stand by adage of this has been done and it’s been done a lot better.<br>
<br>
Worst Songs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ever So Sweet, The Mountain Range In My Living Room</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Lyrics</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
If you’re out of your teenage years than the lyrics are wasted on you. These lyrics reflect a time of transition when everything seems so confusing, be it your future, expectations, and of course, one’s romantic adventures. That’s not to say that these lyrics are particularly well crafted examinations of this time but with adolescent issues you get an adolescent’s ability to craft songs. There are a few good lines scattered around here and there but then there’s also some truly embarrassing faire that probably will find their way into the away messages of teenage girls. A lot of this stuff is trite and forgettable but that doesn’t mean that it’s not enjoyable. Lyrically, Dinner At The Money Table is the most advanced song as it shows some depth, has a great hook, and shows restraint, as Enders doesn’t fully pour his heart out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Ace Enders’ vocals are beyond irritating. While it’s true that they are youthful and it helps flesh out some of the adolescent lyrics there are just…just…bad. There’s no getting around it, I really can’t stand his voice. It breaks way to easily, he has a real problem with tone, and they just sound bad…like Connor Oberst bad and that’s whom he can be most readily compared to. At least with Bright Eyes the lyrics make up for the lack of vocal proficiency. I’m at a loss for why some people can say he has great vocals because I just don’t hear it. A great man once likened his vocals to his anus after Taco Night, and that great man was I. I will however, give credit where credit is due and applaud the man for showing some true emotion on the caustic closing of Everything's Too Cold ... But You're So Hot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
In typical Emo fashion nothing is going to really stand out and make you shi<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it yourself on a technical level but it does have an amateurish charm to it all. The Early November are at their best when they are creating some melancholy atmosphere music such on the excellent closing track but horribly titled Everything's Too Cold ... But You're So Hot. There are a few surprises along the way such as few stutter stop riffs and a few lines that could be formidable breakdowns in more experienced hands. I wouldn’t go as far as saying this stuff is sloppy but it’s not exactly professional. <br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
If you’ve heard a Drive-Thru record before you know what you’re going to get into here. This record exudes warmth and sounds very bright and vibrant despite having a rather sorry for ones self lyrical message. The guitars have a smidgen of distortion on them as to add a little edge, the bass volume is brought up to appeal to a pop punk crowd, and the drums are relatively far in the back of the mix. The production really doesn’t bring much out of the music but that’s not its M.O. It’s mixed this way to gain maximum exposure. It just sounds, well, calculated.<br>

<br>
With In Flames and Soilwork softening there sounds for wider exposure, many of Sweden’s Gothenburg sound are stuck in a quandary: do you follow In Flames and gain fame and fortune or do you stay with the sound that got you have today and stay toiling in obscurity with a devoted fan base and a warm critical response that recognizes your credibility? For better or for worse Arch Enemy opted for number one. Anthems of Rebellion proves that the Amott brothers have money on the mind as this album softens the blow compared to previous hard hitter Wage of Sin and is so full of cliché you’d think they wrote this specifically for the Hot Topic crowd. I mean, a video gaining heavy rotation on MTV2 and much coveted spot on the Headbanger’s Ball compilation? Is this the same Arch Enemy? No, but the question is are they better for making the change?<br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Anthems of Rebellion</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
From the beginning it’s clear what’s going to work and what’s not. Erlandsson’s provides some competent drum work with some outstanding drum fills and the Amott brothers are their usual impressive selves and bust out eyebrow raising solo after eyebrow raising solo. Mix in some half decent breaks and this album becomes fairly satisfying on a musical level. Listening to this album any other way besides listening to it for technical achievements is a mistake. You’ve been warned.<br>

<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Bad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Where to start? Angela Gossow almost ruins this album all by her lonesome. Her vocals are hokey and just don’t fit the music at all. I just can’t listen to music that’s just there to sell well and this record just screams gimmick. I have a hard time believing that they got a female vocalist as an artistic choice rather than a gimmick to sell more records. Apart from that the guitar work isn’t as crazy as it was on previous albums in an effort to make this more accessible to nu metal kids that aren’t used to hearing a guitar play more than power chords. Considering that the rest of the catalogue is rather enjoyable we have to hope that this was just a misstep and they’ll right themselves with their next album. <br>

Good lord they are bad. I’ve read more coherent things out of fortune cookies. Just taking a look at the horrible song titles should be enough of a red flag not to check out the lyrics, but hey, if you’re a masochist or just generally curious you get gems likes this:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tear down the walls<br>

I’d rather have my ear dressed up like a crotch of a female baboon then be locked in a cage with a male baboon who has been fed on nothing but stale beer and horny goat weed and whose penis has been covered with tacks then listen to the lyrics of this album again. But wait, it doesn’t stop there! You also get lyrics about death and pain. Death and pain in metal? Who woulda thunk it?!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
As giant scary German bitches go, Angela isn’t that intimidating when it comes to her vocals. You know, it’s always nice to see women break into a genre that is almost exclusively male but Gossow’s performance here will only strengthen detractor’s arguments that female vocals in the metal world just don’t work. While not the worst vocals in metal this year (a distinction that is Dimmu Borgir’s and Dimmu Borgir’s alone) they are pretty damn bad and have driven me away from ever touching this album again, more so than everything else that is bad about this record. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Like so many bands of their kind it’s becoming increasingly apparent that all Arch Enemy has to offer the world is their ability at playing their instruments. The songs largely suck for the most part but they do have the saving grace of featuring some decent drum work and the fantastic guitar interplay of the Amott brothers. Much like other guitar virtuosos, they don’t write good songs as they do pieces to show off their nimble fingers. It’s sad when art takes a backseat to musicianship but take what you can get and when it’s the Amott brothers thankfully they give you a lot.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Predictably the vocals sound horrible, whether you can fault the production for this is really up in the air, but they never used to sound this bad so something changed. As for the rest of the album: the segues are a joke as I could create more convincing sound pieces with a cheap ‘90 Mac mic and a Spin ‘n Say, the guitars almost have the same tone as the Nevermore album, the drums sound somewhat decent, and the bass sits in the back. Deconstructing the album anymore then that would require me reliving this mess.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
I rather enjoyed Wage of Sin and although it was full of cliché and the over top theatrics that this album is it still had some great guitar work to carry it along with some great songs. There’s nothing wrong with a band trying to evolve and reach more listeners as long as they don’t make the jump by sacrificing what got them to that position in the first place. For an album that had such high expectations this year this was a letdown and one of the biggest disappointments of the year.<br>

<br>
In these reviews I’ve been rather loud about the fact that at some point Emo as a genre needs to grow up and stop it’s adolescent ways. Consider, for a moment, what a record would sound like if an Emo leaning outfit actually heeded that advice and recorded an Emo album for people that want the music and the melancholy message without the trite lyrics and without sounding like whinny pussies. The Weakerthans, lead by John Samson who also headed the seminal political punk band Propaghandi, have done just that, they have recorded a mature Emo record for those that have grown out of what the genre has grown into. <br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Reconstruction Site</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
The writing is probably what stands out the most when I listen to this record. Samson is one of the better writers in music today and not only does he create some fantastic hooks but just some of the great stories he gets into is enough to put a smile on my face. Along with being a great songwriter, he’s also blessed with being a great singer as he channels Al Stewart throughout most of this record. If you’re looking for a record that is far from dense and but carries some weight it comes to intelligent songwriting then pick this up, it’s worth your time.<br>
<br>
Best Songs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Reconstruction Site, Plea From A Cat Named Virtue, Time's Arrows, New Name For Everything, One Great City!, Benediction, Prescience Of Dawn</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Bad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
When they get too experimental it really kills off the pacing of the record. I could’ve done without the production experiments on both (Hospital Vespers) and (Past-Due) since they really feel out of place here. Apart from that I’m not too big on the way that the tracks are placed as edgey rockers have a way of following some quieter alt-country moments. Ah well, just some minor flaws that don’t necessarily bring down a very interesting listen.<br>
<br>
Worst Songs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Hospital Vespers), (Past-Due)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Lyrics</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Samson is a fantastic storyteller and has put out one of the better albums lyrically this year. His lyrics have a real wit to them be it his anthropomorphic view of life from a cat’s perspective, the hate poem written to Winnipeg, or my personal favorite, the standout lines from Reconstruction Site:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And I broke,<br>
Like a bad joke,<br>
Some bodies' uncle told,<br>
At a wedding reception in 1972.<br>
<br>
Where a little boy under a table with cake in his hair,<br>
Stared at the grown-ups feet as they danced and swayed.<br>
<br>
And his father laughed and talked on the long ride home.<br>
And his mother laughed and talked on the long ride home.<br>
And he thought about how everyone dies someday.<br>
And when tomorrow gets here where will yesterday be.<br>
And fell asleep in his brand new winter coat.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
It’s all well written and it’s very engaging, leaving you thinking about the message and how it relates to you.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
It takes a few listens to really appreciate Samson’s vocals. He has a really laid back style and doesn’t try and oversell the songs. This works extremely well on the songs that have the alt-country tinge to them. He’s got a pleasing voice even though he croons on The Reasons, “How I don't know how to sing.” It’s a tad disarming to hear a lead singer that doesn’t have the ego but it works well in this album where most of the lyrics have to do with self-deprecation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
There’s nothing to outwardly showy but the bass has some standout lines something that may have been carried over from Propaghandi. The guitar work is fairly standard (although there is a stand out two guitar solo in the album’s best track, Prescience Of Dawn) and shows it can’t both rock out and play some nice country rhythms; the pedal guitar produces the album’s highlights. The percussion is one of the most interesting elements just because of how eclectic it is. They are adept at playing some good indie post punk stuff but they really excel when they break out into alt-country, which, if you notice, all made my “best songs” list. I’d love to hear them explore that more. <br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Ian Blurton does a fine job juggling the genre switches and makes the country selections warm and inviting and gives the rock stuff a bite and edge to it. Not everything comes together so well as the experimental tracks ((Hospital Vespers), (Past Due)) are the worst sounding of the bunch because of the various techniques used (backwards tracking, etc). Still, Samson’s vocals sound great and I really dug the stripped down feel of the more acoustic laden numbers. It’s a fun romp and I’m happy to say that the production doesn’t inhibited that aforementioned merriment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Compared to Rest of Discography</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
This was my first experience with The Weakerthans and it made me want to check out the rest of their catalogue. I loved the fact that this album had the melancholy of the new era of Emo yet didn’t submit to any of it’s trappings by having wonderfully strong lyrics and a very tight musical backdrop to boot. It’s a fine album, and while it does have some minor flaws of it’s own, it can certainly be considered one of the best releases in the genre this year.<br>

<br>
Who knew that when I started these reviews way back in May that my 100th review was going to be a hot new Emo band from Wales? Funeral for a Friend initially was a hard band to label, they had the vocal tendencies and lyrical output of an Emo band, but had the song structure of a radio ready rock power outfit coupled with some hoarse hardcore shouts backing everything up. Stylistically, they were all over the map but one thing is for sure, all the music on this album is great making it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Emo release to pickup this year.  <br>
<br>
Now, let’s break down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Casually Dressed and Deep In Conversation</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Good</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
If there is ever a band with emocore tendencies that deserves to make the big time it’s Funeral for a Friend. All the songs here have hooks that stay ingrained in your memory for days along with some fine harmonization. It’s radio ready rock with more energy and more smarts than anything that’s being played on the radio currently. Songs like Escape Artists Never Die have a strong Atreyu and Alexisonfire influence but still have strong pop hooks and some great vocal work. Still, it’s that unexplainable energy that makes this band great. You can hear when a band truly has that energy and while you can never pin point where it is, you know they love the music that they’re making and it shows through and through. They deserve every ounce of popularity they get and also deserve to be a rock radio mainstay for years to come.<br>
<br>
Best Songs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bullet Theory, Escape Artists Never Die, Moments Forever Faded, She Drove Me to Daytime Television, Red is the New Black, Waking Up</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">The Bad</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
While it’s a good album and it’s very consistent, it’s a little <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>too</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> consistent. Every song uses the same verse chorus verse structure and while there are some surprises (math influenced stutter stop breaks) they are few and far between as all the songs seem to flow into each other. It’s not necessarily a bad thing as there isn’t a bad moment through out but you do have some reoccurring stuff that feels tired and used up when you get to the last song. There are also points where they feel a little too restrained. On some of the songs you feel there would be places that scream vocals would fit in nicely but are left out, maybe in an attempt not to scare off pop rock kids that don’t have a high tolerance for “death metal vocals.” Personally, I hate those pop bastards, but to each his own.<br>
<br>
Worst Songs: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>None</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Like I said, it’s pretty consistent all the way through.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Lyrics</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Well, it’s not going to blow you away but it fits the music nicely. There’s some great anthemic lines like in Rookie of the Year but on the whole the most of the lyrics have to deal with the typical Emo subject of you broke my heart and now I hate for forever and want to see you die. The difference between this stuff and regular Emo is the fact that these lyrics of rejection and basic female confusion are presented in way that doesn’t make these guys seem like whinny pussies that just can’t get over it. It sounds like they were really dragged through some sh<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->it and it happened just yesterday. Reminds me a lot of Glassjaw’s debut record, lyrically anyway.<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Vocals</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Davies’ vocals could fit very well on rock radio or MTV. That may not sound like the biggest of compliments but he has a nice tone that is easy on the ears and sounds professional; he sings from the gut. He also has the ability to harmonize well, which creates some of the album’s best hooks. The biggest surprise on the album has to be the hardcore screams which sound perfect. Check them out on She Drove Me to Daytime Television. Perfect pitch, just enough energy, right emotion, and you can understand what they’re screaming. Funeral for a Friend put on a clinic on how rock vocals should sound in the 21st century and it wouldn’t surprise me if this blueprint is used over and over again in the coming years.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Instruments</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
While they do subscribe to a basic rock formula when it comes to writing songs, it’s apparent that they do have some skills when it comes to the guitar and while there’s not much in the way of solos, there are some great guitar lines both from the lead and some great stutter stop stuff that could’ve found it’s way on the Beloved album. They don’t want to pound you to death with meaty breakdowns or impress you with nearly impossible run up scales but it’s light and enjoyable, a theme that this played throughout this album over and over again. It’s just good stuff, plain and simple. <br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Production</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
It sounds great all around. The bass is up in the mix, the guitars sound great (especially the lead), and the vocals are mixed well. Compared to the rest of rock radio I guess you consider this album to be stripped down, as there are no shitty production techniques in sight that have plagued albums from Trapt (bar none still one of the worst albums I’ve heard) to Linkin Park. While the scream vocals have a tad bit of production on them it’s just to make them a little stronger and give the album a little edge. It’s not the best sounding record I’ve heard this year but thankfully it doesn’t take away from the album and the good certainly outweighs the bad.<br>

<br>
I’m going to say this right off the bat: if you desperately need all your music to sound unique and original you’re not going to like this album, that is unless you’ve never heard the sweet sounds of Meshuggah before. It’s true, A Life Once Lost has crafted an album that apes Meshuggah’s sound for all it’s worth but they aren’t your normal imitators, nay, they have the talent and skill to back it up essentially making them the Americanized Meshuggah. Considering that the rest of the American metal scene have been taking notes on what Sweden does for a long time now it’s almost silly to think that Meshuggah wouldn’t ever have a clone and thankfully it’s A Life Once Lost doing it and not some jackasses that bought a guitar three days ago from a thrift shop and thinks that time signatures are autographs from clocks (hey, they do have hands).<br>
<br>
ALOL have always struggled to find a sound that was really their own, a problem that can be traced back throughout their catalogue. Be it when they were a spastic tech hardcore band that evokes the giant beast that is Dillingers Escape Plan or now, they never really could develop their own sound and, while their work is readily recognizable to me, it’d be hard for the uninitiated to tell the bands apart. Still, what sets them apart and makes them somewhat credible is the fact that a) they are amazingly talented and b) they write some killer songs.<br>
<br>
As A Great Artist Opens up you know you’re in for a brutal bone crushing experience. There’s just something about a well-executed groove riff that makes you bob your head in synchronized aggression. The guitars here are fantastic as this album comes off as one giant exercise in how to write amazing riffs. After the splendid guitar work the drums just feel like icing on the cake but don’t let them go unnoticed as they are a technical feat. Check the sweet breakdown on Nevermore Will I Have an Understanding... Holy hell!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Bob Meadows just doesn’t really do it for me in this setting. He’s shown he’s versatile in the past, going from a throaty howl to a giant death metal growl, and while he does switch up tones occasionally, there’s just not enough behind his vocals here. I had the same problem the vocals on the Between the Buried and Me album as they were just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>too</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> throaty and didn’t have the power I expected from them. Meadows does happen to sound a lot like Lamb of God front man Randy Blythe and that’s not a bad thing, I just wish he was a tad more on consistent and sang from the gut instead of the throat like Blythe.<br>
<br>
Where this album is consistent, however, is in its song structure, albeit a little too consistent if you ask me. Damn near every song has the same sounding riff with a little tweaking. Then almost every song ends with a harmonic solo played over a great groove riff. It’s all enjoyable on your first listen but the playability factor is diminished by the fact that everything really does sound the same. On my third play through I was getting tired of hearing the same thing over and over. I never get tired of the songs themselves especially when I have something else on between them but hearing the same stuff over and over again just isn’t my cup of tea when it comes to an album. Variety, look into it guys.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:times new roman;font-size:large;">Final Thoughts</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
Even though everything sounds the same and it’s not exactly the most original listen I found myself really enjoying a lot of this. It’s well executed, has some great riffs, shows a lot of talent, and most importantly it kicks a lot of ass. Consider this record a tribute to Meshuggah and all it’s spellbinding power. It’s more than a stopgap for those waiting for a new Meshuggah album; it’s like Meshuggah’s slightly less engaging twin. In the future I hope that ALOL picks up their own sound but I have no real problems with them aping other styles right now since they do a very credible job.<br>

<br>
Despite what everyone is saying, 2003 was not a bad year for music, it just took some searching to find the good stuff. Of course, if you just looked towards the mainstream this would look like a terrible year. Rock radio got even worse and more faceless, and despite some okay singles, it was totally barren of anything that was even slightly compelling. Rap, the most bankable genre in the 21st century, sunk even further down into the pit known as mediocrity as it’s biggest seller, 50 Cent’s Get Rich or Die Tryin' (even the title should put up a red flag), was simply sub par fluff with some likeable production. Thankfully Rap’s credibility was somewhat salvaged by a great pair of singles by Outkast late in the year. Then there’s the pop market and it can be safely said that any pop release in the past few years have been less than exciting. Still, this isn’t about the bad, this is about the good and there certainly was enough of it this year, you just had to be looking in the right places. I did, so join me as I honor the year’s best Flah style.<br>

Emo saw two of its biggest selling artists return this year with albums that were far different from things they put out before. Chris Carrabba put out a electric rocker that harkened back to his day’s helming Further Seems Forever and The Fire Theft put out a more progressive effort, which differed heavily from their work in the seminal outfit Sunny Day Real Estate. It really wasn’t an exciting year for one of the underground’s biggest genre’s as nothing broke through to the mainstream like the success that Jimmy Eat World saw a year earlier. Through and through, this year in Emo was strictly by the books and failed to really produce anything that reached into the creative heavens. Genre heavyweights Alkaline Trio put a largely average record that didn’t have that much in the way of thrills like their earlier catalogue and Saves the Day left their better more youthful years behind as they decided to focus their craft on a more adult pop sound. Still, there were some surprises as Further Seems Forever faired better than many thought they would issuing their first album after Carrabba’s departure and Hey Mercedes continued their excellent streak of albums and proved that last year’s debut was far from a fluke. Elsewhere Mae dropped a very credible debut making a name for themselves, Moneen further evolved their complicated math influenced Emo rock, and The Weakerthans put out a very accomplished album filled to the brim with excellent lyrics and well executed alt-country. Still, all these albums couldn’t match up against the best of the year, a fabulous debut from Funeral for a Friend and an amazing EP from Saosin (who I now wish I gave a higher rating to).<br>

Emocore, this year, was truly hit and miss. There were no albums that came out that were simply average it was either one of the best albums of the year or total and utter crap. Emocore continued it’s strong progression from 2002, a year that had some of the finest releases ever, and while 2003 wasn’t quite as strong it still provided the majority of the gems this year. Two of the biggest bands in the genre put out albums this year and while they weren’t bad they certainly were a disappointment compared to their discography. Thursday’s War All the Time was a decent album but it was hardly comparable to their 2001 release, Full Collapse. Thrice issued their third album, Artist in the Ambulance, and while it too was good it wasn’t a patch on last year’s Illusion of Safety. While those bands didn’t fair so well, Poison the Well, maybe the most recognizable name in the genre, made good releasing not only their best album but one of the best albums of the year. To continue on with bands that improved over time, Haste released their best album, which was greeted with open arms by both the Emo and Hardcore community. This was also a great year for bands making a debut as A Static Lullaby and Beloved made a very strong entry with their first albums. The year wasn’t completely devoid of disappointment though as From Autumn to Ashes couldn’t follow up the success of their debut or their EP and even the band’s hardcore fans realized that Fiction We Live was one of the biggest losers of the year. It was a good year for Emocore even after having to suffer through it’s continued proliferation into pop culture through shitty bands like The Used and the largely disappointing Finch (sans a great single this year that deserved stronger airplay from radio).<br>

My knowledge of Folk music in 2003 starts and abruptly ends with the three albums I reviewed this year. I will say this though; this year can be considered the rise of Jose Gonzalez who released a fine set of albums that measured up well against the year’s best. It’s a continuation of my thought the best music really does come from Sweden. Even after Damien Rice was awarded the coveted Shortlist prize he failed to really inspire anything in me with a comparatively average album. Not the first time mainstream critics and I would clash.<br>

I really wish I paid more attention to Hardcore this year. I missed out on reviewing two of the so-called “best” releases this year, Integrity’s Brining it Back and Burst’s Prey on Life. Not only those but I missed out on a bunch of other strong releases (Curl Up and Die, Burnt by the Sun, Most Precious Blood, The Program, Ion Dissonance, Black Cross, Forever Is Forgotten, With Dead Hands Rising, There Were Wires, In Dying Days, Zombie Apocalypse, and Into the Moat). I truly am ashamed to say I missed out on so much.<br>
<br>
Nothing came out this year in Hardcore that was as strong as Norma Jean was last year but there still were some quality releases this year. Avenged Sevenfold put out the best album this year from a critics standpoint but got beaten out by Throwdown considering that Throwdown was able to have such a hold over me this year. The Bled put out the genre’s best debut this year and one hell of a promising start for a band to watch. Every Time I Die put out an okay album that pales in comparison to it’s debut but the same can not be said for both Hatebreed and Shai Hulud who both issued albums that were on par with their previous releases (shame that Shai Hulud broke up). The biggest trends this year were a continued return to the old hardcore sound (A. 18, Give Up the Ghost, Hot Cross, and Terror) and the exploration of the tech subgenre (Daughters and Scarlet). 2003 wasn’t as bright as 2002 for Hardcore but then I missed so much I can barely comment on the state of things.<br>

Just a year ago Metal was so full of life and creativity, who would’ve thought that just a year later all that creativity and originality would be sucked from the genre. While Headbanger’s Ball helped increase exposure to what people have called this year’s most exciting genre it didn’t do much to stop imitators, especially those that wanted to sound like they were from Sweden (A Life Once Lost, Agony Scene, As I Lay Dying, The Black Dahlia Murder, Bleeding Through, Darkest Hour, and Himsa among others). Oddly enough the best band that came from Sweden, Cult of Luna, this year wanted to sound like American’s Isis and Neurosis.<br>
<br>
If anything, this year in metal will be remembered more for disappointment rather than it’s achievements. Arch Enemy, Bleeding Through, Blood Has Been Shed, Chimaira, Dimmu Borgir, The Haunted, Katatonia, Nevermore, Opeth, and Type O Negative all put out albums that were significantly worse than their previous releases and while some of those bands still put out good albums they were hardly a patch on what they were known for doing. The true bright spots of the genre that still showed some creativity by not outwardly aping their influences were a fine album by Lamb of God and a spectacular work of dense tech metal from Between the Buried and Me.<br>
<br>
Even though Cult of Luna put out one of the best albums of the year it is becoming more and more apparent that when metal’s popularity rises it’s creativity plummets.<br>

I am by no means a scholar on punk and really missed out on a lot of the goings on in the genre this year but from what I saw this genre was lead by the increasingly creative Death By Stereo and the unbridled emotion of Strike Anywhere. The big names also got into the action by putting out good albums that were a step below the quality we expect. Turbonegro, NOFX, and Pennywise all put out decent albums but couldn’t match up against their best. Perennial fan favorites Lagwagon put out a record that echoed it’s past but like their past recordings was largely disappointing. Elsewhere The Suicide File put out a fine debut made up of old school punk and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes showed that they are the finest cover band on the planet.<br>

Rock was marred yet again by what happened to become popular on radio and while this year had nothing that was as bad as Trapt it was still able to produce some true moments of crap.

Still, give credit to the rock underground for producing some fine moments. The Mars Volta brought the prog rock of the seventies back and made the year’s must creative album while Cave In crafted some fantastic Failure inspired pop rock that will stay on my stereo for a long time to come. Freya put out a great album filled with mini alt metal masterpieces and Zwan delivered with some fine throw back music that never failed to put a smile on my face. Coheed and Cambria made one of the biggest impressions with their fine release who’s cascading moods echoed their spastic guitar work.<br>

A Perfect Circle, Boysetsfire, Deftones, Entombed, Pretty Girls Make Graves, and critic darlings The Blood Brothers all put out albums that couldn’t match up against their better moments.
