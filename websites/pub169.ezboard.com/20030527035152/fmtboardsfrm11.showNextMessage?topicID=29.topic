<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A Rogue Born Of Ice:<br>
The snow was falling lightly, and the wind was still, as Erik McMarrin walked briskly to take over the guard post for his brother Bandl. Erik was the happiest man alive at this moment, his new bride had just told him that she was pregnant. <br>
Azeria is a beautiful, dark skinned, Oasis gypsy that Erik met when his father took him to trade food stuffs with the fine folks in Freeport. It was love at first sight, almost as if she had placed a trance on Erik the minute he walked into her Caravan. It didn't take Erik long to decide Azeria to marry him. They picked her up from the way back from Freeport and took her home to the land of Everfrost.<br>
This particular day was going to live long in Erik's memory. He couldn't be happier. The sun was trying hard to shine through the light clouds and the falling snow. Bandl greeted Erik with a basket full of Roasted Bear meat and Ale as he took over the post. Erik loved it here. All of the young kids who would be learning there trade would come and sit by him to be protected from the occasional bear or leopard that would wander by looking for an easy meal. Some times a Landed Lord or Powerful Wizard would stop by for a chat or to pass on some news from the world abroad. It was about 5 hours into Eriks shift that Bandl came running towards the post. As he stopped Erik could tell that he was not only fatigued but extremely worried about something he left behind. <br>
The next 4 months Erik spent in West Karanas fighting off the Infestation with every able bodied man or woman available. Erik spent every minute thinking about his time away from his beauty and their expecting child. It was hard for him to get away the front line to even write her let alone leave to go see her. Finally the reinforcements from Kunark came in to relieve the battle weary Barbarians and Humans. Erik couldn't be more excited, he was going home. <br>
Getting through Black Burrow was always a challenge. Erik would have to wait until nightfall to sneak his way past the Gnolls that ruled the waterfall. He couldn't help but think how nice it would be to have some Stout to take home to celebrate his childs birth with his family and friends. He decided to take a shortcut and go down a secret entrance in an old tree to see his friend, and Master Brewer, Rufus. The problem is when you meet up with Rufus you have to sample his newest brew. Erik thought, &quot;What the heck, a few more minutes won't make a big difference.&quot;<br>
After a few hours of talking and drinking, laughing and swapping stories, Erik was on his way through the tunnel towards home. Erik was looking forward to seeing his good friend Arlin at the bottom of the ramp into Everfrost. As he got to the bottom of the ramp he saw in his horror an Orc standing over the lifeless body stripping the last bit of armor off Arlins legs. Terror took over. Where did they come from? How did they get through the guard points? Where was Bandl? Terror quickly changed into intense anger at the sight of his fallen friend. His brother was going to have to answer to him. But wait what if they got Bandl too? What if they got my beautiful wife? He started running, faster then he had ever run in his life. &quot;May the Spirit of the Wolves carry me swiftly to the waiting arms of my lovely wife&quot; was his thought as his feet pounded on the hard packed snow. His thoughts flooded with gruesome pictures of family and friends slaughtered brutally at the hands of the Orcs. His head was pounding with panic and the effects of the stout as he tripped and fell down the hill leading out to the Tundra. As he righted himself he could see his house off in the distance. His heart sank. He ran to the top of the hill to get a better view. The small cottage was on fire and he could see the band of Orcs surrounding the house. Frantically looking for any signs of Azeria, Erik screamed at the top of his lungs that it sent a rumble throughout the valley completely startling the Orcs down below. The quickly regained their concentration and set out after Erik. Erik knew his only hope was to run towards the North Tower in hopes that His good pal Tundra Jack would be able to help him. The Orcs had other plans. Erik could hear them gaining ground on him. Erik saw the Tower but no sign of Tundra Jack, he would have to fight.<br>
Erik drew his Mighty Blade and swung with all his might. The power of the blow sent two Orcs to the ground without their grotesque heads. Two more Orcs advanced with spears slashing at Eriks mid-section. Erik parried and brought one to his knees with a swift kick to the groin. A sharp pain took Eriks breath away, he struggled for his breath. When he looked down he saw the end of a spear poking through his breastplate. He fell forward, sword falling from his hands, he caught himself before he completely fell. This was it, he knew he was only moments from death. One more blow from the ruthless Orc and he would be dead. The Orc turned him over breathed heavily into Eriks face and grunted some Orcish. Soon three more Orcs were standing over Erik. Two propped him up on his feet and faced him towards the apparent leader. Then to Eriks horror, the Orc pulled a head from the sack on his waist. It was Azeria. His beloved wife, brutally murdered by these disgusting, ruthless, bloodthirsty Orcs. Rage, sorrow, frustration, and pain took over. Erik lunged forward. In one fell swoop, Erik pulled a dagger from his sleeve and jammed it in the forehead of the Evil before him.<br>
&quot;My wife, my poor lovely wife, these bastards took my wife&quot; Erik said as he felt the life drain from the Orc under him. Then it hit him, &quot;Not just his wife, but his child as well.&quot; The next few moments were a blur. His rage grew with more intensity with each splash of blood each swing of his blade. When he stopped 4 Orcs lay at his feet literally ripped apart. He was weak, his heart pounded, his chest was on fire, Erik knew he would die shortly.<br>
&quot;Why did I leave my wife alone? Why did I stop in BlackBurrow? My poor wife. My child.&quot; all these ideas flashed in Eriks mind as he took his last breath. &quot;May Tunare guide my childs spirit to carry on the memory of its Parents, its Land, its Life&quot;<br>
As Erik slumped over. Tundra Jack leaned down and gently tilted Eriks head into his chest. &quot;Aaaarrrrrggggggg&quot; Jack screamed at the sight of his friends lifeless body. Only the sound of a crying baby brought Tundra Jack back from his deep sadness.<br>
&quot;A baby born of Ice.&quot; Tundra Jack thought to himself. &quot;A child without parents, home, or sureness of life.&quot;<br>
Tundra Jack leaned down and pulled the dagger from the forehead of a slain Orc and wiped it on his tunic. This would be the only thing he could give to the boy in memory of his father.<br>
Kesimar = Wandering <br>
Haakbalas = Dagger<br>
This child would prove his name to be fitting. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The battle with the Orc's lasted for many winters. Many of the residents of Everfrost lost their Husbands, Fathers, Mothers, Brothers and Sisters to the evil Redwind and his minions. Homes were burnt to the ground and livestock slaughtered uselessly, leaving many at a complete loss. People were forced to run to the safety of the town of Halas. With so many people crammed into the tight confines of the box canyon of Halas, it wasn't long before the &quot;Plague&quot; set in and ran rampant, like wild fire throughout the city. Young women turned old overnight. Their faces stretched tight over their frail frame as the disease ate away at there flesh from the insides. Strong men turn weak. Bones breaking under the mere weight of standing on their feet.<br>
The city was strong in the medicinal arts and created many potions to counteract this terrible blight, but Barbarians aren't used to being confined within a cities wall for too long. Many families decided to risks losing everything. Home, possessions, family, even their life for the opportunity to be free. <br>
Kesimar being just a baby when Tundra Jack brought him into the Tavern was now almost 6. A seamstress by the name of Kathrine took pity on the boy and provided a home for him. After the terrible events that took his parents, she felt it was the least she could do.<br>
She couldn't help but be amazed at his growth, it seemed as if nothing, even the terrible &quot;Plague&quot; affected the young lad. <br>
Kesimar was strong, agile, and healthy.Truly growing up fast. One particular afternoon Kesimar decided he was going to venture over to the Arena and watch the mock battles and to see if he could get his hands on some Halas Meat Pie. <br>
He studied his surroundings and saw his opportunity to snag a piece of the pie. A vendor wagon was approaching so he used it as cover to get in close to the Market stand. The wagon stopped, Kesimar ducked quickly under the wagon, rolled across until his back was up against the market stand. He could hear the vendor and the stand owner talking about business. He waited until he heard the familiar jingle of the money pouch and he knew it was now or never. He popped up over the side of the sand and he saw his prize. Kesimar quickly shot his hand across the table and snagged what he was after. He was already back down and under the wagon before the owner ever turned around. Kesimar was halfway through eating his last morsel when he could see the man counting his pies and muttering some less then desirable words. Kesimar knew better then to stand there for too long, so he lit out across the courtyard towards the Arena.<br>
The Arena was a very interesting, but brutal place, at times. It wasn't uncommon for someone to lose a finger or maybe even an eye from the ferocity of sparring. This afternoon would be no different.<br>
Kesimar found his usual spot open. There was some large boulders, that spilled over from a mining expedition from years past, that made a nice spot to see everything that went on in the Arena. With his belly full he was ready to see some action. Moments later the announcer told the crowd that they would be having a special treat today. A great homegrown Warrior was going to face off against a Paladin from the nearby city of Qeynos. It was going to be a full contact event. The winner would receive a medallion worth many days wages and then some.<br>
The battle was short. Not even time enough to remember the names of the contestants, the Paladin came out strong. His blade moved swiftly. He caught the Warrior by surprise. Knocked him off balance and brought the hilt of his sword down on the temple of the fallen Warrior. That was the end of it. The Warrior never even staggered. He quietly slumped to the ground, knocked out cold. The crowd was stunned. They had never witnessed such a defeat. Kesimar could hear a pin drop it was so quiet. Soft whispering could be heard throughout the audience. Some asking: &quot;Whats his name? Where did he come from again? and How did he move so fast?&quot; As the crowd settled down from there amazement, the announcer presented the medallion to the Paladin. He graciously accepted and moved out of the Arena for the next round of fights, as if it was no big deal. As the Paladin exited the Arena he walked by Kesimar who was still staring at him in disbelief. The Paladin called out and said: &quot;Boy, whats your name?&quot; in the direction of Kesimar.<br>
Kesimar still caught up in the moment, didn't quite register as to the fact his new hero was talking to him. Kesimar snapped to attention as the Paladin leaned in to Kesimars face and said: &quot; How would you like to make a little money?&quot;<br>
&quot;Run to the counter over there and fetch us some meat pies.&quot; he said as he pointed towards the vendor.<br>
&quot;This isn't good&quot; Kesimar thought to himself. &quot;What if the owner recognizes me.&quot;<br>
The Paladin had pulled a platinum piece out of his pocket and handed it to Kesimar. As he did so he said &quot;Don't worry boy, this will be enough to cover the one you are about to eat as well as the one you already ate. Be on your way lad and hurry, I am famished.&quot;<br>
&quot;How did he know?&quot; Kesimar wondered as he eyed the platinum piece.<br>
The vendor glared at Kesimar evilly as he approached the stand. &quot;What do you want you little thief?&quot; he growled.<br>
Kesimar knew his face was red, but he wasn't about to let the vendor see his guilt. Kesimar produced the platinum coin and calmly said. &quot; Two Halas Meat Pies, Please.&quot;<br>
The vendor was about to reach over and knock Kesimar senseless when he stopped short and backed off in a hurry. Kesimar could see the vendors face go pale as he looked over Kesimars head. Kesimar turned slightly to see what caused such a response. The Paladin had placed his hand on the hilt of his sword as if to say. &quot;One second longer you have Old man before I draw this sword and knock you senseless.&quot;<br>
The vendor pushed the pies forward accepted the coin and went back to his business as if nothing had happened.<br>
The Paladin again leaned into Kesimar and said softly.&quot;If you want to be rich, steal the hearts of men.&quot; There was a twinkle in his eye as he reached into his pouch and produced the medallion he had just won. The Paladin placed it around Kesimars neck and said a final sentence before he would turn and walk away. &quot;Remember boy. Keep you wits sharp and your dagger shaper. Never steal from your friends but take much from your enemies. And always remember to sweet talk the ladies.&quot;<br>
With that the Paladin was gone. Kesimar stood there in awe as he watched this Hero walk down the street.<br>
Many a night would go by with Kesimar falling asleep to those very words that this Paladin said: &quot;Keep your wits sharp and your dagger sharper. Never steal from your friends but take much from your enemies. And always sweet talk the ladies.&quot; Words from a nameless stranger that Kesimar would truly live by. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The news was spreading quickly that an Army was approaching the wintered lands of Everfrost. Men of all races were coming to rid the land of the Evil hordes of Redwind. The excitement poured out onto the streets quickly as men prepared to join in the fight. Women making food stuff and packing the bags full of ale for the men to eat and drink at the end of the battle. Children scurrying about, desperately to see what all the commotion was about.<br>
It was the first time in years, Kesimar thought to himself, that he actually thought he heard laughter. The town was alive.<br>
The Legions of men that marched down the ramp from Black Burrow was a sight to behold.<br>
Warriors with their armor glistening in the morning sun. Paladins with their cloaks flowing in the slight breeze. Rangers, bows in hand and quivers full. Looking eager to fulfill the dreams of battle. <br>
Wave after wave of men filed down the ramp. Some large, some small, some fat and some thin, but all with that look of hunger for battle in their eyes. <br>
Kesimar couldn't believe what he was seeing. There was actually a small contingent from Erudin of Wizards. Kesimar had only heard stories of them from the occasional jewel vendor. The intellectual powers these Erudite Wizards possessed, some say. could out damage a small army. This was definitely a day that he would remember.<br>
Kesimar new the valleys of Everfrost like the back of his hand, so he ran ahead of the army to get into position so he could see the battle that was about to unfold. As he got near his vantage point high up on the hill side just outside the guard post, Kesimar heard someone he recognized to be his Uncle Bandl.<br>
&quot;Kesimar, Kesimar.&quot; Bandl shouted. &quot;You stay out of sight. Let the army do their job. I don't want you getting hurt.&quot;<br>
Bandl knew that Kesimar had every right to be there and he was actually a little happy that the boy was there to see this mighty force eradicate the very Orcs that took his parents so brutally from him.<br>
&quot;Yes Uncle&quot; Kesimar said quickly, as he ran past.<br>
&quot;Kesimar!&quot; Bandl shouted. &quot;Do you have your dagger?&quot;<br>
The expression on Kesimars face was enough for Bandl to know that Kesimar had his fathers dagger. The boy never let that knife out of his sight.<br>
Bandl couldn't help but remember the time on the dock in Halas he thought he would take Kesimar by surprise by throwing a net over the boy and dumping him in the water. Kesimar produced his dagger and was out of the net and behind him before he could realize what had happened. Kesimar then stuck hi foot behind his leg pushed him off the dock. It was then that he realized the raw potential the boy had.  Faster then any man Bandl could think of. <br>
There were many who witnessed the scene at the docks and on more then one occasion while he was partaking of some Fierce Brew, Bandl heard whispers of Kesimar's name among the Brotherhood of the Rose, a notorious band of Rogues, located in Halas. Bandl knew it wouldn't be long before Kesimar was tempted to use his talents for less then honorable tasks.<br>
But today was a day for Kesimar to see justice metted out at the hands of a mighty army. The lessons learned today could prove to be valuable for a lifetime. <br>
Kesimar could feel the raw power that this mighty army had at their disposal. He couldn't wait to see Redwind running for his life. To see the fear in his eyes would be the least he could ask for. To run his dagger through Redwinds heart would be the ultimate revenge Kesimar could ask for.<br>
Kesimar could feel the blood pumping through his veins. His senses were acute to all that was around him. <br>
Little did Kesimar know but he would find himself having to make a decision regarding Redwind. A decision that would shape his destiny. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Chapter 4<br>
Kesimar moved to the top of the hill at the edge of the Tundra to get a better view of the mounting forces that were about to unleash a mighty fury on the evil forces of Redwind.<br>
The amount of Orc's in the river valley was unbelievable. They had taken over all the beautiful temples that were scattered in the hills of Everfrost. <br>
The stench was almost too much to bear. The wind had shifted from the North and was now bringing the foul smell full force into Kesimars face. The carnage that these Orc's called home was more then enough to even upset the most weathered warrior.<br>
The Orc's were well aware of the presence of the large army approaching, but seemed little phased at the impending battle. Their ferocity was world renowned and they counted on that to inspire fear in their enemies. <br>
The first wave of Rangers came to the top of the hill and launched a barrage of arrows into the river valley. The true beauty of of a well orchestrated group of archers was a sight to behold. These Rangers were well trained and extremely fast and impeccably accurate. Arrows would pierce the thick hide of the Orcs and yet they seemed only to annoy the Orc's as they advanced up the hill.<br>
Kesimar didn't realize this was a part of the overall battle plan. The idea was to whip the Orc's into a frenzy so they would charge up the hill without thought to consequences. As they crested the hill the raw power of the Erudites was unleashed. Kesimar could smell the acridity of burnt flesh and the air was alive with electricity. <br>
Kesimar looked down at his arm and saw the hair standing on edge. The goosebumps were raised at the mere thought of what was taking place. The Orc's were literally taken off their feet and hurled backwards from the extreme force of the powerful blasts.<br>
Some of the Orc's definitely had looks of surprise on their face but the determination quickly took over as they continued to advance up the hill.<br>
Kesimar was beginning to doubt what he had been told about Orc's. The were far from mindless creatures. He could see that they had order to their battle. He could see that in the distance that some of the Orc's were breaking off from the central battle forming smaller groups to attack the outer flanks of the advancing army.<br>
Kesimar was so engrossed in the scene before him he didn't notice that someone had crawled up beside him.<br>
&quot;Hey.&quot; a voice said quietly.<br>
Kesimar nearly jumped out of his skin. He looked over to see a young man, about his age, only about 2 feet from him. He was dressed in the traditional Shaman skins and he had that medicinal smell about him of herbs and sweet liquid.<br>
&quot;How goes the battle?&quot; the young man asked. Still in a quiet tone.<br>
Kesimar wasn't much for conversation and was even more annoyed that this Shaman had been able to sneak up on him without even the slightest bit of noise, but Kesimar couldn't help but to admire the Shaman class. After all they did heal his step Mother of the Plague.<br>
&quot;Look.&quot; Kesimar said as he pointed to the band of Orc's that had broken off from the main battle.<br>
&quot;Let's go see where they are going.&quot; the young shaman suggested.<br>
It didn't take the boys long to make there way along the edge of the mountain in the direction of the Orc band. There was a small inlet just east of the Medicine man that Kesimar figured would make a prime point of attack for the Orcs to surprise the army as they went for supplies.<br>
Sure enough the boys got there just ahead of the Orc's. Kesimar couldn't believe his eyes. Redwind was with them. <br>
&quot;Why would he leave the battle to attack supply runs. Kesimar wondered.<br>
No more then the question left his mind when it was answered. Redwind was enlisting the forces of Ox, the Goblins, to come to his aide. They were everywhere. Literally thousands of the green skin horde were dressed in battle mail and ready for death.<br>
Something needed to be done and done quickly. The boys knew that if they were unleashed now the army would be caught in the middle of two forces.<br>
&quot;May the winds of the Wolves carry us fast.&quot; the young Shaman began to chant.<br>
A strange tingling sensation came over Kesimar as his feet lifted only slightly from the ground. The feeling was awesome.<br>
&quot;Run. Warn the others. Go now.&quot; the Shaman yelled as he pointed to the hills.<br>
Kesimar couldn't believe how fast the ground and trees were whipping past him as he ran faster and faster towards the front line. What just took him and the young Shaman an hour to cover, Kesimar literally covered in 10 minutes. He would have to find out what sort of wizardry the Shaman class employed to create such a phenomenon. But he now was not the time, he needed to warn the others of the danger that was behind him.<br>
Kesimar spotted his old friend Tundra Jack and ran toward him.<br>
Jack saw him coming and knew something was wrong.<br>
&quot;Whats up Kes. You look like you saw a Specter?&quot; Jack asked.<br>
Kesimar launched into a barrage of information about what he saw and where they were.<br>
Jack quickly motioned for a Division Leader and told him what Kesimar had said. What Kesimar saw next was truly awe inspiring. The Division Leader vanished. One minute he was there the next he was gone. No sooner then he was gone he was back with 5 more men. Those men vanished and came back with 5 each. It only took 15 minutes and there was hundreds of new men on the battle field and ready for action.<br>
&quot;Show me where they are, Kesimar is it?&quot; the Division Leader motioned for Kesimar to show him where he came from.<br>
Kesimar crouched over the edge of the hill and motioned to the Division Leader, as he pointed towards the large camp of  Goblins.<br>
&quot; Kesimar you have brought pride to you Land. The people of Everfrost owe you their life.&quot; the Warrior behind him said with admiration in his voice. &quot;Now stand up and watch as this Ox scum is brought to their knees.&quot;<br>
The battle was nothing short of awesome. Single blows would send Goblin body parts sprawling into their fellow battle mates. They were clearly outmatched.<br>
The young Shaman spotted Kesimar and came running towards him.<br>
&quot;I was hoping you would return.&quot; he said with eager anticipation. &quot;My name is Timonor. Timonor Talias&quot;<br>
&quot;Kesimar. Pleasure to meet you fine Shaman.&quot; Kesimar said still in wonder of how this man before him had made his feet come from the ground.<br>
&quot;Look.&quot; Timonor said as he pointed to the base of the mountain.<br>
Redwind was running to the North. The battle was still fairly intense and the focus of the warriors was on the matter at hand. They wouldn't notice if a herd of wild Mammoths ran behind them, let alone a single Orc escaping form the thick of things.<br>
Kesimar look at Timonor and was suprised to see the same look of bloodlust in his counterparts eyes. Today would be the day they would remeber for the rest of their lives. A friendship was born.<br>
Both boys got to their feet and headed off in the direction of Redwind. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Redwind's tracks were easy to follow in the fresh snow. He was moving quickly towards the River and the tracks showed he was running fast.<br>
Kesimar had never been on the other side of the River and for good reason. The East side of the River belonged to Ox and her minions. The name Ox, alone could make women faint and grown men piss their pants. <br>
Ox is a Dragon who is nearly 3000 years old. She is what legends are made of and many graveyards full of dead mens bones who dared to lift some of her treasure. The biggest problem is her minions are enormous Giants made of Ice. They guard her lair and are not forgiving of those who venture to close, even if it was by mistake that you were there.<br>
As Kesimar and Timonor crested the bank they could see that the warmth of Spring had opened places in the ice on the river. They would have to be careful so as to not fall in. That surely would be a quick death.<br>
Redwind was nearly across the span of the river before the boys took there first step out onto the ice. Just the weight of the two together made the ice creak and groan. The two looked at each other and knew they wouldn't be able to cross the river together.<br>
&quot;I'll go first.&quot; Timonor said. &quot;I will keep and eye out for him&quot;<br>
There was no argument from Kesimar. It wasn't that he was scared to cross the river, nor was he scared of falling through the ice, but he was scared of the unknown that lie on the opposite bank. After all they were chasing Redwind into Ice Giant territory. What if Redwind had enlisted the Mighty forces of Ox somehow?<br>
&quot;Snap out of it.&quot; Kesimar said to himself. The idea was too much to bear and he needed to concentrate on the matters at hand.<br>
Both made it across the ice safely, but clearly with their hearts in their throats. Timonor was thinking the same as Kesimar but could control his thoughts a bit better then Kesimar.<br>
&quot;You ok bud, you look a little sick.&quot; Timonor asked.<br>
&quot;Umm, yeah I am ok just a little nervous.&quot; Kesimar understated.<br>
Timonor began rubbing his hands together faster and faster and then placed one hand on Kesimars forehead and said &quot;May Tunare give you the Spirit of the Bear.&quot;<br>
It was as if a rush of courage filled Kesimars soul. This Shaman was truly amazing. Kesimar looked at Timonor for a moment in wonder until Timonor pointed up the hill and brought Kesimar back to his senses.<br>
They picked up Redwinds trail again and Kesimar couldn't help but let a sigh or relief out due to the fact Redwind wasn't headed towards the Castle of Ox but rather to the Theatrics Platform, a covered stage for the performing arts.<br>
The boys proceeded with extreme caution as they approached the stage. Rewdind was standing in the center of the stage talking to himself.<br>
The boys looked at each other as if to say &quot;Who is he talking to?&quot;<br>
Kesimar's new found courage was hard to control. He wanted to run onto the stage and confront his parents killer and run a dagger through his heart. But it was as if a hand was placed on his shoulder forcing him to stay where he was.<br>
The boys quietly conversed about what they should do and finally came up with a plan.<br>
Timonor would distract Redwind and get him to come in the direction of Timonor and then Kesimar would sneak up behind him and run his dagger deep into Redwinds back and hope that he delivered a killing blow.<br>
Timonor didn't like this idea much. There was too much at stake, namely his life and his new friends life. He was in the business to save lives not take them. But he understood that Kesimar wasn't about to back down so he would oblige to this insane plan, against his best judgement.<br>
Timonor certainly got more then he bargained for by getting the attention of Redwind. The life literally could be seen sucked from Timonors body as he convulsed and fell to the ground. Redwind approached the boy and laughed at the fallen body.<br>
Kesimars fear turned to rage as he approached Redwind. The pure callousness of this monster. &quot;You will pay.&quot; Kesimar said as he swung his arm back to drive the dagger deep. Suddenly he went black and collapsed to the ground. <br>
&quot;Get....off of me&quot; Timonor could be heard saying. As he pushed Kesimar off his legs.<br>
Kesimar groaned as he felt himself being rolled over. The pain was intense. His head pounded as his consciousness started to come back to him.<br>
They were alive. &quot;Why.&quot; As Kesimar looked around he saw he was still at the base of the stage and Timonor was there too.<br>
As Kesimars eyes came into focus he could see two other people standing near Timonor.<br>
Suddenly, Kesimars focus came back and his head cleared of the pain. <br>
&quot;That should help.&quot; a strange voice said as a young man approached Kesimar. &quot;You guys are lucky to be alive. If we had not come along when we did you probably wouldn't be.&quot;<br>
&quot;Introductions are in order. My name is Crakenskul and this is my wizard friend Glydon.&quot; the young barbarian said with confidence.<br>
&quot;Kesimar, and thank you for being there at the right time.&quot; Kesimar said with gratitude. He knew he should be dead.<br>
&quot;Timonor&quot; Timonor said and added &quot;I owe you my life fellow Shaman. May Tunare bless your healing hands.&quot;<br>
&quot;Let's get away from here before Redwind decides we were not a threat after all.&quot; Glydon said with a bit of laughter in his voice.<br>
The four together set out in the direction of Halas. Truly happy to be alive. Kesimar knew the power of friends, but until this day, he never understood the value of friends. These four would grow inseparable. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Growing up with friends and developing his skills was more than Kesimar ever thought was possible. So many things have happened since that fateful day that these friends met up with each other.<br>
The mighty army that came in to eradicate the hordes of Orcs and the Mighty Redwind were fairly successful in bringing order back to the lands of Everfrost.<br>
The town of Halas spent many days showing there gratitude to all who fought so valiantly for their freedom. The shelves and cabinets in all the shops were virtually wiped clean from all the activity. <br>
This gave Kesimar ample opportunity to learn some valuable skills with his new found friends.<br>
Timonor and Crakenskul were very adept at their Shaman arts of healing and at using many different forms of magical arts to accomplish so many wonderful things.<br>
Kesimar found himself standing there in awe as his two friends found new ways of bringing down bear, cat, and occasional wooly mammoth calf to their knees.<br>
Kesimar got to see first hand, the power that the Erudite Wizards possessed. His friend Glydon was so often pointing his hands in the direction of the creature they were attempting to bring down and let loose a mighty arch of energy from his palm and literally fry the life right out of it.<br>
So many times they had to tell him to dial it back a bit so they could use the hides for tailoring. If they didn't, they could actually cut chunks of the beast they just slayed and eat it fully cooked due to the amount of firepower he had.<br>
As a group they did well. Everyone seemed to be well cared for. They all had good weapons and items to use. Their bellies were always full and their spirits high. Life was definitely good.<br>
Kesimar was feeling down one particular day. This day no different really than any other, but he was feeling blue so he decided to go hang out at the little store near the bank.<br>
&quot;Maybe a little fresh milk and some fish rolls would snap me out of my funk.&quot; Kesimar thought to himself. &quot;And Cappi's always good for a laugh.&quot;<br>
Cappi was a large man who always had a story to tell. Some adventure to spin for those who would listen to him. Most knew these stories to be a bit farfetched but they were entertaining all the same. <br>
Kesimar always wondered what sort of business Cappi was in but never really had an opportunity to ask.<br>
Cappi was sitting at the table, with his back to the door, out behind the merchant bank, when Kesimar walked through the door.<br>
&quot;Hey Kid&quot; Cappi said. &quot;Whats up.&quot;<br>
Kesimar could never quite figure out how he did that. It seemed that you could never sneak up on Cappi without him knowing you were there.<br>
Kesimar figured he would ask Cappi today what he did for work. It should be entertaining anyway.<br>
&quot;Want some fish rolls Kid?&quot; Cappi asked politely as he pushed the heaping plate towards Kesimar.<br>
Kesimar didn't hesitate. These were so good, Kesimar felt he could eat these every day if given the opportunity.<br>
&quot;What do you do for work Cap?&quot; Kesimar asked with his mouthful.<br>
The birds stopped singing and the surroundings got deathly quiet.<br>
Cappi leaned forward and looked straight into Kesimars eyes and stared at him for what seemed to be a full two minutes without saying anything. Kesimar didn't blink.<br>
Cappi slid his chair closer to Kesimar and sat back and said. &quot;Kid, You don't need to know.&quot;<br>
&quot;What. What do you mean I don't need to know?&quot; Kesimar thought to himself. &quot;what kind of answer is that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hummmph&quot; Kesimar blurted out. &quot;You don't want to tell me, whatever.&quot;<br>
Cappi couldn't help but to laugh out loud at Kesimars tenacity. He would be perfect for the job Cappi had in mind.<br>
&quot;Kid. Do you think you could get me a necklace off of that Goblin in the fork and bring it back here to me?&quot; Cappi asked with a gleam in his eye.<br>
Kesimar couldn't believe what he was hearing. Cappi wanted him to steal from the Goblins. Cappi was a thief.<br>
&quot;Cool&quot; Kesimar thought to himself.<br>
Before Kesimar could speak, Cappi leaned in and said. &quot;Without getting caught.&quot;<br>
Kesimar grinned, immediately lifted out of his depression, he was up and out the door before anyone could say anything further. This was going to be awesome. The adrenaline that flowed through his veins was better then any Shaman magic could offer.<br>
Kesimar descended down the ramp and out into the mass network of mountain passes of Everfrost. He reached up his sleeve and felt the familiar hilt of his fathers dagger. <br>
It didn't take him long to find the camp the Cappi was talking about.<br>
Three igloos built at the base of the mountains. Both ends of the valley provided good cover for Kesimar to sneak almost up to the back part of the first igloo.<br>
Kesimar could hear some activity from inside the igloo. He knew he would have to wait until it got darker before he could sneak any closer.<br>
&quot;How great it would be to be able to disappear.&quot; Kesimar thought.<br>
As he thought that very thought he faded out of sight, completely disappearing.<br>
&quot;What in the name of Tunare?&quot; Timonor muttered to himself.<br>
Timonor had followed his friend to see what he was up to in such a hurry. Now he couldn't believe his eyes. Kesimar vanished into thin air.<br>
His thoughts couldn't wander for too long when Timonor heard a brutal war cry and was snapped back to full consciousness.<br>
&quot;What just happened?&quot; Timonor asked himself. &quot;Where is Kes?&quot;<br>
It was to dark for Timonor to see Kesimar running in the opposite direction away from the igloo. It was probably in Timonors benefit that he didn't see Kesimar.<br>
Kesimar took the Goblin by total surprise and actually had the necklace off before the Goblin realized what was happening. The Goblin immediately lunged for his blade and let out the war cry to alert the others of the intruder. He never made it to his blade. Kesimar drew his dagger across the throat of the Goblin and dropped him to the ground. Not so much as a struggle ensued, Kesimars blade had struck the death blow.<br>
As Kesimar slowed his pace he couldn't help but feel alive. His conscience pricked him a bit for taking the life of that Goblin but not enough to make him feel guilty. He opened his bloodstained hand to see the prize he was after. The crystals gleamed in the dim light and reflected the outline of the moon back into Kesimars bloodlust eyes.<br>
Timonor was shocked. His friend just murdered a Goblin. Now there was no love loss for the Goblin race but still, &quot;what would cause his friend to cold bloodlessly murder a Goblin.&quot; His friend was uncontrollable, unpredictable, and worst of all a cold blooded murderer.<br>
He couldn't help but think how great Kesimar would be in a tough spot. But could he ever turn his back on his friend? If he did what would happen? He didn't ever want to find out for his friend was a Rogue. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Chapter 7<br>
Kesimar perfected his new found craft rather quickly. It didn't take him long to find new ways of sneaking up on people, animals, creatures without then ever knowing he was there. He could dip into their money pouch and lift a few coins or some trinket without them ever knowing it was gone.<br>
His ability to kill creatures twice his size, skin them and be back to killing the next animal was becoming an art form. What would take a normal man days to collect, Kesimar would bring home to Kathrine, in one afternoon.<br>
Kesimar hid his talents well. He didn't want the label of a thief or worse yet a Rogue. But secretly Kesimar loved his choice to be a Rogue.<br>
Timonor, Glydon, and Crakenskul were true friends. They didn't question Kesimars choices. They knew he had a hard life and at least he was happy.<br>
One afternoon Timonor decided he needed to have a talk with Kesimar to see what steps Kesimar would take to get his desires under control.<br>
Timonor knew where to find his friend. Kesimar was always hunting on the Tundra just outside the guard post from his Uncle Bandl.<br>
&quot;Hey Bud!&quot; Kesimar said as Timonor walked up behind him.<br>
Timonor had this happen too many times for him to even wonder how Kesimar knew he was there.<br>
&quot;Yo Kes. How's the hunting?&quot; Timonor asked with his usual cheerful demeanor.<br>
&quot;A little slow today.&quot; Kesimar replied. &quot;I might need to find a new hunting spot.&quot;<br>
&quot;Follow me. I know the perfect spot.&quot; Timonor motioned for Kesimar to follow.<br>
They traveled about a mile to the south. As the young men crowned the top of the rather large hill Timonor pointed to a small mountain like outcropping in the middle of the valley.<br>
&quot;You can see everything from there.&quot; Timonor said somewhat out of breath.<br>
There was wild life every where. Large bears, snow leopards, mammoth calves, and the much sought after giant wooly spiders.<br>
Kesimar followed Timonor down the hill in direction of their new hunting grounds. They set up camp and proceeded to scout for things to kill. They were active for about 5 hours when Timonor stopped and looked out across the valley and saw what he came for. The Dark Assassin.<br>
Kesimar saw him too. He stopped skinning the leopard and sat there watching this person slink across the valley floor.<br>
&quot;Who is that?&quot; Kesimar asked.<br>
&quot;That is the Dark Assassin. A ruthless killer who was exiled from his home. &quot; Timonor said with a hinting tone of Shaman preaching.<br>
&quot;It was said that as a young man, the Dark Assassin, lost his mind and killed his family. Parents, siblings, and neighbors all brutally murdered. One day he was fine and the next he just flipped out. No one knows really why.&quot; Timonor explained.<br>
&quot;When the authorities came in to take him to the gallows, he disappeared. Vanished without a trace. He would pop up now and again in town after town only to disappear again.&quot; Timonor further explained.<br>
&quot;Twenty years later he just wanders out here, kills what he needs, and doesn't bother anyone. That is unless he is bothered.&quot; Timonor shuddered as he said that.<br>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Kesimars interest piqued.<br>
&quot;It is said that he can take 10 men down without even blinking. His dagger is so fast that most don't have a chance to draw their sword before they are dead.&quot; Timonor said in a hushed tone.<br>
&quot;Cool.&quot; Kesimar said with a bit too much admiration in his voice.<br>
This gave Timonor the opportunity to say something. Something he had wanted to say for a while now.<br>
&quot;Promise me something Bud?&quot; Timonor started. &quot;Promise me you will never take another life without good cause.&quot;<br>
Kesimar knew his friend was genuine in his request. His conscience pricked him for the death of the Goblin a few months back. At this moment and he knew his friend was right.<br>
&quot;I promise I will not take a life unless it is necessary.&quot; Kesimar said with heartfelt intent.<br>
&quot;Let us make a pact on this ground we are standing, to never take a life in vain.&quot; Timonor pronounced. &quot;We will call this ground &quot;TimKes Mountain&quot; Land of Life and all that is Holy.&quot;<br>
Kesimar would go home that night with a new belief. Being a Rogue didn't mean he would have to disregard life in order to do what he loved, but he would never take a life with out due cause.<br>
This would not always prove to be an easy choice for Kesimar. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

That evening Kesimar left that hillside with his friend with a new resolve and he felt good about the fact that he had a friend who cared about him as much as Timonor did, but he could help the black mood that was slowly taking over his mood and actions on a daily sometimes hourly event.<br>
He loved his extended family, especially Kathrine. After all she was the closest thing that he would ever get to a mother, but the burning anger and the constant seeking for revenge consumed him. Many around him began to notice the cloud that seemed to follow him everywhere.<br>
Cappi, even as callused as he could be was fully aware of the condition of his brightest and most talented student, was in. He would make a point to find Kesimar and see if he couldn't help him channel the anger he was feeling.<br>
Cappi found Kesimar in his favorite place, chewing on a piece of bear jerky, looking out over the Arena. Cappi decided to watch for a moment before disturbing his young pupil. <br>
Kesimar threw his canteen far into the middle of the Arena, reached into his sleeve and produced a rather wicked looking dagger. Not the one that belonged to his father, but rather a new stiletto blade that Cappi had never seen. With the speed of a leopard after it prey, Kesimar threw the blade with blinding accuracy at his fallen canteen. The blade struck with such precision that even Cappi had to look twice to see that it had gone directly through the middle  and impaled the canteen to the Arena floor.<br>
Kesimar sat there, staring at his mark, and grunted with mild amusement. &quot;What's up Cappi?&quot; Kesimar said without moving his eyes of his target.<br>
&quot;Impressive.&quot; Cappi said quietly, knowing full well that a direct compliment for such skill would have only brought Kesimar to withdraw from any form of conversation.<br>
&quot;I want you to do something for me.&quot; Cappi said with a little questioning in his tone. &quot;But I am not sure you can handle it.&quot;<br>
That kind of challenge always brought out the fire in the kid before him and he was hoping Kesimar would take the bait.<br>
Kesimar flashed his eyes in the direction of Cappi and he waited for his mentor to continue.<br>
&quot;I need you to go to the Oasis for me and get me some of their scrolls. The Gypsies camp is the only place that has them. They will not sell them to you so you are going to have to use other means to acquire them.&quot; Cappi said with a lightness in his voice that kesimar knew full well meant he would have to steal them.<br>
Oasis was pretty far from Halas. Almost on the other side of the continent. The land in between full of danger and peril.<br>
&quot;How soon do you need them&quot; Kesimar asked quickly<br>
&quot;Now&quot; Cappi said as if he meant yesterday. But he knew full well that he didn't need them at all, but if he gave any hesitation he knew his student wouldn't take the hint that he needed to go immediately.<br>
Kesimar ran to the center of the Arena, scooped up his stiletto, and cleared the bottom row of steps, before he turned and said to Cappi, &quot;How many do you want?&quot;<br>
Before Cappi could answer, Kesimar said &quot;Nevermind I will get the good ones.&quot;  Flashed Cappi a smile and ran off.<br>
Kesimar never went home before doing a task for Cappi. He didn't want the standard lecture Kathrine always gave him about the choices Kesimar needs to make about who he hung around with and what activity he would chose to do on a daily basis.<br>
Kesimar knew she didn't approve of his way of life, but he just couldn't find satisfaction any other way for the pain that he felt in his heart.<br>
He knew that Cappi would tell her that he would be gone for a while and not to worry about him.<br>
Kathrine always did worry. After all this was the closest thing she would ever have to a son and she loved the boy more then she would ever care to admit to anyone, including Kesimar.<br>
Cappi wanted someone he trusted to keep an eye out for Kesimar. This trip would prove to be very dangerous and he wasn't sending Kesimar out there for scrolls but rather something to take his mind off of his troubles. He would call on his old and trusted friend Tibeduex, to follow behind Kesimar and make sure he didn't get in over his head. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Kesimar loved Black Burrow. The smell of the mist rising from the huge waterfall, mixed with the aroma of the brewing spices and alcohol that the Gnoll inhabitants made here, was nothing short of intoxicating.<br>
One of the biggest problems is the Gnolls felt everyone was evil and those that visited the Burrow was trying to steal the sacred Stout recipe, when usually was the case most adventurers just wanted a sip of that sweet stout nectar.<br>
Kesimar contemplated taking the secret entrance down into the brewery but though against it today. He was on a mission and he couldn't waste time here, even if he was more then welcome to, once he was out of the possible passerby eyes. The Gnolls loved Kesimar and took him in as their own. The knew his father well and felt responsible for the tragic death of Kesimars parents.<br>
Brewer Tranix was especially fond of Kesimar and was curious why the boy wouldn't stop to see him. It just so happened that Tranix was up on the ledge this afternoon when he saw Kesimar sneak by on the ledge below him, skirting the open pit that was carved by years of the massive waterfall. The boy must be after something and it must be important. Just the fact that the boy hadn't stopped was more then enough of a reason for Tranix to follow him, but the curiosity of what the boy could be after was more then he could handle.<br>
Outside the Burrow, Gnolls were hunted for their pelts, and the possibility that they maybe carrying some of their famous stout. Many a gnoll has been slain for no other reason then they were Gnolls. <br>
Tranix didn't disregard this when he decided to track the boy, but the nagging feeling he should was more then compensating for the possible peril that might lie out there past the Burrows entrance.<br>
Kesimar was quick and light on his feet. <br>
Tibeduex would have to be alert and move quickly as well or lose the boy across the Plains. One of the biggest problems was the Plains didn't offer much in the way of cover. He hoped Kesimar would be focused on the goal of getting to his destination and not look back to many times to see if he missed soemthing. But once he knew he was followed, Tibeduex knew Kesimar would all but vanish.<br>
Tranix made his way through the hidden cave and was waiting above the entrance of the cave when Kesimar emerged. He admired the way Kesimar moved. Fluid like a cat, but with the confidence of a mighty warrior. Tranix knew he too would have to be careful not to insult Kesimar by letting him know he was watching out for him. <br>
Tranix had something few others had and that was the ability to track based on scent alone. So he would give Kesimar a good head start before he would follow. Tranix could count on his acute hearing as well to alert him of any sounds of distress that may befall his friends son.<br>
About 5 minutes had passed and Tranix was about to get up from his vantage point when he heard the distinct sound of footsteps coming through the cave. A warrior well know to many in the North emerged from the entrance only a few feet below where Tranix was hiding. <br>
The sheer sight of such a fearsome warrior sent the short hairs on Tranix neck standing to attention. The Gnoll Wars brought many a story back about Mighty Warriors like this one, who slaughtered many a Gnoll in a single campaign. Tranix would have to keep his eyes out, for if there is one Warrior in the Hills, there would be more. <br>
He loved his friend, and by extension the boy, but this would prove to test the abilities of Tranix to keep one eye on the boy and one out for the Warrior, who would lop off his head without thinking twice and probably wear his aged hide on his shoulders to break the morning chill.<br>
Tranix noted that the Warrior was following the same path as Kesimar. &quot;<br>
Was he there to harm the boy? Was he sent on some kidnapping mission? Was he a slave trader looking for an easy mark?&quot; Tranix thought to himself.<br>
&quot; I will need to follow closer to make sure this Warrior won't get the chance to overcome Kesimar without at least a brief but ferocious battle from me.&quot; Tranix thought as he shuddered from the mental picture of him against the mighty warrior. .<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The morning air was crisp as cool. The sun was just over the edge of the foot hills of the Northern Mountains. The grass was damp from the dew that had accumulated from the evenings cool wind. <br>
Kesimar loved the smell of the huge pines that bordered the canyon leading into the western plains. The canyon was still cool but very refreshing.<br>
Kesimar spotted a strange fellow who was reading from some scroll. The man looked to be about 30 and was wearing some sort of priest garb.<br>
&quot;Great&quot; Kesimar thought grumbling to himself. &quot;Some freak out here in the early morning preaching to the frogs.&quot;<br>
Kesimar didn't feel like hearing about the sins he committed nor wanted to discuss the philosophy of the Mighty Karana. As he looked for an alternate route he knew he had been seen. After all there really wasn't any place Kesimar could go and this Preacher knew it,<br>
&quot;Repent Brother!!! and walk in the way of the Mighty Karana.&quot; the preacher man shouted at the top of his lungs in the direction of Kesimar.<br>
&quot;You there. Yes you, Sinner! Come before me so I can exercise the evil that lie deep in your soul.&quot; the preacher man yelled at Kesimar.<br>
Kesimar veered away from the senile preacher and then darted quickly towards the man and grabbed him unexpectedly by the collar and forced him against the sole tree on the path.<br>
&quot;What did you call me?&quot; Kesimar hissed.<br>
The man went white and urinated on Kesimar's feet as he feinted.<br>
Kesimar dropped him with disgust as he felt the urine soak through his leather boot.<br>
&quot;Enough of this&quot; Kesimar thought as he took off on the path toward the Tower in the distance.<br>
Tibedeux chuckled at the sight he just witnessed. He knew Kesimar wouldn't harm the Priest and only wanted to scare him. But he was suprised at the quickness in which the boy had in taking the preacher by surprise. He wasn't sure if Kesimar had killed him or not and he leaned into the Preacher man he knew to be Brother Estle and checked his neck for a pulse. When he saw that Brother Estle was breathing he noticed the strong smell of urine and quietly chuckled to himself.<br>
Kesimar noticed that wildlife abound here in the Western Plains. Lions a plenty.  An occasional wolf could be seen running from the nearby farms, and Kesimar swore he saw the much feared Grizzly as he made his way from the edge of the pine trees.<br>
Needless to say Kesimar picked up the pace towards the Guard Tower. One thing he knew better was not to tangle with the Grizzly. Death would sure follow quickly if one tried to take one on by himself.<br>
The Tower proved to be a good place for Kesimar to take up breakfast. His dried bear meat and fresh muffins he pilfered from the vender in Halas before he left made for a good meal.<br>
&quot;Where you headed son?&quot; the Guard asked as he looked down from his perch.<br>
&quot;High Pass.&quot; Kesomar said knowing full well that this man represented the law and if he ignored him he would make things real tough for him to continue.<br>
&quot;What business do you have there?&quot; the guard asked.<br>
&quot;What is it to you?&quot; Kesimar thought to himself. &quot;Visiting relatives there.&quot; Kesimar said quickly as he put a coy smile on his face.<br>
&quot;Ah well good travels to you then.&quot; the Guard said with a smile on his face.<br>
Kesimar knew that these guys spent many long months out in the towers and family was important to them. They would leave him be at the mere mention of the word family.<br>
Kesimar knew better then to try to extend his rest here for fear that the guard would want to become chatty and ask who he was visiting in High Pass. This guy probably knew everyone there. By the  perverted looks of him probably been with everyone there.<br>
Kesimar wanted to stray from the path but was quickly brought back to his senses when he saw the outline of a Hill Giant looming on the horizon. The river seemed to attract them. Kesimar thought it must be for the easy pillaging of the constant boat merchants who traffic their goods up and down the river.<br>
He heard stories about the wealth some possessed and silently thought to himself there will be a day when I will be able to sneak up to those stupid dorfs and steal them blind without so much as a scratch.<br>
He had a long way to go so he didn't spend much time watching the Giant lumber along the shore. He knew more dangers lie ahead. The roads were pretty well traveled but he knew once he got to the Easter side of the Plains there would be more bandits, packs of wild dogs, and the mythical Griffon laying in wait for the unaware traveler.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
