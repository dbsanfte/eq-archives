First of all, none of those countries are our enemies... second of all Japan doesnt have nuclear weapons, they dont even have an army... they have more of a &quot;national guard&quot; but not big enough to do anything other than maybe conquer the bahamas =D That is why the US military is in Japan, because one of the terms of their surrender in WWII was they werent allowed to keep a large standing army anymore.<br>

My friend, if you think ANY war is started or joined without Ultirior motives, American, Auro, Asian, Nigerian, then you are sadly mistaken.

Look at Eastern Europe. Compare the wealth and prosperity of the Western European countries and the ones who were assimilated by communism. @#%$, look at North and South Korea, look at how South Korea is one of the most tech advanced nations, while the people in the North are busy wondering where their next meal is coming from. Look at China compared to Hong Kong before it became Chinese again... where was all the money being made and spent? Look at Cuba pre-1957... it was a rich country, people lived well, with even common people partying and living well, now, the coffee is cut with chick peas, because there is no coffee, and the bread is made of oats, and its hard as a rock, I remember we used to play baseball with the bread, and it was baked THAT DAY!<br>

BTW: Bush DID NOT IGNORE THE UN when he decided to bomb Iraq, The United Nations resolution authorized force if Iraq did not withdrawl from Kuwait by midnight of January 15,th 1991.

no, i was simply implying that the country they defend, the nation they feel national pride in belonging to, might not be that sweet after all.

i AM grateful to the american nation for their actions during the wwII. i believe (numbers may be incorrect, but i gasped when i first read the numbers cause they were big) they gave 80 THOUSEND airplanes to russia, 13 THOUSEND tanks. without this machinery, russia would have done it the old fashion way with the scorched earth policy (learnt that translation in a different thread here hihi) and nobody would win. well, we can only imagine anyway.<br>

thats kinda the point with communism, but where u had to bite the dust..another family would be happy instead of miserable. it all equals out in a grey boring median, IF it worked out. but since people are individuals, with individual interests, communism is a paradox. same thing goes for anarchy. or even democracy. i think we need an extra 300 years or so, with wars and great lessons about life, to REALLY understand the meaning of democracy. :/<br>

'91..must have been the gulf war?<br>
<br>
this is 10 years later. this is another war, or maybe an extension of the gulf war, based on the same malice usa and iraq bears to eachother. but the UN did not approve bush to bomb iraq last week (its going on already). this was an internal voting amongst his people.

edit:<br>
<br>
take a look at the movie HART'S WAR! greatly underrated. ok, a lot of honor bullsh!t in the end, but its a VERY interesting view of the WWII. i like movies which are real - the evil maffia boss would kill a &quot;hero&quot; in one scene, but kiss his daughter in the next. this way, the different aspect/faces we all have delivers. nobody is 100% evil. so in hart's war, you meet a nazi captain whoms looks you HATE in the beginning. looks kinda like the emperor in star wars - the perfect face for evil actions. the perfect face to aim your hatred at.<br>
but as the movie rolls on, you get to learn this man as just another man.. with family, a great interest in 'negro blues'..offering the captured british captain a whisky and some blues! but when it comes to the daily routine at the that camp - he is as harsch as before. he is *professional*, not evil.<br>
<br>
very interesting movie, if it wasnt for the bravery and honor crap in the end. and the black aspect of the movie full of moral and ethics. lets just keep it real, shall we? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
     Here's my advice to you:  forget everything you think you know about American history and start over.    Start with the America Rock section of School House rock, it seems to be on your grade level.  You'll get a good idea of the principles behind our founding, which, by the way, were copied LATER by many European nations.    <br>

I know that sounds ridiculous but just hang with me here for a few.<br>
<br>
We are all as a rule, loyal to our guild. We accept that our guild isn't perfect, our leadership makes mistakes, and generally there are several rather large dicks in the guild who make some bad bad judgement calls. And yet we stand by them nonetheless because they are our guildy's. Ponder on that a bit.<br>
<br>
Now granted my own argument is partly reduced because you can join and leave guilds at any time it pleases you and its often not the case with guilds. However, I think that once you take a look back you begin to realize some things. Guilds who have done infamous misdeeds in the past, say the ganking of VS by Relentless Ascension, is it really fair to hold that sort of thing against current members of FE? By EQ standards its ancient history.<br>
<br>
By the same token, why should I be held accountable for segregation and slavery when it ended when my parents were still in diapers? From my point of view segregation is laughably dead and it irritates me when I see someone going on about it since I can honestly it just doesn't happen in my part of the US. Might not be true of the entire US, but its true on my part.<br>
<br>
Also Kreket, to address some errors you have made regarding US history. A good chunk of the initial colonizers of this country were indeed deeply religious, however, not all of them were and indeed most of the original colonies were founded because of pissing matches between various European powers and for the earning of revenue through Tabbacco and Cotton.<br>
<br>
The South was where slavery was accepted, in the Northern areas it was rejected and indeed there were many underground organizations that were helping slaves escape into the parts of the country where they could be free long before the Civil War came.<br>
<br>
America split itself in two and fought a long bloody war principally over the issue of slavery. Show me another country that got rid of slavery through a civil war.<br>
<br>
The South was actually hurt by the dependence on slaver ownership, and made poorer than the average Northerner becasue of it. When the slaves were taken away the economy was of the South was crippled.<br>
<br>
When they were freed many slaves VOLOUNTARILY stayed at their masters plantations becasue believe it or not the slaves were generally not treated very badly. In some cases of course, but in general, not badly. White slaves in the south were often looked upon in pity by black slaves.<br>
<br>
America donates per capita more to international charity than any other nation, none can even compete. You'r not likely to find a more generous group of people. We also do enjoy a lifestyle most can only dream of and believe it or not we realize that and do our best to help those in need.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, you will have a different outlook on potential preventative wars than we will. Lets face it, the world genreally hates America. Why? Well, why is there so much unfounded hatred of FE? Think on that.<br>
<br>
Were top dog and we know it, and there is no way we could ever do enough to make anyone happy, let alone everyone. You have one incident with a stupid American tourist and it just gets chalked up to the dumb American sterotype. You have one incident with a stupid French tourist and it gets generall ignored. Why? People like sterotypes and they like to have a common place to vent their frustration on, and a common place to blame things on. This place is becoming America.<br>
<br>
Our coat tails aren't clean but people still focus on all the negative things in our past. Yet when we pont out the positive things they conveniantly ignore, we are just being arrogant. The past is the past, accept it for what it is. Don't go trying to nitpick for either side of an argument if you are ignoring the other. <br>
<br>
CNN is crappy news and we Americans know so, there are much better places to get news but you don't see them on international TV, CNN is just the most watched becasue of the marketing machine behind it and gets the most attention.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I love my country, despite itself. <p>&quot;For a day I had my dream. And on that day, it was my duty to end that dream.&quot;<br>

you are top dog and you know it, yes. but you also act like you know it. thats one thing that bothers people about usa.<br>

- drop food over africa on the same time children in iraq are killed by american bombs.<br>
<br>
- the whole israel thing with usa paying for israeli weapons, supporting the deaths of innocents, regardless your point of view. i see perfectly well why palestines hate america here.<br>
<br>
- &quot;because america says so&quot; f.e. the stuff in israel. why are the israeli people more entitled that piece of land? you can babbel all u like about tora scrolls, koran or holy bibles, but in the end its all comes down to &quot;because america says so&quot;.<br>

By the way Kreket, no one here has denied the existance of slavery, rascism, or any of the other crimes you accuse us of. we all recognize those as part of our past. we are all taught about those in school at a very young age. <br>
<br>
what we refuse to do is allow you to tell us our country sucks becuase we have done things in our past that are shameful and attrocities against humanity. so no Yen was not the first to admit to any hypocricy or slavery being bad, i think everyone who has replied to you acknowldeged that. <br>
<br>
they may not have said, &quot;your right we suck&quot;, but they didnt deny the events as being factual either. no one said, BS we never owned slaves what are you talking about? no one said, Blacks have always recieved fair treatment in america had two elected president.<br>
<br>
in fact had you just stated your opinions on crimes we've committed in our past im sure youd find many people agreeing with you, that we've done things wrong before, and probably will again in other situations. however you started a flame war against america and we responded. <p>DESEPCHUN &lt;BR&gt;EXILED PRINCE OF ERUDIN&lt;BR&gt;Forever Exiled Elite&lt;BR&gt;Member of the EXILED GATEKEEPERS</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreket>Kreket</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fimble Adorer</span><br>  Posts: 1177<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/2/02 7:47:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=175>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> oh ripert. *hug*<br>

<br>
&quot;slavery was abolished in 1863&quot;<br>
<br>
yeah right? thats like saying sweden had a general voting right in the 16th century just cause a king proposed it! fact is, black people have been treated like slaves as far as into the 60's. and even today you have your ghettos.<br>
as said earlier, instead of putting millions of dollars on an attack against iraq, a better thing to do would be to clean up them ghettos! but then again..if this is about oil, the best thing FINANCIALLY to do would be to crush iraq and take their oil. but i dont think russia will agree with that since they have invested billions of dollars in the iraqian oil.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;why should I be held accountable for segregation and slavery when it ended when my parents were still in diapers?&quot;<br>
<br>
i think its every citizens duty to work against segregation. if all shared the opinion of the author here, progression would stop completely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;japan should be grateful that we dropped an atom bomb instead of launching an attack on ground&quot;<br>
<br>
this is another topic arright, but this line has been haunting me ever since. how could anyone possibly justify the atom bomb? anyways, i take it this line was written by an idiot - the kinda idiot u see in ricki lake. the PERFECT idiot to focus ur deprecation on.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways, i feel that most people here avoid confrontation with my* questions/accusations. if i claim that america had slavery, they would simply answer with &quot;you had too!&quot;. if i* brought up the voting rights, they would refer to my vikings, completely ignoring the foundation and meaning of america, which was kinda the issue here - utopia.<br>
<br>
<br>
havent had a reply here for weeks tho, so ive kinda forgot the discussion anyway. shall we let it die?<br>

you cant equate being OWNED, in a literal sense, to having to drink out of seperate fountains. when someone has the right to drag you out in the middle of town and beat you til your head pops like a watermellon and no one notices becuase your that mans property, then your a slave. when someone tells you that you have to sit in the back of the bus becuase your black, then your a black man suffering from social ignorances and irrational hatred. very big differance.<br>
<br>
ill bet dollars to doughnuts that given a choice between which of those two lives to lead 9 out of 10 blacks would choose the back of the bus. the 10th would choose slavery just because hes one of those guys that has to go against social norms.<br>

Government and private industry spend millions of dollars a year around here. Right outside of downtown Miami, I mean, like 2 blocks, there is a ghetto called &quot;Overtown&quot; It is your average ghetto, no one wakes up untill noon, all drunk by three, selling crack on the sidewalk all day and night. Now, you are probably thinking &quot;Wow, Canna what an insensative thing to say...&quot; Well, let me tell you, my dad is an electrician, and during the summers from when I was 14 to when I was 17, I went to work with him every day.<br>
<br>
Most Ghettos are full of apartment buildings, housing projects, there are very few houses. Most of these apartments are government owned, and given to people in need. For 2 years, my dad had a shitload of big projects in Overtown, entire wiring from top to bottom, there was no wiring in the buildings, no switches, no outlets, no lamps. Down in the main trunk room, where the city power joins the building, there were no meters, no wires.<br>
<br>
The shocker? The building was only a few years old.<br>
<br>
You see, the crackheads take the stoves, the beds, the rug, the wires out of the wall, the pipes, the WINDOWS and they scrap them for crack money. I saw this every day for 3 months a year, same cycle every single day. They would gut entire buildings and still live in them... all that would be left was a soiled mattress and a bunch of little empty baggies and broken lighters. Sometimes you had to throw them out of their @#%$ up empty apartment to build the new ones.<br>
<br>
Sure there were good, honest, people in the ghetto, brought up well, humble, friendly. But their houses got ransacked too.<br>
<br>
Screw rebuilding the ghetto, why fix what the people you are fixing it for will destroy?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kreket>Kreket</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fimble Adorer</span><br>  Posts: 1181<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/2/02 3:11:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=179>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: clean up them ghettos huh?</span><hr size=1> canna, u are suggesting that they can only blame themselves for things being messed up out there. is it that simple, or do they have alternatives? what alternatives in your daily society would make a black man/woman from the ghetto with a criminal past progress, and give him/her a more human life, with the same possibilities as everyone else?<br>
<br>
where is the root of this problem - in their personalities or simply in the past which neglected them and forced them into this?<br>
<br>
i would say these &quot;crackheads&quot; have been drawn into their ways of making money, cause there simply arent many alternatives for them.<br>
<br>
a solution would be, as said, to clean up. pump in more money in those parts of your nation. put in higher security. dont, as you suggest between your lines, ignore them. after all, u brought them in.<br>
