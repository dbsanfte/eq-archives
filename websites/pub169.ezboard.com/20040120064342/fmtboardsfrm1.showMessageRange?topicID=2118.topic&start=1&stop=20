It was sudden, and while not fully unexpected, it was still unexpected.  One of the things that I found comfort in following her death for weeks and months, were people telling me their stories of Nana.  It didn't take away the pain, but it made me smile and laugh at times, and it helped greatly.<br>
<br>
So, in that spirit, I'm starting this thread. Post a memory you have of Eonwe (Kevin Whitaker).  On Friday, I'm going to print them out and mail them to his family, in care of his pastor, along with the links here, so they can read any new additions if they want.<br>
<br>
And...if you could, this isn't by any means an order, but for the sake of space, maybe leave out your signature, and just put your name, in game or real...up to you. <br>

I had never met a high level cleric before, and certainly never had drop one everything they were doing to come and help out a bunch of people they had never met. He was there, dragging our fallen bodies and casting that wonderful spell 'resurrection'. At the time I had never had it cast upon me, and from having seen comments of the hundreds of coins such services normally cost, was petrified that we were going to be presented with a horrible bill at the end - shows how little I knew of him (and of many high level clerics) back then. We tried giving him what little pennies we had to say thankyou, but he was having none of it. He just smiled, said 'no problem' and went on his way, leaving 40 very grateful and bemused dragon hunters to sit and talk about his deeds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Since then I've lost count of the number of times Eonwe happened to be passing and brought my sorry self back to life, not because we were members of his guild, or because we were friends per se. <br>
<br>
Did he ever ask for anything in return, no...Did he do it because it was on some ego trip, no...He was just that rare kind of person who helped because he could and always had a cheerful remark to hand.<br>
<br>
Is our little world diminished with his loss...yes.<br>
<br>
My profound condolences to his family, he will be sorely missed.<br>

a piece of me died too. </div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <br>
<br>
I knew Eonwe/Kevin thru Everquest from my early levels and I have to say if he was half as good as person in real life as he was online, he was one of the most lovable people you could meet in your life... Always friendly, kind and funny. Someone you did like to have around you 24/7 just because he could make you feel better no matter how down you were or how sad you felt. There are so many things I would like him to know, yet he will never get to hear them. If I just could get a 2nd chance to tell you how much I loved you as my (online) friend, I will never forget you. Once someone said everything happends for a reason.... God better had a very good reason for all this sorrow. Maybe he needed a new angel and picked you to become one in his realm, maybe...<br>
<br>
Your body may be dead, but your spirit will live on in our memories. I wish to become as good as you were, to get a chance to meet you one day again when my own life comes to an end.<br>
<br>
Farewell my friend, you will be greatly missed...<br>

For those that don't know, I server xfered to Morell on the recommendation of Lyissa about 2 weeks before Fury's Edge formed, I believe during late August of 01.  I didn't know E until we had formed up FE from RA and HF.<br>
<br>
So imagine my surprise when I see the first male high elf with a velious custom helm, and its that cat-hat...well I about lost it laughing, as I'd never seen it before.  Even now I can remember FE being quite upset when Eonwe was awarded a Halo dropped from Cazic-Thule because it signaled the loss of that hilarious headgear.<br>
<br>
The only other specific memory I have of Eonwe is his fanaticism with Dozekar the Cursed to finish off one of the quest items in TOV.  My god, every time someone would say &quot;What are we doing next?&quot; we'd get at LEAST 8 lines of &quot;DOZEKAR DOZEKAR DOZEKAR DOZEKAR!&quot;<br>
<br>
As I said, the rest I know from Eonwe are his countless jokes, his collections of funny tells, guildchat, and other things, and, most importantly, one of the best playstyles I have ever encountered.  Often I wished I could be as level-headed and calm as Eonwe, and still maintain the extreme skill he had for his class.<br>
<br>
I miss you so much already Eonwe...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tilluinmt>Tilluin mt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 574<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/16/03 11:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2118.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/phpBB2/images/avatars/gallery/Southpark/South_Park_-_Craig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: In memory of Eonwe</span><hr size=1> Eonwe was a legend I had heard about from my first days on Morell Thule.

On one of my earlier raids, to PoFear. We wiped horribly, Eonwe ran half way across Norrath to come and rez us. A truely selfless act, after that we talked a few times and he was a great laugh.<br>

<br>
I first met Eonwe ( Kevin ) when I was a newbie character in the world of Everquest. I had died and didn't know where my body was. I couldn't find it for the life of me and try as I may, I couldn't reach my corps. <br>
<br>
I checked around for someone to help me but no help was to be found. I got a strange /tell from someone who I had never met before. Eonwe.. a level 55 cleric was passing through the zone I was in and heard me shouting for some help finding my corps. For 45 minutes he searched for my lifeless body and was finally able to find it for me and reserrect me. I was so thankful. I gave him what little money I had on me ( I think it was about 25pp ) He declined the trade but I insisted he take it for his payment for helping me. He finally took it after I insisted but he also buffed me up with his uber cleric buffs and went about his business. He would send me tells after that every so often asking how I was doing and wanting to know if I needed help. Very often he would pop into a zone I was in just to buff and heal me while I leveled. <br>
<br>
When I joined Triune, myself and Eonwe would talk and joke about our guilds, life and future plans. He would ask questions about work, college, the military as I was previously in the Army. We would joke about life in general, about Everquest, about other people we knew. Life was good. <br>
<br>
I found myself wanting more from EQ as a game and wanted to be with some of my friends who had moved to another guild within our little world of everquest. I wanted to advise on what I should do so I contacted Eonwe and my other cleric friend Xazy and both told me to follow my heart in what I should do. I soon after applied to Fury's Edge. Eonwe was very helpful in making me feel welcome and soon trained multiple mobs on me while I EXPed and then took screenshots and laughed histericly. I repayed the favor on numerous occasions. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
He would randomly do crazy stuff like ask me to have his elvish love children and invite me into channels such as letsmakebabies. We talked alot and he brought a smile to my face every time he would do off the wall stuff. <br>
<br>
I will miss him greatly but I know he is in heaven now smiling down on all of us. If he were here now he would say... &quot;STOP WHINING!!! IM FINE!!!! now go kill cool stuff and get phat lewt!&quot;<br>
<br>
Hes just the type of person who wouldnt want to make a fuss. But because he was that type of person.. thats the reason we make a fuss. <br>
<br>
Will miss you Eonwe/Kevin, wish we could all have shown you how much we care before you left us. <br>

In my other post, I mentioned the failed Plane of Fear break in a few years ago.  I'll always remember that.  The first high-level cleric I remember seeing was Eonwe, with a clicker (rare back in the day with rotation!) and that kitty helm -- he definately stood out as being uber.  He came without question and just clicked away, making sure the raid was up and running again.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Heaven has a hefty broadband connection -- I hope he uses it from time to time to watch over his friends and family on Morell Thule.<br>

I logged on next day and died and feared I was going to lose my corpse because it was hard to get through NToV with clothes, let alone naked. Eonwe saw me and asked where i died and if i needed a rez, i said in PoM, he told me to log on a diff account and wait a bit then he got a port and went to ToV. He died 4 times trying to get through NToV to get to PoM to rez me. After an hour of him doing these suicide rushes he finally tells me to log on Broo and I see he is in PoM. So I log on Broo and quickly run to bank and grab some amount of pp (like 2k or something) and took the rez box. When I zoned in I tried to give the 2k to Eonwe, he cancels the trade and instead gives me a gate potion, virt and makes sure I didnt die again. It was things like this that made him, going out on a limb for a friend.

Who ever pulled pulled about 6 from the castle so I told him to camp and got argo on the mobs, he camped out ressed us, the same old thing. He then told me to join FE he would talk with Cannibulon and i could app. After that time i rember many nights of Eonwe giving me play by play of takeing other FE chars and deleteing gate loading them with 200k in copper banking all there armor then portin them some where; moving them under water and deleteing EB and any lev spells. <br>

In fact it only happened just about an hour ago.<br>
<br>
I was having a pretty rough day, i think im getting a sore throat so i woke up a bit on crabby side. Then as im heading out to work i get a flat tire along a major interstate pretty much smack dab in the middle of St Louis, to make matters worse the lug nuts on my tires were on so tight (damn air wrenchs) i had to call my insurnace company for roadside assistance, oh the joy of being on hold and being transfered and telling your story to 80 different people. Ok so fast forward 90 minutes my tire is fixed and im on my way to work, albeit really in a bad mood. Needing to get gasoline i pull into the gas station, as im driving up to the pump , another guy from the other direction is moving toward my same pump and its narrow not really any room to go around. So we sit there staring at each other for several moments (seemed much longer) and i mouth a few words (I do not recall what exactly i said, but i know if my mom was near id be eating soap) he proceeds to back up and i squeal my tires as i stomp on gas and go around to the other side away from (at this moment in time in my mind) this moron.<br>
<br>
Something hit me as soon as i turned off my ignition, ( i think it was Eonwe), i got outta my car walked over to the other guy we both about the same time apologized to each other for the incident. I explained i just had a bad day and was sorry for basicly acting like an ass. <br>
<br>
Maybe even if im not changed forever, but even for one moment I did what Eonwe would done or maybe better put what he would told me to do.<br>
<br>
Eonwe is that was you that smacked me, keep on doing it.<br>
Lord knows i could use it.<br>
If i could even be 1/10th as good a person as you , Id be a saint.<br>
<br>
I would like to make a comment from something Elias said:<br>

<br>
I think there's a greatest people thread, and it seemed that practically everyone that posted there put Eonwe's name down as one of the best people they knew.<br>
<br>
I had a few run-ins with Eonwe, but one time sticks out in my mind clearly.<br>
<br>
I was in Sebilis, and some friends and I were farming Juggs for spells. A druid comes in the zone and does a camp check, and finds that I am with some friends at the Juggs.<br>
<br>
I think they were going to try Trak with a 1 or 2 group team, or they were going for Tolapumj, but the druid let me know pretty fast that they were gonna mow through us and we better be ready.<br>
<br>
I got mad, per usual, and I get a tell from Eonwe that yeah, they were gonna go through us, but if we died, they would rez us, they would fully buff us as they passed by, and that they would handover any spells that they picked up along the way and thereafter.<br>
<br>
We never did die, but they raid buffed us and handed over a ton of spells that we otherwise might not have gotten. And I don't think any of that would have happened unless Eonwe was there. He helped out us noobs, was real cool. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">New Legacy<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Reactivated Bitch-Ass Wizard, Level 65<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto:Maxximuus@earthlink.net"> Maxximuus@earthlink.net</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=boraron>boraron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/17/03 3:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2118.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the legend</span><hr size=1> My first dealing with Eonwe aka Kevin was when i was doing my endless tours thru Everfrost and Sol B(aka Naggy and Vox). On more then one occasion Eonwe offered to help buff people on the raid. I remeber one Naggy raid where he also stayed till the end (thru 2 attempts). He gladly offered to rez people and rebuff us all. He also gave me a few helpful hints on running the raid and also engaging Naggy. I will never forget how happy he was when we were successful on the next attempt. I offered to let him roll on some of the loot or give him some plat we got, but he refused to take either and said he was happy to help us out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=senalebster>Senalebster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 198<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/17/03 4:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2118.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Here's my story with E!</span><hr size=1>   The things I'll remember is the laughs. I remember we'd be sitting at the entrance to some dungeon before a raid (since E and I were always at raids extremely way to early) and we'd be sitting there shootin the breeze and Sitting up and down really fast and just making each other laugh. I remember talkin to him about how we picked the most unique combinations of race and class for characters and would talk about why each of us was simply the best race/class combo ever. (which usually ended up being a beauty contest). He was a high elf cleric and I was a human warrior. <br>
<br>
   I remember always asking him 1st if he was looking for groups, and we were ALWAYS in Sebillis killing frogs for the MOST AMAZING ARMOUR! I remember sitting down and talking about colleges and where'd each of us would go. But the best memory of Eonwe(Kevin) is the times when I was upset about something (which seemed daily) Kevin would always tell me the right things to make me shrug it off and smile again. I didn't log into this game for the graphics, the excitement, or to be the best. I logged in to talk to people like Kevin. He had the most magnetic personality and everyone wanted to &quot;hang with Eonwe&quot;. These are the memories that will stay with me and I can look back upon them and honsetly say that I was a better person for knowing Kevin. <br>

He sent me a tell asking me what I had in my boot slot, and I told him. Next thing I knew, he had placed Golden Efreeti Boots in the trader window for me. I cancelled and told him I had nothing to pay with. He put them up again, and told me to take them. This was back when they were selling for 6 and 7k in EC. This generosity impressed me greatly. <br>
<br>
Ever since then, I have watched him and discovered that this incident was not a one time thing for him. He was always nice to people, and seemed to be willing to help anyone anytime. He and I never became friends, inasmuch as really talking to each other, but tells were exchanged and even though he probably never knew it, I considered myself his friend. <br>
<br>
I know in my heart, that a person this nice in game where there is so much anonymity, could only have a good soul out of game. <br>
<br>
Where ever Eonwe's soul is now, I know it is a much better place now that it has him.<br>

I had just began playing EQ, and this game wasn't easy.  I had a knack for finding the most out of the way annoying places to camp, and dieing there.<br>
<br>
This particular time it was in Erud's Crossing, on the little island where the wisps would all join in and kill you.  Like they did me.<br>
<br>
I sat in Qeynos waiting for the boat, and when it finallly did, there's this High Elf cleric there.  He was obviously uber (anyone fully dressed to me then was uber), and he asks me where I died.  Well, I tell him, and it's a 30 minute trip back to where he just came.  And while talking, the boat had left again.<br>
<br>
He sat there with me, the whole 45 minutes for the boat to circle around, and went out with me, and rezzed me.  I was only level 13, a no rez death would have been nothing more than 2 or 3 kills.  He went out of his way to help me, someone he had never met.  For no reason, (there was no chance I could repay him back, even with my gls's), he just went with me.  No questions, nothing expected, just being him, I guess.<br>
<br>
I always watched Eonwe with a kind of awe and respect, cause he was the type of guy most of us just don't have the guts or goodness to be.<br>
<br>
Thanks Eonwe, again.<br>
<br>
I'll never forget you.<br>

When we wiped they came in and helped get back on our feet. Not only Rezzing our Dead but E also Buffed the raid. <br>
<br>
After that I would send him tells when I would see him on and ask questions about being a  cleric on a raid and different things that would help out. He always took the time to answer my tells Never once said I cxan not talk right now even if he was raiding he would always answer. <br>
<br>
He was a great player and from my experience a great person also. He always said hi when he passed by. I have not gotten to see him very much over the past 3 years because of living on Euro time but he was still one of the greatest people I ever met in EQ.<br>

As the group began dying off in the basement, I understand it created mass havoc down there for Eon and whoever was with him. Instead of berating the noob that had created the problem he spent two hours getting our corpses, rezzing and buffing us. I remember posting here way back then thanking him for his kindness. After that night, until 2 am on the cr I might add...he was always there. To laugh with, to help rez or whatever was needed.
