I stopped playing for a while just after Hamunaptra collapsed so I'm kind of foggy on what happened guild-wise at that time. <br>
<br>
I know at some point after Hamunaptra died, Relentless Ascension formed and became a powerhouse for a while. And then In Virtue came about, but I think most of them moved to the Vazaelle server when it opened.<br>
<br>
Then Fury's Edge.<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure about some of the other guilds like Aurore, FoV, Reviction, and Triune. I never really followed guilds and politics back then because I was sitting snugly in a nice, up-and-coming guild (Shards of Fate).<br>
<br>
Take all that with a grain of salt, I played EQ off-and-on since Morell-Thule's opening and I never read the forums much, so I'm sure some of that history is incorrect, but it at least gives you a general outline. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://src=&quot;http://ri.poweredbyevil.com/invisible.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>

Discordians is another 'from the start' oldie<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
     Now, how it all came to be, to now...(and this is my take, and probably wrong..*giggle)<br>
<br>
(fast forward past Circle of the Unseen, In Virtue, etc!)<br>
<br>
     Thunderwalkers kind of chugged along at a steady pace, alongside of Relentless Ascension, and Heroic Few...from what I remember, TW's and HF had a little bad blood between them. The three arguably were about equal. I'm sure some in each of those guilds would beg to differ, but I digress<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
     Things got to a point, where the competition was all about who could mobilize, and kill swiftly...and the three way stalemate wasn't cutting it for most...<br>
<br>
            (this is the part i'm not too clear on..example: I have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>no</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> idea what was the goings on of FoV, cept that they killed when most on american time, were sleeping<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
   Somehow, the leaders of HF and RA decided a merger would be the best bet, as the two combined would achieve much much more, than separately. Some did not find this to be a good plan, and moved to other pastures...the rest stayed, and became a strong force. <br>
<br>
    Now that the new guild was born, Fury's Edge, with the mix of the Heroic few inside it, the guild became a little lower on TW faction, from both guild's perspectives. From then on, for a good long while, it was heated competition, and mean oocs going back and forth, etc...<br>
<br>
     Eventually, FE pulled ahead of the race, by a sizeable margin...then the guilds sort of 'slowed down' on the whole messy relations, cause of the difference in numbers, and overall strength.<br>
<br>
    Thunderwalkers, had a good thing going itself, though,  as the next guild behind them, were a bit behind as well...so, they had reign of quite a few targets themselves...(Ntov, PoG, etc.) with little competition...<br>
<br>
     After a bit, the guilds Triune and Reviction...always great rivals, started gaining power, and as such, started catching up to TW's. Some interguild stuff happened in TW's a bit later,(Due to stinky luclin! *shakes fist! hehe) and many left, which caused a domino effect on the rest that stayed behind, till a few of the 'old tw's' were left...to date, they are working on rebuilding to a former glory<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
     When FoV numbers dwindled (School, i think?) Their momentum slowed as well, and some that had a great love for raiding(/boggle..*grins*) as well as the old members of TW that posessed that same passion, found a home, when FE began recruiting for Time...<br>
<br>
     Reason being, for that recruitment, is...the Rathe encounter, is pure <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>yuck</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. You need a ton of people, patience, and add a lack of care, for lost sanity. Old TWs, and FoV'ers signed on... and long story short, got into time...found the need for lacking classes, got them, and beat Quarm.<br>
<br>

  FoV stumbled when Bettencourt and some others were drafted into military duty I think it is.  I think a few others went to Maelin<br>
<br>
  Lexxis apped FE and TW crumbled at the loss...<br>
<br>
  Zenital Hexad (the korean guild) was absorbed by FoV.<br>

  Oh and AV has jockeyed their way into #4 or 5 now.<br>
<br>
Current Pyramid as best my spies can deduce.<br>
FE - Time flagged<br>
Reviction - Elemental Flagged - Rumored to have beaten dust and for sure has Earth-B flags.<br>
Triune - Elemental Flagged - Frustrated by Dust<br>
Aurore/AV - Elemental Flagged<br>
LoV, Primal Evolution - Emp kills and farming VT.<br>

It's like a PBS 9 episode documentary on the decline of the Old World and the dawning of the new. <br>
<br>
I'd put the current state of the server as-<br>
<br>
FE - flagged for Time. Also possibly flagged for other dimensions.<br>
<br>
Reviction - no one is really sure where they are in Ele progression because they are always /anon (sneaky peoples!!). They could be working on PoEB keys or Seb keys- only they know for sure! Also they are led by a hobbit. So 50 bonus points on that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Triune - 90% of the guild's mail is now forwarded to an address known simply as &quot;that spot near the birds in Fire&quot;. Mucho Fennin ownage. Reports of Triune beastlords now outfitting their warders in Immaculate Vests of the Fire Tyrant. Majority of guild going bald due to tearing hair out as a result of bugged Earth events and bugged Air events. Raid leaders now unable to speak properly due to chewing through their own tongues in frustration. Aforementioned frustration is then taken out on the poor creature known as Rallos Zek the Warlord. Triune simply refers to him as &quot;Farm B!tch&quot;.  MANY MANY MANY Hobbits here. I would put down how many points that gives them but the filthy hobbitses stole my scorecard.<br>
<br>
Aurore - no clue where they are since wherever they are they travel there while I am asleep. So will put them third because France makes good wine and I enjoy consuming it. <br>
<br>
AV - Are now in Elementals (all 12,543 of them). I believe they may be still working on Fire access (haven't noticed insane lag in the area of Mister Sol Ro lately).  Could end up being the first guild in EQ history to field a full raid force on Fennin Ro, Xegony, Cornaiv, and the Earth Rings simultaneously. <br>
<br>
GoB - &quot;nothing to see here, move along&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>
Some guilds are going the Emp/VT route before plowing more into PoP-<br>
<br>
LoV - also does a lot of stuff while I am asleep. Currently farming VT. So that means they are also asleep.<br>
<br>
PE - all reports confirming, PE very glad about the AV thing as VT now considerably less crowded. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.speakeasy.org/~thetroll/pics/misc/necrissig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

All I can say for sure there were few thousand guilds, many of them with very short live spawn.<br>
In general there are 2 major kind of the guilds - &quot; fun loving&quot;<br>
and &quot;raid loving&quot;. Any guild to progress more in higher end of the game had to have good stracture and lots of people that are willing to spend their EQ time to do very boring things.<br>
Besides, you have to have enough people online in any given time for the raid.<br>
Top guilds of MT were listed here. Now, there were a lot of guilds that show some promices , but for one reason or another went down.<br>
Some of them still online in small numbers, some are gone.<br>
It would be interesting to remember some of them.<br>
From the guild that are old and still doing stuff, I would name Discordians. I saw then firs about , well more then 3 years ago I think..it was very small guild then. Then again at this time group or 2 of right levels can ruke almost any zone,<br>
exept may be for Naggy and Vox.<br>
I also remember Demple of Down, they were pretty good as guild goes, but because of internal problems they are no more.<br>

Previous to that there were good guilds, but very little high-end content was being done, since nobody was high-enough level, yet. I do believe that Circle of the Unseen was the first to slay the old-world gods (Inny and CT), while the dragons were not felled until later. Naggy was first killed by a joint effort of TW and HF, lead by TW, and Vox I just don't recall.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion, having been a member of HF, was that Relentless Ascention had a large number of hardcore folks, and was therefore able to do most major encounters first. Shortly afterwards, we -- being Heroic Few -- would do the same with fewer people (we were slightly less hardcore, at the time). After that, TW would do the same thing with twice as many people as RA had.<br>
<br>
It's all ancient history now, but I distinctly remember TW being teased for zerging in almost exactly the same way AV is, these days.<br>
<br>
I'd like to go on record saying that I very vividly remember suggesting that HF and RA work together, since we were so close in relative power, and our constant competition was holding both of us back. However, it was not until a few months after I quit EQ (for the... third time, I believe) that the two guilds actually &quot;merged.&quot; I say the word in quotations because it was more akin to picking teams rather than combining forces. I have spoken to a number of ex-HF who harbored a bit of bad blood for being intentionally cut-out of FE.<br>
<br>
None of this really ever affected me much, since I was never really hardcore uber-guild material, anyways. However, the FE merger -- which combined together the two most powerful guilds on the server -- left them with a sizable lead, which has even today not been diminished. After TW basically imploded, there was a serious power vacuum, which seemed to have been filled by Flames of Vengence, but it seems they kinda vanished at some point. Reviction has been around since the HF/RA/TW days, and was originally formed from ex-Circle of the Unseen folks, if I am not mistaken. They're a quiet bunch, not ones to boast of their accomplishments, but they're a very strong and solid guild. <br>
<br>
I know little of Triune, they were little concern to me when I was among the uber in HF, since they were not really competition to us, but I see that they are doing nicely, as well.<br>
<br>
I honestly never thought that Altruistic Valorians would turn into a raiding guild back then, but I guess anything can happen. Though they have a dubious reputation, you must respect their dogged perseverence in the face of adversity.<br>
<br>
As for the rest, I don't have enough info to make any observations. This is all just one monk's view on events, so take it with a grain of salt. However, I always find it amusing to remember &quot;the good old days,&quot; so do excuse my ramblings. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Argond Valiantfist</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Grandmaster Geezer of Morell-Thule</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133460" target="top">Geezer-gear</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yenadilpureheart>YenadilPureheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Great Hunter<BR>of Gimps</span><br>  Posts: 722<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/13/03 11:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1921.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Question's for the old timers</span><hr size=1> Don't forget to mention Hall of Heroes, never a hugely uber guild, but nonetheless they were always their and were a good group of people. They dissolved shortly after their GL left for RL reasons. A few of them tried for a comeback as Desperate Measures, however that eventually faltered as well.<br>
<br>
IF I remember correctly Sinister was a guild from another game that came over to EQ, eventually they all moved on to another game. The ones who joined when they were on EQ stayed and merged with the recently fallen Circle of the Unseen to form Reviction. Reviction means something along the lines of &quot;new life&quot; if I remember correctly. (Keep in mind I'm not *entirely* sure on all that, its secondhand info thats been sitting in the back of my brain for a couple years now.)<br>
<br>
As far as some history concerning lesser known guilds, their was the old Silent Brotherhood alliance, which was I recall Temple of Dawn, AV, and one other (Can't remember who, Hell Hunters maybe?). That eventually folded as ToD garnered enough strength to raid on their own, as did Av. The third member of the SB alliance merged with Azure Blades to form Titan Lords. TL only lasted perhaps a year, but they shone white hot during that time. In only a year they went from not being able to kill Ixiblatt Fer to raiding ToV, they even took a few whacks at some FB dragons. TL fell apart due to some leadership conflicts and the attitude of one certain monk (*cough*Torturedone*cough*) After that a large body of TL peeps moved on to Protectors of Kindred Souls, which is doing quite well these days.<br>
<br>
As for some never uber but well known guilds, there is Random Acts. These guys have been around forever and always known for their dedication to helping those around them. Hunters of the Undead has been around a long time and is full of good peeps. Happy Funtime Elves is perhaps known most for their total lack of uberness and Simpson's refernce name. At one time also it was a bit of a fad for the uber to have alts in the guild. Also their is Order of the Chosen Few. Around forever, never very big, perhaps most well known for their guild leader, Filin. Filin was the patron saint of Unrest, he spent nearly all his time their helping those who were lower level break up trains and teaching the ropes of the zone. Went with his personality I guess, he was an airborn firefighter in RL as I recall. Filin was also one of the greatest pally's the server ever saw. He could heal better than 90% of the clerics I have met and root-mez better than 60% of the chanters I have known. He could pull 6 mobs at once and control them so that only one at a time came to the group.<br>
<br>
Their have been other guilds that had an impact on the server that I can't recall the name of now, (God, what was the name of the guild that Magnetician was in? They were some good peeps.) There was that french guild that pulled the infamous Fear gank, can't remember their name. There was the guild that broke apart in a particularly fiery display, can't remeber their name, Blades and Magic perhaps?<br>
<br>
Thats about all I can recall for the moment, might add more later if you really want to know it. Anyone feel free to correct me if I am wrong somewhere or add your own piece. This could be a kind of cool thread, a sort of history of our own server <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
In April of 2000 when the server opened several threads started on message boards including Harpy's Head, all were aimed at making MT the unoffical RP server. Many of us moved from others servers to take part. It got ridiculously militant, with folks suggesting the RP'ers would some how force &quot;playa's&quot; to leave the server.<br>
<br>
The RP idea was so popular, that no less than 6 RP guilds were created and a community was firmly established. Coeur de Lion, The Order of the White Hand, The Coven of the Blood Rose, Citizens of Halas, House Rea'Morde, Hessians of Morrell Thule, Mark of Dranconians were among the most noted.<br>
<br>
The reason this is significant, is because out of that arose the GoB. Originally created as a multiguild alliance to script and run original custom RP events, the GoB is the largest interguild alliance on the server. 2 guilds were created specifically out of the GoB to serve large scale guild wars. <br>
<br>
In August of 2001 however, a falling out occurred with some of the member guilds. The result was an eventual shift from RP to a more progressive raiding structure. Those of us who didn't want to go that way left the GoB and it evolved into the alliance it is now.<br>
<br>
Although they may not have reached PoT yet, the GOB definately deserves respect for being the largest guild alliance ever on MT, and I believe it is still so.<br>

<br>
A minor correction here. Dungeon Masters of Norrath (DMoN) later called DMoMT was formed specificly for RP purposes. GoB was always intended to be a Non-RP entity for RP guilds. Due to a series of issues within DMoMT &amp; the popularity of raiding, inter-guild Roleplay ultimately shifted to GoB although without official sanction -- Even the DMoMT message board was added to the GoB boards.<br>
<br>
Once GoB began making moves into Velios, the unfriendlyness of RP in Velios made it very difficult to RP on raids. SoEs completely broken lore of Luclin kept any RP from gaining momentum there. So now any interguild RP really runs through the GoB.<br>
<br>
RP is alive and well, it's just within single guilds, or quietly interguild without any formal structure.<br>
<br>
If you want an intersting history lesson on MT, look at the RPers, not the uberguild stuff.<br>

I think at about lvl 30ish half that guild left and formed up Altruistic Valorians with Doter (necro) as the Guild Leader. Actually was quite a fun guild for awhile (Anyone remember the 4 and 5 hour Hate CRs). Then internal problems happened, and many people split off to other guilds (i.e. Axam to Relentless Ascension, Trystych to TW). Besame, myself, havic, Earlic &lt;i think earlic was with us&gt;  and a bunch of others created our own guild for about a week.(been so long can't remember the name). Lytic aproached us and we merged with CoTu/Sin/&lt;ourfunkyoneweekoldguild&gt; and formed Reviction on the wizard pad in Ro i believe it wa2s. Reviction was one of the top guilds on the server (and still are) at creation with some very good people in it. I think slowly as happens to all other guilds over time people got worn out of the game as well as the Lytic debacle (thats another story all together). However Janson took over leadership  and has kept Rev strong. Now, many top guilds such as TW, Rev, FE , (which was heroic few/R.A. combine), Triune are not the same people that started in these guilds, but they still have fun i'm sure. <br>
