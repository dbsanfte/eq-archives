<br>
One thing it comes down to is respect for the server and for those clerics who have agreed to the list and who put their names on it and have patiently waited.<br>
<br>
If the server wants to &quot;exp&quot; with FFA, then do a legitimate vote, freeze the list and test it out <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AFTER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the listed clerics have gotten their heart.  However, you would be ignoring the recent vote that hands down, chose keeping the list over any other option.<br>
<br>
And Drack, one thing for you, you needed a good set of opinions over on this new board.  Thanks for picking a topic that always gets folks blood boiling.<br>

Honestly I know this suggestion will never happen. But lets look at a few things here.<br>
<br>
<br>
The rotation as it stands now is in a weakening position. Not the weakest its ever been in, which was when oH was pushing hard for the doing away with it, but still not an entirely stable position. Various guilds have had their small little intrigues but none are yet willing to openly break the rotation. However, their is a small growing movement of discontent with it amongst the leadership of some of the high end guilds. So this is what is heppening here.<br>
<br>
Neuro has made his little suggestion. Drack and I are gonna put it foreward to make everyone think about actual FFA on RF. Then everyone is gonna get worked into a tizzy and will make sure this never happens. <p>"For a day I had my dream. And on that day, it was my duty to end that dream."

Some cheap shots too. (Neuro's puppet, gimme a break dipsh!t). <br>
<br>
First off, as I post this, the No's have the slim majority.  While I admit I supported the idea of the one month FFA deal, I also support the wants of the community (thus why I posted it in the first place).<br>
<br>
Exploring options?  What options?  If I wanted to explore an option to get my RF heart I would have ganked him already so please to explore the option of removing yer foot from yer mouth.  <br>
<br>
FFA supporters are bullies eh?  If they were bullies, I mean come on, wouldn't they have already thrown the rotation aside and said screw you???<br>
<br>
I too am willing to wait on the list like everyone else.  Why?  Cuz I could truely give a damn if I have a clicker or not.  My game doesn't revolve around it.  I'll work for it, but I aint stressing over it.<br>
<br>
I have been by and large one of the strongest supporters for the rotations.  I have argued, flamed, ranted, insulted, and snubbed people ranging from guild leaders to non-clerics.  <br>
<br>
Why do I think this FFA for a month will be a good idea?  Because it will shine the light once and for all that rotations are the best option.  The flames, the hatred, that animosity will be crazy.  It will no doubt change the minds of many pro-FFA folks.  That was my reasoning behind it.<br>
<br>
Let's get a reality check though folks.  First off, VI doesnt listen to crap.  They won't change jack sh!t because the players want it changed.  They got the hook in deep and yer not going to, in mass numbers, stop playing because of the RF spawn time.<br>
<br>
It was a simple poll...not to end rotations, not to change rotations!  Just to take a step back, put them on hold, see what happens, then get back on track.  No big deal.  What would make people stop FFA'ing him come November???  Hopefully the same integrity that kept them from FFA'ing him before October.  If they didnt do it yet, why would they do it then since soooooo many use the line &quot;whatever the community decides on..blah blah blah&quot;.<br>
<br>
The poll should have stayed in General as I clearly stated it was not to decide to kill the rotation or change it.  Granted the link of a rotation mob, but the message gets lost here.<br>
<br>
I apologize folks, as drawing up bad blood was not my intent.<br>
Also, as always, I always post here without consulting my guild.  Never have never will.  My opinions and actions on MT.com are mine alone!!!  Whatever DM's stance on any issue will be made by an officer or guild leader.  And if ya think for one damn minute whining to them about what I say on here is gonna stop me, you need to wake the hell up.  kthx =)<br>
<br>
&lt;side note:  IN-GAME issues however are different.  When I do something IN-GAME, THEN i represent my guild and if I screw up...then it's justified and I must answer to my guild.&gt; <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

I think even people who support the rotation system would agree that the queue has gotten ridiculously large -- I would certainly agree to it, and it's part of the reason I chose *not* to persue the epic.<br>
<br>
Where this discussion always gets derailed (if you don't mind me fast-forwarding a bit) is coming up with a system that is both equitible to the clerics currently on the list and focused on whole reason there is a rotation (which is keeping Ragefire gank threads from overwhelming this community the way they have on others.) Where the FFA advocates tend to fail in proposing solutions is not taking into account one of the two items above. I'd argue that the current vote fails to take into account the first of those items. <p>Faithfully yours,<BR><BR>

How many of us are still gonna be playing EQ in Sept. 2003?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Forgive me but how would FFA make this better?  It may line a few pockets with a crap load of Plat, but other then that I do not really see how this would make the situation any better.<br>
<br>
I agree the only ones voting on this should be the clerics themselves, but we all have had this conversation before, haven't we.  Talk about deja vu. <p><p><center><b>

Playing the devil's advocate is a good thing... it's serving its purpose despite the fact that it seems to be turning into a witchhunt.  <br>
<br>
Folks are getting their panties in a twist and are seemingly recognizing that letting it go FFA could spiral into a very ugly situation.<br>
<br>
Cheers to you, Drack and Neuro, for having the balls to even suggest it. <p><table> <tr><td><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/thehessiansofmorellthule/images/AEsig2.jpg><br><font size=1>

There might be a wait between triggers but 5 dyas?! Sheesh. Even if we kept the rotation it would move so much faster if Verant would consider this option. On a side not it seems he's been spawning 3-4 days apart not 5 lately. <p><p align=center><img src="http://home1.gte.net/vze3fjky/vendicta/sadiasig.jpg"><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33022>Sadia</a><br><a href=http://www.geocities.com/sadiafinesmith/home.html>The Spoiled Enchantress</a>

Let me throw something else out there.  How many of the top 20 clerics on the list are still &quot;mains&quot;???  How often do they play?  Or are we talking alts now?<br>
<br>
/em tries to hide the horns he's growing from his head<br>
<br>
Rotations good.  Rotations reserving a clicker for people that haven't played a cleric in months....kinda sh!tty. <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

I guess the view I always take on this situation is the one of ANY new cleric hoping to get his/her epic. <br>
<br>
It's now getting to the point in the timeline that anyone not already on the list isn't EVER gonna get their epic... EQ2 will be out by then.<br>
<br>
So yes, it screws anyone on the list to go FFA, but it screws any cleric (or epic-less guild for that matter) who isn't already on it by keeping the rotation. No matter how skilled or ambitious or driven a cleric is, they're essentially NEVER gonna get their clicker.<br>
<br>
I remember my own time on the list well, and have always been impressed by the community spirit involved.<br>
<br>
I don't think we should ever go fully FFA, but people should be open to proposals.<br>
<br>
What about having every 4th RF pop fully FFA? /shrug<br>
Gives unlisted or low-listed clerics a remote shot at their epic before Fall of next year. <p>        <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567">Morinkhan</a><br>
