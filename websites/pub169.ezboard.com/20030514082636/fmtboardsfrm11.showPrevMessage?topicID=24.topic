<br>
“<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>By Prexus!!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” he cursed rushing to gather the airborn records. It was then he heard the city alarm… there was an intruder! Clutching the papers to his chest, he froze, feeling the presence of another. Spinning around quickly he faced a room filled to the ceiling with books and records. <br>
<br>
Here housed the entire history of Norrath, family trees, legends of great, noble and simpleman alike. Kvael closed his eyes and inhaled the scent of ancient scrolls and bound tomes, feeling a brief sense of safety, security.<br>
<br>
“ Keeper Rhi’shi… Kvael?” a pained femme voice asked from the shadows, sending the Erudite into a panic, dropping his papers, grabbing a nearby candlestick. <br>
<br>
In a reed-piped voice Kvael yelled at the shadow “ Who goes there?!”<br>
<br>
While staring at the tall bookshelf, the books started to distort and shimmer… a cloak of invisibility was fading from a black robed figure. Kvael took a defensive step back as the image cleared. No, the cloak wasn’t black, but charred and torn. The figure lifted it’s head, letting the hood fall back.<br>
<br>
With a loud clang, the candlestick hit the marble floor as Kvael shrieked in horror. Standing before him was a femme Erudite, emaciated, scarred and burned almost beyond mortal form. The figure wavered slightly, then fell into Kvael’s arms. It was all he could do to hold her upright, the stench of death was so powerful.<br>
<br>
Guiding her to the floor, Kvael said “ Child!! You need a healer… let me…”<br>
<br>
His words where cut off quickly as the stranger’s hand shot up to grip his throat. She hissed, “ No… no healers. Just take my bag.” She slid the bag from her shoulder, letting in lay on the floor beside her. <br>
<br>
“Who attacked you… the intruder?!” Kvael stood up quickly, heading for the door. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, an arch of magical power crackled through the air, gripping the Librarian, sending his body into a terrible seizure, draining his life and restoring it to the stranger on the floor. <br>
<br>
The femme quickly stood up and went over to his side, guiding him to the floor now, whispering: “ Do NOT summon a healer, nor guards. I am sorry but I NEED you to listen to me!!” <br>
<br>
He looked up into the familiar face of the beauty before him, Erudite caramel skin, bright green eyes staring at him in panicked desperation. Suddenly, it was all clear. <br>
<br>
“ You!!” he said, “ Shai’le, it IS you... but but... child why…?” The pain he felt was so great that it sent him into unconsciousness. <br>
<br>
After what seemed like hours, but was only a few minutes, Kvael awoke with a start. He was still lying on the floor, and near him was the orphan child he used to catch hiding in the cellars of the Library, pouring over books instead of playing with the others. <br>
<br>
Now she was this beautiful stranger, seated in meditative form. A chill rushed over him as he realized she was a practicer of the black arts, a Necromancer. In the background, the city was still on full alert. Considering his options, he decided screaming would be the fastest way, instead of moving in his weakened state. <br>
<br>
As he filled his lungs with air, and he screamed &quot; GUARDS!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
Shai'le's eyes flashed open, filled with tears. “ Please…” was all she said. She grabbed her bag and handed it to him.<br>
<br>
Just then the doors of the Library flew open, guards pouring into the building, surrounding her, the commander striding in confidently, behind his men.<br>
<br>
“ Heretic!” he spat. As she began to chat and her fingertips came to light with magic, an enchanter stepped in and mesmerized her. Her body and her magic froze, leaving her completely invulnerable, tremoring only when the enchanters sieved magic from her. <br>
<br>
“ Shai’le, we drove you out before and what a mistake,” he moved in to face her “ …we should have killed you.” <br>
<br>
“ Do not call me that name!”, as she spoke the room filled with gasps. “ I am Malaele d’Aeliu, Daughter of Malaeliu, banished Priestess of Innoruuk.” <br>
<br>
The commander cut in, “ Look at your skin, Shai’le… it is NOT blue! You are not elven! You are ERUDITE! Why would you claim blood of a Teir'dal. You ARE insane!!”<br>
<br>
“ Your mighty guards of Prexus” she spat back “ didn’t protect me from being abducted as a child! Nor did they ever come to find me!” <br>
<br>
Silence filled the room, as Kvael stood up to peer closer. She continues, “ No, Malaeliu wasn’t my mother at birth, but she saved me and other children… my sisters! And after her death?! Did Quellious give me the coppers I had to beg for? Did your precious Prexus guide me back here to your vile cursed forest?”.<br>
<br>
The commander stepped forward, drew his long two-handed sword and cut the woman down. Freed from the enchanter’s spell, Malaele channeled her magic into the commander to restore her health from his. But, completely drained, all she could do was lie in the floor, bleeding to death.<br>
<br>
“ We should have destroyed you when we found you! No one can live with evil and not be effected. Now you grow up to make us proud, the vile Bonecaster!”.<br>
<br>
She shot back, in desparation “ You gave me no choice, throwing me out in the forests with no training… how else was I to survive? I had to feed off the lives of the forest creatures. I cared not where my power was from, Quellious, Prexus or Cazic Thule.” <br>
<br>
The crowd gasped and murmured… “ Heresy” as they pulled her to her feet.<br>
<br>
She continued in the ancient Combine tongue, knowing Kvael would understand… “ I wanted to unite my family, and piece my Mother’s story together. Now you have it, do not let it die with me, please I beg you…”<br>
<br>
Cold blue steel cut off the last of her words. The commander withdrew his sword from the girl, wiping her blood on her black robe. “ Dispose of this in the usual Heretic manner.”<br>

After impaling her corpse for all to see, Malaele d'Aeliu was burned then ashes gathered and poured into the sea.<br>
<br>
Kvael huddled in the basement of the Library, staring at the papers strewn on the floor. They were diary pages, some torn, others water washed and faded, but all written in unmistakable Teir’dal.<br>
<br>
For the next few weeks, he worked with little food or sleep, obsessed with putting this puzzle together. He had remembered the orphan child Shai’le. The city guards had found her half-starved and torn up by Kobolds, wandering in Toxxilia Forest. She was the child everyone shunned, who used to hide here in the cellars of the Library pouring over books, while the rest were at play. She spoke of stories she remembered of her abduction and being raised in Nektulos forest by a savior she called Mother. But, he thought the child was delusional and shrugged it off as a wild imagination. <br>
<br>
However, with a great sense of sadness and regret, he pieced together her Mother’s diary and found it all to be true.<br>
<br>
The night had come for the Librarians to gather and give progress of the work they had been doing. Kvael’s hands were cold and sweaty as they gripped the red leather Tome he had crafted to house the Legacy of Malaeliu. His body shook with nervousness, legs tremmoring, bouncing up and down until the assembly floor felt the vibration.<br>
<br>
When his turn was up, he walked into the center of the Library, peering up at the vaulted ceiling, seeing his peers gathered together to listen.<br>
<br>
“ To ensure the safety of these documents,” Kvael started out with a breaking voice. “ I ask that the meeting be closed and private.” The crowd murmured softly as the elders discussed the request briefly.<br>
<br>
Elder Shotala, a clean shaven Erudite with tattoo marking of his family nodded and called out “ Seal the doors please. Go ahead Kvael, we await to hear what you have kept so secretly guarded.”<br>
<br>
Hearing the heavy doors close, he took a deep breath and began. “ A Teir’dal was born into the Priestly House and she was raised in the service of Innoruuk. Her name was… Malaeliu.” <br>
<br>
Instantly the crowd was in an uproar, having heard this name and portions of this story told by the child Shai’le.<br>
<br>
The Librarian raised his voice over the crowd, in defense “ I present this book of diary pages that have been collected all over Norrath, to the commitee. On the backs of these pages are the trade seals from lands of the Barbarians, to the Humans, the Dwarven seal, and the seals of the gypsies.” He passed the Tome carefully to the elders, and watched them carefully examine the seals.<br>
<br>
“ May Kvael continue without more unaccepted interruptions?” Elder Shotala scolded the crowd. “ The authentication committee, I assure you, will clarify the if the pages are forged or altered.”<br>
<br>
With a formal bow to the Elder, Kvael continued. “ Malaeliu, yes a Teir'dal by breed and birth, had one enemy, Vri’dril. Our records show that these children shared the same father, Draxius- a powerful member of the High Council. The facts are not clear, of why there was such a fierce hatred in a family. But, the diary indicates that she grew up in fear of him.”<br>
<br>
“When they were both of age, the time came to choose a High Council member from the House of their Father. Malaeliu was reckoned to win but some incident happened. <br>
<br>
Vri’dril went on a mad spree of slaying the Stone Guardians to the north of Nektulos forest. Malaeliu knew that the Guardians were allies, sworn to protect the Teir’dal, so she intervened, healing the last of them before Vri’dril could land the finishing blow.<br>
<br>
At this moment the elders happened upon them, Vri’dril instantly covering up, saying he was stopping a Guardian revolt but Malaeliu was on the side of the Guardians. One elder stepped forward and asked the dying Guardian who healed him… he pointed to Malaeliu. But, before he could speak in her behalf, the poison of Vri’dril’s dagger took his life. Malaeliu’s story and her half-brother’s did not fit. But, soon it was forgotten.<br>
<br>
Ever suspicious of him now, the cleric started following him. Something was taking him in and out of Neriak at night. Sometimes he would come back into town with presents from all over Norrath. Spoils of war he called them. His power increased and so did his house of followers.<br>
<br>
One evening she saw him slip behind the waterfall in Neriak Commons. Assuming he had fallen in, she looked down to the other side where the pool was, but he never emerged. After several hours, she decided to take the plunge into the waterfall and see where he had gone. <br>
<br>
Behind the falls was a secret entrance, she had never known about. As she emerged from the water, the stench of sickness and filth hit her nose. Her ears were assailed with the cries of … children. <br>
<br>
Hundred and hundred of children of every race, were huddled on the floor, chained together… even Teir’dal children! Malaeliu froze in her tracks and hid her body from view, so as not to startle them. For hours she sat there and watched the little ones cry and comfort each other, some standing proud as if ready to defend the others. <br>
<br>
While she waited, Vri’dril entered with a Human gypsie. She saw money exchanged and listened as Vri’dril made arrangements to sell these children as slaves. <br>
<br>
The cleric’s heart was devoted to Innoruuk, god of Hatred. Her hands reached up to her neck, where she wore the Father’s symbol with pride. But, this was… beyond hate. This was a violation of worst kind. Even Innoruuk has rules and structure. Surely this could not be tolerated. Malaeliu had no love for the children she said, but she had a sense of right and wrong.<br>
<br>
She decided to ignore this. Vri’dril was far too powerful to go up against alone. The disgust she felt in her soul urged her to pray and meditate more on the Hatred of the Father. But as time passed, she found herself sneaking into the hidden cavern, leaving food and water, casting a calming spell and healing when necessary, slipping out before she was discovered.<br>
<br>
Time passes in the diary pages...<br>
<br>
While away in the Northlands, fighting in the Lair of Lady Vox, Malaeliu’s party was completely destroyed, many running off for their lives. Having been left for dead, Malaeliu found herself alone, powerless to heal herself.<br>
<br>
A mixed band of Barbarians, dwarves and a huge Ogre named Kruuk came in and pulled her to safety. She stayed with them while she healed up. <br>
<br>
The leader was a Shamaness named Kate, haggard from lack of sleep. Her husband had been killed and children had been abducted by a band of Teir’dals and gypsies. She pleaded with Malaeliu if she knew anything about the whereabouts of her children. With her husband gone, she would never marry another, never bear anymore children. She moved her hand across the Cleric’s abdomen and sighed. The shamaness told her that she of all people should understand; she had ascertained that the cleric was indeed barren and could not bear children of her own. <br>
<br>
Something inside Malaeliu tore her heart, breaking that wall of hatred that surrounded it. The pages of poetry she wrote... were emotionally charged.<br>
<br>
The plan was set. The band would go back to Neriak and free the children. Malaeliu would show them the way, but could not be a part.<br>
<br>
The librarian paused for a moment, asking for a glass of water...<br>

<br>
&quot; On the eve of the Festival of Innoruuk, cases of strong spirits, specially brewed by the Dwarves, laced with a sleeping potion concocted by the shamaness were delivered to Neriak. In the middle of the night when the last of the guards was drunk and in a deep sleep, the band of rescuers snuck in.<br>
<br>
The dwarven rogues emerged into the lair of children with torches sending them into a terrific chorus of screams, sounding a loud alarm echoing through the caverns. They set upon the children, picking the locks off their bonds as quickly as possible. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, Vri’dril and his men where there, having just arrived from another trip. Seeing the chaos, he ordered the children to be killed as fast as possible. Kate and the rest arrived in time to fight his men. <br>
<br>
Malaeliu was back in the temple in Third Gate pacing and praying for guidance. She was answered with a cold chill of laughter and screaming children. She tore the symbol of Innoruuk off her neck and threw it upon the holy altar, absolving her devotion to the Prince of Hate. <br>
<br>
She rushed into the commons and was shocked to hear silence. Running into the lair, the vision of carnage was unbelievable… hundred and hundreds of scorched bodies. Vri’dril had ordered his wizards to destroy the intruders and all the evidence. <br>
<br>
Picking through the bodies carefully, she saw the Shamaness. She tried to heal her but Kate was far gone. She took her Mace and her beads from her neck and put them in her bag, vowing to find her family to return these to.<br>
<br>
Hearing a wimper in the back… Malaeliu rounded a corner and was beset on by the wounded Ogre, Kruuk, and a dozen little girls. Kruuk calmed them down and said the cleric would help. She healed their wounds, cast a calming spell on the frightened bunch and quietly led them out. The girls were still chained together, but Kruuk scooped them up into his arms and they successfully made it out the forest. <br>
<br>
Malaeliu showed them where to hide, asking the Stone Guardians to watch over them. They loyally obeyed.<br>
<br>
It was the light of the next day when Malaeliu went back to her home to pack her belongings. Entering her home, there was the High Council and Vri’dil standing in the midst of her room. The High Priest held out her broken necklace and asked her to explain herself. <br>
<br>
She told them everything, about Vri’dril’s corruption, the destruction of the children even guiding them to the hidden lair.<br>
<br>
Upon entry, the place was spotless. No evidence was found anywhere. Vri’dril took this moment to his advantage, calling Malaeliu to be banished as someone insane, not worthy of the Council. Malaehi cursed him to his face then screamed up to the sky cursing Innoruuk for being a weak Father of Lies.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kvael paused in the story, taking another drink of water. Peering around the Library halls, everyone was listening raptly. “ I ask that the elders consider the next page… and note that it was dated 3 months later… and written in by a hand of a child.” The elders murmured and nodded.<br>
<br>
“ Malaeliu was banished and punished so badly where she could no longer use her hands to write. We know she was released into the forests and the Stone Guardians took her body and the Ogre shaman and children nursed her back to life. Kruuk stayed with her and the children for a long time afterwards.<br>
<br>
The children were:<br>
<br>
Malaeli, a Teir'dal child<br>
Kaete, the barbarian child of the dead Shamaness. <br>
Malaehi a high elven waif.<br>
Malae, a human child<br>
Malaekru, an ogre<br>
Malaela, a troll<br>
Malaele, an erudite, the one we called Shai’le<br>
<br>
Please note - The story indicates that there were twelve girls saved, but the diary pages only mention these… but much is still incomplete.<br>
<br>
Malaeliu spend the rest of her days raising these girls teaching them to love each other and be a family. Like I said the rest of the diary was written by a child, with little stories of the sister’s antics and of the visitors who came to reclaim their lost children. <br>
<br>
Kaete’s family came for her, as did Malae’s. Kruuk decided to take Malaekru back home with him for his sisters to raise. Since Grobb was close he too Malaela back too. Malaehi, the high elf, was completely heartbroken to see them go, writing pages of how much she loved them and missed them.<br>
<br>
So, Malaehi- the high elf, Malaeli- the dark elf and our Erudite Malaele were left. And the diary ends here.<br>
<br>
Kvael pulled out papers from the shelf on the podium, and approached the Committee presenting them with more evidence of his research.<br>
<br>
Reports have it that Vri’dril gathered a group from Felwithe to raid Nektulos forest, in search of Malaeliu. In this report&quot; he waved in the air high &quot; Vri'dril accused Malaeliu of kidnapping the children!!&quot;<br>
<br>
He paused and shook his head, sadly.<br>
<br>
She was executed in front of the 3 girls. Witnesses say an enchantress wiped the memory of the girls, but the erudite got away. <br>
<br>
Malaehi was taken back to the High Elven city of Felwithe. The Ancients of Erollisi Marr adopted the child into their sect and she is serving with them still. She approaches her 20th season soon.<br>
<br>
A surprising turn of events... Vri’dril took the dark elven Malaeli into his home to raise her. She was brought up to be a priestess and honored for her bravery in battle. Interesting to note… one morning he and his household were all found dead, bodies where executed. Malaeli was never found and disappeared from all Norrathian records. She should be well into her 28th season, if she is still alive.<br>
<br>
