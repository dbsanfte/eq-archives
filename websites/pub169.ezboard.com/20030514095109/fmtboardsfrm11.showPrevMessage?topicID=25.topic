<br>
Greetings Kvael,<br>
<br>
I send you this post as am update of what is going on with my sisters. In truth, only the Gods know of the fate of my sisters. It is the will of the Goddess I serve that I spread her message of Love to the lost ones of Norrath and even bringing a balance to those who serve the god of War. The simple truth is that while men seek revenge, thirst for bloodshed and covet the power of others, the ones who suffer are the masses who want to live a life of peace and tranquility. <br>
<br>
However, I do see the wisdom of the Ancients them it was said: &quot; Si vis pacem, para bellum&quot;, or &quot;If you want peace, prepare for the war.&quot; So, I live in a conflict of trying to spread this message of Love in a loveless world, showing kindness to all, in hopes of one day... ah, the grander hopes need not be mentioned, just hoped for, alas. But, it is my wish to unite my sisters back together and be a family, the way we must have been, the way our Mother Malaeliu had raised us.<br>
<br>
After a long thorough search around Norrath, I have found a Guild to align myself with. I am a member of Coeur de Lion, a fine, fiercly proud bunch. They have made me feel a part of the family, in more ways than others at times. My loyalty and heart resides with them, indeed.<br>
<br>
I have been thinking long and hard about our discussions, and have thought about the possibility of our sisters getting back together and becoming a family. But, ro be honest, perhaps we should just let it go. Everyone has a destiny to follow, as deemed by the Godess.<br>
<br>
The fact is, I do not think I could stand the fact that my sister Malaeli has forgotten what the house of Innoruuk had done to our Mother. HOW COULD SHE GO BACK TO HIS SERVICE??!!<br>
<br>
I will speak no more of this... it upsets me so.<br>
<br>
As for Kaete .... *smiles warmly* ... here is a post form her: <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
 &quot;As ye might have 'eard, I've returned my Hammer to the Tribunal, giving up my ways as a Shamaness to settle down with a nice Halas boy naemed Kraek, here in the West Commonlands. Now'days, the only castin ye see me doin' is with me fishin' pole ... &lt;snip&gt; ... As weeks passed and I found myself alone hunting and loosing the love that this Shaman had in the past. After realizing that I was nothing but a &lt;edit&gt; to those of Antonica, I decided to settle down to a life of fishing...&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ah, pardon the edits... *blush* She is a rather crash lass, indeed.<br>
<br>
The others are still young and are not aware of our presence, although I have seen the young Druid sister in Misty Thicket recently ridding the land of Orc Pawns with a passion. *chuckle*<br>
<br>
*sighs* Much has happened in my life since my last post, Kvael. I have a need to come to you in person to talk. I have ... experienced... a lot of conflict... with my feelings and my duties to the Goddess.<br>
<br>
*pauses*<br>
<br>
I must end this post here, I am being summoned by the House of Ancients at this time. *trembles in her writing*<br>
<br>
I bid you the blessings of Love, Kvael.<br>
<br>

The home of the Koada'dal people has always been very quiet and serene, a place where visitors are few and peace is an absolute law. Towards the north, there is a hidden path that leads to the Houses of Arcane powers. <br>
<br>
It is there, deep in the lower confines of the House of the Ancients of Erollisi Marr, where Malaehi is on her knees in prayer. The dark basement room has a solitary candle to provide warmth and light, failing miserably at both. Her Robe of Enchantment has been stripped and she's left wearing her faded green robe of the Apprentice. Droplets of blood soak through the linen where the penitent lass has been kneeling for three moons now. The Enchantress has been summoned here to meet with the Ancients of Erollisi Marr to explain her actions of late. <br>
<br>
She had broke her sacred vow to the Ancients of Erollisi Marr by falling in love with an &quot;untouchable&quot; one, breaking her vow of chastity and running away when summoned to answer for her crimes. But, it was her most unspeakable act that sent a piercing cry across the Frontier Mountains into Faydwer finally reaching into the heart of the Koada'dal femme Mistress Kae, of the Ancients. <br>
<br>
&quot;Malaehi!!&quot;. Kae screamed as she came out of her dream with a start. She donned her robe, summoned her servants to call for an emergency meeting of the Consul. <br>
<br>
Within minutes, the cold inner sanctum of the Ancients was lit up with candles as the Elders came in, roused from their sleep. Lord Kaer spoke first, &quot;Why was this meeting called, Mistress Kae?&quot; <br>
<br>
With a trembling voice, she recalled the vision of Malaehi in a white gown of gossamer stepping off the high mountain, plummeting to her death. &quot;This was neither accident, nor foul play... she has done this of her own choice, my Elders&quot;. Lord Kaer's eyes raged with fire as he dispatched a note to be sent to a Cleric of Tunare, Winnihym, to raise this vile child from her death. Lord Vaerli, the House Wizard stood without being asked and stepped into the shimmering blue portal to retrieve her. <br>
<br>
Now, preparing for her ordeal she has been in deep meditation, praying for mercy and understanding to be shown. Aye, the Goddess of Love herself shows compassion and knows the ways of a woman's heart, but the Consul... is less forgiving. <br>
<br>
Chanting the words of penitence, Mala's voice is dry and cracked. &quot;Goddess of Love, bringing balance to the world of Norrath, lifting the pall of hatred and terror and allowing life and love to prosper... I come to thee... again, begging for mercy. A young lass I was, brought to you, the shame of my people. Whisked away from my home in the Plane of Youth, I was enslaved under the fearful hand of Vri'Dril of Innoruuk, along with many other children of Norrath. My savior, the only mother I knew was a Teir'dal, and even she was banished from her people for her rebellious actions. Growing up in fear of being caught, I bonded tightly with my new family, all sisters from different races. When the Time of Release came, and I was old enough to walk on my own, I found myself her, my Goddess. Cut off from my family and the memories of them until I was much older, I embraced the creed of your followers. I swore the Oath of Chasteness, determined to only know the pure love, which releases all from the bondage of hatred.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi pauses, shakes her head to clear her thoughts, but his face appears in front of her when she speaks of love. She shrinks back into a ball, hugging her knees tightly to her chest, rocking slowly. Fresh tears pour down her face as she thinks of the thief who has stolen her heart. <br>
<br>
“Usst Ssins’Veldre, my shadowlover, this heart was never mine, it was always promised to the Goddess.&quot; Shivers run over her like a cool spring shower and Mala hugs herself tightly, whispering “...aye, my heart as well as body were not mine to give, nor yours... to take.” Her words where cut off by a painful blow to the back of her head, sending her back down on her knees to pray. The guard of the Ancient had slipped into her cell and caught her musings and followed orders without feeling. Malaehi felt a trickle of blood run down the back of her head, matching the pace and speed with which her tears flowed. &quot;Goddess of Love, bringing balance to the world of Norrath, lifting the pall of hatred and terror and allowing life and love to prosper... I come to thee... again, begging for mercy....&quot; The room goes black and tilts sideways, as Mala slips into oblivion. <br>
<br>
Mala's mind drifts off to the past...<br>

<br>
The Mission<br>
<br>
Standing at attention, not daring to move a muscle, nor blink, the gangly, young Malaehi stares straight across the room of the Ancients. Her Elders have put her through rigorous trials, testing her enchanting abilities, sending her on quests spanning the entire planet of Norrath. On the marble table before her lies the items she has acquired for the Consul, proving she is strong and worthy.<br>
<br>
A ghostly pale Koada'dal femme, hair the same hue of white as her skin, peruses the items with distain. She spits: &quot;You troublesome little guttersnipe, you dare come back into our presence?! You think these paultry items deem you worthy to be one of us?! Tell me, how can a castaway orphan be of any use to the Ancients of Erollisi?&quot;<br>
<br>
Keeping her eyes glued to the tapestry on the far wall, Malaehi answers: &quot;I am pure of heart and chaste of body. Tis my sole purpose to serve the Goddess and the Consul, Mistress Kiae.&quot; Malaehi's eyes glaze over breifly, knowing what is to come. An earsplitting spell is cast and the breath is ripped from her lungs, suffocating her for a few agonizing minutes. Before her eyes disappear into the back of her head, the Elder releases her spell, dropping Mala to her knees, gasping for air. <br>
<br>
The Elder laughs derisively making the parting shot, before she exits: &quot;I, a mere Enchantress, can do this, she will crumble in the face of a Necromancer or any other evil. My vote is send this orphan back to the forests of Nektulos!&quot; The others gaspsed as Malaehi gathered her strength, and stood up tall. Chanting words to clear her mind and invigorate her body, she is wasted over with a warm aura. <br>
<br>
Lord Kaer, a Koada'dal in the Crimson robe stood up pointing an accusing finger at Mala, &quot;Dare you cast without permission?!&quot; With fire in her eyes, as the Guards approached her, Mala screamed out the same words: &quot;I AM PURE OF HEART AND CHASTE OF BODY. TIS MY SOLE PURPOSE TO SERVE THE GODDESS AND THE CONSUL!&quot; She jerked her hands away as the guards tried to seize her, held her head regally and walked from the room, back into her chambers.<br>
<br>
The Elders were all silent, except for the most Ancient one. A willowy fair Koada'dal femme with unnaturally yellow hair and dark eyebrows, sitting behind the marble table, chuckled softly, &quot;So, the child wants to remain chaste and serve the Goddess, with a spirit like that?&quot; Her body shook with laughter, infectuous laughter at that, soon most of the room was enjoying the joke as well. All but one, who stepped out of the room and out to the balcony to wipe away her tears. The Ancient Kae, a Koada’dal femme with soft features and wide set eyes that stared off into the sunset, whispering a prayer, &quot;Goddess of Love, guide her now, she has been so lost and so forsaken, please give her direction.&quot; Her whispered voice cracks as she pleads, &quot;Be the Mother that should have been there for her&quot;. She crumples to the balcony floor as her image shimmers, illusion falling.<br>
<br>
Still reeling from the day’s events, Mala ran into the confines and security her room where she spent the next two days on her knees praying for guidance. Near the end of the second day, without food, water, Malaehi was deliriously chanting her prayers of meditation. Suddenly, under the crack of the door a warm pink glowing aura drifted in. The room filled with the soothing aura and Mala was lifted off her knees and into the air. She tried to open her eyes but the light was too brilliant, too painful to look at. In the tongue of the Ancients, the messenger of Erollisi Marr whispered words that comforted Malaehi, wiped her tears and giving her instructions. She was refreshed with the blessings of the Goddess, then tucked into her bed. The spirit left as quietly as it had entered as Malaehi drifted off into sleep. In her dreams she was able to understand the message:<br>
<br>
“The Dark and Light Paths must come to know the Love of Erollisi Marr. You will bring this message to all and bear the pain of the messenger. However, I will be with you, my child. Though you will see your death, I will never forsake you. Bear my message child.”<br>
<br>
Malaehi awoke with a start, gathered her things and ran into the Consul’s chambers, unannounced and uninvited. The guards immediately pushed her to the floor and silenced her with a spell. Six of the members of the Ancients were there in conference, and plainly ignored Malaehi’s intrusion. She stayed on the floor kneeled down, not speaking until spoken to for three hours. At last, the ghostly white Mistress Kiae, gazed over with a frown, released the spell of silence, saying: “You troublesome infidel of Malaeliu, why do you vex us?”<br>
<br>
“Hail the Goddess of Love, blessings be upon you all, I have news that is most important..” Malaehi said in a strangled voice.<br>
<br>
Lord Kaer glared at her and snorts: “What would you know of important things, wastrel? Dare you come to the Ancients to school US of importance? Your sniveling voice grates my nerves child of Malaeliu. Silence!” Throwing his hand up, the voice was taken away from Mala again, as tears of frustration streamed down her face. She concentrated hard and sent the telepathic message out to any of the Members who would hear. She recalled the recent events and the spectral visitor last night, and the command she was given. But, they continued to ignore her, and after another five hours they ordered the guards to remove her. Malaehi arrived in her room and stumbled into bed, crying herself to sleep, wondering what she had done. <br>
<br>
In her sleep, one of the Ancients crept into her room and slipped in her bag a note of components of a quest, some provisions and a map book. The Ancient Kae looked upon the sleeping girl, kissed her cheek and whispered: “You will know love as I have known, my ... my child”. Tears trickled down her face as her illusion slipped, revealing the identical features that Malaehi had inherited.<br>
<br>
Malaehi awoke and left Feliwithe bewildered by the harsh treatment, but inspired by the message and purpose she had in her life. She found the note in her bag and ran off to complete her quest, which would give her the gem clustered, golden Rod. She would use this for the rest of her days as an enchantress, to cast a warm glowing aura on all she met, attempting to charm and soften the hearts of all of Norrath. <br>

Her mother had told stories of the youthful Teir’dal priestess, whom she made armor for and her consort, the devilishly handsome wizard who failed to impress her with his flirtatious ways. Now these had grown in incredible power, their house had divided with the Wizard walking the solo path while the Priestess gathered the strength of numbers. She did her research too, donning an illusion she entered the frightening halls of Neriak Library and read the tomes that contained the history of this people. By the time the last book was closed, Malaehi had a fond attachment to this group and saw how misunderstood they were by many whom walks the path of the Light. <br>
<br>
With Rod in hand and a determined gleam in her eye, Malaehi hunted the band of Dark Ones, finding the Matron of the House and her consorts. For days she followed under the cloak of invisibility, learning about them, studying them. Elegant grace cloaked the Matron making Malaehi feel like a gangly, ugly child. Her face held the fine features and fresh kiss of youth, but it was her eyes that made Malaehi fear. She appeared to be all seeing, all knowing, as if she has lived this life in an endless cycle. She seemed neither surprised nor effected when Malaehi had decided to make her appearance. <br>
<br>
When the time was right, Malaehi dropped her cloak of invisibility, donned the illusion Teir’Dal and expressed her desire to join in the hunt. With a cool nod, she was invited to join the hunting party. The moons that passed were not easy as many put up an incredible resistance to Malaehi‘s appearance. In the constant attendance of the Matron was a powerful Enchanter. He held his serene features even in the heat of battle, controlling the minds of the beasts and soothing their rage. Malaehi became an apt pupil, learning much from this powerful Teir’dal. Another priestess attending to the hunting party had the very tongue of Innoruuk himself, setting Malaehi on edge, taunting the enchantress mercilessly about being an obvious innocent, the “Chaste One”. <br>
<br>
However, constantly standing in the shadows behind the hunting party, stood a fierce Teir’dal, whose eyes penetrated Malaehi’s soul. This rogue rarely stepped from the shadows except to sheath his dagger into the back of an offending beast, felling them one by one. It was those eyes that reminded Malaehi that she was deep in enemy territory and must watch her every step. If she were ever the prey, she had truly found the predator.<br>
<br>
In her quest to soften the hearts of these Teir’Dals, Malaehi found herself completely enamored with the Ogres and Trolls who served the House. Ah, these were easiest to win over, as Malaehi had a genuine love for these races. (Two of her younger sisters were of these races and she loved them fiercely). Dancing with the Ogres and Trolls made Malaehi’s heart rejoice and spread an infectious smile to all that watched. Malaehi would run back to her Lords in her Guild, begging to keep the Ogres or even one Troll. Of course, her request was denied time and time again.<br>
<br>
After hunting with this “Evil” clan for a while, she knew it was time to reveal her true identity, a Koada’Dal bearing the insignia of Coeur de Lion. Her mission was not from her Lord Artanos by any means, but from the very Goddess she made oath to serve. She was baffled that few were surprised, she thought her illusion was excellent. But, these people were far to clever for her simple tricks of the mind. None of her antics were those of the Teir’Dal, the illusion was simply cosmetic.<br>
<br>
Still... something was in the air, a subtle change had occurred, tangible enough to give the overconfident Enchantress enough rope to hang herself...<br>

<br>
Time has a way of bringing about change in a person. Be they Elf, Dwarf, Human, Gnome or even the mixed blood... Change is inevitable... and when it happens...<br>
<br>
It started again for Nathomin when the High Elf woman child named Malaehi began to hunt the hunters...<br>
<br>
Nathomin had sensed a ... Presence, watching the T'Vlosians as they hunted. He had felt it, but until it showed itself to be a danger he would simply keep ready. Ready he was, when the figure approached in the form of a Teir'Dal, he did not let down his guard. Too long had he hunted one of his own kin, too long had he walked the blood path of discord to let his guard down in trust. Nathomin realized that the one called Burnssoburn had done him a favor... but only one that could be repaid in blood. Never trust your own kind... Trust no one. Not even yourself. <br>
<br>
And so it was with wary eyes that he watched this one ask to join them in the hunt. She introduced herself as an Illusionist and this was her first mistake. Now Nathomin would watch even harder, wait with deadly patience for the true form to emerge... and when it did... when Malaehi revealed her true form, and the badge of the Coeur ... Anger... and a bitterness emerged...<br>
<br>
From the moment Malaehi had begun to hunt with the House, Nathomin had watched her with curiosity and a wary fascination. As she spoke of her goddess, his mind screamed out that she was just like the others of her kind, speaking of beauty and hiding the ugliness that was truth. Another one to weave lies for the young and inexperienced, leading them home with promises of welcome, and false hopes of being loved as they only love their own... No, Nathomin would not believe this one. However, his matron wanted to breach the walls of hatred, bridging the everlasting war between Teir'Dal and the other races, to take a first step to bring peace between T'Vlos and Malaehi's own Coeur de Lion. <br>
<br>
This in its self was enough to put Nathomin on guard. Too long had he known of the zealot Mallo and his blind followers. Their power was undoubted, their history one of growing power and relentless destruction of their enemies: Nathomin’s own people, and others who the leader of the Lions thought worthy of death. <br>
<br>
Now into his presence one of them came, and this highbred illusionist thought to preach her lies of hope. He spoke little to her for the most part; just watching her as his past had thought him to do... Wait, watch, and let the opportunity come when the first mistake is made, when they slipped up in their lies and spoke the words that would show their true colors. Then he could dispose of them simply, quickly...<br>
<br>
There were times when he thought that poisons could be used on this deceived Elf, for this is what he thought her to be: Deceived, deluded and lied to. He felt sorry for her, and wished there were something he could say to show her that her goddess' love was very conditional as evidenced by her own people. His people were surely shown no love, least of all any tolerance. Yes, he thought a poison would be best, one to make her sleep, so that cutting her throat would be painless ... for her at least. Nathomin imagined the feeling of slicing the soft flesh of her throat open and watching her life flow out of her... Moments like these served to remind him that IS what he had had to do. And the dark dreams that followed him for many months after. They did not bring him the feeling of power that his kind spoke of, nor the glory they said they reveled in. No. No glory, no power was ever gotten from such a death... Instead glory and honor came from killing those that believed the lies of their ancient, senile masters... Those who perused in the killing of the untrained guards of Nektulos, pathetic fools who were sent as fodder to roam the forest while King Thex sent his finest to posts where they did little but seek the blood of any who crossed their path. Xas... yes, for those he knew the blood lust that his people praised... Or so he had believed for long years.<br>
<br>
Change is inevitable... <br>
<br>
Malaehi had shared food and drink with the T'Vlosians, used her incantations to quicken their blades and clear the minds of the healers, and she spoke with such ease of tongue, jesting with the best of them. When she chose to drop her Teir'Dal illusion, the Guild name she wore revealed herself to be of the blood enemy of his lord Cyrric of the Order, and the sworn destruction of those who had become his friends... his family. She served the one who had sworn death to his Matron Ravensky, the center of his strength. This woman’s people hunted his wise, caring friend Ripert Deathstone. She served that illegitimate sewer rat of Qeynos, Mallo Artanos...<br>
Ahh but there was ... something... some quality in this woman child that made Nathomin's mind itch. He would wait and watch...<br>
<br>
Standing in the midst of those who would slay her, Malaehi held herself with pride, not the self-delusional pride of her people... but a self assured one revealed in her stance... More, it showed in her genuine caring... even to those who were her lords enemy.<br>
<br>
Nights and days wore on, the hunting would be disbanded for supplies... and though T'Vlos gathered in other places... still she came. She endured jabs theological and personal. Xas, she endured them and to Nathomin's ever-increasing amusement returned them with the fire of one that would not be shaken from her place.... Aye, so very self-assured. Nathomin had to know what it was that gave this person such power... How had she reached such a place in her mind... without the losses that he had endured, without the tests that he had been put through... He had to know if she was truly what she showed.... Or was it another illusion that hid something even more dangerous. <br>
<br>
She spoke of her goddess' and the grace of that being's love. But Nathomin had found a chink in this... Love... without Passion. For she was forbidden the touch of a man, forbidden the fullness that brings love down from the lofty places of the gods... and gives it to the mortals that spill their blood for the gods eternal wars... The love between man and woman had been excluded from her teachings, denied her. The passion that fuels, that which brings lovers together... that which raises a woman to defend her children from bloody death at a raiders hand, the passion that brings a hardened warrior to his knees, and gentles his hand to touch his children with a warm heart, or a lover with yearning...<br>
<br>
This passionless love... it is a lofty and admirable thing ... for gods. But for mortals, it is a pedestal of the most fragile crystal.... And the hammer of truth has no gentleness... Nathomin spoke to Malaehi of passion, its qualities, and some of its faults... But there could be no way to teach of passion... No way to teach... Nathomin could only show and guide..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughtersofmalaeliu>DaughtersOfMalaeliu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Penny Priddy</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/20/02 4:08:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~chasingsusan/women.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Fall of Malaehi- Meeting with Kaete</span><hr size=1> Malaehi walks into the humble house in the Western Commonlands, unannounced and is hit in the face with the ever-permeating smell of fish scales. She wrinkles her nose in distaste, reaching for the frosty datura flower she was recently given, to get the scent out of her nose. She mumbles: &quot;Why did Kaete have to go and marry a fisherman for the God's sake...&quot; <br>
<br>
No sooner had she finished her words, when into the room came the noisy Halas-born couple. What a sight! Kraek had picked Kaete up into his arms, kicked the door open and was seemingly feasting on her neck. Malaehi gasped loudly putting a fright into Kraek, who ended up dropping her sister Kaete on the floor with a big thud.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bloody Bristlebane, wench! Ye scared th' spirit out o' me!&quot;, Kraek boomed in the Barbarian tongue. Kaete clamored up from the floor, whacked Kraek in his broad chest, sending him back a few feet and breathless, &quot;See 'ow ye feel wit the spirit knocked out ov ye, oaf! Whut?! In faer ov me wee lil sister are ye?&quot;, she snorted. Rubbing her backside, she added: &quot;Gone wit ye clumsy self, gonna be days past afore I let ye naer me, now ye'v cracked me tailbone.&quot; With a an evil grin Kraek slips Kaete back into his embrace, moving his hands down where hers are &quot;Och, dinna be sayin' that to yer man, lass, I've known ye to be a strong healthy wench.&quot; <br>
<br>
Malaehi flushes with embarrassment and turns her head from the couple, coughing in discomfort. Kraek kisses Kaete soundly then heads outside back to fishing, whistling a happy tune.<br>
<br>
Getting down to business, Malaehi tries to be calm, sitting down at the rough wooden table and asks: &quot;I‘ve got the most incredible news!! Where are the sisters? I sent post for them to meet here on this day.“ Malaehi frowned in grave disappointment. Kaete gets up, touches her sister on the arm and looks up with concern. “Och, my sweetbabe Mala always tryin’ to get them together... Malaeli is too far gone in her hate and revenge for Mum’s death.” <br>
<br>
Malaehi jumps to her feet, “THAT’S the point!! Vri’dril is DEAD!“ Kaete stares in shock... tears well up in her eyes as a smile creeps to her lips. “Say th’truth lass?“ <br>
<br>
Years of pent up tears of frustration pour out of Mala’s eyes, sobbing “Tis true! The murderer of our Mother... our very our kidnapper has been executed along with his entire house!” The two sisters come together, clinging and crying. Mala chokes for air between her sobs of joy “It’s all over, Kaeteluv! It’s all over!! We can be a family again, sis!” Kaete asks “How, when... who did this?”<br>
<br>
Malaehi tells Kaete of the band of Teir’dals she has been hunting with for the past few months. “Once they found out who I was, I had to defend myself, trying to establish a common ground. I told them our family’s tale and that we grew up in Nektulos. As soon as I mentioned this, one of their own, a rogue, his face went pale with recognition. Later when her hunted alone, he told me that Vri’dril and his entire house had been brought to swift justice! Oh, Kaete!! Praise the Gods of Justice, his entire House had been dealt with!“<br>
<br>
Kaete jumped up, let out a victory “whoop” and Malaehi roared as the two danced around the room. Mala stopped and continued her grim tale “Aye, the Rogue himself saw Vri’dril’s head mounted on a stake in front of his house, serving as a warning to all of Neriak.” Malaehi shuddered with revulsion, but Kaete nodded with satisfaction, “So be it,” she walked over to pull out the lock of pure white hair that belonged to Malaeliu. Malaehi, reached into her bag and pulled the one she kept as well. <br>
<br>
The two sisters walked out into the moonlit night, to the lake, knelt down and prayed. Kaete took her shaman beads, said a few incantations in a tongue Malaehi did not understand. She took the two locks of Malaeliu’s of hair and braided it into her own “It has come to pass, at last, Mother ... we await your return.” Chills waved over Malaehi’s body at these cryptic words, and looked at her beautiful sister, wild tattooed face of the Tribunal and now with the beaded braids with her mother’s stark white hair weaved in with her honey blonde. Kaete nodded and stood up. “Tis time I go back to the Tribunal now, I’ve been away from the majiks fer long ‘nuff.” Malaehi hugged her sister tightly. <br>
<br>
As they walked back into the home, she thought how this news drew her so close to the rogue. The new respect that she had for her mother‘s people impelled her to actually want to be with them and learn more. She shared her thoughts with her sister “Doesn’t this show that these people know Justice and can be respected?” Kaete looked over with wisened eyes and sighed. “Lass, dinna ferget who yer dealin wit. Ye’v seen wit yer own eyes that our Mum wuz the exception to th’ rule, a fyne Teir’dal lady she wuz, but e’en she used ta worship th’ ol shrivened up Baesard o’ Hate ’imself. An ye know ’ow twisted an sick his followers kin be.” Malaehi frowned and started saying “But,...” <br>
<br>
“Och, wit yer ‘Buts’, lassie! Mind yer company, wench!” Kaete nags but Malaehi’s thoughts run back to the Rogue, teasing her constantly, speaking to her in the tongue of the Ancients, knowing she speaks it so poorly. Kaete gets up and pours two steaming mugs of tea, nudges one mug to her sister and says “Spaek his name luv.”<br>
<br>
Malaehi smiles and pictures his rare grin... “Nathomin D’Falivae...”<br>
<br>
Kaete sighs in exasperation, &quot;Well?! When wuz ye plannin' to tell me? I 'ear tell ye'v takin up wit the company o' the more stubborn sex. First it was the pasty faced Magician ye was holed up in Lower Guk with fer 3 days, then I 'ear you wuz in Velious savin' the life ov a Human who plants a kiss on ye'... bah.. in front of the Gods, Goddesses and all the leerin' folk standin' 'round! Then I 'eard ye waz spirited off with that leacherous wizard wit all the ladies&quot; Kaete slams her frying pan on the loud table with a bang, hollering: &quot;And now? 'Ave ye lost yer bleedin' mind? Consortin' with the evilest of all the males in Norrath?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi stands determined, face to ... well... shoulder with her towering sister. &quot;Are you quite finished piercing my ears, sister?&quot; Kaete bellows: &quot;No I'm not! I told ye' you 'ad the hunger in ye sister, but NOO, Miss high an' mighty had to go runnin' into the 'ouse of Prudes, swaerin' 'way her passion to some nameless cause!&quot; Calmness washes over Kaete's tattooed face, &quot;Sister, sweet luv ov my 'eart... find ye a nice man as I 'ave... Settle down and cool yer wanderlust, 'afore ye catch daemons ta pay, luv.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi reddens with rage, and with a deathly calm voice begins her defense. &quot;First of all, SISTER&quot;, sniffs her nose in the air haughtily, &quot;I would suggest you keep better company than the gossiping fishwives here in the village. The Mage you spoke of, aye I hunted with and he was nothing more than a kind gentleman aiding me in retrieving my stolen gown. Secondly, the Knight ... well, am I to be blamed for his impetuousness?” Mala blinks innocently. Kaete rolls her eyes and the two shared a sisterly giggle. Kaete raises an eyebrow, nudging Mala, “Welll???” <br>
<br>
“Nae, sister! A brave man he is, but he is a Knight of Shadows, compelled into the service of Innoruuk as a lad... BAH! Besides, it matters not! I am chaste and will take no man! The Knight wastes his time pursuing one who’s heart is not her’s to give.” Mala sighs and Kaete groans loudly, in sarcasm. <br>
<br>
Not to be deterred, Mala continues her defense, “As for the deposed Master of the House T’Vlos... I sought his company to better understand the history of the enemy of my Lord, and to carry the message from my Goddess.&quot; She shrugs and says “I was safe at all time, as he has his carnal attentions attended to by a priestess. Though my message from the Goddess fell upon his ears as if he were deafened. Love seems to mean one thing to Teir‘dals. Most interesting...” Malaehi fades of thinking of the band of Dark Elves she hunts with now. Kaete raises and eyebrow and prods her sister to continue.<br>
<br>
Malaehi’s mind wanders to the enigma of a male she has been hunting with for the past few months. This Teir’dal rogue who gave her the most wonderful news she has heard in her life, spars with her mentally, speaks with her in an intimate way sending her into a fury of blushes. Yet she longs for his company even now. <br>
<br>
Finishing her tea, she slams the cup down and says &quot;And I have 'consorted' with NO one!&quot; Her blushing face told no lies, as Kaete walked away seeing more than was said, hearing more than was told.<br>
<br>
