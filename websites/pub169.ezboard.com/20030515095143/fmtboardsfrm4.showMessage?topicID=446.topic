Unanamiously voted it down. So today our bargaining commitee and the people from the company met at 9. About 25 of us from 2nd and 3rd shift stood outside (4 degrees) with picket signs for 2 hours protesting.<br>
<br>
Almost everyone that drove by, and I mean alot drove by, all beeping their horns and giving us the thumbs up. I was pretty ecstatic that people were supporting us. To top that off, Perkins, which is right next door to the hotel the negotiations were taking place at, brought out a big tray with donuts and hot coffee for us. That almost brought a tear to my eye. Support during a tough time when 800 of us might be going on strike Wendsday morning because of unfair proposals means alot and the people in my area just made things look a bit brighter. <br>
<br>
I know this isn't about EQ, but I am over-joyed at the support by the people in my town <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vyrance>Vyrance</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/20/03 12:12:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=446.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The people in my area...</span><hr size=1> hug me <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qikkiq>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/20/03 2:04:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=446.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The people in my area...</span><hr size=1> I sincerely hope it works out for you, but I don't believe in strikes.  Striking is a cheater's way out of a sticky situation.<br>
<br>
If your poeple really felt the contract sucked, the proper, upstanding thing to do would be to tender your 800 resignations, and leave the property with due haste and composure.<br>
<br>
No picketing, no protesting... just let the company hire 800 new people (which they likely won't be able to do, and if they *CAN* it says something about the contract you turned down).  Best of all, you don't need a union, nor to pay union dues.<br>
<br>
Striking sends this message:  &quot;I really don't want to risk looking for a job somewhere else, and what you're offering isn't so bad that it makes me want to take a risk, but I'll kick up some stink and try to screw you for a better deal.&quot;  In the end the company is at the mercy of the employees unless the jobs they offer require so little skill that they could get any monkey off the street to do it.  So why strike... Quit like a man.<br>
<br>
I have a lot more respect for people who put their ass on the line to achieve their goals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barradmallas>BarradMallas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/20/03 2:29:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=446.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The people in my area...</span><hr size=1> Please dont take this as a rant because it most definatly is not. The support your community is showing is very admirable and I'm happy for you.<br>
<br>
Now, let me tell you a little story.<br>
<br>
A trucking Company in Utah is striked twice over a 5 year period by the union in their area. Wage and benefits increases were the goal. This was a very large trucking company with hubs all over the US but based out of Utah. I knew people who worked there. Starting wages were well over $12.00 an hour...for dock workers.. no specialized training, no diploma required, just lugging freight. Drivers with a CDL doing local routes...17 or 18 dollars an HOUR to start..Fuel costs go up, business slows down, and yet along comes strike number two in under 5 years for even MORE money for the employees.<br>
The company is paralyzied by the strike so eventually they negotiate a settlement and everyone goes back to work.<br>
<br>
Its now 2 years later.<br>
The company took out a bankruptcy a couple months ago...All those people who pushed the company even when the freight industry was suffering?<br>
<br>
Well.....they are all now unemployed, along with all the others who weren't involved in the labor dispute. The company shut down due to lack of profits. Total unemployed? over 8,000 people.<br>
<br>
Cosider this, just how bad is what you are making and your benefits now..Look at other employers around you with the same type of jobs...is your current package REALLY that bad?<br>
<br>
The moral of the story is alot of times whats best for the company is also best for the employees. When a company is low on funds for whatever the reason, employees usually take a hit on it. and for good reason. Company #1..then employees..OR..this story is a good example of what happens.<br>
I wish you luck, but just remember, you may get what you ask for..at the cost of the company and your very own job you are fighting for now.<br>
<br>
BTW,<br>
Just so you know I do understand this from a first hand perspective, I was laid off after the Major computer maker I worked for closed down its production facility I worked at.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you,<br>

I grew up in a die-hard Teamster household.  My post here would be considered heresy if any of my relatives saw it and they'd want me burned at the stake... or more likely buried in cement somewhere (wink).<br>
<br>
Before I left home, the discussion of strikes came up once over dinner.  I ran the math on all my dad's pay for the last 7 years (at the time) and we figured out that if there'd been no strikes and the union had accepted the company's first offer, he'd have made more money over that time... His wage would be lower, but he wouldn't have lost those months of work either.<br>
<br>
Teachers where I live went on strike a couple years ago and stayed out so long it will take them 12 years to break even financially, by then many will be retired, so those ones all lose.<br>
<br>
I just changed jobs.  In September, due to my salary having been frozen for 2 years, and being well below market rates for my line of work, I asked for a cost of living raise equal to the CPI index for the last 2 years (about 3% total).  I was told no... no money in the budget.  I explained that I had brought in 4x my salary in billable work, showed evidence of being paid below market, produced the company's own numbers that showed our group was making and exceeding its targets.  Still no.<br>
<br>
So I found another job that actually pays considerably more than the CPI increase I asked for.  I resigned and detailed exactly why to my (former) supervisor and to human resources.<br>
<br>
The old company i worked for is having problems staffing my position, and their bottom line is going to suffer because they were selfish.  Word got out about why I left, and 3 other people left for the same reason.  Now the company is scrambling a bit... seems that if you screw people to save a buck, you might have nobody left to actually do the work - in effect they screw you back.<br>
<br>
Either they will improve the situation, or they will go under.  Either way, problem solved.<br>
<br>
If you're good at what you do, never be afraid to tell an employer to bite.  If you're going to threaten to stop work, go all the way and don't look back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannabulon>Cannabulon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.eiga.com/extra/images/chinpokomon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secret Master of the<BR>Marshmallow Silique</span><br>  Posts: 516<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/20/03 4:59:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=446.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://burtcom.com/athf/frylock.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The people in my area...</span><hr size=1> I agree that sometimes unions toe the fine line between legal and Organized Crime, many times they totally overstep that line and stomp all over it.<br>
<br>
However, when we look at a world before unions, we find some horrible goings on, business owners abusing people, ignoring basic human rights, putting workers in danger, paying next to nothing, no benefits, nothing.<br>
<br>
Labor unions fixed all this, (some argue they create a whole new set of problems) and even though we live in a world (or at least a country) where we dont have to worry about being chained to our sewing machine, I still think theres a need for them, maybe even unionization in other areas...<br>
<br>
with all the recent incidents of corporate bullshit, one has to wonder if pasty-faced fax jockeys are the next ones in need of labor unions =) Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, Imclone. The time of abusive bosses isnt over yet =/<br>

That's assinine at best. These people have house payments, car payments, child support, other various bills, most are living paycheck to paycheck. We do get strike pay (125 a week, uber!), and these people would not be willing to strike if the contract wasn't as bad as it is. The company surely would hire 800 scabs, that's apparent, what company wouldn't? Just like every other company in the world, it's quantity &gt; quality.<br>
<br>
Trust me, if you know what happens during a strike, then you of all people should know it's a last resort. People lose everything they have, and it's quite honorable to back your fellow brothers and sisters imho. Personally, I despise unions, because they just keep deadbeats and stoners their jobs. People like myself would rather save the dues a pay a week because I would have a job with or without one. However, I doubt I would have free insurance and good wages right now if we didn't have a union.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=446.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=446.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=446.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=446.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.threadControl?topicID=446.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=446.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=446.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm4>Raves and Accomplishments</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
