<br>
<br>
ROFL!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
of course, we, here in the US like to refer to Democrats as &quot;domestic French&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
some good arguements, some bad ones. anyone who says this war isnt partially about money/oil is an idiot. BUT anyone who says this war is ONLY about oil/money is a bigger idiot.  would we be fighting it if it was in certain south american or central american countries (were dictators more ruthless than saddam have killed many more than saddam in teh last 10 years).. ? probably not.<br>
<br>
did george W make his case tieing in terrorism to saddam?  didnt convince me. <br>
<br>
BUT....<br>
<br>
keep in mind several things. 12 years ago, when i WAS in the desert, we let saddam go. we made promises to the Iraqi people that if they rose up and fought saddam, 'uncle sam' would back them. did we? no. we allowed saddam to murder and oppress those people who fought for freedom, in the name of global peace, and cowing to the U.N.. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://india39.com/frenchsurrender.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
12 years have not seen Saddam lesson his throat hold on his people. he continues to be a disruptive influence on affairs in the middle east. in an oil based economy, this instability causes economic turmoil world wide. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://india39.com/inspectors.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
In America, our leaders hold power not through threat of torture, military force, or rite of birth. they hold power due to a political system which, on the surface, lets the populous give power to the leaders. througout history, presidents and congress has held power through the economic success of the country.  in the face of economic failure, presidents look outward for ways to rally the public.  so, here is a way to accomplish (possibly) several tasks, each important, but not important enough to wage war individually.  in no particular order:<br>
<br>
- economic reasons<br>
- anti-terrorism<br>
- end the saddam regime, and free iraq <br>
- institute a pro-american(pro-western) government into iraq<br>
- stabilize the middle east<br>
- economic reasons<br>
<br>
<br>
anyway, i wholly support our president, and our troops overseas, and wish them a speedy victory. i may not totally agree with the decision to go to war, but i DO support our governmental system. i wont always agree with every decision they make, but, I am happy they are making decisions.<br>
<br>
now, if the french support us, or dont, i really dont care. after all, going to war without the french, is like going deer hunting without an accordian..<br>
<br>

<br>
while you go to bed tonite, in your comfortable home, dormroom, or cardboard box, safe in knowing that you will wake up, please think about the soldiers who are right now risking thier lives. before you dis the war, think of those soldiers familys, friends, children, parents, who simply dont know if they will return. while your EXPing, raiding, or goofing off, take confort in the knowlege that when you die, some cleric may rez you. think about it. how well did YOU sleep last nite? <br>

and lastly, while you all sit here and rant the french, or americans, or G.W.Bush, please remember those who have given thier lives in this conflict, not becuase they wanted to do so, not for oil, economics, or even political idealogy, but because they swore an oath to defend democracy.<br>

They're not Danish men.  Do you not see the hypocrisy inherent in you accusing *US* of meddling in the affairs of other countries?  It's fine for you to make ignorant, uneducated comments regarding American foreign policy, yet it's wrong for the American Secretary of State to say that the UN's impotence kills more innocents every year than the US military ever could?<br>
<br>
Do you have any idea how many hundreds of thousands of innocent people Saddam has killed?  Have you ever been there?  Have you ever been anywhere in the Arab world?  If the answer is no, than what exactly is it that you think makes you qualified to express your comments on the matter?  Rest assured that for every Iraqi soldier that has bought into Saddam's regime, there are 100 more who welcome the Americans.  Understand that violence is necessary, to prevent exponentially MORE violence in the future.  <br>
<br>
Iraq not a threat?  Ask the British about the ricin in London, that was traced DIRECTLY back to Al-Qaeda operatives operating in Northern Iraq.  After you ask, try to convince yourself that a totalitarian megalomaniac like Saddam *really* didn't know they were there, despite the fact that he was funneling money and weapons to them to fight the Kurds.  Now ask yourself whether those same Al-Qaeda operatives were connected to the ones that flew the 9/11 flights.  I'm sure they would NEVER have even considered using any of those neurotoxins against the American people.  No sir, they're harmless.  <br>
<br>
You seeing the big picture yet?    <br>

<br>
im assuming you have never served in the armed forces of your country.<br>
<br>
&quot;What kind of democracy do you get when you dictate other countries what to do?&quot;<br>
<br>
please dont oversimplify. we are not dictating to IRAQ what IRAQ should do. we are dictating to the REGIME what IRAQ should do.  the overwhelming majority of Iraqis want Saddam out of power, want the terror, the suffering, and the class disparity to end. im no fool either, im sure whatever government is instituted once we win this war will be both democratic, and pro-US.  but i also guarantee that the majority of iraqis will be better off when saddam is gone.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, I am not disregarding the sacrifice... I am just soo very angry because even ONE! of these men had to die.&quot;<br>
<br>
the frustrating part is that i dont wholly agree with the WAR. but i cant stand idiots who protest at military bases, factorys, or places that have NO IMPACT WHATSOEVER on the political decision to go to war.  here, in america, we value our rights to make asses of ourselves. to openly protest the war, or any decision made by our government.<br>
<br>
but if your going to protest, protest the WAR, not the WARRIOR.  whenever i see soldiers going to work in domestic bases, having to drive though hordes of protesters, it makes me want to puke. go to your state government building. write letters to your congressmen, or make a million man march on washington/whitehouse to get your points across.. but dont target those americans who are doing what they are told, in service to thier country. I dont know how many of you have actually pulled the trigger to kill another man, but i can tell you it is a serious thing. getting your rifle, is all cool and @#%$, and its neat to show army pictures to your buddies,  but when your there, looking down the sights at your &quot;enemy&quot;, a man, just like you, who may have family, may not.. someone who, a few weeks earlier, or a few weeks later might be a drinking buddy, a peer, or just some dude on the street in a country you didnt know existed a month before.... all bullshit aside.. anyway, you dont pull the trigger because of oil. you dont end his life because of economics. you kill that soldier because that is what soldiers do. and if you dont, he will kill you. its not an easy thing to do, or to live with. and when you are overseas doing that, the LAST thing you want in the back of your mind, is some antiwar @#%$ harassing your family, your friends, or your place of work.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sylpheden>Sylpheden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/7/03 1:08:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=548.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> hmmm just when did i protest the warriors?? <br>
<br>
Why do you state that the majority of the people in Iraq wants Sadam removed from power? Does that mean that America have the right to start a war? Ohh and who did the actual asking? <br>
<br>
You are probably right... that country will have a pro american goverment after the war. If you suspect there is the slightest chance that they can not make one them selfes, I am confident you will elect one for them ..... in the best interest of democracy ofcourse.<br>
<br>
The pictures of soldiers and the list.... those were emotional arguments. But, I don't need pictures or lists to know that people are dieing. I don't see that people dieing justifies war.... To me it is an argument for peace.<br>
<br>
All of these men knew they could die, all of these men knew they were suposed to kill. That is just horible. No learned philosofy, no oath and no good intentions can justify this.<br>
<br>
Only one thing can.... to me a man can kill when he or his dear ones are in imediate danger. The danger was not to America. <br>
<br>
This could have been resolved without a war. If the world had tried to resolve the problem instead of placing blame. Now people have died. American soldiers, Iraqi soldiers and iraqi civilians.<br>
<br>
Yes, Saddam have comitted terible crimes. So put him on trial like any other criminal. If the situation had been resolved peacefully, the iraqi could do what chile never did..... they could put the dictator on trial  and convict him. Now they are deprived this libaration. <br>
<br>
I do not defend Sadam, I do not defend his regime. What I do defend is a nations right to look for a more peacefull solution. France have a right to decline a war. France is not a coward because of this. If anything, it took some courage to stand against America in this matter. <br>
<br>
I also defend the right of the iraqi people to find their own solution. They have not been given this option. Please, if you tell me that the iraqi is pro this war... also tell me when they voted... The fact is that you are equaly ignorant to me in these afairs... I can not be sure that the statistics don't lie.<br>
<br>
Ohh you are right, I never did join the armed forces. I saw no need to. I am not quite sure I could kill for my country. I do know that I could die for my country, that one is easy, but to kill...<br>
<br>
I will at any time fight for my country, but I pick the weapons. My weapon of choise is not a gun,  my weapon of choice is non cooperation, civil disobediance and even sabotage. <br>
<br>
So if you find your self occupying my country, you will find getting the people you don't like out of harms way, you will find me refusing to work for you and you will find me sabotaging your means of transport, your means of comunication and any respect for your reign that you try to built.<br>
<br>
I am not saying this because I have never been faced with violence or because I fear violence. I don't fear it, I just will not support it by taking part in it. Yes, you can get bruises this way.... But you can still resolve even very violent situations by peacefull means.<br>

I'm glad to see that this dialogue turned into an opportunity for you to advertise what YOU would do if YOUR country were occupied.  <br>
<br>
You conspicuously avoided addressing the fact that Hussein has been committing genocide on a regular basis for decades.  Civil disobedience is a very noble concept, but once again you're projecting your own values onto a completely disparate culture.  Try non-aggressive disobedience in pre-war Iraq and you'd have found yourself on the business end of a cattle prod while your feet were in a bucket of water.  You're still laboring under the ideological illusion that Hussein and his ilk play by the same rules as the rest of us.  They don't.<br>
<br>
The Middle East (particularly Iraq/Iran/Syria) is not Europe.  You can embrace the philosophies of Gandhi and Martin Luther King right up until the point when the secret police kick in your door and drag you out with a black bag over your head.  <br>
<br>
How were the Iraqi people to find their own solution?  The same way the Russians did under Stalin?  The comparison is dead-on.  How do you rise against a regime that punishes even the most moderate protests with torture and death?  How can you speak out, let alone enact armed rebellion, against a government that murders your wife and children in front of you before killing you?  <br>
<br>
The rest of the world turns a blind eye to regimes like this and pretends that they don't exist.  America is as guilty of this as anyone.  Ask the 900+ residents of the Congo who were massacred this weekend how they feel about the UN's diplomatic efforts to enact a regime change there.  Ask them how they feel about the peace process.  Ask the 3,000 victims of the WTC bombing how effective they think diplomacy was in dealing with Afghanistan.  Ask the thousands of one-armed children in Sierra Leone who are the victims of government (and rebel) mutilation squads how happy they are for the peaceful resolutions being pursued for their country.  Ask the residents of the mass graves in Srebrenica and Rwanda.  Think about this tonight while you're playing Everquest:  <br>

Does that mean that America have the right to start a war?&quot;<br>
<br>
yes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohh and who did the actual asking?&quot; <br>
<br>
habib akbar husien <br>
<br>
&quot;You are probably right... that country will have a pro american goverment after the war. If you suspect there is the slightest chance that they can not make one them selfes, I am confident you will elect one for them ..... in the best interest of democracy ofcourse.&quot;<br>
<br>
well, of course.<br>
<br>
&quot;The pictures of soldiers and the list.... those were emotional arguments. But, I don't need pictures or lists to know that people are dieing. I don't see that people dieing justifies war.... To me it is an argument for peace.&quot;<br>
<br>
it doesnt justify war.  it justifies SUPPORTING THE TROOPS.  hopefully, the Iraqi regime will see the futility of war, and there will soon be peace.<br>
<br>
&quot;All of these men knew they could die, all of these men knew they were suposed to kill. That is just horible. No learned philosofy, no oath and no good intentions can justify this.&quot;<br>
<br>
in a world with borders, Armys are needed. untill everyone is willing to respect thier neighbors ideaologys, and permit ideas and ways of life they may find offensive within thier borders,  the need to wage war will exist. <br>
<br>
&quot;Only one thing can.... to me a man can kill when he or his dear ones are in imediate danger. The danger was not to America.&quot; <br>
<br>
tell that to the survivors of 9/11. tell that to American Allies who saddam has ruthlessly killed. tell that to britian, where ricen was found and traced back to Iraq.  we had been attacked. we saw the threat of future attack, and we took action. <br>
<br>
&quot;This could have been resolved without a war. If the world had tried to resolve the problem instead of placing blame. Now people have died. American soldiers, Iraqi soldiers and iraqi civilians.&quot;<br>
<br>
for 12 years, we attemped to resolve this without war. how long should we have waited? untill saddam died of old age, and his insane son took over? saddam at least has some of the qualitys of a ruler, who realizes he needs his people in order to stay in power, his son is a butcher, plain and simple.  how long is enough time? <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, Saddam have comitted terible crimes. So put him on trial like any other criminal. If the situation had been resolved peacefully, the iraqi could do what chile never did..... they could put the dictator on trial and convict him. Now they are deprived this libaration.&quot; <br>
<br>
they tried, and were gassed. 100,000 civilians dead, gassed by chemical ali, on orders from saddam.  how exactly do they do it, when anyone who voices outrage could find his wife and daughter gang raped while he is forced to watch, knowing that when the &quot;police&quot; are done with his wife and children, he will be beaten to death while THEY watch, before they are raped again.   THAT is how saddam and his sons deal with internal uprisings. <br>
<br>
&quot;I do not defend Sadam, I do not defend his regime. What I do defend is a nations right to look for a more peacefull solution. France have a right to decline a war. France is not a coward because of this. If anything, it took some courage to stand against America in this matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
France stands to lose considerably economically, as as much as 10% of thier economy can be traced to iraqi oil.  let them stand by thier decision. <br>
<br>
&quot;I also defend the right of the iraqi people to find their own solution. They have not been given this option. Please, if you tell me that the iraqi is pro this war... also tell me when they voted... The fact is that you are equaly ignorant to me in these afairs... I can not be sure that the statistics don't lie.&quot;<br>
<br>
i do know that iraq was not given the chance to vote. when over 70% of the population attempted to rise up, saddam turned his army loose on them and forced them into submission.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ohh you are right, I never did join the armed forces. I saw no need to. I am not quite sure I could kill for my country. I do know that I could die for my country, that one is easy, but to kill...&quot;<br>
<br>
and that is a choice i respect.  but keep in mind that there are many support roles that 'probably' wont involve killing in most modern armys.  if you had the desire, you could serve outside of the role of combat arms. immagine the benefit you could offer as a doctor, nurse, or whatever.  dont think that wearing a uniform means you have to take life. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will at any time fight for my country, but I pick the weapons. My weapon of choise is not a gun, my weapon of choice is non cooperation, civil disobediance and even sabotage.&quot;<br>
<br>
and i simply cannot respect this arguement.  i dont know what country you are from, but, i cannot immagine a society where sabotage of ones own government is accepted, or respected.  <br>
<br>
&quot;So if you find your self occupying my country, you will find getting the people you don't like out of harms way, you will find me refusing to work for you and you will find me sabotaging your means of transport, your means of comunication and any respect for your reign that you try to built.&quot;<br>
<br>
so, if your government turns oppressive, randomly kills people, allows its soldiers to rape your women, steal your goods, forcibly conscript your sons, and start ruling through terror, think about who you will call for help. who will offer thier lives to help you recover yours? thats right. the U.S. armed forces.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I am not saying this because I have never been faced with violence or because I fear violence. I don't fear it, I just will not support it by taking part in it. Yes, you can get bruises this way.... But you can still resolve even very violent situations by peacefull means.&quot;<br>
<br>
how many people must die in the time it takes non-violence to work? sometimes, you must simply say enough is enough, and take action. <br>
<br>
&quot;I am not soft pretty pink idealogist..... I am the agresive outgoing 'doer'. I get this atitude of yours from army types alot.... then if they end up experience it, they just tell me it scares the living daylight out of them.'<br>
<br>
i dont knwo what 'attitude' your talking about. i SUPPORT my government, and soldiers. i dont always agree with them, but i SUPPORT them. to do any less, would be.. unpatriotic.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chrispycj8>ChrisPycj8</A> at: 4/7/03 1:53:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heisenberguncertainus>Heisenberg Uncertainus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/7/03 2:20:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=548.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1>  i don't  like the fact that my friends are going  fighting/dieing in this war but after reading some of  this i am struck by some people's pacifist motives??<br>
<br>
here is an example for you you don't feel we should tread on another nations  soil except in defense and that people in iraq should solve their own problems?  seems a bit disengenous<br>
<br>
consider if we had done that during WW1 or WW2  (which most americans at the time were leaning to do anyways prior to lusitania/and pearlharbor).?<br>
<br>
German would be your native language now ?<br>
<br>
If you see a person being beaten to death in a street and there is noone around to help what do you do? let him die or call the police and then rush out to save him?<br>
<br>
Well the police (UN) don't answer most calls for help  there are alot of people losing their lives and the  potential for more to lose their lives as well and it was time to rush out with a big stick andd put a stop to it.<br>
<br>
I don't much like DubbaBush and i  didn't  like how this was approached from the begining <br>
but there is and was a problem in Iraq we failed to correct the problem the  first time and made promises to the  people in iraq to rise up .. and they did and they died when courtesy of pressure from middle eastern countries and the UN we buckled and  walked the @#%$ away fromm  the situation.<br>
<br>
I find it funny that  Germany and France  two countrys that benfited from us stepping  in and spending tons of  American Blood,lives and money   for similar reasons<br>
 <br>
how quickly the Benfactees forget...<br>
<br>
Be happy that atm the guy with the biggest stick  on the block atm happens to care about some stranger being beaten to death in the streets and is going to stop it whatever his myriad reasons are.....<br>
<br>
Personally i  hope this sets the stage for actively policing/destroying other regimes and areas where people don't have the rights that we do......<br>
<br>
There has been a lot of injustice swept under the carpet globally and perhaps it is time for some  house cleaning...<br>
<br>
of course when it is all done when  we give freedom a chance to live and breathe in these countries .. just like we did yours hopefully they will remember, respect, and be grateful...<br>
<br>
But in 20ty years or so they prolly will be  just like you and whine when we solve some other poor nations problems.<br>

<br>
lets look at a bit of recent history...<br>
<br>
THE WAR DURING 1940<br>
<br>
Early in April Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. Denmark accepted the &quot;protection&quot; that Germany offered the two countries. Norway, however, instantly declared war.<br>
<br>
British troops landed in Norway, but they were unable to stop the German advance. In May the British forces were evacuated. On June 9 Norway fell. King Haakon VII escaped and set up a government in exile in London<br>
<br>
In its conquest of Norway Germany was aided by its fifth column. These were Germans and Norwegian Nazis led by Maj. Vidkun Quisling. The term fifth column came from the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. There the fascist general Emilio Mola, leading four columns of troops on Madrid, boasted that he had a fifth column of sympathizers inside the city. Another term used for such traitors was quisling, from the name of the Norwegian Nazi.<br>
<br>
Invasion of the Low Countries<br>
<br>
On May 10 German forces invaded Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Luxembourg was occupied without resistance. Belgium and The Netherlands declared war.<br>
<br>
Winston Churchill now replaced the aged Neville Chamberlain as prime minister of Great Britain. The Allies sent troops into the Low Countries.<br>
<br>
On May 14 the Dutch army had to give up the fight. The Netherlands was quickly brought under the rule of German forces of occupation. Queen Wilhelmina fled to London. There she formed a government in exile <br>
<br>
Dunkirk Evacuation; Italy Enters War<br>
<br>
King Leopold of Belgium surrendered his army on May 28. The Allies had no choice but to attempt an escape by sea. From May 29 to June 4 the Allies evacuated 360,000 men from Dunkirk.<br>
<br>
The battle of France began June 5. The Germans attacked along a 100-mile front from near Laon to the English Channel. They smashed through the French forces and headed for Paris. At this point Italy declared war on Great Britain and France.<br>
<br>
Fall of France<br>
<br>
On June 11 the French government moved to Tours and later to Bordeaux. Paris was occupied by the Germans June 14. The French cabinet voted in favor of an armistice on June 16. Marshal Henri Petain, the 84-year-old hero of World War I, became premier. He asked the German government to state its terms.<br>
<br>
The Franco-German armistice was signed June 22 in the forest of Compiegne. It was signed in the same railway car in which France had dictated its terms to a beaten Germany 22 years before. The Franco-Italian armistice was signed on June 24. More than half of France was now occupied by German troops. This included France's entire Atlantic coast and its northern area from Geneva almost to Tours.<br>

WOW  could you take this to tell.<br>
<br>
All this long winded rhetoric is getting to be a bit annoying.<br>
<br>
Wether you agree with the war or not it is to late.   The US in not going to leave now they are there until it is done.<br>
<br>
Do we have the right, no one has the right to start wars.  but once again it is to late it is started.<br>
<br>
Do the french surrender better than anyone else of course they have had centuries of practice.  IF the french had giving the surrender class to Iraq while selling them weapons and buying their oil this would have been over last week.  <br>

I guess you're saying that having the French sit around chain-smoking Gitanes and chomping down on their croissants while allowing Saddam to make chemical and biological weapons that would be used to threaten Iraq's neighbouring states as well as the U.S is fine. I mean, giving French youth their &quot;How to Surrender, The French Way&quot;  and &quot;Running Away 101&quot; lessons is much more important.<br>

Please note that BOTH make a point that they could be false positives, thus more testing is needed. I wouldn't call that 'mass control' by the media. More like actual journalism, as they DON'T have all the facts as to whether it's  actually a chemical weapon.<br>

The French military is one of the active in the world, they've been nation building in their old colonies, mostly Africa, at a rate of about one military operation per year for the past half century.  Right now they have troops in the Ivory Coast playing peacekeeper during a civil war (and mostly backing the current government).<br>
<br>
The difference is, the French wait to be invited, they respect the sovereignty of the nation involved.  They may certainly play fast and loose with local laws, but they've never violated international law (not and got caught, anyway).  When they sunk the Rainbow Warrior it was done by intelligence agents who were tried and convicted under kiwi law, not by a missle from a French warship.<br>
<br>
There are ways to do these things and unilateral invasion ain't it.  We can't just allow countries to invade each other because the other guy's president has a silly mustache.  We're slipping back into the bad old days of nationalism and constant warfare that we were finally forced to put aside by the threat of global nuclear war. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarion81>Sarion81</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/7/03 5:47:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=548.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Well, I wish I had more time but I gotta run to class, damn lab...<br>

One difference is we have a responsible, democratic government.  If Iraq was under control of a reasonable person I wouldn't have a problem with them having WMDs.  In fact, we'll probably never, ever use these weapons.  Since we have so many, no one is stupid enough to use them against us except for madmen, and thats why they exist.  Secondly, we're currently in the process of a fairly massive campaign to get rid of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>most</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of ours.  Of course Russia won't sign because they don't support the war.  Want us to get rid of ours, talk to Russia.<br>

<br>
So, what you're saying, if Iraq would have had a lot biological, chemical and possibly nuclear weaponry, that would suddenly be cool, because hey, if they were foolish enough to launch, it would just be to retaliate and remove Iraq from the worldmap. But on the other hand, having few weapons (or even being hinted at having) however means you're a danger to the world and must be elminiated at all costs?<br>
I wouldn't call all the countries that sports nuclear weaponry today even near extraordinary well-disciplined and/or democratic, but that these states possessing &quot;weapons of massdestruction&quot; are cool, because they would have to be crazy enough to know they would be green cinders a few hours later if they launched, right?<br>
It takes a few very, very bad persons and a bit of misscommuncations and we're all dust.<br>
<br>
I don't quite see Russia, nor France, India, China, England or any other country possesing nuclear warheads any better, possibly even worse. I see it as quite commendable that the US wants to disarm their own. Terrorbalance is a fools game with only one possible outcome as long as the weapons still exists.<br>
<br>
I never claimed that the US would be using nuclear weapons. However, possesing &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; was one of the reasons Iraq was invaded, I merely hinted that they (if they now have) wouldn't quite be alone in this field, or even make it to the high score list. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tariden>Tariden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/7/03 8:57:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=548.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re</span><hr size=1> Hey Tanzoi,<br>

<br>
its not the possession of weapons of mass destruction that matters. its the fact that he was specifically banned from possessing them in 1991, after he proved incapable of using them purely for defense.<br>
<br>
in america, we have the right to bear arms (own handguns and stuff).  however, if you committ a felony using a handgun, you forfeit that right.  once released, mere possession of a handgun is grounds for sending you right back to prison, regardless if you use it to commit another felony or not.<br>
<br>
THAT is why we went in on the search for WMD's.  when Saddam sued for peace in 1992, one of the terms was NONE of these in his possession, we gave him TWELVE YEARS to dispose of them, under the conditions HE AGREED TO, and he failed to do so.<br>
<br>
also, nico, i wont debate any of the 'facts' you made regarding american US policy. i will say that it is my OPINION that in the majority of each of those issues, the amount of deaths was probably LESS than leaving the status quo.<br>
<br>
look at the bombing of nagasaki/hiroshima. we fried millions of japanese men, women, and children. however, it is ESTIMATED that the cost in lives to end the war in the pacific would have been 5 times that amount.   <br>
<br>
if your going to tell one side of a story, dont be offended by the reality of the situation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left
