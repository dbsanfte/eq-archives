This is a tricky thing Paf, you see &quot;High THC level&quot; means nothing more than they were heavy pot smokers. Marijuanna doesnt metabolize out of the system for 30 days or more sometimes, so the problem with the argument of &quot;They were high&quot; is that they could have been high 3 hours, 8 hours, or 10 days ago.<br>

<br>
I agree with the first three, however the short term memory thing, that is only WHILE high, there is NO research showing long term memory impairment or damage to memory. If you have it by all means let me know which medical journal that appeared in, or quote the study with paranthetical documentation because I wont believe that till I see it.<br>

Substances affect different people different ways; some people could smoke an ounce of pot on their own in a 12 hour period and still be perfectly in control of their faculties; some people smoke a single joint and have a nervous breakdown.  There are several other factors to it beside simple numeric chemical representation--.12 BAL for some people may mean they're stumbling drunk; for others it may mean that they can do cartwheels down the median line when the cops ask them to walk it.  <br>
<br>
Body chemicals are wacky things, and here's a little tip:  if you're on anti-depressants, or you have a history of some kind of hormone imbalance, stay away from recreational drugs, k?  <br>

Also, there is this.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Marijuana's damage to short-term memory seems to occur because THC alters the way in which information is processed by the hippocampus, a brain area responsible for memory formation. Laboratory rats treated with THC displayed the same reduced ability to perform tasks requiring short-term memory as other rats showed after nerve cells in their hippocampus were destroyed.65 In addition, the THC-treated rats had the greatest difficulty with the tasks precisely during the time when the drug was interfering most with the normal functioning of cells in the hippocampus<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Now, if we look at pot as just a chemical substance (meaning take all the hyperbole and rhetoric out of the discussion), you'll find that, just like alcohol, it can have adverse effects to the body when ingested in large amounts over long periods of time.  There is also research out there that indicates some beneficial uses of THC can be extrapolated.  <br>
<br>
Take the issue of glaucoma treatment.  Research has indicated that THC has been beneficial in treating glaucoma.  Research has also indicated that there are many other medicines and compounds that do it better and more efficiently.  What if someone is allergic to those other medicines?  Try THC administered via pharmaceutical.  It's a cleaner dose and the body doesn't have to ingest the hundreds of other carcinogens found in weed (which, if you can believe, cause cancer.  Ask Bob Marley, he'll tell ya).  <br>
<br>
Is pot addictive?  It can be, and certainly for some users who may have traits leading to addiction.  Just like alcohol or gambling, certain folks seem to have a proclivity for addictions.  Are there people who smoked pot a few times and decided it wasn't for them?  Sure.  Much like there are folks who don't drink because they just don't like it.  <br>
<br>
To argue the glories of pot over any other drug of choice without doing your research is naive.  There is nothing on this planet that is completely beneficial.  If you eat too much, you become obese.  If you drink too much, you get cirrhosis of the liver, if you smoke too much, you damage your lungs, if you drink too much water you pee a whole lot (not sure if that's bad for you or just inconvenient, research is still out on that).  <br>
<br>
So, again, smokin' pot?  Fine, whatever  Do it at home, it's your body, you live with your decisions, not me.  <br>
<br>
Don't smoke pot and drive.  Don't drink and drive.  Etc.  Because you take your choice and decide to inflict it upon others.  And that's just wrong.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Marley died of a brain tumor that spread from cancerous growths in his foot.  Perhaps we should examine the effects of soccer as it relates to cancer too?  I find it quite hard to believe that you're trying to link the carcinogens or THC content in marijuana to one isolated case of cancer, particularly when <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/htdocs/LT-studies/tr446.html">this study</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> suggests that THC may actually have helped battle Marley's cancer and subsequently extended his life.  Of course, actually allowing physicians to treat his ailment rather than holding out hope that Jah would heal him would undoubtedly have helped too.<br>
<br>
But anyway, arguing that it's smart to toke up and drive around is silly--but suggesting that if you toke up you'll flatten an 8 year old on a bike is silly too.  My point is that the anti-pot ad campaign is similar to W.R. Hearst's scare tactics, and reeks of misinformation.  There are much more insidious and relevant targets to attack than marijuana. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannabulon>Cannabulon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.eiga.com/extra/images/chinpokomon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secret Master of the<BR>Marshmallow Silique</span><br>  Posts: 537<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/5/03 1:20:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://burtcom.com/athf/frylock.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I was the TA investigator on that accident.

whoa whoa whoa... youre gonna quote the National institute on Drug Abuse? In this country where research with marijuanna is FORBIDDEN by the law? Sorry, I'm not biting. that is as much propagnda of this anti-drug nation as those idiotic commercials. As for reading the NEJM, since you apparently have them scattered across the coffee table, how about you tell me what exactly to read, throwing around the name of a medical journal doesnt give me much proof of anything.<br>
<br>
Also, I've found no, none, zero, research indicating that alcohol and pure THC-Delta-9 have anywhere NEAR the same toxicity level. In fact, the existence of the THC brain receptor discovered in 1986 lends creedence to the possibility that THC isnt anywhere near as toxic as some uninformed propagandists would have us believe. Last I heard there is no Ethanol receptor.<br>
<br>
To compare pot &quot;addiction&quot; to alcohol addiction is ridiculous. I dont know if you've ever seen a recovering alcoholic, or one who has been on the bottle for 20-30 years then decides to quit, but if you have you probably noticed the profuse vomiting, seizures, delirium, high fever, and other pleasant withdrawl symptoms associated with a true addiction. Even worse for a Heroin or Crack addict, kicking those addictions can actually KILL you. Quitting marijuanna means 1-2 weeks of &quot;Awww man, I wish I was high&quot; and that is IT, no pain, no nothing. Pot is mildly habit forming, I will admit that completely, a pothead smokes every day, usually more than once a day, thats a fact.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>To argue the glories of pot over any other drug of choice without doing your research is naive.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

To not see the difference between Marijuanna and cocaine, alcohol, crack, Heroin, inhalants, Methamphetamines, etc, is much more naive. No one here has said anything about pot being harmless, or a miracle drug. As for not doing their research, I am afraid you are quite guilty of that, your research is extremely one-sided, incomplete, and incorrect.  <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Next to the maiden's<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Sleeping place<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->I left<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->The Sabre, The Sword- <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Alas, that Sword...<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> -Yamato Takeru<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
As for some of the things said about drugs... WOW some of you are WAAAAY off base on your assumptions.... let me explain.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Marijuanna DOES lead to: Overeating, complacency, temporary short attention span, lots of cartoons, laziness<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Although disputed some scientists have said that Marijuanna does indeed lead to overeating however some attribute it to the way people's metabolic rate is altered when taking it. And the short attention span is also true as is the laziness.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do think alcohol is much worse than pot, ethically, physiologically, psychologically, in EVERY way. People say pot kills brain cells (it doesnt, anything smoked and inhaled kills brain cells not necessarily marijuanna itself, THC is not a toxin) Alcohol however IS a toxin, kills brain cells, is physically addictive, and causes physical violence and irrationality. Ever seen someone really drunk go from really happy to psychotic in 5 seconds? happens all the time!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First of all Pot DOES kill brain cells.. however more pot has to be taken than alcohol and the rate is MUCH less than alcohol's rate of killing brain cells.  Also pot can be Psychologically adictive as can anything to the person who is using it...also people who have been doing pot for a long time in large amounts CAN lead to psysiological addictions as can any drug or substance that is abused.  Alcohol in itself is a very dangerous drug but the long term effects of alcohol are nothing compared to that of pot.<br>
<br>
Pot can lead to Cancer<br>
It is known that marijuana contains some of the same, and sometimes even more, of the cancer-causing chemicals found in tobacco smoke. Studies show that someone who smokes five joints per day may be taking in as many cancer-causing chemicals as someone who smokes a full pack of cigarettes every day (15) .<br>
<br>
<br>
Lungs and airways<br>
ungs and airways—People who smoke marijuana often develop the same kinds of breathing problems that cigarette smokers have: coughing and wheezing. They tend to have more chest colds than nonusers. They are also at greater risk of getting lung infections like pneumonia.<br>
<br>
<br>
Immune system<br>
THC may increase the risk of developing infections by inhibiting normal disease-preventing reactions.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Marijuanna does NOT lead to: terrorism, accidental shootings, teen pregnancy, harder drugs, murderous rampages, psychosis, rape.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have to say I disagree with some of this... terrorism is most likely not caused by pot, teen pregnancy definately not since it actually lowers your sperm count when you do it.  HOWEVER Marijuanna being a mind altering drug CAN lead to Accidental shootings, murderous rampages, and rape..... The truth is that marijuanna can alter your state of conciousness much like heroin.  And it has been proven that marijuanna can lead to harder drugs.  However currently marijuanna has not been proven to create some sort of perminent &quot;pshychosis&quot; as you so elegantly put it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There has NEVER been a traffic fatality linked to someone who was JUST high on pot. Yes, there are several people who have committed vehicular manslaughter who have tested positive for marijuana, but invariably they test positive for any number of other things also--most typically alcohol (that's a shocker, huh?)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
what can I say besides this is COMPLETELY incorrect... here is the truth... Data has shown that while smoking marijuana, people show the same lack of coordination on standard &quot;drunk driver&quot; tests as do people who have had too much to drink, also it has been proven that Marijuana has serious harmful effects on the skills required to drive safely: alertness, the ability to concentrate, coordination, and the ability to react quickly. Marijuana use can make it difficult to judge distances and react to signals and sounds on the road and with an estimated 16 to 20 millionfrequent user all over the place I find it hard to believe that you really think that pot hasn't caused at least 1 traffic fatality... if not Thousands. <p>~<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527819">Venerable Hvyarms Steelfists</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

First of all NO IT DOESNT. Let me tell you a little story about a scientest named Dr. Heath. A long time ago, a man by the name of Dr. Heath took a bunch of Rhesus monkeys and put them into a cage, for months on end, he flooded their airtight cages with enough Marijuana smoke to get 50 human beings high at one time, enough to smother them and cut off all oxygen from their brains.Eventually, Dr. Heath's colleagues found out about the way in which these tests were run and he was ridiculed and his study completely discredited. However, this did not stop anti-drug whackos, who use nothing but lies to begin with, from quoting this &quot;scientific study&quot; This evolved over time, and many, many people began to believe this, people like you, who say it does without a clue to the truth.<br>
<br>
Luckily for people who care about truth and not propaganda, the 90's brought us TWO new studies on THC and brain damage. One done by William Slikker Jr. entitled &quot;Chronic Marijuana Smoke Exposure in the Rhesus Monkey&quot; it appeared in &quot;Fundamental and Applied Toxicology&quot; in 1991. The second, still unpublished and being worked on, is being done by Gordon T. Pryor and Charles Rebert at SRI International. Both of these studies used proper amounts, and didnt suffocate the test subjects in order to achieve the wanted results. Both studies showed no link between Marijuana and any sort of brain damage whatsoever.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Immune system<br>

<br>
I want to see where this is published, I want an actual study, because this I've never heard in my life. And I have pretty much read everything written on the subject. Please provide to me the journal and the scientists, or a link or something. Because this is completely off base.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>HOWEVER Marijuanna being a mind altering drug CAN lead to Accidental shootings, murderous rampages, and rape..... The truth is that marijuanna can alter your state of conciousness much like heroin<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Did you get this out of Reefer Madness or something? Let me tell you something, I've smoked a lot of weed, with a lot of people, from scientists, to musicians, to deadbeat losers, to successfull college graduates, and never in my life, ever, have I seen, either myself, or in others, an altered state of consciousness similar to Heroin. In fact, thats the most ridiculous thing I've ever read in my life. And no, pot does not lead to murderous rampages and rape, anyone who believes this has obviously never smoked a doob in their life, as it's hard enough to overcome inertia to reach for the controller when it's time to flip the channel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>teen pregnancy definately not since it actually lowers your sperm count when you do it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Time for another hot truth injection... Dr. Robert Block, University of Iowa, published a study refuting the old unfounded claim that Marijuana lowers sperm count or testosterone levels. The study found <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>chronic marijuana use had no effect on testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin and cortisol in men or women.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Furthermore, Dr. Block's conclusions were:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It appears that marijuana, even heavy use of the kind that's typical in the United States, doesn't alter testosterone levels<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In case you dont believe me, look it up yourself the study can be found published in &quot;Drug and Alcohol <br>
Dependence&quot;, Vol. 28: 121-8 (1991)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And it has been proven that marijuanna can lead to harder drugs<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's been proven? Where? In fact, it's been Discredited. There is no such thing as &quot;Gateway Theory&quot;. You do understand how ridiculous that concept is dont you? If anything, I'd place tobacco or Alcohol as the true &quot;Gateway&quot; because most kids try those first, I know I did.<br>
<br>
The RAND drug policy institute is fighting a battle right now to have Gateway theory stricken from so called &quot;Drug Education&quot; because it missleads people by telling them lies. According to the government's own numbers, the amount of Americans who have tried Marijuana is 76,300,000. The amount of americans who have tried Heroin is only 2,730,000. Tell me how Marijuanna leads to harder drugs looking at those numbers. It isnt even a significant majority, not even close. The TRUTH is there is NO evidence of any such thing as &quot;Gateway Theory&quot;<br>

Unless you have personal experience with both drugs, you have no frame of reference and no way to quantify such a ridiculous statement.  Yes, both induce &quot;a state of euphoria.&quot;  Tryng to define &quot;euphoria&quot; is like trying to guess how many cups of water are in the Mississippi.  I've experience a pot high and an opium high, and let me tell you, the difference in scale and effect are monumental.<br>
<br>
Similarly, by your reasoning, I could go to microfiche and dig up every capital crime in which the perpetrator was a tobacco smoker, and then make a case for tobacco inducing &quot;irrational&quot; behavior.  Irrational people are irrational; people with slow reflexes have slow reflexes...marijuana simply accentuates characteristics.  Sure, lots of rapists, murderers, and everyday common criminals have traces of THC in their bloodstream.  A lot of them also have brown hair, yet brown hair is still legal.  Strangely enough, a lot of great cultural icons, artists, and yes, even statesmen have traces of THC in their bloodstream also.  Weird, huh?  Hell, let's just grab some facts out of the air and make a random correlation now and then claim it's been &quot;proven.&quot;<br>

Q: What are the long-term effects of marijuana use?<br>

You can find the Info obtained about marijuana leading to other drugs here.<br>
Q: Does marijuana lead to the use of other drugs?<br>

Every single thing I posted was researched and I'll have to check up on the other links ta show ya my sources for all my facts but cann... I really dont care how much weed you have smoked it does NOT make you an expert on it in any way.<br>

Is where I got my info on sperm count... it stated...<br>
&quot;Hormones: Yandi can affect hormone production - this causes problems in the reproductive system. Research shows that some cannabis users have a lower sex drive. Irregular menstrual cycles for women and lowered sperm counts for men have also been reported.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also at this site it stated..<br>
<br>
&quot;Psychosis: It is believed that cannabis use - especially if heavy and regular - may be linked to drug-induced psychosis or cannabis psychosis. This can last up to a few days. The episodes are often characterised by hallucinations, delusions, memory loss and confusion.<br>
<br>
<br>
In some cases, cannabis use may precipitate a latent psychosis. In other words, it could bring forward an episode of schizophrenia or manic depressive psychosis in a vulnerable or pre-disposed individual. In a person who already has a mental illness, cannabis can trigger psychotic episodes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also in my college psychology book &quot;Psychology an Intermediate Study&quot;  It also suggested that marijanna could lead to temporary drug induced psychosis.<br>

That statement is completely ridiculous, The way you ingest something has no effect on the ingredients in it... given its easyer to get lung cancer by smoking it because it destroys the cillia in your lungs and destroys the outter cells and directly places the carcinogens in the cells... but other forms of cancer (not lung cancer) could be just as easily obtained by simply eating carcinogens.<br>

<br>
Using the NIDA for Unbiased scientific sources is as futile a thing as you can do... You are telling me you think that a pamphlet, put out by a government that doesnt even allow testing on Marijuanna since it's a schedule 1 substance with &quot;No Medical Value&quot;, is going to be neutral and loaded with fact, as opposed to propaganda? Do you really think the NIDA is going to tell you anything other than &quot;Drugs are bad!&quot; of course not, they are paid to say just that, this country is incredibly anti-drug, and will do just about anything, no matter how unscrupulous to make others believe the exact same thing, this includes missinformation, it's been going on since the 30's my friend. <br>
<br>
Do you know why Marijuana was made illegal? The Cotton Industry. Seeing that hemp was cheaper, just as comfortable, and more resiliant than Cotton, became very afraid of what was to come, so they decided to begin a campaign against marijuana, which at the time was smoked only by a small number of Jazz and Blues musicians in the deep south. it was in no way widespread. However, in an attempt to make hemp and marijuana into the same evil plant, they began a campaign, the result was that both were made illegal.<br>
<br>
The studies I listed are all neutral studies, not sponsored by the US government, free to come up with unbiased conclusions. Yours are done by the very government trying to keep all drugs illegal. All the new ridiculous Marijuana commercials are based on one thing, the fact they dont have a leg to stand on anymore when it comes to medical proof its bad for you, therefore they must tread the realm of the nebulous and make accusations that Marijuana = Terrorism, even though Afghanistan's major crop is OPIUM POPPIES.<br>

Every single thing you posted was NOT researched, the proof of that is that you dont even know where the hell your research comes from, the rest of the proof is in the fact you are completely mistaken in all of your assertions. For example, your newest gem.<br>

THC IS NOT A CARCINOGEN PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS, The only carcinogenic substances in marijuana appear when combusted, and are a result of the smoke and tar not the active chemical itself. For example, a steak is not a carcinogen, but when you char the outside black, it becomes carcinogenic, which is why they say not to eat burnt food, do you really think steak is carcinogenic all the time? No, didnt think so, try again please.<br>
<br>
Besides, if it was carcinogenic do you think they would prescribe it to CANCER PATIENTS? Come on man, do a little thinking please. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hvyarmssteelfists>Hvyarms Steelfists</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/8/03 11:58:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> rofl cann every bit of the &quot;Info&quot; you have posted has come directly from<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ny/ANADSpage/MARIJUANNA.html" target="top">www.angelfire.com/ny/ANADSpage/MARIJUANNA.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Some person's site who has no affiliation with any corporation... yet you are constantly bad mouthing the government research on marjuanna as completely offbase.<br>
<br>
<br>
And as for you saying people need to light up to get the carcinogens out, I personally dont know about this but I would assume it false simply because look at all the people who use &quot;chew&quot; tobacco ... they arent lighting up yet they are still retaining the same effects as those who are smoking it.<br>
<br>
Btw I did research before I posted and I threw in another link to a site not sponsored by the government so you could see what it had to say.  1 question... do you believe the government has some big coverup for spaceships landing and stuff like area 51? <p>~<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527819">Venerable Hvyarms Steelfists</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

that is because Nicotene is CARCINOGENIC. Yes, if you chew a carcinogen you will get cancer! But like I said before, THC (The active chemical in MJ) is not a carcinogen, hence you could chew it, roll it around your tongue, shove it up your ass, the result will be the same, no cancer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=414.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=414.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=414.topic&start=61&stop=65>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=414.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=414.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=414.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=414.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=414.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=414.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5>Off Topic</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
