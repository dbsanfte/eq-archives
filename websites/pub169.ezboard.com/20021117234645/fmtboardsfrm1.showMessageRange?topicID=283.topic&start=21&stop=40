<br>
This does cause a bit of an unbalance. <br>
<br>
Having said that, I DO think this would be a nice spell for us to have if some more thought goes into counter-balancing the Clerics spells. A few of the spells Fogel posted for Clerics seem interesting, particularly the grp CE, not sure if that's enough though.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Honestly, I was content when they took away the 10 percent penalty to healing for us Druids/Shamans and  although I think this would be a nice spell definately don't think it's needed, so don't look for me advocating it with much passion.<br>

 <br>
Now VI are stuck and can't make contence that is balanced so you can do nearly as well with a shaman/druid healer as you could in the orginal world without making the contence trivial for a group with a cleric. Same goes for the 2nd most overpowerd spell, slow... <br>
This is probably a try to deal with the problem they are stuck with and it easier to increase healing on druid/shaman then it would be to remove Compleate heal and rewamp all contence that is made with CH in mind...<br>

<br>
&quot;CH + Rez +Buffs makes Clerics the most group/raid desirable class in the game by far.&quot;<br>
<br>
*cough* Raid much?<br>
<br>
CH is great, I'm never going to complain about CH. Druids and shaman have typically played &quot;spam healer&quot; rolls to support CH circles -- now I suspect they can be a part of those instead of just supporting them. Paladins actually have superior group heals to any of the above.<br>
<br>
Rez? Bah, let the paladins do that. They can do that between group heals while the druids are doing the CHeal circle.<br>
<br>
Buffs? Yup. Woo hoo! Our job is to buff!<br>
<br>
I've got no problem with spreading the healing duties around if they give clerics something else to do and one ... just one ... &quot;class defining skill&quot; (which I thought was rez and complete heal, then thought was complete heal, now I'm not so sure.)<br>
<br>
In the meantime, if they actually give a cleric enough soloing power to take down a barely-blue that isn't undead, I might see it as a fair trade. Tag on a couple of utilities (such as a way to regenerate mana -- whether from stealing it, bleeding it, gathering it, or whatever -- and for god sakes, please, a normal freakin' invisibility) and I'd be a happy cleric.<br>

Figure the mobs in POP will need to be much harder encouinters then what is currently in the game, and the cleric class will not be able to perform its duties healing wise to make up for this.  Most guilds typically have 8-10 or less clerics, less FT ones and the need for clerics right now is too great.  <br>
<br>
CH chains in POP may not be sufficient healing power for mobs like Solusek Ro.  So the druids and shamans with added healing power will be required to fill in those gaps, but in order to do that their gimp 670 heal needs to be improved.  a 670 heal in the game is no longer sufficient sorry.  <br>
<br>
Plus, considering casters now have more HP then melee did 2 years ago, it only seems reasonable that their healing power also improve with that.  These changes are not intended to replace cleric heals, they are intended I believe to assist clerics, and are simply an upgrade to a spell that 2 years ago was sufficient but no longer is.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uraahvin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raahvin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/22/02 10:38:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Possible Ragefire fix on Test.</span><hr size=1> Hmm... what I think is going on here is VI's attempt to compete with the mass quantities of other MMORPG's coming out, and by &quot;throwing everyone a bone&quot; and making their game experience easier and fluffier, they are enticing us to continue playing.<br>
<br>
Sure the game evolves, gets harder, and we as upper-gamers grow in strength to compensate. But to reduce the importance of a &quot;Cleric&quot; on the battle field? Just so more Jr. Kiters can heal themselves better? Total bullsh!t.<br>
<br>
Currently, in DL (again), I see clerics shouting for groups constantly with no one taking them. There are 2 reasons for this; 1) Clerics are a dime a dozen. Way too many of them, because everyone listened when they were told &quot;clerics can always get groups, man!&quot;, and 2) I am sure it's everyone's fantasy to get on the 1.5 year RF waiting list. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Either way... I hope the clerics do not go the way of the Do Do. I will always take a cleric in my group FIRST, because without them, I do not feel safe.<br>

There shouldnt be even classes . a cleirc is the healer , its what they do , i as a shaman DO NOT want this. honeslty im very upset that this might happen. shaman and druid deserve a heal upgrade for 54-60  but not this big . i DONT wanna be the main healer. i have a wide aray of stacking DoT's and Slows and debuffs that are incredibly useful in groups and raids ands soloing. if i wanna be a main healer ill make a cleric. i DONT wanna do it all and more importantly i shouldnt be able to. im a shaman. ted is a druid. we have our roles. each is balanced. you need to look at what you have before complaining some one else is better. i dont think druids realize just how powerful snare is cause they use it constantly. have you ever seen a shaman quad kiting ?.<br>
<br>
if i root , every single DOT i hit , every single DD that root breaks and im getting smacked.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyway , this isnt about druids. this is about this heal. while i cant deny a part of me wants it. i feel in spirit of the gae. inspirit of the class i picked, i should not get this . Druids either.  Clerics role needs to be preserved.<br>
<br>
upgrade the heal . but dont make use clerics please . when the lines blur and we all can do everyhting and there is no longer pride in your class cause its all the same, well then its time for me to leave this game.<br>

<br>
I'll always pick a cleric first for MH in an exp group, and the new spells they're getting look like they might make up (a bit) for the mini-CH being given to the other priest classes.  Then again, I don't have a cleric main and these spells may be a total gip for the class.  ;-) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=218008 " target="-blank">Rhowne "Bloody Teeth" Frozenflame</a><br>

As it stands now clerics are not needed in most old world and Kunark groups.<br>
<br>
However, does that stop people for shouting for one and groups breaking up just because the cleric has to leave. Where we need a cleric today we will need one tomorrow. Also people like having a cleric around because of the fuzzy feeling you get when you have a rezzer in the group. That will never change.<br>
<br>
I personally like the change and hope it goes live. For me it will trivialize Topor and hopefully Topor will become more available because the Kurnark Dragon enabled quilds will stop sitting on it and let it flood back into the market which will lower the price drastically.<br>
<br>
I would just recommend that everyone keep an open mind before they judge. Saying you don't like something before you have even tried it first really shows your lack of maturity. Nobody likes change but change happens every day. Besides, the Clerics got some nice stuff added to test so you don't really have anything to complain about.<br>
<br>
Edit: One more thing. I think we need to drop the reference to CH and these new heals. To put these heals in the same category as a CH is just not accurate. They are not even close. These are just improved heals that needed to be put into the game over a year ago.<br>

If its a low lvl, why even bother getting Torpor? Do i want a CH? Nope not really, i do want a more powerful direct heal than superior heal and chloroblast tho. <br>
<br>
The one thing that is bugging me tho, we get ALOT of buffs, well shamans are supposed to be master of buffs. But really. Weapons can proc Avatar, a spell that cost us a emerald to cast. <br>
Looking at FE's, TW's, FoV's tanks/melee magelos. Do they look like they need a str or dex buff? Not really. The buffs just make a minor difference now. Give us a straight atk buff instead of many useless str buffs. Give us buffs that are useful regardless of the stats you have. Granted this isnt a problem that i run into. But i guess that some highend shamans have some rather useless spells in their spellbook.<br>
<br>
I would also want the ability to melee, since verant think we do that alot (rabid bear). Perhaps recive the dmg bonus on weapons?<br>
<br>
Anyway, unless the spell cost a huge amount of mana i belive this will overpower the shamans and druids.<br>

Im envious of the mana/hp regen buffs that beastlords have on test!<br>

This should open up a door for non needed classes&quot;<br>
Hmmmm, ok now to tear this apart.  A druid in group instead of a cleric, well ok.  Now is the druid supposed to buff (prolly)  keep evac up (prolly) and heal (prolly).  Good thing druids have unlimited mana cause other wise I see a serious problem with this.  Anyway basically you resolve an issue for one class, Druids.  Now you can take two druids instead of one druid and basically have a somewhat cleric.  Not bad, but you still take two instead of one which means that spot didn't really open at all.  What do I think should be done?  Well if there going to do this then fine, but clerics need something.  Either slow, haste, snare, hell I say give em bard ac (basically ac over ranger/rogue but under pally sk) and double attack and lets rock.<br>
As for shamans getting it to, now we have something to work with.  Shaman/Druid combo in group, now we have two good healers buffs haste slow, just more healing for the two classes.  We still have evac and other necessities, as for how oom pans out, thinking this just depends on the group (Example: 53 tank compared to a 60 tank).<br>
This may offend people, but Verant needs to pull there head out of the arse and do something for clerics in the way of ragefire.  They avoid the issue like the plague.<br>
Ok tried to cover both sides of things and prolly left some stuff out but in most part that is the pros and cons.  The only onther problem I see is:  How mana druids/shamans do you know that want to be the main healer. <p>Only one who's powers are great and pure can gain knowledge on the ancient art of the Ranger Gate!<BR>

Have you ever tried to keep a group healed as a druid? I used to have to spam heal before I got sup heal, which would only be a minor upgrade. Sure you say a druid is  &quot;Jack of all trades&quot;, but can we really do it all? You might say this is overpowering a druid, or shaman, but it really is not. People will always want a cleric in their group, at least I always do. I dont want to be the main healer, but I want a heal that will do SOMETHING. I have seen my sup heals get absorbed into a warrior like crazy, and he only gets half a bub a heal(Around there, anyways)<br>
      This would not make druids overpowered, clerics will always be the healers. Although this might make the class a little less roleplaying, it will at least allow the druids some role, other than DS, and nuke, which is what I usually do. Druids currently cannot be main healer, not without a C3 or something. Even with this spell druids will never be what clerics are. As for the Ragefire thing, they really should change it, I have only seen the thing once in my life, on tracking,(and I constantly track) And I have spent, Oh, 5-6 levels in SolB <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/udryoc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dryoc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/22/02 7:48:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Possible Ragefire fix on Test.</span><hr size=1> I've thought of something... No offense to the druids and shamans out there (I love both groups...)  but screw their mini-CH... Beastlords should have this mini-CH!  I mean wtf, nobody ever really wants as BL in their group... because they SUCK (sorry Beastlords... but its basically true! =(  So how do we fix this?  Give THEM the mini-CH, there isnt that big of a threat to clerics cause 1) Not alot of Beastlords out there, 2) Shaman and Druids wouldn't be over powerd and 3) BL's suck atm!<br>
<br>
Now, I saw someone mention how great the cleric spells are... WTF are you talkin about?!?! The Yaulp line of spells currently doesn't stack with our Armor of the Faithful line of spells, and Yaulp V only lasts 24seconds, so thats only 3 ticks... here let me tell it to u this way, IT ONLY ADDS 5 MANA EVERY 24 SECONDS! Do you know how long it would take to make this even useful? a CH costs 400mana, so 400/5 = 80*24 = 1920/60 = 32! It would take us 32 minutes to get enough mana to cast CH usin this spell!  (thats if my math isnt off and not counting natural regen...)  So what they need to do is make this spell have a high mana regen 15mana, and last LONGER its a waste of a spell icon slot... We'd also need to make it STACK with Armor of the Faithful line!<br>
Now heres one more thing about Yaulp V:<br>
&quot;Note however that this spell will currently overwrite VoG, Speed of the Shissar/Brood, and a number of other ATK increasing spells.&quot;<br>
Why would we rather have Yaulp V over SoS or VoG? we wouldn't why would we have those in the first place... is beyond me (unless we are really bored and help melee...) but theres no point the spell is utter crap if you ask me...<br>
<br>
Now the new hammer spell... Here are the stats:<br>
LORE, MAGIC, NO DROP, NO RENT<br>
AC 10<br>
14 DMG, 18 DLY, Bane Undead +10<br>
25 Dex, 8 Wis, 35 HP, 35 Mana<br>
+ 10 Sv. Disease, + 5 Sv. Magic, +10 Sv. Poison<br>
Effect: Hand of the Gods.<br>
--<br>
Hand of the Gods is a DD that can hit anything, have not seen it <br>
resisted yet, but you can get partials. High I've seen was 141.<br>
Stats/info From Allden of Test<br>
<br>
Its a decent 1hb... but again not really worth it since cleric's dont have good MELEE SKILLS!!! We're meant to be able to TAKE damage not GIVE it, why not make this like the other later game hammer spell? But make it a pet that LASTS not some 1 kill disapeer crap, MAKE IT LIVE TILL IT IS SLAIN IN COMBAT OR YOU ZONE (or you have it leave ya know... just like any other pet.)<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this was a little in-depth but its what needs to be said...  Look at this from a CLERICS point of view, not a ROGUE (Zera) sorry but you just dont know what your saying... Take away CH from clerics? Sure, VI can take our CH when they take a rogue's BACKSTAB! Hey while we're at it how bout Enchanter's MEZ, say Druid's ports and snare, Shaman slows, monk FD, and how bout mage's pets?!  Sound like a fun to you?  For godsakes man wtf are you thinking?!?!<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. If VI wants to give Shaman and Druids a better heal (which I beleive they should have...) Why not give them DIVINE LIGHT?!?!  Its not CLOSE to as powerful as CH but its ALOT more powerful then sup heal...<br>
<br>
P.P.S. Have any of you actually looked at the cleric AA's?  Have you ever thought that if you were a cleric you'd be happy with them?  I gotta say adding improved natural durab was good, but our arch AA's truthfully suck...  Turn Undead? wtf, Purify Soul, uhh ok, decent but still shitty for the cost, Innate Invis to Undead, crap...  so about 1/2 of our Arch AA's blow... great! I cant wait till i get there!  Ok we have some good ones (MGB, Divine Rez nice if u need a tank ASAP...)<br>

<br>
I feel that these new spells will not effect a clerics role in the group, however in all fairness if the shaman and druid are getting a lesser version of our most widely used spell then we in turn should get a lesser version of theirs. I'd say a lesser form of the shaman slow or a weaker version of there pet would be nice, and it would help to make a cleric a more effective soloer, and the same goes for a lesser version of the druid snare. <br>
<br>
Another solution to equalizing clerics that has come to mind isn't new spells. VI should decrease the cast time on CH, and at the same time increase the clerics mana pool, or increase the clerics mana regen, although the increase in mana pool sounds better to me. When things get thick a lot of times the MA's life is dropping so fast that you don't have time to land a CH so you just chain cast devine light and hope the druid in the group can lend you a hand. Needless to say you also burn ALOT of mana doing this. Ok if VI doesn't agree with increasing clerics mana pool then maybe they should consider decreasing the mana usage on key spells, thats another idea.<br>
<br>
I don't think that swapping spells around is the solution, I think that increasing efficiency in cast time and mana usage will keep the clerics firmly rooted in there roll as MH. But once again my post and oppinion will hold no sway over VI.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah and someone mentioned pally rezes earlier, id just like to say that i love pally rezes, if im in a seb group and everyone lives but me, i dont need a cr i just need the pally rez, and yes this has happened to me before lol.<br>
<br>
Any way im sure your all sick of my rambling and this is why i tend to avoid posting, but id just like to ask each of you to realy consider the great benefit of the other classes having these spells, and think of all the things that you or your guilds could accomplish that you were once unable to do if your druids and shamans have this heal. Oh yeah and PL'ing will be a breeze to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
