<br>
&quot;And my original reply in this post stands... I think clerics are smart enough not to even think of buying shards for 40k. Why when, you can farm them yourselves for free? So your point is... what?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
to me, it looks like you only said &quot;they dont have to buy them&quot; in your original reply. u DIDNT say that &quot;clerics are smart enough not to buy them&quot;. maybe thats what u MEANT, but did you seriously think people here would read that between your lines?<br>
is it only me, or did you change course just to not look bad?<br>

<br>
They don't have to buy them... because they can gather them themselves. Surely most clerics realize that. If a cleric is rich and lazy, why the hell shouldn't they have the option to buy them, at any price the market is willing to bear? It's not like they have a gun to thier heads. It's not like that one shard is the ONLY SHARD IN THE ZONE. Is it lame to try nd sell one for 40k? Yes? Would any clerics pay 40k for one? Well a very rich or a very stupid one might... but I even doubt that. <br>
<br>
You are so rediculous and so lame Booga, I feel sad for you. Maybe it is the English/Sweedish mentality difference, but everything you say here stikes me as soooo wrong and sooo lame. <br>
<br>
I have had a really busy day, getting ready for my business trip, and I played 2 sets of tennis on my lunch hour(s lol. 6-3, 1-6, in my favour) and I have so much else to do today and this weekend... I will try and peek back here to respond to what I know will be some more senseless drivel that will comprise of your lame repsonse. While you are at it, summon my ass, you lame assed excuse for a ranter. If I could really have one wish, it would really and truly be for you to 'fvck off', never post here again, so I wouldn't be forced to look at your crap ever agian. <br>
<br>
On a side note, please, anyone, let me know if you ever see Booga in game in the arena. There is nothing I would like to do more than to fry his laame ass in game as well as here on the the boards. I know, it will be too easy to do (just like here) but still, he is the one who said his pet would 'eat my dignity'.  That much I would like to see. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uishinrublendermonk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ishinru BlenderMonk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/13/02 2:53:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: i summon thee, aelfgay!</span><hr size=1> If I had 500k sitting in the bank, I woudl have ni problem paying 30k per shard if it would get me in and out of the aone in under an hour.<br>

There is absolutely nothing contradictory between:<br>
&quot;They don't have to buy them... &quot;<br>
--and--<br>
&quot;They ought to be smart enough to not buy them...&quot;<br>
<br>
Those that want them in a hurry *and* have the cash burngin a hole in their pocket would buy them.<br>
<br>
Those that aren't in that much of a hurry and those that can't afford it will not.<br>
<br>
It's all basic Economics...<br>
what is the cost of farming shards?  Suppose the average is 1 shard per 2 hours... it is up to each individual to decide if 2 hors of their time is worth 40k.  For someone with lots of cash, it might just be worth it.  For those whose time is worth much less than 20k per hour, they would &quot;be smart&quot; to not make the purchase as the cost of the shard is more than the cost of their time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/usiliniussexybarbarianhero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silinius Sexy Barbarian Hero</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/13/02 2:56:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: i summon thee, aelfgay!</span><hr size=1> Dood Boggo.. you are beating a dead fookin horse man.

<br>
here we go again.. *sigh* the aelfgay tries to confirm himself on a rants board. i dont know if i should laugh in your face or just feel sorry for you and your delusional behaviour.<br>
<br>
honestly, im not interested in what you are doing between norrath and trying to be smart on this board. it doesnt mattrer, cause i only want you HERE - to please me. you are braincandy for me. its like going back to 3rd grade just to feel smart. and i love it! i love to bash you, see you react..take things way too personal. i can FEEL your anger when i read your so called rants. i touch you, and you wont admit it.<br>
<br>
spare me the bullsh!t please. i really dont care about your life. but i have to admit, i DO enjoy your attempts to look untouchable. but you prove yourself SO wrong every single time. this whole business thing - the only thing it tells me is that i beat you, and you try to win by having a life better than mine. now, if u DO have a life or not, IT DOESNT MATTER! cause u are still bringing it up here.. as what? information for us? confirmation on yourself? bragging?<br>
<br>
come on.. i dont think anyone here gives a flying fvck about your life. and i dont care if you cant answer within 3 mins or 3 days.. i just want to see you bleed. like now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukreket.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreket</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fimble Adorer</span><br>  Posts: 484<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/13/02 7:57:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: i summon thee, aelfgay!</span><hr size=1> DEAR silinius,<br>
<br>
before you make asumptions, PLEASE read the boards to get a clue.<br>
<br>
ever since the &quot;who are these people&quot; thread, AELFGAY's been attacking ME. HE is the one persecuting ME, and i simply enjoy his attacks, cause he never learns and always turns out as inferior as he is.<br>
<br>
look around in the different posts im involved with..you SHOULD notice that he always came with a provoking comment.<br>
<br>
so i ask you..would YOU take sh!t from a guy u find inferior and just plain stupid? would u make him throw a comment in your face, unprovoked, and just close ur eyes and ignore it?<br>
<br>
ok, so aelfgay is a person that should be ignored and left in his corner, i admit that..but im having fun with him! and i dont want to lose that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

maybe people THINK i always draw first blood, cause i always come out superior from a &quot;bogga versus aelfgay-match&quot;, but it isnt like that. im simply defending myself from this jackass thats trying to be something..on a fvcking rants board. :/<br>

<br>
&quot;and this thread is an exception.. aelfgay fled from one of my threads where he jumped me and i simply wanted to put him against the wall.&quot;<br>
<br>
i havent attacked aelfgay since you-know-what. ever since then, he has been trying to witch hunt me. im simply defending myself. and yes, i am enjoying it. you would too. ANYONE would if they had a stupid, inferior person hunting them.<br>
<br>
please, dont think emotional - think logical. even tho u dont like me, and think i deserve blablabla..would you take this kind of sh!t? no you wouldnt.<br>
<br>
as i said earlier.. i wont shut up. i will always reply. u cant ask me to swallow his sh!t. i hope you understand that. i will NEVER bend over for either you or (laugh) aelfgay. i simply give him what he asks for - rants. its not my fault if he gets hurt.<br>
<br>
<br>
if you want me to shut up - dont attack me.<br>
<br>
its very easy. shall we say it together? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ugalivain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>galivain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/14/02 1:35:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: (nt)</span><hr size=1> Booger says:<br>
