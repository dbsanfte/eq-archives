size=1> Logan, thanks for an intelligent reply.<br>
<br>
I think I said... I can understand TW waiting for us to wipe. I can understand TW thinking we HAD wiped and making the decision to port into Emp's room.<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is the timing involved, or what happened after. <br>
<br>
Yes, there was definitely a few minutes when anyone in Ssra doing a /who would have seen very few FE in-zone. Under those circumstances, sure, anyone could reasonably assume we wiped when we hadn't.<br>
<br>
BUT, what I don't understand is what took TW so long. If your intent was to wait for us to wipe, then come up and take over, then why did your guild wait approx 15 minutes to actually port up? We had time to camp, return, rez ~10 people, rebuff, get organized and then engage  and control the entire room for 4 minutes before any TW showed up.<br>
<br>
Even after we decided to continue and we dropped the Blood, I can understand TW staying there in the hopes we wiped. Knowing the encounter, I would consider it next to impossible to take over the entire room after another force wipes, but IMO you would have been within your rights to try.<br>
<br>
But, intentional or not, many of your members were interfering with our attempt. Members were running around the entire room, seeing how we were set up, AE buffing and overwriting some our own, standing on modrods, etc.<br>
<br>
If you're going to wait for us to wipe, please gather your own forces in an out-of-the-way corner, away from all our members. Control spamming. Control anyone who might be in our way, either purposely or otherwise. Any interference is going to cause confusion and hard feelings, as evidenced by last night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uneuromt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neuro  MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/26/02 1:29:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Our goal is to enter VT.

<br>
I am not opposed to giving you a clean shot.  The issue is, when you take your 'clean shot' you screw it for us.  Server was rebooting last night, had you taken your 'clean shot' Emp would have been blown till midnight at least, by which time too many of our members would have logged, and Emp would have been wasted.   TW has a history of trying a mob over and over, wiping repeatedly, then giving up once it is too late for us to take a (successful) shot, by which time FoV logs in and gets the kill. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/unadimemt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nadimeMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/26/02 1:35:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Neuro, no offense, but so what?

Once you spawn Emperor, you get 1 shot.  the room is not very large, if he is up and you are in line of sight of him or any of the snakes in that room, you get instant aggro, summoned and killed.  I know this from our repeated attempts to learn the encounter, I would camp out, have a cleric camp out and attempt to perform CR inside the room, within an alcove while Emperor was still up.  It simply doesn't work.  <br>
<br>
Knowing that, the best thing for TW to do was to wait OUTSIDE the room at the portal.  There would have been no problem with that.  And had we wiped, TW would have gotten an uncontested shot at Emp, FE would have come back to Ssra, summoned corpses and left.  TW would had to have waited the 2 hours or so for Emperor to despawn and an additional 45 minutes for the blood place holder to respawn in order to respawn the Emperor.<br>
<br>
We didn't have a &quot;wipe&quot; situation. We had a &quot;premature unintentional&quot; aggro situation that was easily resolved with camping to clear that aggro.  In the case where &quot;we took to long to engage and Prien warned that they were going to enter since we hadn't engaged yet&quot; that's just a piss poor technique at attempting to bully the first guild.  It's the &quot;rush them&quot; strategy designed to force a guild to go quicker then normal in an attempt to force mistakes due to hastily started attempts.  it's something that happens all the time in raids.  RA did it to HF, HF did it to TW, TW did it to HF, every guild does it.  but, there is a line, that line was crossed last night in ssra.  There was zero need for TW to pull what they pulled in an attempt to get a shot at Emperor.<br>
<br>
Again, the facts are rather simple.  TW showed the level to which they will go to attempt to achieve their goals.  I wonder if TW has ever considered that once PoP goes live, FE will leave Ssra and VT behind, much like we left ntov and the rest of velious behind?  That would enable TW nearly uncontested attempts at Emperor; only having to compete in learning and perfecting a kill execution with FoV, a guild on a different time zone.  That would give TW nearly 4 weeks to learn how to kill High Priest, an encounter that I don't believe they have managed to successfully complete, an encounter that is 10x easier then Emperor will ever be.  so much in this game could be easily avoided if people would not allow jealousy, greed and blind hatred effect the decision making process.  I dont' want to tell TW how to run their guild, I have my own guild to run.  But I will say that I think the leadership of TW could do a better job at running their guild in terms of dealing with the competitive nature of the game.  <br>
<br>
But, if that is not an option, then again, I will readily accept a /guildwar to assist in solving the issues that continue to fester between our two guilds.<br>

<br>
Yes, I'm sure us killing Emp has some motivation in keeping others out of VT. That's simply self-interest in a competitive environment. But also consider that the Emp is still probably the hardest fight in the game. Myself, it's my favorite fight because it's the most challenging we do. Emp also drops equipment better than 99% of the stuff out there. So our guild benefits directly from every kill we get too. It's not only a case of us blocking others from the spawn.<br>
<br>
Also wanted to say... yes, there's frustration and anger on both sides, but actions like last night only perpetuate the mutual disrespect. I like to think I'm open-minded enough to see both sides of most conflicts between our guilds. But unlike some other run-ins our guilds had in the past, in my opinion, last night FE was 100% within our rights and did nothing wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/usamoht73.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samoht73</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/26/02 1:57:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Logancreed</span><hr size=1> FYI, TW has killed the HP, not this last spawn but the one prior. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uwaladce.showPublicProfile?language=EN>waladce</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/26/02 2:00:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Leeches</span><hr size=1> /wave Traktur <br>

Course they may have bigger better strats then that but 2 out of the 3 encounters I have witnessed involved these tactics <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    1.  Leapfrogging at AOW.  2.  Pulling through us in TOV. <br>

I like a bunch of TW people but the decision process to do this stuff is just sort of seedy, cheap and lame sry.<br>

While you are busy making threats to people's real lives and buying computers with your guild's fundage, I will be sure to laugh at your expense, in my forum! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ulogancreed2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Logancreed2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/26/02 3:07:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Logancreed</span><hr size=1> We would have needed time to learn the encounter, and the patch was approaching.  I'll give ya that.  We should have traded an uncontested spawn on Wednesday for an uncontested spawn on Thursday.  It should be something we talk about in the future.<br>
<br>
However, there is an attempt by FE to keep us out of VT until POP comes, as to keep us out of POP.  We'd like to be in VT before POP, so that we can work on POP.  I'm sure you understand.<br>
<br>
No guild should interfere with a raid like we are accused of.  Mod rods shouldn't be picked up.  Buffs shouldn't be overwritten.  Debuffs shouldn't be canceled.  That's low crap.  Again, I really don't see us doing all that crap we are accused of..... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukalran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/26/02 3:15:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Logancreed</span><hr size=1> Logancreed: I wanted to clarify for you.  I was one of the last people that died when we had the bad pull.  I was also one of the last ones rez'd... and I called for a delay before we pulled blood (I was missing FoS still).  I was fully buffed, with no rez effects, and ready to tank Blood when he was pulled.  I've tanked blood before, and did nothing different than what I usually would have done.  After the start of the fight, we were told to go into a holding pattern.  (We started with the intent to continue and progress as per our normal routine.)<br>
<br>
Now, for those of you that don't know about Blood... here's a bit of l33t str@t 4 u.  (note the sarcasm)  He hits fairly hard and flurries, but can easily be tanked and controlled by a 7k tank and a few clerics.  Unfortunately he also procs pillage (strips 4 buffs).  I don't know how many of you have tanked a mob that strips 4 buffs at once while indoors... but let's just say it's a pain in the foking ass to keep your buffs up.  I was able to get haste in slot #11, fos in slot #12, aego in slot #13 (meaning they would likely only be stripped if all hell broke loose and he proc'd like a fiend).  Some @#%$ rocket scientist from TW decided it would be a good idea to AE buff aego.  Thank you SOOOOO much for getting aego into slot 3 for me.  God knows that it helped me for the 5 seconds it actually lasted.  I didn't need those 1100hp anyways.  Through some insanely lucky timing, and a whole lotta right click skill... I was able to stuff Aego back into slot #13.  <br>
<br>
Now... when TW showed up, Blood was engaged (by someone who was dead from the &quot;wipe&quot;), and the encounter had begun.  Knowing that your very presence would @#%$ up the encounter... what were we to do?  We could... a) have everyone camp, and stop the encounter.  b) wipe   c) continue and have a reduced chance at success or d) go into a stable holding pattern until you assholes left.  (that reference is actually only aimed at a few of the people that were up there... most notably the ones that were picking up our rods, breaking mez's, and @#%$ with our buffs)<br>
<br>
You guys say you're ready to kill Emporer... but you don't even know about the @#%$ room yet!  After spending 4 hours up there picking your asses and wasting a spawn, I figured you might actually have a clue.<br>
<br>
The worst part about the whole fight was that you caused us to delay so long that my eyes were turning yellow I had to pee so bad.  If you think we're gonna wipe, wait at the other side of the portal.  If we wipe... it's an SC and the room is nice and clear for ya. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
