You have to be willing to look at the good as well as the bad.  I'll be the first to point out the wrongs that the US does but I'm also more than willing to admit all the rights.  You accuse the average American of not being willing to see any faults with the US, and in some ways I agree, but you yourself are unable to see any of the many things the US has done right.  That's just as biased and it actually diminishes your credibility in many ways.  The majority of your posts come off just as biased and unobjective as the one Ayerish just made.<br>

Check out an atlas please, there's countries separating Iraq from Israel.  Also, the odds of him being able to conquer Iran are minimal at best, seeing as he had just fought a war to a stalemate with Iran.  Finally, his expansionism is very different from that of WW2 Germany.  In many ways, Kuwait brought the invasion upon itself by promising support during the Iran / Iraq conflict and then reneging on that promise.  Iraq was used as a buffer against the fundamentalist regime in Iran and then left to rot when the war was over and their economy was in ruins.  The fact the US was also part of the promised, and never materialized, support, is just another bit in a long misguided US foriegn policy in the gulf area that has contributed to the current state of things.  Not sure what Kuwait was expecting, they encouraged Saddam to build up a war machine so they wouldn't have to and then told him to screw himself once the war was over.  It's sort of like encouraging your neighbor to spend all his money on guns to protect the neighborhood from rampaging criminals, promising him money to feed his kids and then telling him to bugger off once he fought off the gangs and his home was in ruins.<br>
<br>
EDIT - how the heck did we get to this topic from gun control anyway?  Any chance we could go back to gun control?  That's a fun topic.  Here, I'll put up the first shot.<br>
<br>
I am amazed at the stupidity of most gun owners.  The next person who tells me an AK47 is good for home defense is going to get my fist in his face.  Hello, idiot, the only thing you are likely to kill with thatis your neighbors.  I believe in strict gun control and no guns in the hands of civilians, but if you're going to own a gun at least get something that actually makes sense for home defense.  A shotgun would be a far better choice.  Less likely to jam, easier to operate and maintain and has much more intimidation value.  Plus the odds of sending a bullet through your neighbor's walls is zero with a shotgun.  Most (note I said most) US gun owners have the IQ of a garden vegetable and shouldn't be trusted with an electric pencil sharpner, much less a firearm.<br>
<br>
And what's up with hunters claiming that shooting a stupid animal with a high powered rifle is sporting?  How in the world is this sporting?  Can the animal shootback?  Is the deer going to pop off some shots at you from his antlers?  Hello, you might as well be shooting a machine gun into a chicken coop.  About the same risk level.<br>

The clear implication is that countries like Jordan &amp; Syria would have either been made allies or fertilizer.  Remember that before Desert Storm, Iraq had the 4th largest military in the world.  If I recall correctly, at the time it was US, Russia, China, India, Iraq, (insert Pakistan/Israel/whatever European nations here).  That's a pretty big arsenal.  Add to that chemical, biological &amp; very possibly nuclear weapons (inevitable given time), and there is no country in the middle east that would have stood a chance.  I believe that his war with Iran was not a stalemate, but only on pause while he acquired more resources by invading Kuwait.  If we had not intervened, the surrounding countries would have fallen like dominoes.  Only Israel could have possible held out, much like the UK in WWII.<br>

I will be the first to admit that first Britain &amp; later the US made many mistakes in the region.  The problems we have today can doubtlessly be directly attributed to the misguided intervention of both countries.  I also believe that easily our biggest mistake of these was a failure to finish the job we started in '91.  Saddam shouldn't even be an issue today.<br>

i can see many things usa did right, but that is not what this topic is about.<br>
sure, most americans would use it as an argument that &quot;we drop food allover africa to save* children, so dont complain about nagasaki&quot; or whatever (i have gotten that before here on the boards by some idiots), but that doesnt mean dick to me since i dont think that way. evil is evil imo, and you cant compensate it by doing something good. you cant just go kill someone and then help and old lady over the street and think it would compensate your evil act.<br>
<br>
but in case you DO think like that..who measures goodness? and evil acts? the bible? well, the bible says in the 10 or whatever commandments that &quot;thou shall not kill&quot;. are we making our own rules now? do we choose to refer to the bible when it benefits us, and neglect it when it doesnt? apparently we are.<br>
<br>
but overall, i think america is a very very evil country that has done more evil than good throughout the last 227 years or whatever. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Now, I wont argue whether or not to take the Bible literally, as thats a whole nother arguement, but if you're gonna being it up, the Bible also says there is a &quot;time for war&quot;. And obviously God directed His people to many a war, guiding them to victory quite often.<br>

I can only hope that someday soon America adopts a foreign policy based on strict isolationism.  No one comes in, no one goes out, and we enforce bioregionalism as a means of economic and social structure, since we are one of the only countries in the world that has the means and resources to be ultimately self-sufficient.  Leave the rest of the U.S.-haters to squabble amongst themselves and nuke themselves off of the planet, or simply starve to death when they have to depend on the U.N. to enforce order without the support of the American military.   <br>
<br>
It's anti-Americans like old Krakhead here that make me think that this kind of approach would probably be for the best--ungrateful, whiny cowards who live with their mommies so they can afford $900 cell phones while they're unemployed or jockeying the reception desk at a health clinic because it's all they're qualified to do.  Europe seems to be fairly overflowing with this kind of overpriviliged, undereducated, disenfranchised youth--it certainly bodes well for the continent's future.  <br>
<br>
And for the record, my &quot;biased and unobjective&quot; earlier post consisted entirely of factual information gleaned from transcripts of Hussein's speeches and his military history.  I'll be happy to produce documentation if you insist on claiming that I'm biased in that regard.  The U.S. has also been promised all kinds of military and economic support several times in the past hundred years from countries who reneged when it really counted.  We didn't invade them to collect, nor did we exhort our neighbors to wipe them from the face of the earth.  Don't ever make the mistake of comparing the U.S. representative democracy to Iraq's plutocratic and fascist dictatorship again, please.<br>
<br>
And for the record, if you weren't born here, you came here because our country had something to offer you that wasn't available in your own country.  That doesn't give you the right to express your opinion about how we do things here; obviously we do them better than wherever you're from, or you wouldn't have come in the first place.  Keep that in mind next time you feel it's your duty to humanity to open your ignorant gob and comment on our policies--and most of all, if you dislike us and our methods so much, please return to wherever it is you hailed from, and when your native government eagerly holds out its hand for U.S. aid, tell them to decline and offer to work triple shifts at your job for the same pay to make up the difference.  Encourage your countrymen to do the same.  When you don't rely on American money and American assisstance, you won't be so tempted to criticize America as if you were an American citizen.  The loudest criticism you can have as an American is a vote, and sorry, you don't get one of those just for getting off a boat.    <br>
<br>
Imagine how successful you'd be if you invested 1/10th the amount of time you spend in Everquest in your classes and/or jobs.<br>

Many a war=Many wars.<br>
<br>
You can maybe argue that &quot;a time for war&quot; can be taken in other ways then a &quot;pro war stance&quot;<br>
<br>
But how can you argue with stories of God directly telling His people to fight, and to go to war, and to kill? David was a &quot;man after Mine own heart&quot;, and he was told to kill Goliath. In the Bible, justified war has its place. Obviously, whether or not the war on Iraq is justified is debatable, but thats not my point. My point is you obviously don't know anything about the Bible, so bringing it up, out of context is probably a poor idea. Unless you are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>trying</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to lose the argument, and then by all means. <p><br>

my point wasnt to iron out whether the different stories in the bible are historic events or just pure literature. like moses and the red sea, noak's ark or david and goliath. we really dont know if these are just tales or really historic events so there is no reason to use them as reference to justify killing. not that you did, but i want to point out that the 10 commandments still ARE a greater reference than the different stories in the bible you referred to.<br>
<br>
the 10 commandments have a purpose - to tell you how to live a good life.<br>

First off... <br>
I am most definitely *not* your sweetheart.  You are an ass and an antaganist with no redeeming qualities what-so-ever.<br>
<br>
Secondly... <br>
several people stated that they do not support the war or rampant ownership of guns (showing that Americans are not all as you claimed in your first post).  <br>
<br>
they show that they do understand your point of view (when asked if they knew now the long term effects of the A-Bomb, would they do it?  Several said they would not but upon your continued rant againast all things american did bring up the point of view that the 2 nukes saved more lives than they cost.) <br>
<br>
if your brain were developed enough, you would be able to understand that some people here understand your point of view.  Some of them hold contrary opinions, some agree with parts of it in principle, and others agree whole-heartedly.  However, you continue to say that they don't attempt to understand your point of view, when, in fact, they have already stated that they do, but disagree with it.<br>
<br>
Thirdly... <br>
I am not here to prove anyone right or wrong.  re-read what I wrote and show me where I took a stand one way or the other in an effort to prove anything.  I made reference to why people cite WW2 whenever a military conflict arises.  I did not say that it was either appropriate or inappropriate for this discussion.  I merely answered a question that you raised.  By answering a question that you ask, that means I am here to prove you wrong?  no... it merely means that I answered a question.<br>
<br>
Fourthly (my God, how can someone make 4 blatant errors in one post?),<br>
I am not a mod on these boards and never have been.  I have never &quot;moved&quot; posts from one forum to the other.<br>
<br>
Fifthly...<br>
Kreket -- &quot;OFF COURSE i will be the one who &quot;dont listen&quot; or &quot;dont try to understand&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
Like I said in my original post... you do not demonstrate that you the the ability (mental capacity) to understand.  Once you demonstrate this ability, *then* you can claim &quot;For the sake of discussion, I am playing devil's advocate&quot;.<br>
<br>
But... given your limited intellect and reasoning skills, I am sure that this concept evades you.<br>
<br>
Now can we please get back to gun control?<br>
1. (TTBOMK) Japan does not allow individual ownership of guns and they have the lowest murder rate among the inducstrial nations (not sure who all is in this list of nations, but they have a really, really, REALLY low murder rate.).<br>
2. Despite point 1, above, Japan's crime rate is not any lower, merely, fewer people are killed as a result of the crime.<br>
<br>
<br>
A study from back in the late 70s (you'll have to take my word for this, I have looked for 3 years or so and have been unable to find a link on the 'net) shows that States that have the death penalty (even if it is not used) have a higher violent crime rate than they had before they had the death penalty and, for states that repealled the death penatly, have a lower violent crime rate after.  <br>
<br>
The hypothesis is that when &quot;the people&quot; see that killing someone for their wrong-doings is acceptable, they in turn escalate their retriubtion against others for their wrong-doings.  That is, every society will have some degree of vigilantism (would you attempt to stop a domestic disturbance if you were able?  did you ever destroy or otherwise deface a friend's possession when he made you mad? (put a crease in his baseball card, etc.), and, in a society that has &quot;murder&quot; as an acceptable form of punishment, the bar is raised on what society considers with regards to vigilantism as well.<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that punishment is usually more sever than the original offense. <br>
<br>
So what happens when people see violence as an acceptable means of punishment and they have access to more powerful and deadlier weapons?  The crimes committed are done with more violence than otherwise (at gunpoint instead of with a knife).  In turn, people defend themselves with more violent methods (carrying mace).  In turn, the criminal stops &quot;asking&quot; for your money and starts taking it instead and shoots you if you start to get in the way.  So you start carrying a gun to show the crominal that you aren't scared.  So instead of stealing your purse, he shoots you twice and leaves you for dead and then takes it.  So the criminal gets captured but is let go on a technicality.  You decide that he ruined your life, so you are going to end his.<br>

Other than &quot;the US is evil because it nuked Japan,&quot; all I see is a lot of the circular &quot;the US is evil because I say it is.&quot;  I could just as easily argue that Sweden is evil because of its indifference during WWII, or the US would have been evil for NOT nuking Japan.  Of course the circular argument is far easier than actually addressing why the US shouldn't be invading Iraq.

<br>
Now, I did also express some particular opinions of my own with regard to people from other countries who hold strongly anti-American sentiments in my last post, but they weren't directed at anyone in particular.  However, if the shoe fits...<br>
<br>
Lastly, while we're on the subject of &quot;biased opinions,&quot; why not find some facts to back up your claim that our action in Somalia was a &quot;loss?&quot;  Since the casualty rate there was 19 U.S. KIA and about ~70 WIA, versus an estimated 1000 Somali militants killed and hundreds more wounded, I'd hardly call that a defeat--particularly considering the fact that several of Aidid's top lieutenants were captured or killed in the raid.  Certainly not a shining example of a mission going off as planned, but not a loss either--and you're forgetting that Somalia was a U.N. deployment, not more of our patented &quot;unchecked U.S. aggression.&quot;  But, of course only someone with an anti-American bias would present a 50:1 casualty ratio in favor of the U.S. a &quot;loss.&quot;  We simply discovered that the only way to bring peace to the region was to wipe it from the face of the Earth, an action we were neither willing or obligated to undertake.  The region is still as anarchic, violent, and corrupt today as it was 10 years ago, but there's no reason for more Americans to die there.    <br>
<br>
On the subject of gun control (as if that were REALLY what this thread were about), I'm in favor of it.  Anyone who wants to own a firearm should have to pass a rigorous series of written and psychological tests--it shouldn't be easier to get a gun license than a dog license.  I also don't see any legitimate reason for owning more than one firearm, nor do I see any justification for any civilian to own an assault rifle.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laralanla>Laralanla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Legend<BR>Prancing, frolicking M&M</span><br>  Posts: 871<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/19/03 5:49:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=100>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: guns</span><hr size=1> I think I'll take a page from this rant <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=627.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100" target="top">pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=627.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and call Bogga the biggest mormon I've ever seen.<br>
