A little history about Pickk:<br>
<br>
Born May 26th 2000 8pm EST:<br>
Yes this would make me one of the oldest playing rogues around. I think MT had just opened up a few days earlier so I thought I would try out the wonders of a halfling rogue. The name Pickk seemed appropriate.. I wasn't going for anything naturally rogueish it just seemed to fit with the halfling names in Rivervale.<br>
<br>
God those first 10 levels were a bitch. I remember duoing with a monk named Pokerface in misty thickets. Me with my Dagger* and him with his fists. My first server friendship is formed, and then fades as pokerface hits 50 by the time I hit 20. I saved up every copper I could to buy the allusive giant snake fang. When I finally was able to purchase one (I think it might have cost me 3 plat.. a fortune to me at lvl 6) I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I killed wolves to make myself my own armor and started to feel uber.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to level 14. I was dual wielding a dragoon dirk and a gnoll hide lariat. I met up with a really cool ranger named Glenaron (sp) [forgive me its been a long time]. He was in a guild named Tolkiens Revenge and I decided to join its ranks. Boraron traveled all the way from GFay to come tag me in West Commons. This was in september of 2000 (yes it took me 4 months and 20 days played to hit lvl 14 and save up enough plat from goblins to pay the outrageous 100pp fee for a dragoon dirk). There I met some of my longstanding friends. Wikkiwikwik was a half elf warrior, and a constant pain in the ass (funny tho). Fimble was a cool gnome that somehow always managed to stay within grouping range of me for 2 whole years. Donador was a human paladin that I got along great with and also was within range. Daddywood was the coolest dwarf around and the best guy to have at your back. This is just the tip of the iceberg. We had great times in those days, and I leanred alot of my roguely skills from Ciypher, a 26 rogue at the time I believe. Here I made friends with Astlin, Tyas, Bambuk amoung others. We played every night as a group and had an incredible amount of fun.<br>
<br>
I stayed with TR until August of 2001 when it was obvious the ship was going down. I was level 46 and had a slime coated harpoon and full ravenscale (yes laugh, I felt uber at the time for some reason). A bunch of my good friends were starting a guild named Lunacy so I decided to join my second and final guild.<br>
<br>
Lunacy was great. Never have I had such an incredible time. Kuhbla, Darlissa, and Jhared were a constant source of friendship and amusement, and having them all be related always made for some interesting times. Vercingetorix was a good friend and a great monk. I should kill him for making me type out his name in too many assist messages. Hidious was a cool guy and a bit testy, which only added to his online persona. Cullian was another paladin and a good friend, I always enjoyed his company. Karor was a fellow rogue (yes lunacy only had 2 rogues) and was always up to any task big or small. Ianarie the elf wizard that would always compete with me for the exp in raid groups. Dartanion and Kaesora a great couple and great friends. Tedox and Xeera, a cooler bunch of shamans I have never met. I know I missed some of you but believe me I had fun with you all.<br>
<br>
I was the first Lunatic to get epicfied and I really felt like you guys went out of your way to help me every step of the path. Culnaej was a great pal and even gave up his SMR to get me my epic =). Here I met up with Patofnaud and Dubb, a great bunch of rogues and me and Dubb got epicfied on the same general raid, then helped Pato with his raid a few months after. The rogue community on MT was very tight and always willing to help eachother out.<br>
<br>
I leave this game with no enemies and many friends. I'm in my final year of university and unfortunetly I want to spend all my time online talking with all of the people I have met over the years. This is why I cannot play. I can't afford to fail a single class and due to financial constraints between school and full time work I simply don't have time for everquest.<br>
<br>
&quot;When I was a child I talked like a child, acted like a child, and thought like a child. Now that I am a man I must give up my childish ways.-Corinthians 2:14&quot;<br>
<br>
This is what was first running through my mind when I decided to give up Pickk for good. But I reliazed some of the most mature and inteligent people I have met have been in this game so it really isn't appropriate. Perhaps a better quote would be: <br>
&quot;Until we meet again, I bid thee farewell&quot;<br>
<br>
If you see Pickk running around... well its me. I will never ever sell this character no matter how badly I need the money. I had a great time, and I wish you all the best.<br>

*in thieves cant*  /sniff - I remember when I met you for the first time in the Old Cazic Thule while farming that UBER Ravenscale.  Next thing I know we were doing PoH and General Raids together and wearing the same guild tag.  <br>
<br>
Being in Lunacy made me the rogue I am today!  I hate being second best at anything and when the original Lunacy rogue had skills, I had to put 150% into Karor to keep up with you. That I thank you for.  You were a mentor.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you in real life.<br>

Still remember those nights (and wipes) in Kithicor. I noticed you were not around much lately, was wondering if RL was taking you back, and I guess I was right.<br>
<br>
Keep the Ragebringer covered in a light film of WD-40 so it don't rust, make sure you keep the moths off of your armor, and come back and say HEY from time to time.<br>

We had some really great times in this game, and I am not likely to forget them... you were the one who guilded me in TR where a lot of my in game friendships began, and even though you took a long break, you came back and we had some more great times together... getting every ranger and druid in Lunacy their Jade Reavers was a blast!<br>
Take care of yourself, and send me a tell from time to time if you log on.  <br>
