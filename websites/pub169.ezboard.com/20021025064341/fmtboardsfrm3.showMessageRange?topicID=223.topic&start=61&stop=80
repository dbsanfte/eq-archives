<br>
What kinda dumb ass post is that?  Ya said ya don't post much.  With a post like that I guess we should consider ourselves lucky.  The purpose of this here Rants forum, BillyBob, is to complain, whine, b.itch, and rip apart injustices that occur in the game.  You listenin' boy?  Get off yer sister and listen to yer pa, Billybob.  Not everyone wants to spend every online moment in the game.  To those that do..great.  To those that chose to come here, great.  To those that post &quot;grow up and get ready for PoP&quot;...wake the hell up.  <br>
<br>
Billybob, I know that between your 5th grade edumacation and working part time at the local Pump-N-Go even you must realize that ninjalooters and anal probers like Daarkside will not go away when PoP is release.  KSers will not suddenly stop KSing because the new expansion comes out.  Daarkside will not stop whoring himself out as a bimbo broad to any guy that happens across his heroin addicted AIDS ridden suicidal-every-other-post path when PoP is released.  Talorb will still steal his best friends Jock Strap of Might, wear it around his mouth like a feeder bag.  Hanuri and Phantom Knights will still freely train, gank, KS and shout &quot;kekekekekeke&quot; all over PoP.  FE will probably wake the Sleeper &lt;heaven forbid!&gt;.  Eventually someone will come here, maybe you, and demand Rustem be removed as moderator in 500 different posts.<br>
<br>
We've all agreed this is not where the meeting of the world's greatest minds gather.  If yer like CERTAIN (repeat:certain) FE members that ran away crying because you expected this to be highly intellectual then follow suit with them and go away.  Telling people to &quot;grow up&quot; because bashing idiots like Daarkside replaced baseball as the national pasttime.  Christ I even heard talk of having John Madden come in to do some color commentary.<br>
<br>
&quot;And see here how Daarkside goes back to that old playbook?  You can see how much he advertises his next play.  He breaks the huddle wearing the dress and fishnet stockings then BOOM, he makes his move with the suicide thread.  The defense was ready for that one.  I mean how stupid can you be to call that play again?&quot;<br>
<br>
Everquest is only a game?!?!?!?  Gee Billybob, maybe we can talk to the skewl and get you put into 6th grade now.  God's sake man, people can be passionate about a freaking hobby!  It's like every time the damn wind changes direction someone feeling all psychological comes around and chimes in with the &quot;it's only a game&quot;.  Well sheeeeeeiiiiiiiiiit.  I guess no one should give a damn about getting screwed over after playing this game for several hours a week for 1-2 or more years.  <br>
<br>
People take a lot of things to heart that can't be touched.  Religion, faith, beliefs, love, yer manhood &lt;but give Daarkside a chance, he'll try&gt;.<br>
<br>
Yes EQ will always be there and there will be more silly little drums and bags.  However, buck-o, when I timesink hours to get the raid together, organized, buffed, and the dragon goes down...they are not your silly little bags or drums.  We decide that as a raid leader.  If you think your $13 carries more weight then mine...better get the scale out of yer ass and recalibrate it.  The raid leader isn't going to hold raids for every single person on this server multiple times until the ninjalooters are fat, dumb, and happy (or drugged, gay, and suicidal).<br>
<br>
I'll stop here and ration the rest in the event you pipe up again with more &quot;enlightenment&quot;.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucrystilla.showPublicProfile?language=EN>crystilla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 229<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/20/02 5:32:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Grow up</span><hr size=1> Blast it Drack!!!!!

And btw if he is working fast food ect, I highly doubt he will be able to cruise the internet there! Chances are, he is still living under mommy's roof, and mommy told him to go do yard work. So he was taking a nice relaxing stroll on mommy's computer telling us to grow up!<br>

I don't recall (and i could be wrong) other guilds having the numbers like FE did that made like a bad Shakespherean play stating &quot;Hark thy posts shalt never be visable in this location again!&quot;.<br>

So no, I wasn't bashing FE.  Cerain people in it...perhaps I took a poke at em, but it was far from a bash.  Now you didn't come outright to state I was bashing FE, but bringing FE into this.  No, I wasn't bringing anyone into this.  I made many references of other rants and slip-ups.  Sorry but FE isn't special this time.  A later date, maybe. =)<br>

No, the dwarf isn't getting laid.  Haven't had time to log him on much lately either because...well...=)<br>
