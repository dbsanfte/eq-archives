<br>
In the cold halls of Permafrost did Nathomin take Malaehi, and they spoke of soft touches and feelings that burned in their minds as well as their bodies.<br>
<br>
In the cold halls of the Dragon did Nathomin take The High Elf Malaehi, and introduced her to the world of passion between men and woman. It was not painless, and Nathomin had not thought to tell her of the pains that could come of this thing.<br>
<br>
So much did they share... So much did they learn together, of eachother... But when it was done, still more questions did she ask... And those he could not answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;What am I to do now? What do I do now that I have broken my most sacred oath for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi stared at the Tier'Dal rogue with tears in her eyes, and Nathomin could not answer... He did not know.<br>
<br>
He wanted to tell her that every thing would be well, that her goddess would understand and aprove, but he did not know.<br>
He would not lie to her and say he did. He wanted to tell her that she would now be fulfilled. But he knew that every moment she was with someone it could very well be filled with a yearning... and that hunger would never go away.<br>
<br>
They left the cold halls and went to find shelter from the winds of the frozen lands of the Barbarians... In a lone tower they sat and spoke more, He felt something that he had not felt before, He had been with two other woman before, and this... this was something new. He had felt passion before, but this..... What was this that was gripping his heart to see tears in her eyes?<br>
<br>
&quot;Why Nathomin?! Why did you do this to me?!&quot;  Her face turned down in anger, she stood and turned her back to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;What can you give me to replace what you have taken?<br>
Words? Empty words and ...&quot;<br>
<br>
She placed her pale hand on her belly, so recently he had filled her, and now she felt so very empty inside.. Just an hour ago he had thrilled her with his touch, Now her skin felt only cold and tired ...and sore.<br>
<br>
&quot;WHY?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi turned to face Nathomin, anger and feelings of betrayal spilling forth from her eyes mixing with the tears that trickled down her face and hung on her fine jaw. Nathomin ached to kiss them from her face, to take away her pain. But when he stepped forward to take her in his arms she backed away like a feral thing, fear and hurt enveloped her, His eyes fell to the floor as his arms dropped to his sides limply.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wanted to give you.... to show you what LOVE can be when you know passion... I wanted you to have this, to be able to understand ....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;UNDERSTAND!!!! Understand... Do you even understand what you have DONE!?! What you have TAKEN from me...&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi turned away again and looked up into the cold distance of the Everfrost sky and wept.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh goddess, ... forgive me...&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin looked up and his breath caught in his throat. She stood there, a silhouett of beauty against the white snow clad hills... His heart jumped in his chest and he took a step forward again, only to stop dead still as he watched her body stiffen at his approach.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have taken from me thief... You have taken something you can NEVER replace..&quot;<br>
<br>
Her hands clenched at her sides and Nathomin's mind cried out to beg her forgiveness.. but his mouth could not move.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have taken what was not yours to take, what was not mine to give.. and you have given me what in return thief?!!...<br>
No, Do not speak... Think on this as you make camp Nathomin.<br>
Think on what you have done as you wash the blood of my innocence from your flesh.. and know that you cannot undo what you have done...&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi stepped out of the tower into the Everfrost night leaving the rogue to his thoughts... and the cold howling of the winds. The silent howling of his mind and heart...<br>
<br>
Nathomin stood in the doorway of the tower for long hours. Time passed and he stood like a statue. The sun crested the horizon and still he stood there.. his eyes did not see the land awaken, his ears did not hear the calls of the hunters as they cried out their victories, and their battle cries to the Tribunal...<br>
<br>
&quot;Xas Sun-runner.. My dear Sun-runner. I have taken from you and for this, I will not forgive myself.. If you never forgive me, then I will understand... But what is this you have taken from me?... Why does my heart ache so? Why do I feel like this when I have never... even when my first lover went into the halls of madness and left me to wander alone... Not even then did I feel like this...&quot;<br>
<br>
The snow began to fall outside the land gaining another cloak of ice hideing the soil below it under another layer of blindeing white.<br>
<br>
The rogue looked up into the grey sky seeking something... Solice? Forgiveness?.. He knew not which. From his lips came words spoken for one he knew little of. Words for a Goddess whome he had taken from.. A prayor for a woman he had wronged.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have taken from your servant Erolissi... I have taken from you, and I ask forgiveness.. Guide her Goddess.. Show her that she is still your child, and that even such as I....&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin breathed out a sigh of frustration, These words did not come easy from lips that had only spoken hate for so long.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can even I know your grace Goddess of Love? Can even one born of shadows and hate... Is this what I am feeling now under this cold and forsaken sky?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin sat there as the snow was driven up into the doorway, and Nathomin closed his eyes holding in the pain that he felt growing in his chest. Holding in the one thing he knew he had given to his Sun-runner. His.... Love.<br>

<br>
Days passed, And Nathomin found his way back to the lands of Kunark. The House T'Vlos had converged there again... It was almost instinct for them, they traveled, and from great distances they found themselves gravitating together..<br>
Nathomin hunted with strangers and fellows for long days.. His mind blured to most everything around him.. Words echoed inside of his head... Malaehi's words. Her acusations of his crime against her.<br>
<br>
And his heart grew heavier with guilt. But even then the immage of her face, the taste of her lips... the vision of them together would bannish the darkness in his heart like the sun of midday could bannish the night, only to be covered again like clouds by grief for what he had done.<br>
<br>
His blades never lost their movement, never lost their tempo, they danced under the sun, gleeming cold steel and the red of his enemies blood.<br>
<br>
There were times when he could almost hear the chants of ancient warriors, The songs of battle sung to the one he called The Blade Master, To the God of War.... but he was denyed such honor as to sing them. He was a shadow walker... a rogue, a thief.<br>
<br>
He had not the right to call out to the Blade Master...<br>
<br>
But one day his blades did stop, they fell to his sides even as the creature before him clawed and kicked at him... Nathomin felt her presence... He knew she was here in the lands with him even as he heard the battle cry of the Coeur ringing out over the hills in Malaehi's clarion voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ssus'zhar....&quot; Nathomin whispered, all of his guilt flooded away to be replaced by a longing..<br>
<br>
Nathomin fell back propelled by a strong hit from the Sarnak that had taken the oppertunity while the rogue stood dumbfounded, And the force of the blow snapped Nathomin's mind back to the battle.<br>
<br>
His blades found new strength... a speed that he hadnt thought he could produce without the aid of magic... The Sarnak fell back under the flurry of cuts and slices.. And within moments... fell to the ground dead.<br>
<br>
Nathomin stepped over its body unmindfull of the coin and treasure it held and began running toward where He thought he heard Malaehi's voice....<br>
<br>
Up the hill, toward the Burning wood... She is HERE!!<br>
<br>
His heart was beating fast, hope flooded him and his stomach was fluttering. He laughed into the wind as he ran, blades at his side. He could look upon her face again... He could tell her all that he had felt and all the things his heart did when she was close to him.<br>
<br>
He could tell her..... that he Loved her....<br>
<br>
Malaehi was there. A druid sat nearby talking of comrads that were far away and they looked up warily when they saw the aproaching Tier'Dal. A frown creased the lips of the druidess as he came towards them, then Malaehi let out a cry of joy.<br>
<br>
&quot;NATHOMIN!!..&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi stood and ran to him, unmindfull of her companion's dour look.<br>
<br>
They fell into each others arms, words of greeting mumbled into each others shoulders. Nathomin's heart pounded in his chest as his mind raced.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sun-runner... I must speak with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin stood back and knelt at her feet, his eyes looking up into hers speaking all of the things he felt for her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Malaehi... My Sun-runner... I have done you wrongly, and for this I will not ask forgiveness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi opened her mouth to speak, but Nathomin shook his head to silence her. He had to say everything before he lost courage.<br>
<br>
&quot;Malaehi... My Sun-runner... I cannot marry you.. for so many reasons we both know.. And you have so much to learn about passion and so much to teach about love. I cannot promise that I will be there for all of it. but I ... Malaehi .. I wish to be with you, to help you...<br>
<br>
Malaehi.. Ssus'zhar.. I want to walk by your side... Please tell me I can walk with you.. &quot; Nathomin's voice dropped as he whispered. But Malaehi's delecate ears heard well enough, and the words took her breath away...<br>
<br>
&quot;Malaehi... I love you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi looked into Nathomin's eyes seeking any sign of deception, any trace of Tier'Dal lies.. but there were none.<br>
Nathomin's face held only desire and hope... she stood a moment, her heart pounding, her mind trying to sort out her thoughts.. franticly she looked around for something.. she knew not what... Her eyes settled back to his, tears of joy fell to her cheeks and she nodded.<br>
<br>
In that moment, as he felt her take breath to answer darkness fell over him.. and his legs crumpled beneath him... He felt a wave of hate descend upon him and he knew something was not right.<br>
<br>
He heard an echoing laughter in his head.. it was cruel and malicious... it knew no compassion, nor did it know the feelings mortals know...<br>
<br>
&quot;Innoruuk.....&quot; Nathomin whispered in dread... &quot;No... No innoruuk...Let me go!&quot; <br>
<br>
Nathomin's mind screamed out against the pull, cried out against the injustice... cried out for his love... Malaehi.<br>
Suddenly the darkness was thrown back, the hand lifted from him and his spirit fell back into his body... But his mind was spinning in terror and fury.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why... Why would you prevent me from being with her?&quot;<br>
Nathomin knew in that instant that his heart.... that which he had thought Innoruuk's gift/curse was not innoruuk's makeing at all.... That his ability to know hate AND passion... were not innoruuk's gift... but something he had had always... something that was Nathomin's... Innoruuk had lied to him.. <br>
<br>
Nathomin's eyes found focus and they found Malaehi and the Druidess both.. but his eyes were filled with anger.  He turned away from them so that they would not see how he hated...<br>
A scream built up within him... one born of fury and indignation, built of them but powered by his love for Malaehi..<br>
<br>
&quot;INNORUUK!!!!... YOU SHRIVELED SEEDLESS ARSE!!&quot;<br>
Nathomin breathed deeply as Malaehi stood shocked behind him, reaching out to still him... But he would not forgive this. Could not...<br>
<br>
&quot;I swore an oath Innoruuk. I swore that I would leave the realms of the gods to themselves.... But the Deal is OFF INNORUUK.... I will come to your very house and I will watch it burn... You have tried to take from me... My one joy... It will not happen again You vile gutless pile of Dung!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin's voice echoed through the Burning Woods as he shouted this last..<br>
<br>
&quot;HEAR ME INNORUUK.... I AM NO LONGER YOUR CREATURE... NO MORE!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin turned to face Malaehi, her eyes were filled with tears, but her sweet lips were smileing as she enveloped him in an embrace.. She mumbled into his hair..<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes my shadow-lover.. Yes.. I want you to walk by my side.&quot;<br>
Nathomin held her eyes closed.. or he would have seen the apporving nod that the Druid gave them both. and would have seen her slip silently into the forest night....  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daughtersofmalaeliu>DaughtersOfMalaeliu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Penny Priddy</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/20/02 4:21:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~chasingsusan/women.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Fall of Malaehi - The Letter</span><hr size=1> Nathomin, <br>
<br>
Usst Ssins’Veldre I cannot do this any longer. Every night before I camp, I am summoned before the Ancients of Erollisi Marr and am interrogated. They keep me awake all night, beating me with their accusations, their prying eyes, their questions of where I've been, who was I with... I have denied my passion, denied my love, denied my actions to them... but I can lie NO more! <br>
<br>
Not only that, upon entering the Lion’s Hall, I am greeted with a cool response and peering eyes. The walls echo with whispers, I do not feel at home here anymore. I know that they KNOW what has happened to me. Then, it happened. When leaving the room after a meeting, I caught the cold look from Eranendi ... the one who came valiantly to my aid in times past, stood firm next to my side when I needed support and guidance. <br>
<br>
Aye, as I was leaving a meeting yesterday, he glared at me and called me “Teir’dal”. The others around either heard nothing or just chose to wander off, wordlessly. I ran from there in tears... The druidess, who knows, pulled me aside and warned me of the path I have chosen. She spoke of the wrath my Lord Mallo would have should this be found out.<br>
<br>
Then, today... you and that forked tongued Jyssa joined the hunting party with the Lions to invade Kaesora. You and I had to hunt together... as if... as if NONE of this has passed between us... Do you think the others were blind to the passion that was in your eyes?!<br>
<br>
I cannot live like this any longer... the agony.. the shame... and what... what is this feeling inside I have... it will not go away. My prayers are not being heard... there is no contact from my sisters... I feel utterly...<br>
<br>
lost...<br>

She was already confused and scared, when the terror began.<br>
<br>
A disembodied voice started to whispered to her. This voice, a male’s, spoke of danger, lies and deceit. Then, it spoke of the children of Nathomin... Malaehi was stricken with fear and doubt. But, the voice lead her into the lair of the Teir’dals, into the Library of Neriak, where she read more of the history of the House T’Vlos and the tales of Nathomin therein. Malaehi’s illusion wavered as she was washed over with grief. “Oh, Nathomin... why did you not tell me... you fathered children, and ... with... her...“ <br>
<br>
She chanted an incantation and stepped into the pale blue shadows, appearing in her room in Felwithe. Solitude was needed, she needed time to think... the one thing she has not done this entire time. She had been so blinded by her mission that she did not see the trap that lay before her; the trap of her heart and of her awakened passion. <br>
<br>
The voice began to haunt Malaehi, no matter where she went ... the voice followed. Here is was again, whispering to her, warning her... Malaehi drops to her knees in madness, screaming: “WHO ARE YOU?!“ Her voice echoed in the small chamber of her room. The voice finally responded with a chuckle and answered: “You know who this is, fair one and you know I speak the truth.“ Malaehi jumped to her feet, spun around shouting: “Show yourself, NOW, daemon!“ She was indeed alone.<br>
<br>
For a week, Malaehi prayed and prayed, begging for the voice to leave her alone, so she could worship... so she could think of what to do. But, it persisted, driving her mad. Occasionally, she would her Nathomin’s voice call to her, searching for her, then the voice would be Mallo’s or was it Kylaa’s, then it would be her enemy Jyssa jeering at her, “The Chaste one... HA! More like chased!” She heard her disapproving voice of Tintari, changing into the voice of concern from her twin Ennya. Malaehi crawled into her bed, with her pillow over her head, crying herself to sleep, begging for this torment to end, crying out for her lover to be with her, to hold her.<br>
<br>
Vivid dreams plagued her sleep, her lover hunted down like a madman, tortured, interrogated and executed. Malaehi envisioned herself standing on a precipice, teetering on the edge, no escape, no right way to go, no one to advise nor help. Giving into this feeling of love means losing the only stable things in her life: her service of her Goddess and her brethren in Coeur de Lion. However, the other option, to forsake the one she has given so much for, who has left his way of life to pursue her, who has humbled himself before her Goddess ... the one whom she now knows ... she loves ... <br>
<br>
Malaehi awoke with a start, flailing in the sheets as if she were falling. Scrambling out of her bed, she ran down the hallway, barefoot and wrapped in her sheet. Bursting through the doors that lead to the courtyard, she ran straight to the fountain in the center, and fell into the water. On her knees, soaked to the skin, she raised her eyes up to the statue of Erollisi Marr. There her Goddess’ image stood, arms gently holding the image of Norrath ...<br>
<br>
Mala cried out in desperation: “Dear precious Goddess, must I choose my love or my brethren? Is there no other way?” She was answered with the gentle lapping of the waves in the pool where she knelt. <br>
<br>
Fresh tears sprung from her eyes as she tore the sheet covering her in two, tears of frustration and madness. Disheveled and naked, Malaehi walked back into her quarters, pulled out her pristine white gossamer robe, arranged her hair in the High Elven fashion, and walked out of her room, leaving the rest of her belongings behind. <br>
<br>
Dawn arrived as she was boarding the ship bound for Kunark ... her mind was completely blank, spent from all the agony. A human passenger tried to strike up conversation with the dazed Enchantress. She saw his lips moving, by all she heard was the whispers in her mind, haunting her again with a terrifying chuckle... <br>

Here was a place where she had sought solace, communed with her Goddess in the past. Looking up to the lifeless monuments, beautiful in form, overlooking the Frontier Mountains, Malaehi saw the grace and beauty of these fierce creatures and sighed knowing that the minions of hunters passing through will be unaware of their presence. <br>
<br>
Looking out over the breathtaking sunrise, she cleared her mind and sent a call to her lover. She sensed him stirring in his sleep, in his tent ... she thought to herself: “Ahh in the Dreadlands, he is close.” Before summoning him, rousing him from his peaceful slumber, she gracefully sat down, in her meditative stance. <br>
<br>
Turning inward, Malaehi reflected on the life she has known and began to cry, overcome by a complete sense of powerlessness. Never knowing her birth parents, ripped away from them and taken to serve the vile Vri’dril with the other kidnapped children, Malaehi was grateful that she barely had any memories of this time. Even after she and her new “sisters” were rescued, life was still difficult. Growing up in Nektulos, she was ever in fear of being caught, knowing the Teir’dal woman, she and her sisters loved as a Mother, was hated and banished by her own people. <br>
<br>
Malaehi’s face softened as she recollected the times she spent with her new family. Aye in that dark, terrifying forest, Malaehi knew happiness and showered unconditional affection and love on her sisters. Kaete was the Snowborn lass who mothered them all, while the twin Teir’dals, Malaeli and Malaeki, were always in whispers to each other sharing the bond that twins seem to have. The wraithlike human child Malae spent more time climbing trees and getting scrapes, caring not for the lessons of casting Mother Malaeliu taught. Malaele, the beautiful daughter of Erud was the most avid pupil of these lessons, hungering for the power of incantations. <br>
<br>
But, by far, Malaehi had the most love for the two babies, Malaekru - the Ogre , and Malaela, the Troll. Soft tears brimmed in her eyes, remembering how these two struggled so hard with their lessons, how they would both doze off, crushing Malaehi with their weight, deafening her with their chorus of snores. Mother Malaeliu would get so frustrated and send them off to hunt, the Ogress “barshing” and the Troll trotting along behind, casting heals. Every night, before going to bed they would cry and whine until Malaehi told them a story ... a story of love and far away places and beautiful dragons, promising that one day they would all hunt together and see these noble beasts of fame.<br>
<br>
Malaehi’s body shook with the pain she felt, letting the tears far freely. As the Gods would have it, that promise would never be kept. Just when life in the forest had a semblance of order and routine, the time came for the girls to pass their Age of Release. The Gods would claim each one for their servitude, transporting the girls back to their original lands of birth - blurring all memory of the past until they were old enough to handle the truth. <br>
<br>
Malaehi stood up and glared at the sky “Why do WE not have a choice?! I had a family, and it was taken away. I found a new family and again it was taken away. Are we mere toys for your amusement?!!” Her voice echoed off the mountain, reaching back to her renewing the anguish.<br>
<br>
She slumped against the cool stone leg of one of the guardian statues, and wrapped her arms around it, hugging it ... longing to be hugged back. “...and now? What choice do I have... to love and lose my new family, the Lions ... or to lose the love I have...?” <br>
<br>
Numbness swept over Malaehi, as she stood there hugging the lifeless statue for hours. Pulling away finally, Malaehi cleared her mind of all thoughts, all feelings. she had decided to make a choice and to let it be her decision... to take fate into her own hands...<br>

Entering the Dreadlands she shouted out her warcry and greeting: “ROAR!!!” Immediately her elven ears picked up the voice of her lover shouting back to her, calling her “Usst Ssus’Z’har”, my Sunrunner. Her heart leapt in her chest at hearing this term of affection echoing the hills of the land. <br>
<br>
Within minutes she saw Nathomin running swiftly to her, his long hair flying, free from it’s knot. With daggers still in hand and his blue skin shining from the efforts of his recent battle, Nathomin rushed into Malaehi’s arms, kissing her passionately. After a few breathless moments, the rogue pulled away with a chuckle as he sheathed his weapons and watched his love blush madly, still unused to such displays of passion. He took her hand and said: <br>
<br>
“Come my love, your Goddess has granted me this beautiful day and this feeling of love in my heart. I wish to celebrate love... keeping you blushing for the entire evening and glowing for days to come yet.” Malaehi gasped and felt herself being dragged along behind the rogue who was determinedly headed for his camp. He stopped and turned her back into his embrace, eyes sparkling with sheer joy. <br>
<br>
“I love you.... incredibly so much, Malaehi! I love the Goddess you serve as well, for she has opened my eyes to the true beauty of this land and of this life.” He turned his eyes up to the sky, pulled back from the embrace and proudly saluted “Hail Erollisi Marr, Queen of Love, the source of the happiness I feel now!”<br>
<br>
Malaehi felt a cold chill up her spine, and turned to face the cold North wind, hearing the haunting voice in her head again sneering “Death comes to you soon, Malaehi, you have broken your vows.“ Nathomin was so caught up in the joy of the moment that he failed to see her freeze in terror. <br>
<br>
“What is this, the rogue forsaking Innoruuk for His antithesis?” the wicked laughter continued “He speeds his death as a traitor, Malaehi, his fate is now sealed, as is yours”.<br>
<br>
“Nooo!” Malaehi screamed to the voice in her mind. Just as Nathomin turned in shock to question, a Giant lumbered over the hill and kicked Nathomin in the back. Stunned and without weapons in hand, the rogue stood dazed as the Giant pounded on him mercilessly. Malaehi quickly fought the Giant, casting a spell to destroy it's brain, then chanting for roots to come out of the earth to immobilize him so they could escape. Malaehi quickly grabbed her stunned lover and raced up the hill and into the tunnel.<br>
<br>
The emerged into the Frontier Mountains, safe at last. With daggers in hand and a fierce look of revenge on his face, Nathomin headed back to kill the giant. <br>
<br>
“Please don’t... Nathomin, another will come along and finish the job... I wish to speak with you.” Nathomin sighed, sheathed his weapons and let it go, finally noticing something strange in Mala. <br>
<br>
“Sunrunner, what is it?” Malaehi walked out of the tunnel, down the hill and started to make her way up the steep, jagged cliff of the Guardian’s mountain. Nathomin sensed Malaehi’s serious mood and chose to follow without question. After the strenuous climb, they arrived at the peak. Malaehi stumbled, feeling a bit dizzy form the height and this overwhelming fear that gripped her. Nathomin quickly caught her, pulling her into his protective embrace “What is it, Sunrunner?” <br>
<br>
Mala pulled away nervously, “Thh... this is a beautiful place is it not...?” Nathomin chuckled and walked up behind the enchantress, snaked his hands around her and pulled her in close, kissing her neck tenderly. Malaehi turned her head and their gazes locked. For an eternal moment, ice met fire, love met hate, Koada’dal met Teir’dal... Malaehi knew at that moment, that she must decide.<br>
<br>
“I love you, Nathomin.” <br>
<br>
The rogue looked as if he‘d been struck, Malaehi had said it at last. He turned her completely around to face him, took her face gently into his hands, and kissed her slowly still staring into her eyes. But, something was wrong...<br>
<br>
Malaehi’s expression went cold, emotionless, even her voice ... it was like that of the undead. With a sense of foreboding, Nathomin continued his kiss, determined not to ruin this most precious time. Malaehi stood there is if she were the guardian statue. He pulled back in frustration, looking bewildered.<br>
<br>
“Nathomin... But, our love is not meant to be... and I cannot live in this torment anymore. The Ancients ... they will punish me for breaking my vow of chastity and taking a lover.” <br>
<br>
“I will end the life of anyone harming you, SsusZ’har” Nathomin said without blinking. He sighed and reached forward, but Malaehi stepped further, inches from the edge. The sound of pebbles dropping over the edge over the edge rang like sweet music in her elven ears as a feeling of euphoria entered Malaehi’s mind. She closed he eyes and swayed in the breeze.<br>
<br>
Nathomin’s eyes narrowed tightly, voice dropping to a cold whisper “What are you doing Malaehi d’Aeliu? Come here now,” pointing to his side.<br>
<br>
She could not hear him at all. All she could here was the soft sound of her Mother’s voice, singing a lullaby in the tongue of the Ancients. That was the most peaceful moment she had ever known, and all she wanted was that feeling again. Looking off Nathomin‘s shoulder, Malaehi‘s eyes glazed over with sheer madness. She envisioned her mother, standing off into the distance, opening her arms, beckoning her to come. <br>
<br>
“Ilhar Malaeliu...I’ve missed you so. Please.... I can’t take this anymore. I cannot live like this. The Ancients ... will see me bleed for my crimes ... I feel as if I am dead, Ilhar, please make it stop?” Tears poured down her face as the vision of her mother, turned her back and walked away. “Noooo, don’t leave me!!” The bitter laughed echoed in Malaehi’s mind, drowning out the sound of the approaching Giant.<br>
<br>
“Where is your Mother, lover? What is going on?!” Nathomin turned and faced the startled Giant, quickly grabbed his blades and set to work to destroy the intruder. Fear crept up the back of Nathomin’s spine. He quickly glanced over to his lover to see why she was not casting. That glance sent Nathomin reeling back as the Giant landed a crushing blow to his shoulder, rendering his left arm paralyzed and knocking him back several feet, away from Malaehi. He snarled, seeing the Giant turn his attention to his lover, then swiftly sliced his blade across the back of the Giant’s knees, through skin and tendons, crippling the roaring monster and sending it into a raging fury. Once on it had fallen half way, the rogue drove his blade into it’s back again and again, finally twisting his wrist up, puncturing a lung. The mountains echoed with the dying gasp of the felled Giant as Nathomin struggled to free his blade where it was deeply embedded.<br>
<br>
The air went completely still as Malaehi turned to face the setting sun. Nathomin left his buried blade, stood up on the Giant’s back, and immediately ran towards his lover. But, he reached her a moment too late, grabbing the sleeve of her pure, white robe which gave way freely as she stepped off the edge into oblivion, ending her life.<br>
