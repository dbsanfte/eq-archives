<br>
I am bored at work and have been reading Steel Warrior to pass the time... Anyway, so many angry people taking being a warrior FAR too seriously. I have been playing a warrior for over 3 years and I have ALWAYS had a blast. Sure, I do worry that my taunt sucks, but as long as my group is happy and I get the odd rogue endorsement for holding aggro, I am quite chilled about it.<br>
<br>
My point is am I the only one warrior who still gets to tank raid mobs? Am I the last warrior to tank an exp group? I highly doubt it, as I still suck major donkey balls compared to most Overlords out there. So, if you are getting groups, going to raid parties, getting killed so the SKs can laugh at you,, WHERE IS THE PROBLEM???<br>
<br>
Anyone who actually listens to paladins and SKs spouting about their aggro ability, or lazy casters moaning about not being able to nuke one time more out of 300, or slowers moaning that they cant slow til mob is at 25% health, or clerics moaning about how they have to heal more due to late slows, should really know better. I mean let's face it - people don't invite you to group out of pity, (hang on I might see why I get groups now...) but because you can do the job. <br>
<br>
So what if you are chosen in absence of a pal/sk? Just because we are no longer perceived as an essential group member doesntt mean we acn't still do our thang!!<br>
<br>
We are warriors!! We rule!! regardless of anything else this will always be true. Just thank Rallos Zek you ain't a ranja. or a dorf.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mallo>mallo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>MT Legend</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(11/12/03 8:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I really don't get it.</span><hr size=1> Twina,<br>
<br>
Aye I get group invites I've been around for 3 plus years and have friends on the server.  But I know of warriors coming up through the various Gathering guilds that haven't raided much don't have great gear or are not well known that can't buy a group unless there is no Paladins or SKs to be found.  <br>
<br>
I've seen groups wait for a Paladin or an SK to come free instead of picking up one of the four or five warriors that were LFG.<br>
<br>
If Sony doesn't like the old Iron Triangle then fine change the content to make it so you need the other classes.  That is hard its easier to;<br>
<br>
Give Druids and Shamans better heals so that Clerics are not a must have.<br>
<br>
Its easier to flag MoBs unmezzable and to boost up Bard CC and or make root mezzing easier.<br>
<br>
Its easier to boost up Paladin and SK DPS (in the case of Paladins vs Undead to insane levels with Slay Undead 3) and to boost up their mitigation to the point where they can take the place of Warriors.<br>
<br>
I can argue that the first two have harmed the classes that used to fill those roles but that is another issue.<br>
<br>
The point here being that last one.<br>
<br>
Its not like they made Paladins and SKs able to tank as well as warriors and took away some of a Paladins ability to heal or made SK FD less reliable.  No they in fact with PoP made Paladin and SK spells more usefull.  Paladins to their group and SKs to themselves.<br>
<br>
So now we have classes that have very good spells.  Very solid roles on raids.  And can do the one thing Warriors can do, tank.  Only with their spells that can tank better then we can as they can hold agro better.<br>
<br>
Clerics have more then one role because they have the spells for it.  Are they bad at those other roles yes but they can nuke for example.<br>
<br>
Enchanters have more then one role because they have the spells for it.  Again they can nuke they're still better at CC but can do other things.<br>
<br>
What other role is there for a Warrior but attempting to hold agro?  We can chip in decent DPS but frankly their are a lot of classes better then us at that.  <br>
<br>
The sad part is to fix our class they would have to break their game or nerf the Knights.  I don't think they can do it.<br>

They had the classical palladin half warrior, half cleric so for balance put in the not so classical anti-hero. Half warrior/half necro. From that point on they had no plan or idea what we are or how we should evolve.<br>
 I can't speak for palladins, but while I grew up warriors were chosen over shadowknights. They were tanks, we were a novelty. In time we stumbled on the fact that some of our spells caused massive amounts of agro, we had found a niche. If the warrior fell, we could grab the agro quickly and save the others getting killed. <br>
 As patches came, some of our agro spells became less effective as a side-effect of change and with Luclin VI/SoE gave us specific agro spells for the first time since we had found a niche and they were happy to leave us there since it was less work. Fine for me, I now had a single raid usefull buff. <br>
 However the downside to this agro discovery was lazy group members.<br>
 Somewhere along the lines of EQ expansions the availability and quality of equipment was outdone by the power of the mobs.<br>
 An old world warrior can tank an old world mob for a few seconds to get solid agro before the slows start to land, if they were even necessary, then everyone joins in.<br>
 Suddenly the mobs are hitting so hard/fast that those few seconds become more vital. The SK may have the same poor quality of equipment as the warrior, but we aren't as dependent on it. So groups look for fast agro because they don't want to have to work up a sweat. Personally whenever he's about I have my top guild warrior tank on Reapers raids so they don't get lazy and learn to manage agro.<br>
<br>
 Warriors make better tanks than knights, but players are too lazy to think about what theyre doing and just want to tash/slow/nuke without regard and SoE seem reluctant to alter their ironic agro formula of worst tanking ability = best agro ability and vice versa and the players won't change their nature.<br>
<br>
 Warriors should not have to feel second rate to knights just because the non melees don't have a clue. Warriors should not need to rely on agro transfer tactics just for regular hunting parties.<br>
<br>
 Warriors are masters of their art, lifelong dedication to the ways of war and fighting. They should have better caps on all melee skills, better equipment available of an appropriate level to the game content and to be perfectly honest if they took away Taunt from all except warriors I wouldn't think it harsh.<br>
I can hear the screams of nerfage now, but there are always screams as everyone thinks their class should be able to do everything.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I don't play a warrior, so even though I have close friends that do, I do not know of or understand the subtleties of the class. There may be issues that make my entire point of view....pointless, but I thought I'd stop by and lend some support anyway.<br>

The point of this in my mind is balance. Warriors are fine for exp grps. ya the chanter or cleric or shamen might get hit some befor the warrior gets argo but who cares. ON raids knights are MA;s and offtankers on trash due to the fact of pulling in for mobs they go to slow one and all would be on them if they were not tanked mezzed yet. If warriors become the exp grp tank then knights should become the big mob tank. No class should be the best at every single mob in the game.  Warriors should get a dps upgrade imo and that is about it minus maybe a better taunt button , Example is every time you hit the taunt button and you are not top of argo list it puts you on top by 1 ( like it is now) but if you are on top of the argo list and hit the taunt button it adds 300 argo at the start of the fight and drops over the course of a fight to like a 100 per pressing of the taunt button. This trait would be warrior only. That way the rest of the classes can potentially get top of argo list if they need it but warriors will get a instant argo  thing that is not over powering but when used right helps a lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
to be honest i hate this crap that shadow knights and pallies are better tanks then warriors. Everyone is bitchin and moaning that shadow knights and pallies can tank quarm now, no kidding IT is old content. And the few who can tank him are rare rare exceptions. Warriors can tank better on high end mobs, now befor you say BS. Who was the first to tank emp when it was fresh  content? Warriors same for aten, same for vulak same for quarm. Then after people have geared up on that exspansion beyond what the content is capable of then knights can tank. Hell monks Can tank fenin ro if they have enough hp. <br>
<br>
Warriors need to be fixxed but if you look at what class is the first to tank almost any high end encounter it is warriors, there role is more raid orientated. this goes for new content. Hell I bet a cleric could ma AoW now if they had the hp.<br>
<br>
<br>
If they go and lower knights abilitys to tank then we are useless and warriors still are at the same point. There is no reason a warrior should be first pick for a class for grps and raids. just like a knight should not be top pick for grp and raid.<br>
<br>
The point is every class is situational, but warriors atm are lacking the balance that  some of the other classes have. I am all for warriors getting a boost but i think the worst part of reading the melle balanceing posts is that warriors are complaining that knights can tank all that they can, how ever they don;t look at the fact that it is old content. have a shadow knight in full ele gear time wepon and shield and then throw on a bunch of 40 hp or 50 hp augs of course they can tank  time gods.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~odanzig/ThorukSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I'm not getting worked up either.  I really enjoy playing a warrior.  Class balance has never been a big issue to me.  I've enjoyed the challenge of getting and keeping agro and have been frustrated by it as well.  But I will be the last one to cry class imbalance.  All the various classes have evolved over time due to SOE tweaks.  The key is to adapt.  Adaptation proves the quality of player you are.<br>
<br>
There is another <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessage?topicID=1288.topic"> thread </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> that is related.  Getting locked into a mindset is limiting.  If people want to alter the iron triangle to replace the warrior with a pally/sk then so be it.  But for me I'll be the oddball and take those oddball groups.  Those oddball groups are usually the funnest times I've had in the game.  I was in Tactics one day with Baete and a necro friend of his.  The three of us did well, but instead of the standard tanking/slowing/healing tactic we did something else.  We altered our tactics to match what our group could do.  This plays right in to the point Krastus made.  Don't form your groups according to a narrow tactical mindset.  Adjust the tactics to the group.<br>
<br>

To be honest.. there is really no difference when you are tanking RZ in Time on or off disc.. he still hits freaking hard and can kill you in one attack round either way if you get unlucky rolls on hit checks. <br>
<br>
Having to contend with pallys and sks for this gear that helps us be a better tank ( lets face it... as a warrior we are primarilly gear dependant, if you dont believe me take a look at AC/HP/Modifiers on TOV vs Time gear  and see who survives the longest ) just makes it harder for a raid leader to chose a warrior over pally when tanking big mobs. <br>
<br>
I know for a fact there are SKs and pally's over 10khp and they have the modifiers such as shielding/dodge etc. Torahdane in FE has over 10khp and 2100ac when fully buffed and can keep agro like a mad man.. he has tanked many a named when warriors were dead or couldnt keep agro. <br>
<br>
The major bitch is we have very few items in PoTime and Elemental planes that give us the advantage of being a warrior over a pally or SK for most raid/group situations. <br>
<br>
I myself dont really care as long as my guild as a whole gets the job done. I have over 10500hp fully buffed and have a few upgrades left to get myself.  But I do see where the high end warriors do have a little room to bitch. Its not so apparent prior to Elemental/PoTime but yall will see once you work your way there. <br>
<br>
Hope that fills in some blanks there twina and gives you an idea of what the bitching is about. <br>

I get pretty disgusted sometimes when a mob one rounds me for a quick death. I don't have the hp that Sil does nor the AA I'm sure, but quite often lately the fight for me is over before it begins. Thank God for Fenny, Aram, Janny etc that they're front line. A nice little boost for warriors would definately be nice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninjathoruk>Ninja thoruk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(11/13/03 3:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I really don't get it.</span><hr size=1> i think the point people miss though is warriors work fine in grps ya they don;t have instant argo but it is there(not to mention the Augs now make warriors better as tanks). Yes a shadow knight or pally can tank Time stuff especially when they have the higher hp (which is not common) and then you have to look at the encounter. No one could set a new ssra knight up to tank the emp. after he has a bunch of upgrade sure he can but now you have to realize that emp is old content. As for time there is so much loot and so many drops per raid that most can get at least one item per raid, if there are DKP saved as i know many of FE did for a long time then a person will be better geared in shorter time then Verant would want. I guess that verant felt that knights would go the left overs and there for be behind the warriors in hp shielding ect, forgetting that points are what determins loot. <br>
<br>
I agree that warriors need a boost and are welcome to complain about it, but the part that bugs me is the whole well the knights can so should I. Every class has its advantages and disadvantges. Pallies can heal grps but get more argo and can;t FD. Shads can dot and on average do more dps and we can fd the argo how ever we can;t heal anyone worth scat yes we can grp 200hp and 100 mana ever min but that is not going to save a cleric who is getting pounded on. Warriors were given the Discs that when they were implimented they made the difference, how ever as the game has progressed and exspansions have come and gone the discs on almost every single class have become near useless. I would like to see an upgrade to wars defensive dis where it gives 20% argo increase above normal with the less dmg taken. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~odanzig/ThorukSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

You and I are not so far apart.  Warrior discs are what we got and they helped a lot then.  But with PoP Knights got fairly major improvements while Warriors seem to have been pretty much forgotten in this expansion.  <br>
<br>
Not sure though how Verant fixes things or even if they can.  I understood the limits on my class as the person who showed me EQ was playing a warrior at the time and in general I am happy.  That said I know of warriors in the Gathering that simply have a hell of a time getting groups because they're not knights.<br>
<br>
We'll have to see how things go.<br>

I remeber raiding in north tov and luclin and doing nothing but playing gems. then pop came out and things changed. I think Verant never thought a shadow knight would hit 10k hp. on most other servers where the calender is in effect and the rotations limit guilds loots there is most likely more of a difference between warriors and knights. example would be guild 01 has 2 days to clear PoF they do it then wait 3 weeks to be aloud again. hence the loot per person in the guild drops, not to mention the loot they would get would have to go to key classes/players to allow that guild to progress. and since the loot lvs are down you would see an increase in warriors abilitys compared to knights <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.comcast.net/~odanzig/ThorukSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
In BoT for instance, the following is a common lament after a chanter/etc gets pounded on : &quot;but that wasn't happening when the SK was tanking&quot;.  Right, that wasn't happening. And do you have any clue <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>why?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  They don't. <br>
<br>
Levelling up on a Druid, I came from the school of &quot;don't nuke until 50%&quot;. That was the golden rule. Debuffs? You didn't cast them until 90% and even then you cringed as you cast. Snare? NEVER until just before the mob turns. Why all of these unwritten rules? Because you will get agro- and that was your own fault. Getting agro if you weren't the MA was something you yourself took ownership of and were to blame for. Getting agro was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>bad</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if you were not the MA. And then you ventured into the scary places like Umbral Plains and you encountered your first summoning mobs in exp groups. And now if you drew agro it was pretty much announced to all in hearing when the mob summoned you. <br>

Whatever the changes or fixes may be, the unfortunate fact remains that the problem of laziness on the part of all other members of a group is something no patch will ever fix.<br>

<br>
I also understand a bit more about the perspective of the up and coming warrior, not getting groups because of the ridiculous perception SK and Pal make better tanks. And yes - it is ridiculous. For the odd extra hit and few seconds per mob - when I play a healing class (granted not very often anymore) I like to think I can cope with the situation at hand- not bish when I'm not spoon-fed.<br>
