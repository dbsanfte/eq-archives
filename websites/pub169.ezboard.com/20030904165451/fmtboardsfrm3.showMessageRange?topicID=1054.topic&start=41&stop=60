Now I know I've never been to pass up taking a shot at pallies or SK's, but running a warrior heavy guild, most of the time my MA's are either SK's or pallies for clearing or trash mobs (note, trash mobs hitting close to 800-1k a shot). Love the knight class' ability to lock agro faster than wars, which make the healers and debuffers quite happy. Not to mention the friggin ridiculous amounts of Pally/SK only armor my guild seem to get would rot were it not for the Triune knight crew to scoop it up (/rude SOE).<br>
<br>
Anyway, props to pallies and Sk's. You guys are like earwax. You may not be pretty, but you do serve some purpose!<br>
<br>
Oh and back to topic. Yalwen, you may be or have been a great tank, but know the zones. You have no business being in PoV at 52. No one's going to take a pally with zero ability to tank those mobs efficiently, and a pretty measly DPS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wilerian>Wilerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/21/03 11:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I don't exactly understand your point anymore.<br>
<br>
You say that your dps is not that good but it is added dps.  But I don't understand how in anyway shape or form you are gonna out dps anybody else who is higher level that you in that zone.  Hence why you can't find a group.<br>
<br>
You say your not there to be plinged but isn't that excatly what is gonna happen if you join 60 plus group in POV.  You can call it by any other name but aren't you LFG in POV for one reason only to get xp....and as much of it as possible.  So much xp that you feel being lfg for hours is worth the wait for a POV group.<br>
<br>
My grammer (yeah I know it's really grammar but FU) might suck and I'm not smartedst pod in the pea but I know what plinging is.   Anyone can say &quot;I'm don't want to be plinged&quot; but if you're in a zone you can't survive in without grouping with players who are 8 or 10 levels above you that's exactly what is going to happen to you.<br>
<br>
Your actions dictate the opposite of what you are posting.  And I agree a 58 pally should not be tanking in POV either.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draxusmt>Draxus MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/21/03 11:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>running a warrior heavy guild<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I'm not seeing where that comes into this argument at all.  DPS is dps...regardless of how much or little.....the group decides if they need little, average, or mega amounts.  <br>
<br>
So, that being said, I'm going with everyone else here...my first thought when reading this that a 52 was in PoV was either the group was VERY desperate...but now reading that you had been in the zone looking for a group for quite a bit?  You were after some PL'ing....no way around it.<br>

That would probably be you in this case....but, I wasn't there, so I don't know.  /shrug.  <br>
<br>
I did have a 56 necro in a PoV group with me once though...and we had no problems at all....then again, he wasn't tanking.  /shrug.  Guess it depends on the person.<br>

I've grouped with a couple 57-58ish tanks in PoV and some have more HP/AC than some level 65 tanks trying to tank in BoT.  The removal of the need to go through PoJ trials has made it much easier for an under-equipped player to get into these zones.<br>

See a 58 tank LFG and you need a tank?  Ask him what his HP/AC is.  He's not gonna be able to lie about it and fool the group for very long.  52 is way too low to be useful for anything though.  There's always gonna be someone better than that for a PoV group LFG.

<br>
I don't think it was nice that others were taunting you.  However, I wouldn't have invited you to a group either.   If I was looking for a replacement for a group I was running I'd be looking for the best replacement available.   I've never had a problem finding someone 60+ to join a group in PoV.   Its not a first come first serve line.   You could be there 5 hours LFG and I'd still take that 63 Paladin who just zoned in over you every time.   <br>

You'd be far better served going to PoD and grouping in the CY's until 60.<br>

That may work for knights, but I know from experience that a warrior won't be able to taunt anything at that level.  You may have the HP/AC, but taunt is very level dependant.

A 52 paladin/warrior/ranger/whatever is nothing more than a speedbump for mobs in Valor.

he's not ranting because ppl wouldn't take him for a group. he's ranting because the guy was rude to him. if he wants to sit in PoV for hours and /LFG then he can.  if he can get into the zone then he has a right to be there just like anyone else. if you don't think he should be there then don't take him for your group. <br>
if exp is split only 5 ways for a 6 person group then... umm.. that would be a bonus.<br>
added dps for the same amount of exp... i call that a bonus )<br>
you can't judge anyone's tanking ability by the level they are. just like you can't judge a person's pulling ability by the fact that they are a L60 monk ( this i found out the hard way).<br>

<br>
as far as exp in a 6 man group goes..if i recall correctly anyways, in DL, Guk, Seb..those zones..doesn't having a person 10-15 levels under you equal more experience for the higher leveled ones? granted this new exp bonus system they implemented may change that, but if not..well, who'd be PLing who?<br>
<br>
also, to address the &quot;sitting in PoV for hours&quot; LFG point that was made..i don't. After a long night of farming AA's on Booke, i pop onto Yalwen looking for group. I don't stay on him long. When I do, I generally sit on the hill, out of people's way, LFG overlooking OC camp. I run down occasionally to hit with downtime heals to help out the cleric, toss any buffs i have that will stick on them, and generally hope their fights go well, with no deaths. I occasionally check the MA's/cleric's health with my finger on LoH, but have not had to use it yet. I'm not in PoV to bother anyone, and if they are bothered, that's their own option to allow the fact I am there to bother them. I'm just in the zone, cuz simply put, I can be..and there is nothing wrong with hoping, like I said a group does say &quot;hey Yalwen, wanna jump in group for a bit?&quot; But it doesn't mean me just being in there I am pestering, or bothering any groups looking to get &quot;PL'ed&quot;..this whole thing with PLing too..has me confused. See, I associate PLing with a low player having a high player behind him to buff, heal and DS them to gain levels..I don't see PLing as that way, with me LFG..i plan to contribute to a group effort, if i am invited to join, so that we ALL would get experience. <br>
<br>
Either way, I appreciate all the opinions here, and aside from Faate's little outburst, am glad it didn't turn into a full on flame-fest. I was simply expressing my opinion of how a player shouldn't be judged on how they perform, based on level, with no knowledge of ever having seen them play.<br>
<br>
To the ones suggesting Yalwen hit the tier 1's, you are right..when I decide to LFG on Yalwen, I will hit those zones until he can handle PoV/PoS..still will hope someday a /tell comes my way..i AM flagged (hint hint!)..if you have a 50's alt, who knows, you may get to group with Yalwen, and see for yourself, he does play a damn good tank, an aspect of his playing that I have a lot of self-respect about..hope you get to see this when he gets in his 60's.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draxusmt>Draxus MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 170<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/21/03 5:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: points..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Pallies and SK's do alot better than people give them credit for.You gonna cancel the group because you can't find a Warrior to MT?
