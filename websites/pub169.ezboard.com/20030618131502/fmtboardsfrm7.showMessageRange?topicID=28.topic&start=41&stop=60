<br>
Only way a clueless player will believe it is if a guide/GM is parked there enforcing the list.  Otherwise, he/she will be thinking those promoting the list are scamming him/her, especially if they are there and the &quot;next&quot; person on the supposed list isn't present.  For all they know, these people are trying to scam him/her on a FFA spawn.<br>
<br>
Of course, if one of the four clerics is already there before him/her then there is no problem.<br>
<br>
If you were 60 on the list and have to wait a couple weeks, aren't you still far better off?  Or perhaps, you'd prefer they nerf the shard drops to get rid of the bottleneck?<br>

(1) we no longer have a dedicated GM.  The Gm's now float from server to server.. Their policy with the Guides is they CAN and WILL do 1 of 4 options when people are disputing a mob.  The parties can choose to come to their OWN agreement, they can just leave, they can go with the Enforced random(and hope they get lucky), or the Guide or GM will just kill the spawn.  And then no one gets it.  Once they make a ruling, if you dont comply, you will get a formal warnin put on your account.  The Lead GM came and clarified what the GUIDES could and couldnt do.  <br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong, a mob that doesnt need killing is a FFA mob.  The Lead Gm didnt say different.. He was enforcing a RULING.  That is why the cleric that ganked, got a formal warning put on their account.  <br>
<br>
The four of us that were involved informed everyone there.. The newcomers asked to be added to a &quot;list&quot; as they were goin to stay and camp it as well.  The &quot;list&quot; was with respect to one another.  The ganker was 6th on the list.  And those there even took a vote whether we should stick to our new &quot;list&quot; or try to outgank one another and make it FFA.  The ganker chose &quot;list&quot; as well as the majority.  <br>
<br>
Thank god, with cooperation with my fellow clerics that were in the dispute, I was lucky enuff to get my pearl last nite.  Hehe, after a looong non sleeping weekend.   54 hours I stayed and camped.. I even went so far as to keep the fgs cleared with my warrior, so I could sit on top of the spawn.  Imagine how you would feel, if someone just logged in, and sat  next to you and said, &quot;I dont care, Im gonna gank&quot; this is  a FFA mob.   Its a lil different when it happens to you.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is, we started with a dispute of 4 clerics, we ended as bonded clerics battling future gankers.  To all those lazy thieves in the night that try to sneak in and not put time in, bugger off and may your clicky stick rust.<br>
<br>
Good luck Boraf, Reigna and Bigjon.. if you need me, just /tell  Ill come to aid )<br>
<br>
FYI, we did inform each and every new cleric that came, as to what happened and how we had designated 4 spawns from a forced random.  They dont have to believe us, they can always petition to see if its true.  But dont tell me that you feel &quot;right and justified&quot; coming 10 mins prior to it spawning, see others sittin in line, and its yours to gank.<br>
<br>
lol, theres nothing worse than a scorned woman.. and hehe Im female through and through..<br>
<br>
Good luck everyone..<br>
<br>
Oh, btw, LEAD GM also said that they are lookin into the Merchant spawn.. Since that was put there to alleviate the bottleneck, ganks, fights last year from people ksin one another.  Now that its a bottleneck again, who knows they might change the way the spawn pops or how long it stays.. <br>

All I can say for the ones saying the warning is lesser than having the epic, you do what you think you must do... If you want to take the warning and gank it so be it... You've all been warned about it on here, so just like in life you do something you have to accept the consequences...<br>

I see it not as a gank but as a first come first serve.. You guys werent expecting epic till next year now you all are bitching about some stupid 24hour spawn that clerics are ganking or one cleric that ganked it..<br>
<br>
All i have to say is be ready.. Cause you shouldnt have to wait for a list to know when to camp it for 24hrs just sit there and wait for it cause the GM's decision to make it that crappy list is retarded..<br>
<br>
I wish i was a cleric right about now i'd do the same thing because for one i might not even have trolled these boards and also if I went into SolB got to that merchant and found out that there was a list from a cleric and no GM's on i wouldnt have believed him.. I would think he was just saying it so I could leave so he wouldnt have any competition.. The whole fact that your griping about it whomever is retarded.. I dont know I just think the whole list and the warning thing is retarded..<br>

.. and as for any one who says &quot;If your not a 50+ cleric who was on the RF list, stfu!&quot; .. You might want to listen!<br>
<br>
I see no reason that a person can not claim a mob to do a turn in, &quot;Verbally&quot;.  ie .. /camp check ?? .. /ooc RF Merchant.  If i'm not mistaken this is true for Fay.  However, where the hell does this list thing come from.  I think this is inherent due to the RF list.  These are NOT the same by any streach of the imagination, not even close.  Now forget for a few minutes that anyone 50+ able to do the turn in should have long ago .. (spilt milk) and forget the fact that completing the Cleric Epic is now the easiest of ALL the classes, Rogue and Druid included.  You all remember rogue epic is called the Free-Bringer.  You all need to follow your on-line PnP rule book.<br>
<br>
As for a GM forced list that is posted NO where, all I can say is HA!!  I don't troll these boards.  I'm here maybe once a month.  If I turn in my pearl before Joe Shmoe and get a Warning then someone is going to eat my ass before im done with them.  VI encourages questing.  VI has no personal address system.  There is no On-Line mail box.  Message boards are only for those whom read them, NOT the EQ community.  If VI wants to hold a list then they BETTER put it on the MOTD when you sign in.  Even if they do that, they BETTER be prepared to explain what it means.  (I know you all understand what a 'LIST' means, but there are some who certainly do not)  All you Sh!t house lawyers think you know what is fair .. and just cause 4 people agreed does not mean that ALL and I mean ALL of the Community Clerics were asked to random.  <br>
<br>
I can see a GM / Guide forcing you to RND for the 'Next' spawn, but no way for 72 hours in the future, someone else might want to come do it.  Who is going to tell then the have to /petition to get one a list.  I certainly hope they don't listed to the person you is going to gank thier merchant spawn.  After all .. They don't know you are in Kahoots with the GM / Guide.  who the Fook are you to tell them they can't.<br>
<br>
Bottom line.  Claim your spawn .. One spawn at a time .. respect people for who they are .. End of story<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ps... The BEST (only IMHO) solution for the whole problem ..<br>
....Make the spawn point a PvP area.. Then we'll see people stfu! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukalyneblakrose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalyne BlakRose</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator<BR>Kal Kal The Taxi Gal</span><br>  Posts: 80<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/9/02 5:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=49>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Zzelda</span><hr size=1> Your opinion of 'first come first serve' doesn't hold with your agreement of the person ganking it.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  In addition to the general guidelines listed in section 1.0, players are also subject to these supplementary rules while playing EverQuest. While by no means an all-inclusive list of the do's and don'ts in EverQuest, it provides a suitable foundation by which the player can determine what activities are appropriate: <br>
<br>
1. You may not steal kills.<br>
<br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br>
<br>
The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. <br>
<br>
2. You may not ninjaloot.<br>
<br>
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br>
<br>
3. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br>
<br>
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same NPC or hunt in the same area. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. <br>
<br>
If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a compromise. Any such compromise is final and not open to debate. Refusing to abide by these terms will be considered disruption and may result in disciplinary action. <br>
<br>
It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

What I meant by First Come First Serve dear Kaylne &lt;sp&gt; was that the first one to put that Pearl into a trade box and hit &quot;Give&quot; is first served.  Not First One to park their toon there and go to bed.<br>
<br>
VI supports no lists and it doesnt support their guides making lists.  I can't see how the RF Merchant can EVER be a contested spawn because as soon as you give it the pearl, it gives you the shimmering pearl and despawns.  Where is there the possibility to contest that??? <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

I agree, if the person is in bed, you can do whatever the heck you want. It's outrageous that anyone would think that someone would sit another x hours and wait for Cleric 1 to get their ass out of bed and turn in the pearl. I agree 100% with you there.  But, by the same token, if someone has been sitting there 15 or 20 hours and you just show up, and the guy spawns and you turn in your pearl first, while you have every right to do so, it's awfully rude. The thing about MT is that it's always had this wonderful spirit of community, and when people advocate this behaviour I just feel it lowers us to what goes on on some of the other really crappy servers.<br>
