</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->the lonely cry echoed through the vast walls of Malaehi's bedroom.  The enchantress sat up in bed, pulled her legs up and hugged her knees tightly, sobbing into them.<br>
<br>
The voice had returned to haunt her, the same maddening voice that drove her to throw herself off the high cliff of the Frontier Mountains ever so long ago.  He had returned... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Your Goddess is dead, she has forsaken you Malaehi... the Gods are more mortal than you think...&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi quickly got out of her destroyed bed, donned a robe and fled out of her estate as fast as her horse would take her.  By nightfall, she had entered the city of her Gnome, Katta Castellum.  Barging in, unannounced, Malaehi ran up the stairs and into Xendapus Fabink's sleeping quarters.  <br>
<br>
The noise was deafening as she entered the room.  Malaehi was on her guard searching for the dragon who must be hiding in the Gnome's room.  But, there was no dragon, just a wee wizard, curled up into a ball on a tiny bed, snoring so loudly the walls and floor shook.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Gnome... gnome?&quot; </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->she gently shook Xend's shoulder to wake him up.  He lept up into the air, brandishing a sword in one hand and a dagger in the other, slicing and screaming wildly <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Die! Die! DIE!!!&quot;.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi leaped back in time, saving herself from certain death.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;GNOME!  It's me!!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Xendapus blinked, eyes coming into focus <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Elf?!  Bah, what is this?&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi was still in shock, seeing her wild-eyed Gnome, dual wielding in black silk pajamas and a pink sleeping cap.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;What's this?&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The wizard quickly hid the weapons behind his back, tossing them across the room with a whistle and an innocent grin.  The long tassel from his pink nightcap flipped over his face, tickling his nose.  He blushed and ripped the cap off quickly.<br>
<br>
Malaehi rushed into his arms and hugged him tightly.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;The voice is back, Gnome.  I am so scared!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  He hugged her in return, kissing her elven ears whispering, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;You are safe with me, Mala.  Come, you need sleep, more talk in the morning.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
With a few muttered words and a pull on a cord, his bed expanded into a King sized one.  Buzzing clockwork robots busied about the room, putting on sheets and adding thick warm blankets and pillows.  Xend crawled up on the bed and pulled Malaehi in, then tucked her under the sheets nicely and kissed her nose.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Sleep now, I'll be over here keeping watch, ok elf?&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  He picked up his sword and his knife and sat at the foot of the bed, peering into the darkened room, protecting his wife-to-be.<br>
<br>
Malaehi drifted off to sleep quickly and into a dreamscape.  She found herself walking in a castle filled with crazy sights and sounds, wild laughter and uncontrolled screams.  In front of her was a tall, female wearing a beautiful diaphanous gown of black.  She was skeletally thin with pale skin. Long, black fingernails extended from her bony hands, to match her slinky gown. Her face was smooth - no features marred its sleek surface other than two empty black eye sockets. Long black hair flowed back from two massive brass horns at her temples.<br>
<br>
The enchantress recognized her immediately and tried to run, but Terris Thule just laughed and summoned Mala back to her side.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Twice you have tormented me, slaying my minions, trying to destroy me in the name of your Goddess of Love.  Well, you will see what has become of her and the other so called Gods of Norrath.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Entering a vast ballroom, through a crimson fog she saw the pantheon of Norrathian Gods dancing on the white and black checkerboard floor.  They were tiny and doll-like, moving about like marionette puppets.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Behold the glorious Gods!  Do you want to know why your goddess never answers your prayers anymore, enchantress?  Do you?!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi looked on in horror and Terris Thule held up a limp body of a beautiful Barbarian female, dressed in resplendent white robes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Behold your Goddess, Erollisi Marr!&quot; </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Terris threw the doll like Erollisi to the floor and summoned Cazic Thule over.  As the puppet approached, he grew larger and larger, until he reached his full height, towering over all in the room.  Terris pushed Malaehi into his arms and she tried with all her magic to escape, but she was held fast in Cazic's viselike grip.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Summon your Goddess to save you now, enchantress.&quot; </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Terris Thule laughed maniacally as Cazic Thule opened his huge mouth to swallow Malaehi whole.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;ELF!!  ELF!!&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A stinging slap woke Malaehi up from her dream, and she peered into the gaunt, worried face of her Gnome.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Bah, FINALLY!  Are you ok??  You have slept for a fortnight!  I have summoned every priest and shaman I know to awaken you.  You almost seemed...&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Xendapus cringed, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;.... dead&quot;.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi was weakened and disoriented looking around the room and seeing many faces.  Her mind filled with that mad voice saying:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;...the deities are more mortal than they think...the deities are more mortal than they think...&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p>Malaehi d'Aeliu - Phantasmist, in the service of Erollisi Marr<br>

She had spent the past few weeks trying to make sense of her dreams and the voice she heard.  Of all people, she had found a clue with a fallen Paladin.  He spoke of a realm that matched her dream precisely.  <br>
<br>
The home of Bristlebane.<br>
<br>
Malaehi ventured to the Temple of Veeshan and waited patiently to join a war party to travel safely through the lair of the fierce Dragons and enter the Plane of Mischief.<br>
<br>
She spent the next week wandering the walls of the Castle until she finally found what she was looking for.  The ballroom matched the scene from Malaehi’s dream perfectly.  It all made perfect sense now.<br>
<br>
She found Erollisi Marr and threw herself down at the feet of the Goddess and wept.  But, the Goddess stared across the room with glass eyes and an empty smile, dancing around, mindlessly.<br>
<br>
The voice whispered in her ear… <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Yes, it is true.  You have put your faith in a puppet.  You have fought for no one but yourself and those around you, enchantress.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi whirled around quickly and at last saw the one who’s voice had haunted her.  He was a human, but wraithlike in appearance, wearing the garments of a prisoner.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Who are you!?”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The gaunt man chuckled and leaned upon a staff wearily, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“I am called many things… The Forsaken… the UnGod … the Mad… but, what is a name?”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> he shrugged and hobbled through the crimson fog, disappearing.<br>
<br>
Malaehi turned back to her Goddess and gently gathered the doll into her arms and hugged her to her chest.  Murmuring words of forgiveness she stepped into a blue-grey portal and left Bristlebane’s abode.<br>

She recalled being awestruck by the Gods and their power.  Evil Innoruuk had sent his minions to slaughter all those invading his realm.  When the time was right, and the army was strong enough, she would see him die again and again.  <br>
<br>
Riding her mount, Kingwell, through Lesser Faydark, she recalled laying eyes on the fearful Cazic Thule when he faced off with the tree-hugging sprite Tunare.  The result was a ruined land.  Later she would see Cazic Thule in his own realm and eventually trod across his fallen body.  He was no more than a mighty, powerful beast; nothing to be deified.<br>
<br>
But, what of the rest?  Terris Thule, Saryrn, the Zek twins and Bertoxxulous, … all so called Gods, but lay dead like cattle.<br>
<br>
Praise be to the Gods of the light…<br>
<br>
Malaehi paused and shifted in her saddle.  Kingwell nickered softly, warning the enchantress of an intruder.  The frail man emerged from the Faydark fog and caressed Kingwell’s soft nose.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Where were those Gods of the light when this land was cursed?  Why would they not instantly come to your aid when you called?  Why did they allow so many to suffer and perish in battle….”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> His voice grew louder into a shout, echoing through the forest… <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Only to allow you to be resurrected and die again?!”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
He turned to the forest and raised his staff  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Where are you when we need you?  Why do you toy with us?!”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
He paused and crouched low to the ground and listened, like a crazed person… <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Shh... You hear that?”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi listened intently, straining to hear.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly the man was upon Kingwell’s back and behind Malaehi in the saddle, holding her tight with his staff across her throat, choking her.  Kingwell took off into a terrified run through the forest at breakneck speed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Call for Erollisi NOW!!!  Do IT!!  Where is she?”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi closed her eyes and focused her magic on escaping in anyway, but the man was relentless with his grip, laughing in her ear the whole time.  She prayed to her Goddess, but remembered that her Goddess was a doll, stuffed away in her backpack tied to Kingwell’s saddle.  She had to do something fast, she could not breathe.  She sent her thoughts out into a pure clear stream of thought. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Help me, my love&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Call to her… CALL to any of them… they ARE DEAD!!!  Or they just do not CARE!  Do you hear me?!”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Tears and the sharp cold wind stung Mala’s cheeks as she felt Kingwell take flight into the air.  The sharp smell of sulfur struck the air as a thunderbolt bounced harmlessly off the back of the madman.  Below on the ground, stood Xendapus chanting and firing off explosions aimed at the madman.<br>
<br>
Then the world went black and tilted left.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Malaehi woke up in Xendapus’ room, again with his worried face near hers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“There, there she is!  Bah, elf!  You will be the death of me!” </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The gnome sighed.  Mala struggled to speak, but the Gnome put a finger over her lips saying:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“I found something you may want to snuggle with!” </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> He cackled and hopped off the bed and returned with the Erollisi Marr puppet in his hands.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Look!  A Dolly!”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> he rambled on missing the look of shock and terror in the enchantress’ eyes <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“… just tuck her under your chin and snuggle up for a while.  I need to run out and let everyone know you are fine… hush hush just sleep!”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi waited for Xend to leave, before crawling out of bed, grabbing her things and gating back to Plane of Tranquility.  She entered her home on the hill and walked around to her meditation garden.  She settled in and slipped into a trance and deep thought.<br>
<br>
Hours later, she got up refreshed and determined.  She summoned Kingwell and put the doll into his saddleback and sent him off to graze.  Her courier came in with a message.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Milady, evil has invade the land of Tunare and the Council of Faydark and the ancients of Erollisi Marr seek your aid in stopping them.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi spat in disgust, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“after the abuse the Ancients of Erollisi put me through … torturing me because I fell in love… because I gave myself to a male.  NOW, they want my help…”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Malaehi recalled the searing pain of being flogged and starved for her “crime”, for breaking her vow of chastity; they would have taken her life, had it not been for the intervention of Kae, the mysterious enchantress who was a member of the Council.<br>
<br>
She had left the sect of the Goddess and continued to worship her on her own.  But, to what avail…<br>

The land was bare and quiet.  She called out into the emptiness:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>“Please I beg of you, for the love of all that is holy and sacred, leave this land now, untouched and unspoiled!  This is the realm of the Mother of All.  Leave her in peace.”</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Her call was returned with familiar voices… Krastus, the evil Knight who has hunted by her side for ages, aye hating her to the core, but protecting her more often than not.  Then the chillingly evil voice of the dead himself, Patron of the House Rea’Morda, beckoning the enchantress in a mocking manner, to join in on the hunt.  <br>
<br>
As she rode Kingwell through the battle scarred land, she recalled the times where the evil one himself had summoned her corpse from the dead, aiding her in battle many times.<br>
<br>
One by one familiar voices, Cortusa, Kogbender, Maedaria, Charaniki, and more.  Voices whom she was told she should hate because of the God they follow.  But, she never hated them.  No, the love of the Goddess impelled Malaehi to convince these lost souls to stop their evil ways and return to the light from where they were snatched ever so long ago by their evil Gods.  Now, she was ordered to slay these for invading Tunare’s realm?!  <br>
<br>
She rode closer to the war party.<br>
<br>
The coldest voice cut through the land, the one whom she feared the most:  Rusalka, Matron of the House, High Priestess of Innoruuk.  The same one who brought Malaehi back from the dead countless times, who stood side by side as they brought Innoruuk to his knees.<br>
<br>
She paused in thought as she rounded the bend and looked down at the hunters. She frowned and decided to disobey the orders of the Faydark Champions, ripping the missive to shreds.  She would not attempt to slaughter these people, nor die trying.<br>
<br>
Approaching the party she expected to be killed as swiftly as they killed the pumas.  But, she was greeted and invited to join in.  Mala tried again to dissuade them from hunting in these holy lands… but even those words sounded dead on her tongue.<br>
<br>
What made these lands holy and Innoruuk’s defiled?<br>
<br>
The voice of laughter resounded in her ears, the voice of the madman, the voice of the Forsaken.  He was Zebuxoruk. And he was right.<br>
<br>
Malaehi joined in the battle and fought furiously, just as she had done in the other realms of the Gods.<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
The next day, she was with another army in the Halls of Honor, where she stood on top of the corpse of Mithaniel Marr, twin of her Goddess and a worthy foe.<br>
<br>
Malaehi threw her head back and roared in victory!<br>
<br>
Faith in the Gods was dead to her; however, faith in those she hunted with took its place in her heart.  She was scared, no doubt, but free. <p>Malaehi d'Aeliu - Phantasmist, in the service of Erollisi Marr<br>
