It is admirable that you wish to exonerate Joselyn and protect what is left of her reputation.  I will not argue that the player you knew is the one guilty of the theft.  I just wanna tell ya that as long as you know that she did not do it, I am sure she will be fine for it.  It takes great faith and no small amount of love for someone to believe as you do.  I hope that your loyalty is never betrayed.  Above all things, you seem to do your friends great honour with your devotion.  Be well.<br>

Look carefully at the date, this is long before this incident and long before the Pardus Vox incident.  If you mean to say you could fake the text to look like that, yes you could but you later said in the next line that you trust Fimble's opinion so you aren't insinuating that he faked it.  What are you stating, then you could type within such short intervals using two computers on two accounts?  <br>
<br>
  Next &quot;Just ashamed that we're being asked to believe the 'someone else must have been using my account but I have no idea who it could have been' defense&quot;.  True, that's vague, but there are several posts putting a probable &quot;who&quot; behind the incident.  The evidence, is as strong as it can possibly be to prove someone else used the account since we are dealing with online personas short of a confession.  I'll reiterate on this point once more.  We have known ninja looter Pardus who is also the same person as daarkside  having access to the Joselyn account by the admission of both Joselyn and Pardus/Daarkside.  We have credible evidence that Joselyn and Pardus/daarkside are separate people Irl.  This evidence, again restated, is that they have separate Ip addresses (all but one)*I'll get to that in a a min.<br>
They live in different states.  Text log evidence that shows a very difficult feat of the two toons (Pardus and Joselyn) having separate conversations at the same time.  The source of the Log is fimble, of whom you yourself don't question the credibility of.  We have numerous character witnesses who speak on Joselyn's behalf.  We have evidence of Pardus/daarkside's petty personality, on this board, and he is an admitted ninja looter so his character is already known.  This evidence of his pettiness is within the statement that (paraphrase) he ninja looted because he was screwed out of the Guild leader position of a guild.  I refute that but, let's say I'm full of @#%$ on that issue and he was.  That's no reason for his actions, and it's still very much a picture of a hateful and selfish individual.  <br>
<br>
  So explain to me how it's that far out there to say another individual did this act, and that said individual who we are almost certain is in fact Pardus/daarkside, it's in his character to do so and not in her's to do so.  I would say it's reaching further out there to argue that because of one shared Ip address that they are in fact the same person; I would find it more reasonable that since Par/side had access to the Joselyn account that he also had access to the Joselyn Ezboard account.  Let's face it, many people do recycle passwords for use in things.  I also find it pretty far reaching to speculate on conversations they may have had prior to the naggy incident about one convincing the other to do it and then later one trying to get the other to take the blame.  I find the latter much more reasonable and it too is a product of deductive logic, however it's based on pure speculation.  My point here is that the arguments made for the Account swapping are no less concrete than the primary arguments made against it.  Show me 10 cases of the last 50 times this argument was made by an accused ninja looter, heck show me 5 where so much credible evidence was given in defense of the accused.  Baring that, I think the conclusion here is obvious.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uflmutanteq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>flmutanteq</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/16/02 11:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=163>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: NINJA LOOTER  JOSEYLN TREEHUGGER on spet15th naggy raid</span><hr size=1> Cadin, Gnostik here...<br>

Oopsie, you're right ... I missed that those were 2001 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Your other question was &quot;So explain to me how it's that far out there to say another individual did this act?&quot;<br>
<br>
It's not at all. That still means you don't know who is the person behind the Joseyln character on any particular day, right? I mean, at the end of the day Joselyn (the toon) ninjaed a Naggy, got caught, confirmed by the GMs, item(s) removed from the character. Joseyln (the toon) = ninja.<br>
<br>
In fact, doesn't VI just ban accounts when two different people have access to the password? Not that I'm suggesting this should happen ... but Joseyln (the toon) is suspect now since J0S3Y1n the person doesn't have real control over it anymore.<br>
<br>

One, didn't Daark say he had a brother...? He could have easily done that if he had someone else with him. Another thing. As for the phone call, that is so easy to fake. On a phone you can make your voice sound like anything you want it to. I can sound like one of those phone ad people, or a squeaky little kid. As for the logs, I don't doubt your credibility Fimble, but the fact that he could easily have 2 comps and 2 accounts could easily discredit that. I haven't met Jos and only met Daark once, so I have no clue if they do function independently. <br>
<br>
Also, what about their IP's on this board? They would mean something if they are similar, but nothing if they are different. Mostly because if they have the same ones on this board then they are definitely at the same house, etc, but if they are different then he could easily just gone over to another person's house.<br>
