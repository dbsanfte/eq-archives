Where do you not see something very, very wrong with that?<br>
<br>
Its not unlike Turkey, another country were allied with. The US government has offered to let Turkish troops move into Northern Iraq to 'subdue' Kurdish resistance factions, cause theyve taken care of the ones in their own country. <br>
<br>
There are insurgents like Osama Bin Laden or Abu Nidal. There are back and forth fu<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->ck arounds like the Ivory Coast or CAF. Then theres teetotal stand up sit down evil coming from the governments of countries like Israel, Iraq, China, and Turkey, but were still shellin out your money to them every day. Think about it, before you have another eighth grade boy reaction like 'Stand in front of a bulldozer, get bulldozed.'<br>

<br>

<br>
thats odd. cause last night on meet the press Dick Cheney said there were plans in place to have a democratic government formed in iraq led by a coalition of Kurd's, Shitte, and Sunni Muslims. where did your info come from?<br>
<br>
if your carving wood on your leg and slip cutting a 6 inch gash in your thigh, whos fault is that? if you throw a ball into a highway and go chase after it, only to end up smeared up and down the underside of an eighteen wheeler, whos fault is that? if you step in the path of a moving BULLDOZER and end up part of the fertilizer, again WHOS FAULT IS THAT?<br>
<br>
its not that we dont care that a woman died, its that that woman put her self in a postion of great danger and we're supposed to feel sorry for her? <br>
<br>
ever driven a bulldozer? your certainly not supposed to operate in the path of one moving. <br>
<br>
that blade can make a huge barrier to your vision, they often have to drive by looking around the blade, ahead of the dozer. in fact further in the article one witness says the collision took place when the Dozer was lifting its Blade to move some earth. HELLO DRIVER BLIND PEDESTRIAN IMMEDIATELY IN PATH.<br>
 <br>
couple that with the safety gear ( not sure if Israel has an OSHA equivlent, but here in USA if you run one of those without proper ear protection your business can face severe fines and penalties) needed against the noise of thier engine. so you have an operator with an obstructed view, with restricted hearing, and a peace protestor laying down in front of the vehicle. <br>
<br>
dont you see the responsiblity she holds in her own death?<br>
the article you linked even talked of witnesses who saw her climbing on the mound of debris as the Dozer did its work. how could she reasonably expect a differant result?<br>
<br>
so tell me Rustem, how is Israel to deal with the wholesale slaughter of its men women and children in the streets? really, tell me, please. simply capitulate, give them a home of thier own so they can have thier own little peace of the world too? <br>
<br>
how long do you think Israel would last after that? if they simply roll over and drop out some land after some citizens die in the streets from another SUICIDE bomber, how long do you think thier country would stand in that region? so come on Rustem, give Israel a better alternative. im sure theyd appreciate it.<br>
<br>
they've got the hardest stance on Terrorists cause they've been fighting against them for the longest( or at least one of the most visible and on going) it seems like every week another bomb is going off, thats quickly followed by Israel shelling some buildings, maybe surrounding Arafat--AGAIN(yawn already) <br>
<br>
even the Terror attacks of the IRA, were usually targeted at government targets or installations. the Drug Lord Terrorists execute law enforcement agents and rival cartels. granted neither of those groups bats any eyebrow when civilans get caught in the middle, but in Israel its the Civilans themselves that are a target. <br>
<br>
see, for me in that whole affair there is no right answer. its all phuckered up over there.<br>
<br>
EDIT: those pictures are concurrent either. does'nt look like they are at least. notice how both shots are nearly dead on center mass of the Dozer? <br>
<br>
yet the lighting has shifted dramatically. on the top the light is form the left on the bottom its on the right. so either the suns changed dramatically or the bulldozer has SEVERLY changed its postion from the first picture. <br>
<br>
i was wondering why if someone had a shot that close to the dozer and then as it backed off her how come they hadnt shot any actually during the collison(that may sound callous but i bet $$$ to doughnuts most any photo Jorunalist worht his lens would be going CLICK CLICK CLICK, not that i agree with that mentality just that being in the field demands it)<br>

People always say people should be prepared to die for their convictions. I'd say she was prepared, and she died. No ones fault but her own, and I'm sure she understood that.

<br>
I see nothing wrong with that at all.  It's unfortunate, perhaps, and I see a general wrongness that goes with bulldozing settlements, but not with the running over of some meddling protester.<br>
<br>
Will the US not bomb Iraq because there's one peace protester somewhere on the ground saying &quot;no! no! stop!&quot; ?<br>
<br>
Being an activist is a contact sport.  So is being a government.  Governments just can't roll over and play dead everytime some activist decides they don't like what the government is doing.<br>
<br>
Consider also, that being run over with a bulldozer is not like being shot in the head.  It takes a CONSIDERABLE amount of strength of will to sit there and be run over.  Bulldozers are not lighting fast with cat-like agility.  That person deliberately parked their arse in the path of a dozer and stayed there.  They clearly got what they wanted.  The dozer driver probably couldn't believe what was happening, if he even knew at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drackorespyritfyst>DrackoreSpyritfyst</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1666<br> <font color=#628CBC>(3/18/03 8:04:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: American killed by Israeli military</span><hr size=1> She wanted to be a shield.

Yeah, I love the fact that white bread kids  have nothing better to do then stick thier asses in a thousand year conflict.  You think you're just gonna show up with 7 of your buddies, wishing there was a 7-11 close by, and bitching about not bringing enough batteries for your mp3 player? <br>
 <br>
Listen here, Don't flatter yourself by thinking they give a @#%$ if you show your support and air your voice.  Their war is more personal, hated, and entrenched than anything you can imagine.  It's something that can't be assumed (unless you're in seminary or are a native of that area).  I don't pretend to know @#%$ about a Palestinian/Israeli relationship, but one thing I understand is I don't understand it.  And rings bells to leave it the @#%$ alone.<br>
 <br>
Just like you mentioned Rob, the image of a white girl getting pancaked by a bulldozer is infuriating to some, but lets not assume it STARTS there.  It was in retaliation to a palestinian suicide bomb.  Which was in retaliation to some Israeli action, which was in retaliation to yadda yadda yadda.  It's an infinite loop.<br>
<br>
I never had any tie to the middle east conflict until My mom married Frank.<br>
 <br>
Frank has two daughters.  One of them is married to a Palestinian national named Khalid.  I've met him on a few occasions now when there are family gatherings in Phoenix.  They have a house in Virginia and a 9 year old daughter. He's arguably the nicest man I have ever met.  <br>
 <br>
One thing I've noticed is that he never brings this topic to the table.  He never initiates it.  Because he knows it's something most of us can't comprehend.  Because Americans can't....for lack of a better term, appreciate it.  But on a few instances he's talked about it.  His mom and sister still lives there.  He goes back to visit a few times a year.  And one things hes reinterated is that the idea that Governments (particularly the US) are willing to take Israel sides on this war is hideous.  He's told me about agressions and tactics Israelis use and the atrocities that ensue...<br>
 <br>
But in the end of our conversation he's resolved that his People are just as guilty.  Fact is this is something that is passionate, unyeilding, and unresolveable for each side.<br>

Im never bringing something like this up again on this board, its like arguing with fence sitting monkeys. Bring this up, and all I get are either 'Well, its their right to kill whoever they need!' or 'There are problems on both sides, Im not gonna offer up an opinion or possible solution'.<br>
<br>
Dont tell me that guy didnt know she was there. She had a loudspeaker and a bright orange jacket on. He didnt know if there were bombs in that house, he just had orders to bulldoze a few homes in retaliation for an attack last week.<br>
<br>
And Lokar, my input is this: No more American support for Israel, then see what happens, both to us and to the Israelis. My theory? They lose the nod from Washington to do as they please and our money, and we dont get attacked for supporting Israel anymore. Simple.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=finnigan@mtboards>Finnigan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#628CBC>(3/18/03 4:20:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: American killed by Israeli military</span><hr size=1> Rustem,<br>
<br>
While I think it is a tragedy that a young life was lost, I feel like the girl herself bears responsibility for what happened to her.<br>
<br>
The article offered no clear-cut evidence of whether it was an accident or deliberate.  One witness claimed that the dozer driver callously and intentionally drove over her knowing full well that she was there.<br>
<br>
However the article also says other witnesses claim she lost her footing and fell, and was out of the driver's line of vision.<br>
<br>
Whether he could hear her megaphone over the engine noise is not known.<br>
<br>
It is sad never-the-less, and I feel bad for her family and friends.<br>
<br>
I can see you are upset because most of the posters on this thread [myself included], do not share<br>
your point of view on this.  However, I certainly do not think that we are &quot;...fence sitting monkeys&quot;, just because we disagree with you.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to open yourself up to this kind of criticism, then perhaps you should follow your own advice and not initiate a thread on a topic that, obviously, is one you feel very passionate about.<br>

Bottom line.  Whether the government is in the right or wrong, if they have a target to take out...they are going to take it out.  Doesn't matter how many people wanna play martyr/human shield.  <br>
<br>
Same goes for the Iraqi conflict.  Wanna stand in front of a miliatary target to be a human shield?  I'd still drop that 5 ton bomb through it's roof.  The only added benefit is that it also goes up yer a.ss.  Yay me.  One military target down and one less stupid person breathing my air.<br>
<br>
No sympathy here, sorry.<br>
<br>
As for my position on Palestine/Isreal...I have none.  Frankly, if I were in charge of Isreal...I'd push em all out.  Why?  Easy.  It doesn't matter if they get their own state or not, it doesn't matter what rights you give them, money, food, jobs, land, etc.  They want Isreal GONE.  Plain gone!  Arafat could not control his own terrorist creations and the &quot;new government&quot; won't be able to either.  The fighting will never stop until one side is just gone.<br>
<br>
Far as the Arab states are concerned...if they cared, they'd take all the Palestinians in themselves.  Put up or shut up.  <br>
<br>
Holy land my a.ss.  With so much Christian/Muslim/Jewish blood spilled, it's not a holy land anymore.  It's the Devil's Playground. <p>http://pub78.ezboard.com/bworldnewseventsdiscussion<br>
