<br>
If you failed  to admit it and learn from it i think it does?<br>
<br>
<br>
 When most serious content requires a large commitment far larger and longer than  a mere rew months this seems a bit over the top<br>
<br>
Now i realise that the &quot;Friends of sharn&quot; may chime in but again if you cannot bring up logical arguements and intend to filll up the post with lame statement  that do not apply to the question i posed then  of course expect no response from me.<br>

well.. reading these threads... my only comment is that I don't think he's a coward.. more like he tried something and it didn't work so he gave up on it.. wasn't worth the trouble...<br>

<br>
I made no promises of greatness, at any time, I merely recruited people to kill things.<br>
<br>
Now more to the matter of me being a coward.  <br>
<br>
If by coward, you mean tired of hearing people b1tch, then yes.<br>
<br>
If by coward, you mean that I missed the high end game which I had worked my a$$ off in TW to get to, then yes.<br>
<br>
If by coward, you mean that is all you have to throw around at me, then you're pathetic.  You want to sling mud, and call people names, be my guest.  You want to make yourself look like a bigger moron than you already do, again, be my guest.<br>
<br>
Why don't you talk to anyone who was in WL, evedn those who somehow felt disenfranchised by me.  Not one of them will tell you that I at any time made some great promise of phat lewts, or uber kills.  Ask them what the raids consisted of, simple raids to get them gear and give them worth their time.  Why don't you ask them, if before, and after WL, they felt that they had more for the road, than if they had not joined.  Not one person who was in WL, save myself and Parin, left that guild without multiple items as upgrades to benefit them.  <br>
<br>
You are so very quick to preach to the choir, and hope that your words have meaning, all you're doing is making assumptions, and we all know what that does.  You are even quicker to shout at the top of your lungs that anyone who decries you isnt using logic, or facts... yet for some reason you seem to omit the fact that you enjoy making up your *so called facts* at will, just to further your hate for me.<br>
<br>
All of this spawned from one incident.  The bazaar, someone was lvl 51, they made an off color remark that made me laugh, I let something slip about *how youth has it's benefits* and you turn this into me wanting to call everyone noobs.  So I logged to me, and what did you do? *heyyyy sharnhorst, what's up!* and I immediately stated *I was the person who said the so called noob statement* I then went on to back what I said.  You however, fled to the message boards where you proceeded to dig up any old dirt you could find on me, since you yourself had none, and were at a loss.  <br>
<br>
For the record, most people 51 or pre, are indeed noobs in my mind, it's not arrogance, it's the simple fact that they haven't really experienced the high end of kunark velious luclin pop, it's just a fact, yet some people choose to assume one word means another, so it must be said in spite.<br>
<br>
Heisenburg, I'll say this here and now, in the hopes that you can understand this, once and for all, despite your apparent learning cap.<br>
<br>
You want to throw mud at me, be my guest.  But get your facts straight, you have yet to say word ONE with a shred of truth to it.  You my unstable friend, are not fit to be an officer of a guild, you are not fit to play an online game where you will interact with other people and spread your decay of moronic babble, and you most certainly are not worthy of the oxygen you breath in day in and day out, which I am possitive would be better used by some lab mouse slated to be tested for a penis wrinkle cream.<br>
<br>
You have lost, yet just like a mutt not taken to obedience school, you will continue to growl and bark hoping to scare up some friendly support.  Go away, you are nothing except for a sniveling fool bent on hearing his own words as truth.<br>
<br>

<br>
Boy jesus, calling him a coward is nothing short of the biggest waste of breath you have ever done.<br>
<br>
Sharn, along with a few select others Started War Legion (myself included) under the premise that we'd kill lots of @#%$ and have lots of fun and get to call vyrance gay.<br>
<br>
He never promised us anythign but a bit of fun, and thats what we got, a few peeps got aloot, and grats them....All in all sharn did the valor trials I beleive around 80 times, to get peeps flagged. He probably lost 50k in expenditures for the guild, I lost about 4k in coffin/peri's heh. I dont see how a bit of fun and some good times makes someone a coward.<br>

Higher end content takes work  ,common knowledge, This is somthing any 3toed sloth would realise out the box. so any realist should have stepped the hell back  ...or kept trudging on. He failed to do either.<br>
Cowardice is a lack of resolve and courage sadly ,in the end,<br>
he  lacked both and walked out leaving  the work and efforts of all who trusted him in the dust.<br>

Just how dense are you?  Nothing lasts forever, that's common knowledge.  Do you whine and fuss when your warranty on your portable CD player expires?  Do you cry like a baby when you check your fridge and find some food item that is past it's date?<br>

<br>
but rather than editing or adding a second post since a friend had showed up i chose to let it stand<br>
<br>
For some reason his complications with his newborn daughter needing a heart were more important than responding to you.<br>
<br>
Sharn as for your second post ?<br>
<br>
hmmm seems a bit personal and really fails to address anything except for yer temperament where i am concerned. along with a few facts that do not apply to this particular situation<br>
<br>
Lara  i will have to chalk part of that to coming to yer mates defense.<br>
The other part ? <br>
nope in sharn's eyes he didnt make a mistake the situation and other people were all to blame that is known as &quot;passing the buck&quot;.<br>
<br>
people &quot;bitched too much&quot; or &quot;it was too tough&quot;<br>
<br>
He never once said &quot;damned i  lacked the courage or resolve to follow thro with this  Sorry&quot;<br>
Instead he tossed pathetic excuses out there as a means of apology.<br>
<br>
actually after reading thro the rest of your post sharn i realised that most of it was a nice piece of fiction with your hate fueling it. i have seen that trick before... learn a new one<br>
<br>
the recount on the old /ooc spat was funny and curiously<br>
skewed in your favor?<br>
which is funny because if this was just a humourous joke without derogatory arrogance behind the &quot;newb&quot; definition and you were mistaken and &quot;took it back&quot; then why did you take the time to jump onto your main and continue it?<br>
as for taking it back i don't recall you once admitting yer stupidity.<br>
and if you recall your response to pricing a certain item &quot;it keeps the newbs outa of &lt;insert content here&gt;&quot;<br>
Yeeah suure you were not derogatory nor arrogant.<br>
<br>
Old habits die hard... i suppose and admitting your faults or not seeing the world thro sharn-colored glasses would be &quot;too tough&quot; for you.<br>
<br>
 Hmm seems you ARE a coward after all<br>
you see the truth is just one incident of cowardice could  be passed off a mistake ... and not a habit.<br>
<br>
However by failing to be bluntly honest and lacking the resolve and courage to see events as they occur even if they do not put you in the best light... is another form of cowardice<br>
<br>
and it seems  seems you're guilty of cowardice on multiple occasions.<br>
<br>
hmmmm <br>
<br>
Faate i don't give  a damned how much money you tossed into  your efforts ..grats (time and money are expected with such things and at times the rewards are minimal) that still doesn't address the fact he walked the @#%$ away  for limited reasons  and left the ones who trusted him and believed what he was preaching without sticking it out.<br>
<br>
 a few months my ass. You want to lead? be the solution not the damned problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fogel<br>

yeah it is old news <br>
yeah i was bored <br>
