some 58 paladin decides to judge me based on his weapon or gear or something. To be honest, dunno why he decided it was up to him to send me tells about how i shouldn't be there in PoV..<br>

i explained to him Yalwen has been on ice for 2 years, while i leveled up Booke, and have just gotten into playing some on Yalwen..to which he says..<br>

i am sorry a 48 necro was a bad addition to your group also..doesn't mean that i would be, at 52. i know my place in a group when in an area out of my league..sit back, shut up, do my part as best i can, don't anger the mobs, and avoid the taunt button, everyone lives, and we all get experience.<br>
<br>
basically to try to come in so low as Yalwen is, my best hope is a group of guildmates or friends..but holding out a flicker of hope in there some group goes, &quot;hey, it's not the best DPS in the world, but it's SOME DPS..&quot;..and instead of running a 5 man group in there, they shoot me a /tell and say &quot;hey, we can use ya&quot;..it's not impossible, but will be rare, and i accept that.<br>

the point of my rant is being told &quot;you don't know how to tank&quot;..i'm gonna have to beg to differ on that one..i know it's been a long time since i played Yalwen, but I didn't forget how to tank. in fact, Yalwen used to tank so well, warriors would sometimes get mad that i was outdamaging them..i know how to play my pally, and i do a DAMN good job of it, and can do without a little punk, only 6 levels higher than me telling me &quot;you don't know how to tank&quot; without ever having been in a group with me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shorrtstuff>Shorrtstuff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PeeWee Shorrty</span><br>  Posts: 1632<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/20/03 2:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh</span><hr size=1> Yalwen held DOWN that lower guk Frenzy camp.

<br>
Um, right.<br>
<br>
First off, unless you're all doing real time parsing, there's no way any warrior will know if you're outdamaging them<br>
<br>
Secondly, there's no way a paladin will EVER outdamage a warrior given similar gear and AA (and at 52 no AA exists that would help you) UNLESS you're fighting undead.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, tanking has NOTHING to do with damage. Knights can tank mobs doing 0dps through spells. Tanking is about holding aggro primarily and having the HPs/AC to survive the aggro.<br>
<br>
My guess is that the level 58 paladin was right, you have no clue about what it is to tank. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wilerian>Wilerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/20/03 3:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh</span><hr size=1> I think the point of the rant is that he did know how to tank...he wasn't in POV to TANK.

<br>
However I not too sure being in POV at 52 is wise move.  Not sure your added DPS would be as good as any other Class that was there at 55+.<br>
<br>
The person who assumed you were there to tank is the idiot.  He probably thought you were a noob.<br>
<br>
I joined a POV group once with my 52 warrior.  The rogue decided to tank cause she had virtue and said she could hold agro better.  So I let her tank, despite the fact that her hps with virtue were only 100hps better than mine and I had better AC...without cleric buffs...And I grabbed agro all the time.   She assumed I couldn't hold agro becasue she assumed wrong.   A few tells could have enlighted her.  But instead of asking me what my hps and AC and weapons were she assumed.<br>
<br>
Oh well..word to wise..don't assume.  Not every 1st level character is brand new to the game and not every tank is in POV to tank. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sourrrevenge>Sourr Revenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/20/03 4:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh</span><hr size=1> Considering that full group experience in PoD and PoN is great at level 60 by my lowly standards, it would be safe to assume that a level 52 would fair far better there then in PoV/PoS.<br>

<br>
we are talking the days before Velious, where high damage weapons were RARE..Axe of the Iron Backs sold for 250-300pp..Yalwen was swinging a 25/50 sword (Edge of Cabilis) from 15-35 and people were astonished how much i was hitting for in groups...then I moved up to the axe Shorrty sold me. 33/42. more damage, less delay. most warriors were equipped with Exe Axes. hell, Yalwen was trying to get in frenzy groups when awesome players of today, was still in the bedroom in lower guk at level 30 LFG, like Sharn and many others i see posting on here...those were the days. Yalwen's stats focused mainly on +str items, so I was a pally with a +str of about 175 and swinging a 33/42 axe. When warriors would join the group, i WOULD outdamage them. Not ALL..but some. Those are the ones I am saying would get pissed. Yes, stunning stole agro too..<br>
<br>
my LoH was never used for myself in battle when grouped, it was reserved (still is) for clerics only. if an add joined, i would offtank it or pull it aside and root it. Yalwen was damned good at CC, offtanking, and main-tanking when needed in the hellhole that used to be Lower Guk back in the days when FBSS was the most sought after haste item.<br>
<br>
Like I said, Yalwen has been on ice for 2 years, the game has changed. a LOT since then. I know this and respect this, but hey..i am hoping to grab hold of that fast exp nipple at 52 just like anyone else would..and like was said, yes..if i am in PoV and hoping for a group, it's not to stand toe to toe with a mob there and try to tank. it's to stand behind the mob and slash some added damage on him and help the group kill it faster. If the main tank goes down, and i have a Virtue on me, i am added insurance there to allow the casters time to gate out.<br>
<br>
*shrugs*..those who know how I used to play Yalwen know having him in the group is a good thing..those who have never grouped with him, i hope you get to see someday..<br>

I said a paladin will NEVER outdamage a warrior with similar gear/AA. You're saying you had VASTLY better weapons than the warriors you encountered. No kidding you'd outdamage them. That's really impressive! I can outdamage a 65 warrior with no haste dual wielding lammys, I must be uber!<br>
<br>
Um, no wait, I'm not. I'm comparing myself against someone who hasn't had the advantages I've had so neither of us is actually better or worse than the other, we're simply different.<br>
<br>
At 52 you have NO business being in PoV UNLESS you're tanking. Paladins are NOT a DPS class (unless you have SU3 and are doing undeads which you couldn't have been doing at 52 since SU3 requires 59).<br>

As such you DID want to be PLed.<br>
<br>
As such, any argument you've made is meaningless.<br>
<br>
Your posts since then haven't been about 'tanking' they've been about what a great paladin you are. Yippee! I'm sure you're the best. Please teach Tingling, Tiralle, and Brackoven your secrets (I'm too stupid to learn, I'l be forever condemned to not knowing how to play my class). <br>
<br>
When they laugh about your tips on tanking (save your LoH for the cleric and such) rest assured that you're right and they're wrong.<br>
<br>
I don't rant just to rant, I just happen to hate stupid people, and I hate stupid paladins more than I hate stupid people of any other class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yalwensomeyallosesome>YalwenSomeyallosesome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/20/03 6:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>what a great paladin you are<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

were..not are...were..<br>
<br>
those days of being great are long gone with the implementation of several expansions that changed the game drastically with new armor/weaponry.<br>
<br>
so i am not saying i AM a great paladin anymore. was one once..hope to be again..but the mental aspect of how to play my character and play him well is still there.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sourrrevenge>Sourr Revenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/20/03 7:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh</span><hr size=1> The only way to be a great paladin is to level a cleric to 65. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wheatlandmusicfest>Wheatland Musicfest</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 317<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/20/03 8:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Eh</span><hr size=1> ouch....<br>

I agree yal, people shouldn't assume anything.  I've passed the PoJ trials a few times with a 51 cleric.  I don't know how he does it, but..he does.  Nothing wrong with trying to have a little fun, and get some exp.  <br>
