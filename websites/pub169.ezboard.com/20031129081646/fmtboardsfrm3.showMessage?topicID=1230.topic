There is currently a guild named &quot;Mystic Horizon&quot; that is going around attempting to take members out of other guilds by starting rumors and making them look bad in order to convice the member that the guild he/she is in is bad and falling apart. The Crystal Order had a problem and now &quot;Trii&quot; from MH has blown it out of proportion. He was removed from our guild when we learned of an incident in where there was in-game harassment and stalking. He seems to think it was because our leader didn't like him, but that is not the case. Our leader wanted to give him a 2nd chance, but the officers voted against it 2 days later after we heard of Trii's past. Yesterday, my RL wife recieved an e-mail from Guild Magic asking if she wanted to join MH. I replied to him in game and he states that she was not guilded. Below is her listing copied exactly from the site. If you notice the date this character was last updated, it is obvious that he is lying. So my point here is simply this, put up a MOTD to your guild members if you value them at all. This person will stop at nothing to ruin a guild and right now he is targeting The Crystal Order.<br>

<br>
He'd also tried to get my alt in MH a while back, even though she was obviously guilded. I remember him from when he was in his 20's or so, when he was briefly in Faveo. His reputation preceeded him.<br>
<br>
Also ran across him yet again recently in PoK making a real ruckus for over an hour in /ooc , badmouthing a nice enchanter named Kanlu that I had grouped with on my alt earlier that day because she wised up and left that guild- wasn't making his guild look very good when their  leader acts like that.<br>

Apparantly it has been recreated.  I was in the guild with Kanlu.  I have witnessed Trii's stalking first hand, considering I was one of the people that was stalked.  He stalked me in game, sent threatening tells to ANY male character I happen to be talking to, etc.  I disbanded from guild and Trii promptly disbanded the entire guild.  <br>
One thing posted on here is wrong though. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Aye, Kanlu is a real sweatheart. /hugs<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Kanlu is no sweatheart.  As much of an ass Trii is, Kanlu stuck it to him big time.  Trii was nice enough to shell out 20K or so and bought her KEI.  Shortly afterwards, she disbanded from guild, saying she wanted to join her &quot;in game&quot; boyfriend's guild.  <br>
Even with that, Trii is no saint. So by no means do I defend Trii's actions, but I also cannot agree with the above comment on Kanlu.  Using a guild for a KEI scribe is about as bad as using a guild to get your epic and then disbanding.  <br>

In an attempt to impress everyone standing around, he had the conversation with her in /say. He said that the spell had just dropped on a raid he was on.

She was still in MH at this time. <br>

<br>
Feel bad for the members of MH that are getting sucked in to that guild, already took a few members from our guild, warn your guildmates and new recruits about anyone from MH that approaches them, i have already done so and will continue to do so<br>

Trii i hope you read these boards, if you have any self respect for yourself you will stop doing what youre doing even better disband MH and go on another server<br>

<br>
Needless to say It sounds like this Trii is not a guild I want to be part of... <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the Tip !<br>

He currently has an alt in Faveo.  He told be about the time he was booted from Faveo for constanly breaking mezzes while on a raid.  He says he and Nynnia (ex-GL, now officer of Faveo) now 'look back and laugh' on the incident.  I found that kind of difficult to believe, myself, knowing Nynnia.<br>
<br>
He also told me MH was disbanded by some sort of bug or something.  He logged on one day and *poof* no tag, no guild.  I've never heard of that happening before, but hey, I'm no expert.<br>
<br>
The other day he sends me a tell asking if I want to be an 'honorary' member of MH, whatever that means.  I guess he was testing to see if I'd leave Faveo for MH (No way), but I didn't answer.<br>

As for Kanlu, I have never met such a giving person. As for stalking, I dont have time for this as I have a guild to run but rumors shall ever be just that...Rumors..  Order of the white hand lost a cleric because of an incident in Chardok where it involved an epic drop...so pls get ur story straight before placing on this board....Inla then came to me and ask to join and has been happy that she made this choice.<br>
<br>
Crystal Order is another case...I was ask to come tank a raid for them before reforming MH and they invited me to the guild.<br>
Drewdar thought it would make things easier in the raid since sometimes they talk in guild....we were in CoM and had a good time.<br>
<br>
phew...next issue....I went to guild magic and well..found a new toy....picked out about 10 people ...all starting with As who showed unguilded in the recruiting part of GM....well people...dont use this....lol  for obvious reasons.  I mistakenly invited a member of CO and since have appologized and I do take responsibility for this...even tho GM did have a flaw.<br>
<br>
I guess I have made many mistakes in this game.  I know not everyone is forgiven but I am sorry for all the trouble and grief I have caused.<br>
<br>
As for Valuing your members and guild..well even without this post....I think all people should do this anyway..I know I do.<br>
<br>
As for Kanlu and the C3 spell, yes, I did pay for her spell but she paid me back very quickly and then left the guild...As a guild leader we hope they stay but we cant tie them up...we can only wish them the best and at the time...I was a lil fraustrated... I only wish I was perfect so I could make everyone happy...  actually I wish I had 10 percent perfection.<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again....I apologize for all my flaws and I hope some of you are understanding to what has happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
/hugs everyone...Trii..<br>

Trii, you're full of shi.t.  I've seen your stalking of Mizmez first hand.  I'm hoping some of the people you've ripped apart in tells for talking to her reads this.   A few members of Exiled Gatekeepers can testify to this as well.  If you're insistent that Mizmez and anyone else is lying about your stalking,  take Mizmez's in-game reputation into consideration.  All your smooth talking doesn't hide the truth about you, and truth is simply that you are a piece of shi.t.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=waardar>waardar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/28/03 3:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1230.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: **IF YOU VALUE YOUR MEMBERS AND GUILD, PLEASE READ THIS!</span><hr size=1> I personally wouldn't worry about MH taking your good players out of your guilds.

I don't see anyone above lvl 50 being too entyced by that. ;-)<br>

Well here's another rumor, that's true,<br>
<br>
I recently played my alt and was helping out a young player on how to play her class. I had seen that she had joined MH and I asked why.<br>
<br>
She said that Trii had blackmailed her into joining. Seems she made a comment about a friend and Trii had told her that he had /log the whole conversation and would reveal it if she didn't join the guild.<br>
<br>
What a piece of @#%$! This friend really wanted to join a good guild and was too much of a newbie to know what to do. She was afraid everyone would ostrisize her if she didn't join this guild.<br>
<br>
BTW Trii, @#%$ you! How you could do that to people is beyond me but I know what a piece of @#%$ you are. <br>
<br>
New players come into this game and you manipulate them and try to use them for whatever twisted reasons you have.<br>
