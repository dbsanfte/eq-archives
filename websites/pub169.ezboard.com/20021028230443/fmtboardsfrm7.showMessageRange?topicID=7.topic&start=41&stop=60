<br>
Essentially, every month, Mallo randoms (in the presence of witnesses) 1-X, X being the number of clerics on the list.  The lucky winner gets moved to the top of the list.<br>
<br>
The disadvantages: Those people near the top of the list will be slowed down, by a factor of 1/6.  Since approx 6 ragefires spawn per month, shuffling one person to the top of the list every month slows it down by 1/6.  However, the list still moves forward at a reasonable pace, AND newer members of the list have the chance (albeit small) to advance to the top via good fortune.  <br>

<br>
But since we're talking about alternative approaches, how about the &quot;per guild&quot; approach instead of &quot;per cleric&quot;? Why not consider baking in some kind of pro-active reward for not-ganking (like &quot;the guild that helps the #1 cleric get off the list gets their clerics each bumped up one location&quot;)? Why not just toy with what happens after 3 hour mark (producing a &quot;rotation but snooze you lose&quot; style of rotation) coupled with minor revisions on how long you keep the #1 slot?<br>
<br>
I toss these out not because I'm advocate of any one of them, but they are ideas I have seen bandied about in the past in Ragefire threads that, IMHO, probably never really got shook out to see if a viable approach might be in there. I think any of those might provide something more workable than &quot;every 4th Ragefire is free-for-all.&quot;<br>
<br>
But I agree with your observation in general -- the list is dang near to that next generation of age, where it will start being a barrier to some guilds ever getting a cleric in-house. I'm not sure how well any of those guilds would &quot;compete&quot; in a FFA solution (so not sure if that solution scratches this itch) but finding a way to address that point seems worth the energy. <p>Faithfully yours,<BR><BR>

The idea of keeping the rotation but playing around with it scares you.  At this moment, 50 said try the October FFA, 66 said dont.  <br>
<br>
Of the 50 that said try it, look how scared most are to come out and admit it and speak up. <br>

&quot;Please Doctor Evil, don't rant me. I just want to go to home. Alice is making this groovy pie and Greg is going to show me what it's like to be a woman later as we listen to groovy albums in the basement.&quot;<br>
<br>
Had they not screwed around with the album, we'd never have the CD.<br>
<br>
Oh ya, and what's to say that none of those top six clerics end up getting their epic in October?  Ya'll play like &quot;Well if we FFA in October then all those clerics get shoved back and have to wait a month longer&quot;.  What, yer not even gonna TRY????

You show up elated, thinking that now your wait is over, you did your time, you will have your epic, just as soon as RF spawns. Suddenly, it turns into a race! The mob you have so patiently waited for these many months is now FFA! If you are going to stand a chance, you must camp this zone, 24/7 along with god only knows how many more people. How would you feel? Now you have to race people to a kill that was agreed upon by the community as rightfully yours, your reward for patience and honorable play. Does this seem even remotely logical, at all the way we want to spend our days? Not to me, not at all.<br>

<br>
There are have been a lot of clerics like Medicx that which are not played as mains who still get RF because it is their right to do so.  <br>
<br>
If you only play one character and all your time is wrapped up with that yay you.  Don't expect everyone else to be so limited in enjoying the game to the fullest.<br>
<br>
This list doesn't make that distinction nor should it.  Noone has the right to say a person can't and shouldn't have as many epics as they want.  <br>
<br>
For someone people they only feel they won eq if they have completed as many quests as possible. It is called Ever &quot;quest&quot; right?!<br>
<br>
As for eq 2, I disagree eq is dying soon.  You constantly see ubers leave game as one expansion has been done since people tend to set goals and move on. <br>
<br>
With the infusion of Planes of Power there is yet another frontier to pillage.  A true FFA period is a slap in the face to every cleric promised the list would be maintained.  <br>
<br>
The main problem, imo, is the list has not been frozen.  I truly believe the list should be frozen immediately and RF become FFA after the last cleric on the list has been served. <br>
<br>
RF list is like a government program long needing to be stopped but once started hard to kill.<br>
<br>
Its just an opinion neither right or wrong so disagree or *nod it really doesn't matter to me.  <br>

The highest person in the zone after 3 hours gets the spawn, and moves off the list. It just happened yesterday in fact (the 8th person on the list got RF).  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukalyneblakrose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalyne BlakRose</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0> at: 8/5/02 3:34:28 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uathathehealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>athathehealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/5/02 4:12:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Free For All on Ragefire 1-31 October ONLY</span><hr size=1> I am not on the list, however I support the list.

I'd do my part to keep it FFA. Let me know if you need my services during this &quot;test&quot;.<br>
<br>
Clerics who have forces ready to engage when RF pops will be very happy for this, and those that don't... welp, fook u. Wake up, slackers. Be ready. Don't come here whining because your vanilla pudding hardened while you were jerking off in a corner. Eat it, and eat it nowwwwwww!<br>

What the fick do I care what everyone else wants? I can multibox myself all day long, got multiple porters and clerics that can rez, all right here under my roof. I could do a lotta shif that's along those lines, but I don't. I don't see the point to it. I guess I just like the feeling that for the most part we all came together a while back and worked something out. I sincerely believe we could and would accomplish more in a gank-free society. Ragefire wouldn't live more than about 10 minutes, and everyone on the server would know who the next cleric in line is. I hear people saying that we clerics expect our epic to be handed to us, but I don't agree with that. We accomplished everything set before us, and now await a single battle, some of us will have waited nearly 2 years for their shot. You say that it's a competitive game, and people ought to be prepared or suffer the consequences. I ask you, and all others here, how many times have you asked a cleric to sacrifice their own time and experience to come rez you? Once? Twice? Never? Well I assure you it happens a lot, and getting all competitive and unsportsman like is certainly not going to improve my community spirit. Your clerics in this community do one hell of a lot to give you and everyone else a competitive edge, and to help you recover from your mistakes. Is it so bad that we should be treated with kindness, even deference? Is turning this logical, orderly, respectful system into a whirlwind of chaos and animosity what you call entertainment? I just don't see the point in it. What is so wrong with a rotation that you would support all out gank wars? How can this possibly better the game, for you or anyone else? Tell me how charging some poor chump that waited 18 months or more for his epic a whopping 200k in platinum is what this game is all about. I'm just a no-name cleric in a little bitty guild that wants to test it's mettle against this dragon called Ragefire. I don't want to screw anyone over, or be screwed over in the process. Is that so unreasonable? So much so that destroying an agreement that was made only recently will be a better alternative?<br>
