** Experience Balancing ** <br>
<br>
The combination of the NPC experience changes and the post-50 &quot;penalty level&quot; rebalancing at once had a stronger effect than we anticipated. <br>
<br>
<br>
We've altered a few of the changes to more accurately reflect our intent. <br>
<br>
- The intent is to promote grouping, not to inflict a harsh nerf on our more casual players who frequently do not have the time to invest in finding and forming a group. <br>
<br>
- However, we do not believe that going solo should be the single most optimal way to gain experience in EverQuest, which is what it had become prior to these changes. <br>
<br>
<br>
That said, we'd like to take a moment and explain what happened. <br>
<br>
<br>
On &quot;Penalty Level&quot; Rebalancing (Levels 51, 54, and 59): <br>
<br>
- Many people saw much smaller experience gains at level 60. This was due to the &quot;penalty level&quot; rebalancing effect more than anything that was done to NPC experience values. <br>
<br>
- In the previous patch, Level 60 became a full level, when it had been half a half level the day before. <br>
<br>
- &quot;Penalty levels&quot; have once again been rebalanced such that level 60 is much closer to the half level that it was before, and experience was instead redistributed throughout the earlier levels. <br>
<br>
- The penalty effect is still mostly mitigated, however the distribution should be more fair to those who are already level 60, yet do not have a full bar in that level. <br>
<br>
<br>
On Grouping and Soloing: <br>
<br>
- From the point of view of a level 60 character, a steady stream of level 45 NPCs represented the single best advancement in EverQuest, when the score is kept in &quot;Experience Per Hour.&quot; <br>
<br>
- With the advent of Luclin Alternate Abilities, nearly every sufficiently advanced level 60 could eventually and easily solo these &quot;optimal&quot; NPCs, and benefit more than they could in any type of grouping. <br>
<br>
- We understand that forming a group, travelling to your destination, and other inconveniences have an effect on progression. <br>
<br>
- With that in mind, we've undone the penalties for killing low blue NPCs, and instead added an additional group bonus to those who fight NPCs that are reasonably close to the group's level. <br>
<br>
- The idea is that people should be willing to take risks, fighting the hardest NPCs that they possibly can, to reap the best rewards in EverQuest, as opposed to the blue NPCs that represent the lowest risk. <br>
<br>
- For both groups and soloists, we strongly recommend trying out harder overall zones and the more difficult areas of zones that you might already be used to. <br>
<br>
- We're confident that you're going to find that the additional risk pays off *extremely* well. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** Resistance Balancing ** <br>
<br>
Resistances have been altered in PvP to bring the game back into more of a balance. Please do remember, however; In both PvP and PvE, resist gear above 100 will still remain important. We thank you for your feedback. Please do continue let us know how the next round feels on a larger scale. <br>

patch. Some of these changes (such as the changes to resistances and spell<br>
stacking) will effect stuff that we have no idea how it worked in the first<br>
place. Keep this in mind when you log in and don't bother us. K? Thx! With<br>
system-wide changes like these it is entirely possible that there are still<br>
bugs, in fact...we can say for certain that we screwed up lots of stuff!<br>
Please just s.t.f.u and deal<br>
with it. Not like there is any other game you can play. Suckers.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
Petitions<br>
---------<br>
<br>
/viewpetition displays the petition you have in the queue, and we know you<br>
do because you guys whine a LOT.<br>
<br>
/deletepetition deletes the petition you have in the queue, if any (unless<br>
that petition is currently being viewed by CS staff). We like<br>
<br>
this new command. Next patch we will give you a command to delete other<br>
peoples petitions as well! We are looking into making a hotkey that<br>
<br>
will let you randomly blow away petitions on servers you don't even play on<br>
as well.<br>
<br>
--------<br>
Keyrings<br>
--------<br>
<br>
We will be resetting all keyrings with this patch. We HAD the key rings<br>
working how we wanted, but you whiners didn't like our idea of having<br>
<br>
to get a key every time you wanted to go after the phat lewtz. If you had a<br>
key that you lost, do a petition, then a /deletepetition and then go get<br>
another key. Losers.<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
Experience Changes<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60. This should mitigate the<br>
&quot;penalty effect&quot; that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59 and pretty much annoy<br>
anyone that had to go through these Hell Levels before we decided to fix it.<br>
Note that it will cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as it did<br>
before, but by using the new Verant Extra Special Experiance Formula, you<br>
will need to kill twice as many blue mobs to get the same experiance that<br>
you needed before. MUHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA! BOW, PEONS! KISS THE FILTHY FEET<br>
OF THE EXP GOD! Also, death experience loss will appear different in some<br>
levels. Now when you die, a GM will appear and laugh at you. We have<br>
assigned about 00 &quot;Laughing GMs&quot; per server to facilitate this. *NOTE* These<br>
GMs will NOT answer a petition or a question. Sending a &quot;Laughing GM&quot; a<br>
/tell will result in your banning, your friends banning, and having a Verant<br>
Ghestapo member comming to your house and smashing your computer.<br>
<br>
We have rebalanced the rewards for killing NPCs for characters over level<br>
50. NPCs that are considerably weaker than you will give you less<br>
experience. NPCs give more experience the higher level they are, and for the<br>
best results you should fight the most challenging monsters you can<br>
reasonably manage. If you believe this please call us. We have several<br>
bridges for sale we would like to discuss with you.<br>
<br>
------<br>
Spells<br>
------<br>
<br>
Gonzo the Chimp has been WAY busy on his Apple IIe working on spells.<br>
<br>
Too bad none us speak &quot;Chimp&quot; or we would tell you what has changed.<br>
<br>
Find out and tell us and you will get one free petition!<br>
<br>
Whispers in the taverns of Katta Castellum speak of recently discovered<br>
Ancient melodies. Ted Nugget will be making a special guest apperance in the<br>
EC Tunnel to discuss 'Why Bards are Always Broken'.<br>
<br>
Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' spells.<br>
<br>
This means that the annoying Lvl 5 Gnoll Shaman in Blackburrow will still<br>
cast on you even if your Level 60, still land his spell, but you should feel<br>
good about it since we know all about it and are laughing at you.<br>
<br>
Increased the number of spells that can be in effect on a given NPC to 30.<br>
Raised the NPC resists to 1 million kajillion.<br>
<br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
Spell Stacking Changes<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
Spells now stack like pancakes from IHOP, instead of like playing cards.<br>
This was an important change, as pancakes are more yummy.<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
Resistance Changes<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
We've made some fairly drastic changes to the way the spell resistance<br>
system works. Previously, there was only the smallest benefit to having<br>
resists over a certain value. We've reworked resistance in its entirety,<br>
completely replacing the old system with one that is more logical:<br>
<br>
There is now a Secret Button Combo that you must type BEFORE the NPC Spell<br>
lands on you! To receive your 20 diget Secret Resist Code, we will tell it<br>
to you for $50. You Secret Code is only good for 30 days, so be sure to<br>
renew your Secret Resist Code when it runs out!The idea behind the changes<br>
is pretty simple: Resists should matter if your rich.<br>
<br>
For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at the<br>
beginning of the spellcast, not the end. Spells that require but do not have<br>
of LoS will now fail immediately.<br>
<br>
Harmful spells require LoS. Unless your an NPC. If your an NPC, you can now<br>
cast harmful spells on people two zones away.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
Priest Changes<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
We gave clerics a lot of usless junk, but we are laughing to hard to write<br>
it down.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
Sound and Music<br>
---------------<br>
After 3 years of listening to you jerks whine, we have decided to use a new<br>
music and sound system. We were lucky enough to be able to liscense the<br>
Atari 2600 Sound Engine for like two bucks! As soon as we can find a way to<br>
bolt it onto our new Wolfenstine 3D Engine, we'll roll it out.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
Items<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Items now display level-restricted statistics besides armor class and damage<br>
as a red number with the unrestricted value in parentheses. Now you can see<br>
without a doubt that all those uber Stone Tipped Spears and stuff from CT<br>
REALLY ARE for Lvl 35+.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
User Interface<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
Deleting Spells from Spellbook: We thought it was pretty cool that you guys<br>
could lose items, so we thought it would be even FUNNIER if you could lose<br>
spells! We are eagerly awaiting to see how bad we botched this.<br>
<br>
Please note: This does not convert the spell back into a scroll. You will<br>
have to buy a new scroll if you wish to re-scribe the spell. No<br>
reimbursements will be made for deleted spells.<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash when zoning with the corpse window<br>
open. Now you just crash all the time.<br>
<br>
There will now be sound when banking coins. This was a top priority! We are<br>
sorry for the inconvienence this may have caused.<br>
<br>
----<br>
Misc<br>
----<br>
<br>
The Help window will now be displayed on startup. This will happen only if<br>
it has never been seen before (since this change). You will need to enter a<br>
valid Credit Card number when this pops up.<br>
