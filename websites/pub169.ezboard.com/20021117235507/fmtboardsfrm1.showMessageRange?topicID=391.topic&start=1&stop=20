<br>
At first i was horrified, not so much about me being affraid to die, just for the people that died for no reason at all, and their families. i cried for the fact that life, as i knew it, would never be the same. life is going to be even more difficult as time comes and goes.<br>
<br>
Then i realize, what we are as americans. not or race, not our creed, not or religious beliefs, not our sexual preference. i knew that on that day, we wer stronger together then we have ever been before.<br>
<br>
i also get a large swell of pity for the souls of the men that caused this. the horror bestowed on little boys and girls for no reason. for the people that might have had a life fullfilling love to come, that died in this madness. its a crazy world we live in.<br>
<br>
the following evening my dad told me he had gotten called out to help in the releif, he is a construction engineer.<br>
i asked him if i could come and help, he said he thought i was still on the payroll for his company, so i got clearence to come. the next mourning at 5am the sky was still full of a nasty smell. i could see it long before i was even remotely close to seeing the skyline, that was formerly blessed with the pressents of the towers. the air filled with suwte, and truck loads of rubble was being dumped at a parking lot for a ferry crossing on the other side of the river. things i saw wer beathtakeing. men vomiting at the site of human remains that wernt found before being carted. fingers laying in where laarge shards of glass wer. these things will all stand out in my mind.<br>
<br>
as the day went on my heart had even more adoration for the people that wer over there, digging through the madness. that was the longest 15hrs of my life.<br>
<br>
i dont know, its mostly babble, thanks Z, really hit home<br>

It was around 3:00PM or so. When I went in the gate at base housing they said we are locked down no one will be allowed to leave the housing site. This lasted until the next day.<br>
<br>
All I could think of was How? When I got home the TV was on and I finally got to see what had happened and the true extent of it. We left the TV on for the next week just hoping someone would be found alive. About the only imotion I can truely remember was Anger lots of ager. How could these people do this to civilians. I am in the military I understand that I have the risk of this type of thing happening to me, but I signed on that line and raised my hand(3 times so far) to put my self in that position. These people did nothing like this. Sure I felt anger over the pentigon but that was different to me. The WTC was civilians not Military members that Know we are there to help fight to keep our country free. <br>
<br>
I really can not put in to words how I truely feel Tears come to my eyes when I think of this day and I get choked up.<br>

Keep the faith my friends. For those of you from outside the US that came to the boards the day this happened and the weeks following to pledged your support I would like to thank you. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=183727">Sumamdar Spirithealer</a><BR>

<br>
The world is growing worse with each day. Makes me wonder if I really want to bring children into it.<br>
<br>
Killing military, well that's understandable, but innocent people just doing their job, is disgusting. Those people will never get to sit down and drink a beer with some friends, never get to take a nice jog as the sun is rising, never get to feel the touch of a loved one.<br>
<br>
I sometimes wish I was in the military right now, sometimes wish I would get drafted if it ever happened. Until 9/11, I felt the exact opposite.<br>

Call me sick, call my pyscho, call me whatever you would like, but I would like to kill Bin Laden with my bare hands. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucalalily.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calalily</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 171<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/10/02 8:20:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Remember...</span><hr size=1> Dropped my son off at 7:30 at school, and drove the five minutes to the grocery store.  Remember getting in the car wondering whatever happened to asking if you wanted Paper or Plastic.  Such petty thoughts, moreso given what happened.  Turned the radio on, was waiting for the light to turn green, and the morning DJ came on saying that a plane had hit the WTC.  Shock for a minute, and looking at others driving, you could see when everyone first heard it. DJ's speculating that it was just a small twin engine (at that point I don't think anyone knew...was right after it happened?), and I remember thinking no....it was a big plane, and I prayed that people would be ok.  Sort of surreal.  Got home, and turned on tv, where they were still in the dark a bit.  Tried to wake up Garad....who wouldn't really wake up.  Then my mother-in-law called, and while we were on the phone, the second plane hit.  Part of me wanted to get my son from school...I was terrified for him...but another part of me knew that they were ignorant in school for now.  And I doubted I'd be watching anything else on the tv.  <br>
<br>
Here's a posting I posted on my guild message board about how I'm treating tomorrow:<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is September 11, 2002. Exactly one year will have passed since we were attacked on our own soil (for those in the USA) by terrorists, who were acting on their beliefs.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is a day that we are all being asked to remember. To remember the horrific acts that happened, and to remember why we are a free country.<br>
<br>
Me, I'm going to remember, and give thanks, to those that died in the battle against terrorism this past year. I'm going to remember the little boys and girls who lost their mommy and daddy. The men and women who lost their husband, wife, significant other. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters. Families and friends, lost to terrorism forever. <br>
<br>
But, if we allow tomorrow to be a day of mourning, in my mind, the terrorists will have won a small battle, and we, as a nation, just can not allow that.<br>
<br>
I won't judge how you choose to spend your 9/11....as I would hope no one would judge mine. My son and I will read a book about hope. And I will answer any and all questions he may have. I will remind him why we are proud to be Americans, and how we have a spirit that no one can diminish. And I will be thankful that my husband and I were not directly affected by the tragedy a year ago by losing a family member or a friend. For a brief moment, it was thought that a family member on my side was lost in the towers....and thankfully he was found, alive. I couldn't imagine the pain the families feel who lost loved ones, nor do I want to, selfishly.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I hope everyone has a wonderful tomorrow....be happy, and remember that a year ago, our nation was made stronger, not weaker.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
May God (or whoever you worship) Bless you tomorrow, and all of your tomorrows.<br>
<br>

It makes me sick seeing all the &quot;commercialization&quot; of 9/11... its become a @#%$ catchword for god's sake. Yeah, it was terrible... all the more reason NOT to sit around and brood over it like characters on some two-bit soap opera.<br>

I will not be watching TV, reading the newspaper, internet media, or anything else... I think I'll curl up with a nice book or maybe a bottle of something and enjoy the day (hopefully) terrorist free.<br>

<br>
I was at work when this all happened.  I happen to work in the Financial Industry.  At the time my firm worked closely with a Firm in Jersey City.  Their office looks right out over the bay into the city.  I was on the phone with an associate when it all happened.  They knew something had happened but was unsure.  Both our firms did business with many different firms located in the Towers.<br>
<br>
At that time sketchy reports were coming in that a plane had hit the WTC.  Our small office of 6 were glued to our boss's TV.  We sat there watching in a state of shock.  We watched as the 2nd plane hit.  I agree, it was surreal.  We were all waiting for Bruce Willis to step out of a building and save the day thinking aloud that this was some kind of movie.  As there is no way this could be happening.<br>
<br>
After all was said and done and in the days following we had found we lost many associates.  Some we knew personally and some professionally.  Many we knew worked for Cantor Fitzgerald.  Their entire organization was located in the WTC and was lost.  This day is forever etched in my memory.  It will be one of those &quot;do you remember where you were&quot; days.<br>
<br>
9/11 will be a very emotional day for me.  I will watch the shows and will read the papers.  Its something I don't want to block out or forget.  I am mature and educated enough to see thorough the rhetoric and political billowing and see the real meanings in the broadcasts.  I will also be spending my day volunteering my time to help out in my community.  <br>
<br>
God Bless America.<br>

When done I will be spending the rest of the night with my family, celebrating my dad's B'day and going about normal life (prolly minus the EQ for the night).  As much as I hate the news and media for taking things and turning them into spectacals, I will be watching the specials.  I do not want to forget what happen.  Is there going to be another attack? I don't know, but I am not going to run in the house and lock myself in.  I am not going to let them succeed in what they want us to feel, terror!  This day made us realize how important friends and family are and how in a brief blink of an eye people you love can be gone.  So cherish your friends and family and don't let the petty things get in the way. <p>Only one who's powers are great and pure can gain knowledge on the ancient art of the Ranger Gate!<BR>

Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, a little peace, and hot naked chicks massaging me with oil at my command. I also want FIMBLE to stay away from my shoes because he gets them sticky.  If I don't get what I want, I get angry, and throw barrels and flaming oil at whatever's stopping me. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>

As I was driving to work that morning, thinking about the surgery that was going on with my wife, and anticipating the call from the hospital to come down and pick her up, I heard the news that the WTC had just been hit by a plane.<br>
<br>
I hurried on to work, arriving around 7:50 and turned on the computer to go to CNN.com, which of course was flooded. As details came in about the plane(s) which by now counted the three downed, and one more missing, I wondered if my cousin was aboard one of the AA flights, or if any of my old friends and colleges were. I used to work for AA, so this truly hit home, and my cousin is a flight attendent for AA. (He is based out of JFK or was the last time I asked.)<br>
<br>
As bad as this was, both in the lives that were lost and the destruction to property, the aftermath was, to me, even more devistating. Terriorism was something that happened to the other countries, and only to the US in our wonderfull Die-Hard style movies. Yes, I knew, it was allways a possibility. No, I never anticipated it on the scale that occured. I have, over the past year, asked myself what I would have done if I were on one of those 4 planes. I hope to think that I would have done all in my limited fat-boy power to thwart the hijackers. I feel that if I know that my life no longer matters, because it is inevitable that I would die if I did nothing, then I would at least make the attempt to stop or divert it. Not saying that I could, or that those we don't know about on the other three planes (not flight 99) didn't. I like to hope and pray that those passengers and crew didn't go to the slaughter without some kind of fight.<br>
<br>
Tragedy always leads to feats of heroism. The amount of American Pride that has swelled up over the past year is something I hope never dies. I spent many years singing in college and for my dear grandmother. One of my favoriate, and her number one song, was Lee Greenwoods tribute to America:<br>
<br>
God Bless the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
I leave you with these words from that song:<br>
<br>
If tomorrow all the things were gone I’d worked for all my life,<br>
And I had to start again with just my children and my wife.<br>
I’d thank my lucky stars to be living here today,<br>
‘Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can’t take that away.<br>
<br>
And I’m proud to be an American where as least I know I’m free.<br>
And I won’t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.<br>
And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.<br>
‘Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land God bless the U.S.A.<br>
<br>
From the lakes of Minnesota, to the hills of Tennessee,<br>
across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea,<br>
<br>
From Detroit down to Houston and New York to LA,<br>
Well, there’s pride in every American heart,<br>
and it’s time to stand and say:<br>
<br>
I’m proud to be an American where at least I know I’m free.<br>
And I won’t forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.<br>
And I’d gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.<br>
‘Cause there ain’t no doubt I love this land God bless the U.S.A.<br>
