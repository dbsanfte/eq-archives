Seems like you don't have a big recollection of anything. My dear, I was in Fury's Edge... not long, but I had the opportunity to see if I'd like it. After a couple of weeks I deguilded, because I didn't. You and I were grouped in a Velks lab HF-RA group during that time. I also remember that being our first run-in because you were bad mouthing Stronmaus in group at the time. I defended him and you came all over me for it. A little later we repeated that little argument on the FE guild board. To put it in your words... dude, you've got to relax!<br>

All I said was that you remind me of John Wayne as a Green Beret! Not once did I infringe on your right of free speech! You on the other hand seem to think it's ok to try to intimidate people by barking at them. You always have, you always will (see above, our good old time together in FE).<br>

Good show Ayerish, jolly good old chap! Seriously, I've got nothing against you, you can have all the &quot;muscle&quot;-opinions you'd like to have, but don't deny me my opinion. Don't try to make me another notch in your flame-post. Possibly a good advice for EQ, as much as RL: No matter how loud you yell, it doesn't make you right.<br>

Or is that just another flag you're raising just in case anyone missed the 4323523 instances of your tired sig already all over these boards? <br>
<br>
Thanks for the refresher, I do remember the conversation about Stronmaus now.  I think it went something like this:<br>
<br>
Ayerish: &quot;Oh my God, what a selfish prick.  What kind of guy joins a guild and then claims every piece of loot he can KNOWING that he's going to ebay in a week?  What a c0cksucker.&quot;<br>
<br>
Valk:  &quot;Hey!  Stron is my FRIEND!  He would NEVER do that, he must have VERY GOOD REASONS for being a selfish loot whore. You shut up now!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ayerish:  &quot;You live in a fantasy world.  He used every single person in this guild to jack up his ebay value, and if you think otherwise you're fooling yourself.&quot; <br>
<br>
Valkyris:  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!  &lt;logs out&gt;<br>
<br>
That was about it, wasn't it?  Now I suppose you'll say I'm the only &quot;crazy&quot; one in FE who felt that way about Stron walking away with 1200 bucks at our expense.  It's fairly funny, because once again it was me pointing out someone's greed, selfishness, and refusal to face accountability for their actions and you saying &quot;no way, it's not like that at all.  He's a GOOD GUY!&quot;  <br>
<br>
As far as this line:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You came all over me for it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I really don't think you need to worry about THAT particular event ever coming to pass, except in your Dorito-filled dreams <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .   <br>
<br>
Regarding everything else you said, you're pretty much right.  I did accuse you of being a toddler; you're acting like one by turning a perfectly dignified discussion into your own personal anti-Ayerish crusade.  This thread was pretty docile until you piped up and waved your moderator flag all over the place, and I find your &quot;surprise&quot; and defensiveness over ME flaming YOU pretty contrite.  Don't start flame wars unless you're willing to finish them, and don't make posts like your John Wayne barb and then pretend that it wasn't intended to incite my ire; although that's perfectly in character with your whole no-accountability philosophy.   <br>
<br>
And no, I'm not on the same &quot;astral&quot; plane as you.  I live on the material plane--you know, the real world?  You should drop by and visit sometime, so you can run horrified and screaming back to fantasyland and stick your head back in the sand.  Run along now...I think your Spinsters Anonymous group is calling you.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ayerishstormcaller>Ayerish Stormcaller</A> at: 11/27/02 8:44:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=valkyrisvalhalla>Valkyris Valhalla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator<BR>Fim's Shoe Wench</span><br>  Posts: 306<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/27/02 9:23:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=84>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://valkyris.netfirms.com/omani.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> <br>

Something like this, but not quite. I'd be up to the challenge to defend Stron once again, if you care to resurrect our argument. But then again... in the spirit of Christmas and peace on earth and all that... nah. Better not.<br>

the idea that people should go to chruch every week is still alive today. whens the last time youve seen an aethiest politician? you dont, cause they wont get elected, generally speaking. im sure you could find one to prove me wrong with, go for it.<br>

<br>
There was only one coast back then, and the country as a whole was a very small area, also, witch killings were not just in Salem, they happened elsewhere along the country, just not as many. As for Aethiest politicians, when no one is looking, they all act without a fear of god, those snakes would worship Baphomet's severed head if they knew it could get them a big enough group of voters to win.<br>
<br>
Also, I wasnt talking about the idea that people should go to church, Im talking about you had to go to church or they arrested you.<br>

Would you have been just as upset in 1954 when we wasted taxpayer dollars to ADD the words &quot;one nation under god&quot; to the pledge?<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't know why we cant just leave the damn pledge alone, and say it how it was originally written.<br>
<br>
Mark todays date in your day planner, I predict in the next 2 years, we will be adding some lame phrase to the pledge like &quot;...with liberty, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>equality,</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and justice for all.&quot;<br>

PARIS (Reuters) - Swiss voice experts believe an audio recording broadcast this month and thought to be the voice of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden could be a fake, following comparisons with two hours of authentic footage.<br>
<br>
&quot;The voice could be that of bin Laden but it could also not be. It could be an impostor but it is necessary to be prudent,&quot; researcher Samy Bengio said.<br>
<br>
The findings, by respected Swiss research institute IDIAP, query U.S. intelligence reports that the bin Laden tape almost certainly represents the voice of the man the United States says is behind the September 11 attacks.<br>
<br>
IDIAP (the Dalle Molle Institute of Perceptual Artificial Intelligence) was commissioned by France 2 television to compare the tape, first aired by the independent television al-Jazeera, with around 20 authentic recordings of bin Laden.<br>
<br>
IDIAP Professor Herve Boulard concluded that all the voices except that on the tape in question belonged to the same person, noting the statistical software he used has a margin of error of around five percent, France 2 television reported.<br>
<br>
The results should be treated with caution, IDIAP's Bengio told Swiss RSR radio.<br>
<br>
&quot;In order to have an irrefutable conclusion, you would need around 100 recordings of bin Laden. They only had 20, and of poor quality,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
IDIAP, a semi-private body based in Martigny in Switzerland, was not immediately available for comment.<br>
<br>
The audiotape praised attacks that took place as recently as October 28, and has been considered the hardest evidence since December 2001 that bin Laden has survived the U.S. bombing campaign in Afghanistan.<br>
<br>
U.S. intelligence experts believe the tape was made within the last few weeks. That it was apparently recorded over the telephone meant it was of poor quality.<br>
<br>
The tape has also been played to al Qaeda members in U.S. custody, who said it sounded like bin Laden. <br>
<br>

<br>
now i ask you, do you really think that institue had such superior tape analysis that they could find stuff to raise doubts that the CIA missed? i doubt it. perhaps, but i imagine the CIA used only the best sound analysis equipment in the world. however its in thier(bush and his band of merry gun toting cowboys) to make sure the world believes Osama is alive and still coming after the US.<br>
