<br>
EDIT, for those who dont know - In Misty Thicket stands an orphanage built in memory of a Random Acts member, Neao, there in the Great Hall all lost members are remembered, their weapon hung on the wall in honor of their lives.  Read more about it on our guildsite <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://http://www.eqrandomacts.com/" target="top">RA Home</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, click on Stories.

<br>
I would live in a castle-like, nature-like palace. Not really one or the other. It is an enchanted place, not much one way or the other, but constantly shifting.<br>
<br>
The castle itself is made of cool stone, marble and metal works. It lies on a forest, one populated with all sorts of animals, real and unreal.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Think Wakening Lands minus the giants, mercenaries and holgresh, but keeping all of the other bestiary, along with Plane of Growth, and Plane of Air. There is a rainbow of trees, all different seasons, green everywhere, rocks and water. If you go in any direction far enough, you would find another type of terrain. The ocean would only be as far as the edge of the forest, as would the snowy mountains and swaying plains. The weather would change constantly on my will or mood. I would walk openly naked mostly when I was outdoors, my own private garden of eden.<br>
<br>
My bedroom is huge, with a open patio that lies close to a waterfall. I can look out onto the lake it empties into. My bedroom is my most favorite place! It has that wonderful view, plus an absolutely huge fluffy bed- the kind you can get lost in. There is a fireplace and lots of candles everywhere. There is a wizard tower where I go to read, and it constantly rains up there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I have an indoor natural hotspring pool that allows me to swim out to a mermaid garden full of light and shifting colors, and sometimes I travel to otherworldly realms.<br>
<br>

<br>
Fortress Vognalure, the last bastion of the Deathwish Mercenary House.<br>
<br>
Buried deep within the mountain sides near High Hold Pass there has long been rumored to be a 2nd keep.  Many stories tell of a hidden corridor of stone, a winding pathway carved in granite, that leads not to High Hold Keep, but down a darker road.  Very rare are these stories, and even rarer are the repeated, for it is said, to speak of the last great mercenary stronghold, is to ask for death itself.  To understand this, you must first understand, that after the fall of the Combine Empire, it was a trying time.  Many kingdoms, just coming into their own right, sought out to bolster their forces with mercenaries, and then make war upon their neighbors.  During this time, most of the great mercenary lords perished, along with their host of soldiers and great houses.  The few that survived this time, flourished and became large armies with fortresses that rivaled many of the new city-states that now seeded the world of Norrath.  It was due to this success, this survival, that in the end, the great mercenary houses would fall.  So afraid of these armies for hire, afraid that their enemies would purchase their skill, or that they might develop a taste for conquest on their own, these city-states made ready for war.  And over the years leading up to the discovery of the lost continent of Kunark, the last of the houses were left only in the tattered pages of history books littering the walls of the great cities. <br>
<br>
Back to the story at hand, well at least this particular tale.  This tale is the recanting of a dying spy, in the hospitals of Freeport, said to have been injured while making his escape from Vognalure.  The large winding  canyon along the soul passage down from High Hold Pass to the Karana’s is believed to be a solid wall.  But as this fellow, skilled in his trade, found out.  The mighty stone wall at the base of the cliff is merely and illusion, for the valley continues another half a mile until it reaches true stone.  Not more than 50 feet from the illusionary wall, there stands Death’s maw, the 1st of a series of large keep walls.  The large steel door’s are said to be some 40 feet high and double that in width.  On each side there stands an array of some 3 tall spires looming overhead, standing twice again as high as the tops of the gate.  All along these gates there roams constant patrols of soldiers all bearing the emblem of the Great House Deathwish.  Atop each of the great towers stands great machines of war, wrought of the finest irons and magiks built with one soul purpose, the total and absolute destruction of any who would attempt to vanquish the last mercenary house.  After passing through this ominous gate, one only has to travel another 100 feet before reaching yet another wall.  This gate, known as The Stone maw is a gateway crafted from the solid mountain itself.  The gate although created from solid slabs of granite, and some 40 foot in height itself, seemingly opens with the ease of opening a normal wooden door, when it is so desired.  But in dire times, it has been said, nothing but the greatest wizards and armies could pass through this door through might.  Atop this second mighty wall, stand even more soldiers, reinforcing the first large garrison.  All clad in a black heavy plate armor and armed with seemingly ancient weapons of great artistry and lethal precision.  Atop the gate itself stand a row of heavy crossbowmen, ever at the ready to stop anything, should the signal be given, their poise perfect, their skill, unquestionable.  Through this gate, and further down the canyon, a final 500 foot stretch opens up before the final gate.  Within this area can be seen rank upon rank of the elite swordsman of the mercenary house, standing their watch, for the day that war will come and the House shall march out for the last time.<br>
<br>
The last wall stands higher than both the previous, and is thicker even still.  It has no name, it’s vastness and strength are so great that a name would do no justice for the magnitude of such craft.  Along this wall, standing almost 3 times the height of the 1st two walls, flow the banners of the House, a great black tapestry with a great red Death’s Head emblem grinning out to the sky, eye’s ablaze with a silver flame.   Atop this final palisade even more professional soldiers stand guard, looking out over the 1st two gates, ever watchful.  Once past this final great defense, the canyon goes on for some distance, guessed at around one to two thousand feet.  It is here, in this area that there can be seen a multitude of thatch roofed houses.  Within these houses there can be found rack upon rack of glittering weapon or armor, surely the great armories of the mercenary house.  In yet other houses their are a great number of beds, barracks to be sure, and in yet other’s are great stores of foodstuffs and other supplies kept in great amounts.  The last, and largest of all these structures before the mountain face, is some 300 feet in width and length, and all about it is surround by great bails of hay.  Within this massive structure, there reside a great number of steed, massive beasts of burden, the warhorses meant to carry the greatest of the soldiers into war.<br>
<br>
Finally there stands the gateway into the mountain itself, to the deep inner sanctuary.  A door, merely 5 feet wide, simple in design and appearance, yet crafted to remain stalwart until the mark of House Deathwish crosses it's shadow. Within the sanctuary there leads a long corridor, somewhat musty from years of close kept secrets, hallways lead to the left and right, yet onward into the mountain the shimmering black marble floored  hallway leads. Lit only my a dim pair of torches can be seen the archway of the  final room, a door of black solid Iron, looking to almost be rusted with age, yet none the less, strong as the day it was forged. On either side of this strong door stands a large pair of suits of armor, some 8 feet in height, black in shade, but not bright in color, no a bleak dark hue. With sword of red stone drawn at the ready, chipped and cracked from some battle long ago, these soldiers stand eternal watch, for with their visors up, there shows no face, merely a ghostly face of smoke. Within this last room, the war room, there is a great table, some 20 foot wide, with maps sprawling, and plans all about. Scrolls with details, lists of army makeup, size, and location litter the walls, not messy, but not clean. Around this table there sits 15 great chairs, each in it's own a throne.   The chairs sit.. almost with a uselessness, never sitting or being used. the Master of his house is up, and toiling over plans and things to come, ever with his aides-de-camp and Lieutenants in tow. On the back wall hangs the ancient emblem of house Deathwish, oldest mercenary house of the known world, tattered from many battles seen in many lands, it flows with an eerie motion, yet there stirs no wind to move it. Yet it flows.  Out the great glowing eye‘s stare, ever waiting for the next mission, the next assignment, when the Master of House Deathwish, will take the banner out for it's last mission.  Ever waiting, the lidless eyes gaze out, looking... searching... for the one day, when it shall fall to the blood soaked ground, as the battle rages above... with no victory to be had.  For that, is the true destiny of the House Deathwish, there cannot be a final victory, not for those who follow the great Rallos Zek, there is only war, and yet more war.<br>

Quiss was born to Gypsies in North Karana. To this day he still feels a special attachment to the rolling plains of the Karanas. Being a Gypsy and nomadic, Quiss calls home where ever he lays his head. <br>
<br>
Lately, he has been seen performing for Dain Frostreaver IV in Icewell Keep and to the people of Thurgadin. Many a night has Quiss had to defned his honor and drink those Dwarves under the tables. Able to hold his liquor and still put up a good fight, he has made a name for himself among the Dwarven people and is well known and liked. <br>
<br>
If I had to really pick one zone to live in, I would kick out Tunare and build me a Treefort high up in the trees of POG. POG is a very beautiful zone and should never be missed by anyone rather as a tourist or as a pawn of destruction. <p><center><img src="http://www.malignwarlock.com/bounce/fairy_bounce14.gif"><BR>

Her comings and goings wither the plants, but they spring back up again, twisted and rotten, because of the energy she and her home gives off. Hyenas, imported at great cost from The Ro, were ritualistically slaughtered, sprinkled with ghoul dust, and then dumped into the river by night. After some time at the bottom, being waterlogged and partially eaten, they arose, and patrol the small domain, screaming and gibbering in their underserved sentence. Any trespassers are torn to shreds, and depending on how hungry the reanimated hyenas are, later brought back for service on the grounds, or for Sosoca's perverted entertainment.<br>
<br>
Even the most bold young paladins and clerics stay far away from the northeast beach of Toxx, and the knights of Prexus go through her territory quickly on their rounds. Birds are silent. Frogs dont croak. The cicadas and crickets hum and chirp loudly, making a weird wall of sound that never stops, even in the misty day. <br>
<br>
Her stilt cabin is slowly sinking in the muck, and animal part fetishes, weaves, and murdered passerby decorate the outside walls. Inside, a large, room shows the bed and bookshelves. A large firepot in the middle serves as the focal point of the house, with a pot hanging over and the remains of meals scattered on plates around it. Many mats and carpets soften the floor, and peeling paintings from visited lands and cultures hang on the walls, along with favorite masks and fetishs. The books are mouldering from the humid air and long absenses, and the whole deal smells of fresh dirt and dead, wet leaves. <br>
<br>
A wholly depressing and unpleasent place, Sosoca's stilt house is the last stop of many of lifes passengers, and the begining of deaths for a few.<br>
