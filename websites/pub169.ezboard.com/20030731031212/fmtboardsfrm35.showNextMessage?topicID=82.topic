<br>
Hello.<br>
<br>
As of Friday night 1/10/03 I have been having some very serious problems with my main character Aramelus, who is a level 65 warrior on Morell Thule.  My station account name is &quot;(?????)&quot;<br>
<br>
Vital stats (I have never, ever, ever had a problem with this configuration):<br>
<br>
Computer -<br>
<br>
Dell Pentium 4 2.0 gigahertz machine<br>
512 meg of RAM<br>
Radeon 9700 Graphics card<br>
SBLive! Sound card<br>
WinXP<br>
<br>
Network -<br>
<br>
Cable modem<br>
Linksys 4 port router cable/dsl firewall<br>
Computer1(as above)<br>
Computer2 (not really a factor)<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
On Friday evening I logged in normally and played for awhile.  Our guild announced that we would be heading to Plane of Storms to clear some of the giants, etc.<br>
<br>
So I ran from Ssra temple to Plane of Storms.  I have been to Plane of Storms (successfully and on this very same computer) many, many, many times.  When I clicked the rock to zone into Plane of Storms from Plane of Tranquility, the usual zoning activity happened... the screen goes still, you hear the music, etc.  However, instead of popping into Plane of Storms after a few seconds, I found myself popped out to Server Select.<br>
<br>
I thought to myself, &quot;Ok, maybe the zone is down, or maybe I had a glitch.&quot;  I closed Everquest and came back, got to character select, picked Aramelus and began to zone in.  During the character loading phase, I once again was popped back out to Server Select screen.  I then left Everquest, shut down my computer, restarted it, and tried the whole process over again.  Once again, I was at Server Select.<br>
<br>
I then logged in as one of my alternate characters just fine, and told my guild I was having problems.  People suggested that they had seen that sort of thing before, and that I should delete the zone files for both Plane of Storms and Plane of Tranquility, and download fresh copies.<br>
<br>
I did this, and after downloading the new copies, started the game, tried to go into PoS, and again -- server select crash. <br>
<br>
I then entered the in-game chat room from the server select page and explained what was going on to the GM who was working the chat room.  She was nice enough to arrange a walkout from Plane of Storms for me.  I was then able to successsfully log in (to Nexus) so I made my way back to Plane of Storms to join my guild.  When i reached Plane of Tranquility and clicked the zonein to PoS, again I crashed to server select.<br>
<br>
I have two computers.  I normally have one playing Everquest and the other one I use for everything else, however it also has Everquest on it in case the faster computer is needed for work/etc.  At this point, I started to get technical support involved.  I contacted the online tech chat and after waiting they suggested that I uninstall Planes of Power entirely, then reinstall it, and try again.  I did this, and when I got to the same point, it crashed me back out to server select.<br>
<br>
At this point I realize that if it is a client-side problem with files, configurations, UI, etc, anything on the client computer... I should be able to log in successfully from my second computer, which is a totally separate environment.  These two computers do not share any hardware (and in fact are nothing alike other than that they are both Dells) other than being on the same LAN here.  I have a four port Linksys router attached to my cable modem -- the computers are attached to that -- I have been using this configuration for over a year successfully with no problems.<br>
<br>
So, I go ahead and launch Everquest on my second computer.  Totally different box.  I log in, get to character select, pick my guy, and wham... drop to server select, exactly the same as I had experienced on the first computer.<br>
<br>
I am a fairly technical person... I write web software for a living, a software engineer.  I normally have zero problems with running my computers at home.  At this point I have basically made up my mind that whatever the problem is, it has to be something server side.<br>
<br>
I log into the game on an alt and petition my situation.  After like 3 hours, I get a reply from a guide named Shannelle.  She is very nice, and we try a lot of different things, all client side stuff, but I am willing to try anything:<br>
   <br>
   o  Disable texture caching, delete all .txc files from the Everquest directory<br>
   o  Log on alternate character after texture change and zone, then try to camp in with Aramelus<br>
   o  Remove character.ini and character.opt files<br>
   o  Remove UIFiles directory<br>
   o  Remove eqclient.ini file<br>
   o  Turn all graphical settings off, set to lowest 800x600 resolution.<br>
   o  Make sure WindowedMode=FALSE<br>
   o  Run Scandisk<br>
   o  Clear Windows/temp directory<br>
   <br>
Unfortunately, none of these things work.  I continue to crash to server select when I try to enter the game.  She escalates the petition to GM Status, so I am stuck waiting for Jannaka the server GM on Saturday.  She is supposed to be online from 4pm-8pm PST.<br>
<br>
(edit:  turns out the GM just told me to mail tech support which I'd already done -- I did get another walkout though and have been able to go elsewhere)<br>
<br>
Later, I talk to my friend, who also plays Everquest on Morell Thule.  I explain my problem to him, and he asks if I'd like him to try to log my guy in from his house.  I tell him that would be alright, and change my password to something for him and have him log in to my account.  He logs in, and is able to successfully get Aramelus into Plane of Storms -- ala everything is normal.  He zones out, camps, and tells me to log in.  I log in fine.  I try to go back into Plane of Storms, and again I crash to server select.  He logs in again, gets me out again, we try a few other things -- none of them work, each time I keep crashing to server select.  By this time it is getting close to 3-4 in the morning so we give up for the night.  At night's end I am in Plane of Tranquility, the plan is to try again on Saturday.<br>
<br>
The fact that my friend was able to log in and I was not sort of throws a wrench into my theory that it has to be something server side, but again I have tried to log in using both of my computers here and have gotten the same result.  The only thing these two computers share is a network and router.  (More on that later)<br>
<br>
Saturday at about 11am PST I log in.  I try to enter Plane of Storms -- again I crash.  I log on my alt that petitioned.  My petition is gone.  I can no longer see it using /viewpetition and no GMs are anywhere to be seen.  I re-petition and ask if it's up there somewhere, and a guide replies that no, they can no longer see it either.  So my petition is gone.  He says he'll resubmit it and escalate, but there's a line of people 17 deep waiting for GMs at the moment.<br>
<br>
I fiddle around with my router and decide that maybe the router is doing something weird -- blocking ports, etc.  Who knows.  I decide to take my router out of the equation by hooking my cable modem directly to the computer, so it's just a normal cable connection.  For whatever reason, I can't get TCP/IP to work doing this.  I call my cable tech support line -- they are having some kind of issue with adding MAC addresses to their routers -- go figure, I'm not the only one having a bad day.<br>
<br>
That's where we stand right now.  As of right now the only idea I even have left is to hook up to the cable modem and get the router out of the equation -- it could be blocking ports or whatever, but like I said I can't alter it right now because of forementioned problem with the Cable Co.<br>
<br>
Please help if you can!<br>

However, on examination, I would have suggested a connection problem too - maybe your ISP was fiddling around with their own firewall (if they have one?) and blocking access to a world server which handles PoS zoning or something weird.<br>
<br>
It's a shame you couldn't get TCP/IP working with a direct connection. It's bizarre - I can't make mine work either unless I plug the Cisco router into the cable modem, very weird. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117874" target="top"> Magelo Bwah</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
