<br>
Yeah my typing sucks..and my grammer sucks when I don't go back and edit my posts.  But I have published articles in magazines..so FU!<br>
<br>
Commenting about someone grammer is not only off topic but I dont' give a sh*t what you think about my grammer.<br>
<br>
Here is why my grammer sucks.<br>
<br>
1.  Because i don't give a sh*t<br>
2.  Poor grammer does not mean Poor int.  (they just like to think they are smart cause they spent 20 mins keeping their post so nice and tidy with their fancy words and stupid &quot;oh I'm smarter than you..yeah you...if you touch your rub your chin once like your some int professor I want to punch you!&quot;<br>
3.  I don't want to spend a lot of my daily time trying to please yous stuck up noobs.<br>
4.  Um if you can't figure out what I mean by my poor grammer then maybe your the stupid one.  Use your brain figure it out.<br>
5.  I type veryfast and don't take the time to go over my work.  But when I do my grammer is fine.<br>
6.  That's what editors are for (afterall they are failed writers who edit my work so they can sate their need to feel important in life).<br>
7.  Because someone gave me sh*t about my grammer once and I vowed just to keep pissing them off I would never edit my work! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nwinkimt>NwinkiMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/11/03 10:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1039.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Grammer snobs</span><hr size=1> gramm<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>a</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->r <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pasquatch>Pasquatch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 394<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/11/03 11:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1039.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Grammer snobs</span><hr size=1> I think most peeps tool on grammar when they really don't have much other argument... Exceptions are EXTREMELY shoddily written posts, in which the reader must &quot;dumb-down&quot; to even interperate. Not only are these very poorly thought posts usually difficult to understand, they tend to be somewhat emotional, and often factually incorrect.<br>
<br>
The occasional misspelling, or grammar correction can be a learning experience, if one so chooses to take it constructively. It can also be &quot;fuel to the fire&quot; if received poorly, or sent in a rude way. I do love when someone gets all condescending, and corrects someone, incorrectly... ala Dan Quayle a while back, in the famous &quot;Potato(e)&quot; incident, it makes them look so cool!<br>

Some of us wince every time we see an error only because it's as common to us as breathing to do things correctly the first time. I'm definitely a &quot;grammar and spelling nazi&quot; - I tutored in English and was a proofreader for 5 years. When I learned how to speak English as a child I was learning it alongside another language, so in essence I was learning it from the ground up- I just happen to love language and the written word. I rarely point out errors in others because frankly it rarely makes a difference to them. But yes, I judge people very strongly on their ability to express themselves in writing. <br>
<br>
When I'm online I don't so much care about spelling being off, or typos, or capitalisation. But in any arena where you have nothing but your words to fight with (rants board for instance), it's best to have those weapons as polished as possible <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   More often than not the people who point out these errors don't do it because they are policing the post. It just jumps out at them as if it were typed in boldface and blinking like a neon sign. A typo is usually very distinguishable from a true lack of spelling knowledge. If you read a great deal you can immediately tell who made a typo and who really hasn't a clue of how to spell words that I can remember from my 5th grade spelling book. <br>

Seriously, I think that 95% of the &quot;typos&quot; or &quot;grammatical erros&quot; we see here are caused by haste to get the post out, beat the next guy to the punchy rant, or just not really caring because honestly - we'll all get the point.<br>
<br>
The other 5% are stupid, moronic, idiotic, uneducated pre-teen losers who live on AIM and think it's l33t to misspell words. Or, they are French. Either way, same thing.<br>

<br>
I'm not lazy about my grammer....I'm not in a rush.<br>
<br>
I just don't give a rats azzz about it in this forum.<br>
<br>
Because this is a forum about stuff that doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
It's a world that is not real...it's a game folks.  If you treat it as anything else then you need help.<br>
<br>
I rather spend my time reading the philosphies of a modern day philsopher like Eric Weil.  Or writing love poems.  Giving some dear freinds of mind a call.  Organizing my Move to NY.  Trying to get my willy into that MILF next door.  Getting webcams into the bedrooms of my female guildies (ack maybe some are really men).<br>
<br>
<br>
I have better things to do with my time then hit backspace key..or read over the post before hitting the &quot;Add Reply&quot; button.<br>
<br>
So it's okay to make fun of someone for their bad grammer<br>
But it's not okay for the bully in school to call you a geek because you are smart.  Or the cool kids to make fun of you.  Interesting how as you get older you feel it's necessary to turn the tables on the stupid.<br>
<br>
People should be treated as equals....Oh you don't like stupid people..well some people don't like gay, blacks, asians.<br>
<br>
Oh I see that's wrong to dislike someone because of there skin color but..oh someone who is ignorant or doesn't have the education should to go fook off.  HMM...maybe you should take a good look inside yourself and come face to face with the biased person you are.<br>
<br>
Or maybe you don't dislike the stupid/ignorant but you will never hang out with then.  Sounds just all the white guys who say they are not racist but never have any people of color at their parties, get togethers...hmm.<br>
<br>
Take a good look inside and be honest with yourself and then you will grow as a person.  Recognize and learn from the faults within yourself and you will grow as a person, And all around you will benefit from this new better being which you will soon become. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sasarella>Sasarella</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 671<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/11/03 10:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1039.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Grammer snobs</span><hr size=1> Wow I actually agree with Drack/Sour whoever you are these days.<br>

This said, there is a major difference between proper written English for composition and accepted and acceptable errors and shorthand within the new frame of the Internet.  If these boards were intended for publication, or with the intent of being anything other than a purely entertainment venue, then I could see using composition level grammar.  However, I do not see using it in casual personal corespondence nor do I see the point in enforcing it in the casual atmosphere of a message board.  Nitpicking anyone's grammar is frankly an attempt to make a personal assault out of an impersonal forum, namely the Internet.  I am quite certain that those of you who are editors can find several errors in this post, both with sentence structure, and spelling/typographical errors, please do not bother to post them, I am already quite aware of them and frankly don't care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=meperidine>Meperidine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/12/03 12:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1039.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Grammer snobs</span><hr size=1> For someone who has a bachelors degree in english you dont seem to understand punctuation very well.
