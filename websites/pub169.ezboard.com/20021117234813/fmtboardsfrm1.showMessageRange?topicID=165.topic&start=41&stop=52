what i loved is how you showed your utter maturity and sensitivity to others. AV should be proud to have you. I mean, hey yer so dedicated to EQ and your guilds, and take it so seriously that other peoples feelings or RL issues take a back seat to making sure &quot;the bull&quot; wins, right? <br>
<br>
Then what would you know about what relationships are like. Your idea of the perfect woman runs along the beach on Baywatch, and her face is unseen due to the layers of yer manglue, right?<br>
<br>
Anyways, since you want to bring it up. Let's discuss it..was i hurt? yep, torn to shreds. Was my life changed?  Why indeed it was. But guess what? Over it. Does it hurt, eh..a little. But here is a secret for you Sparky. If she's happy, I'm happy. And don't think single life has me sitting in my basement, feeling like I got the upper hand in a bulletin board flame war, wondering what the feel of a woman is like. No, I am not you bro. Trust me, single life..It's rocking and rolling (*pokes Dryoc* ya hear what i'm saying G??? LOL).<br>
<br>
Anyways, Draxus. Yay for you. Your words stung a bit for the day, but eh..hell with it. You only made yourself look stupid and desperate for material to flame with. Have fun being a rejected time and time again, loser. Isn't Baywatch on right now? Better get the Jergen's.<br>

<br>
I was a ronin. For a year and some months. i joined when i was level 20. I was running from a sand giant I was trying to kite. I know cece irl. Personally I dont think cece did alot of loot whoring. Cece gave out alot of loot as well as elping people....even some cece didnt like(just to help). I think cece is a bit controling but cece is a good leader. I wanted to stay in ronins but circumstances didnt work out. Ronins was and for the remainder of people left in it is a good guild. I will always help them when they need it. As for you booke I am not going to flame or anything but imho you were a little on the loot monger side. I dont mean it bad dont know how to say it good but you were...you were kind of annoying and i know annoying hehe. Draxus just relax bro...let him blab or whatever dont take it so personal. =) <br>
<br>
You both are of the suke just deal. hahaha jkn<br>
<br>
Anyhow I miss ronins and my point is that cece / ronins isnt what alot of people thought it/cece was. <br>
<br>
ps. Im really tired and its late so if this doesent make sense im sorry.<br>

I would ask for help with my epic. That's what your supposed to do, ask your guild for help. If they can't help you one day, ask the next. If it annoyed you, /ignore Booke.<br>
<br>
I would almost say your words stung, but to be honest Lylflynn..i dunno who the hell you are. I think i remember you being at a couple of raids..<br>
<br>
As for loots though, i NEVER bid on items someone else could use before me. The only ones i did were ToV legs. blew all my points accrued. Mana robe..same thing. I yielded on so much armor/gear that your claims are laughable. Like a double gnome ring drop off of Inny. I yielded to cancel my vote against one of our MA, who could use the AC far more than i could. Most of my gear i have is bought myself, from soloing/selling.<br>
<br>
I think if any members of the above mentioned guilds remember me, they would easily be able to say that your post was nothing more than an incoherant rambling slandering. If you wanna talk lootwhoring, ask Cecilia how she liked the ToV robe she outbid ALL the necro's on. You know, the summon corpse thing that could benefit the entire guild, as opposed to the level 49 DS it puts SOLELY on the mage when the mage gets it?..next time you two hang out irl i mean.<br>
