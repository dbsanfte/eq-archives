<br>
I am not in your argument. I am discussing an issue that has everything to do with your post though. You are asking me to respond to your statements, but it's these very statements that you have screwed up and have made them sound very retarded. So your point to us is proven to you by rereading your posts. Why should I say anything in retort to your argument when all you need to do is look at your posts and make yourself look like a moron.<br>
<br>

<br>
That is wrong. I am only making a point of your grammar because you made it a point to sound smart. You're the only person on these boards I have ever attacked for incorrect grammar or misspelling because you are trying to make yourself sound like an elitest grammarian.<br>
<br>

So to not debate with you is bad style or is it just pissing you off? Please clarify.<br>

To respond about ducking issues, your issues are personal issues, as I feel no need to respond to them. If you will note though, my hacking away at your posts should be enough response. Since you're so smart though, you have that figured out, right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ciypher>Ciypher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/31/03 2:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=476.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gramar nazi's</span><hr size=1> I'll be waiting for either of you to respond, preferably with an intelligent thought out arguement, until then I will cease posting.

If they choose to speak and write poorly, no grammar sheriff is going to come lock them up.  They will simply be presenting themselves as ignorant and slow, and it's their choice to subsequently get indignant when someone points out their ignorance.  <br>
<br>
You're right, by the way...someone speaking or writing incorrectly doesn't change the MEANING of their message in most cases.  But there's a huge gap between having artistic, creative license with the English language (a la Faulkner in 'The Sound and the Fury') and being an undereducated fool who thinks the world needs to rewrite its rules because he's too lazy to learn them.  That's similar to saying that 10 times 10 is now 20 just because you can't multiply, and then claiming that anyone who claims that it's 100 is just an elitist jerk.  <br>
<br>
Sure, there are variable interpretations and approaches to writing styles.  NONE of these variables involves misusing &quot;your/you're&quot; or &quot;their/there/they're&quot; or &quot;affect/effect&quot; or &quot;its/it's&quot; or &quot;should have&quot; (NOT &quot;should of,&quot; a phrase which is so popular around here).  There are many, many more examples that I won't bother to mention. There are certain grammatical rules that are absolute, and all of the clamoring about &quot;alternate&quot; means of communication in the world doesn't change those absolutes, any more than that nutjob's website that Neuro posted yesterday proves that the Earth is a square.  At some point this entire discussion boils down to us saying &quot;the sky is blue&quot; and you saying &quot;NO IT ISN'T!&quot; and then slamming your hands over your ears and screaming &quot;LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=erradicatedthoughts>Erradicated Thoughts</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 952<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/31/03 2:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=476.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gramar nazi's</span><hr size=1> These are facts. LoL. See what you need to do is respond to my facts that you are disgustingly unintelligent and forthright with misinformation. Until then, I will honor your discussion with this passage.<br>
<br>
Perception is reality. It is the responsibility of the writer to properly explain himself and to properly execute his story or discussion. It is not the responsibility of the reader to interpret the writer through misinformation, improper use of grammar and/or vocabulary. <br>
<br>
To some, one who cannot spell or improperly uses grammar will come as off as a big idiot. To others, whether they be as educated as the writer or simply do not care, the writer may be making a valid point. But then there is something to be said about order and neatness.<br>
<br>
If one has a bunch of words in one paragraph, and the pasragraph is a page long, that scares away alot of readers. It lacks taste and shows that the writer honestly has no clue how to seperate thought and leads into his topic seperately, he just throws it together and shows the reader exactly what is going on in his mind. <br>
<br>
If someone misses a space at the end of a sentence, oh well. That's typing and you just don't catch every mistake.<br>
<br>
If one misspells words, they may actually convey different meanings to alot of different readers. Some people may think it's one word, some may think it's another, and some may lose interest trying to figure it out.<br>
<br>
Properly explaining yourself goes a long way to explain how much you value the work you have placed in front of others for their reading entertainment.<br>
<br>
If you suck on the wording and grammar scale, alot of readers will think you or the passage sucks, and they have every right to think that way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xxjacyxx>xxJacyxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i>*hairtoss*</i></span><br>  Posts: 158<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/31/03 3:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=476.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gramar nazi's</span><hr size=1> This is not Dead Poet's Society for cryin' out loud!

If you can't spell,write fluently or type horribly (that would be me, I can't type for @#%$) than other people may make fast judgements about what a moron you are but c'mon now this is an EQ rants section, does anyone honestly care if your writing/spelling skills are a little amiss?

<br>
The reason the term &quot;Grammar Nazi&quot; fits you ASSHATS so well is because you are shokingly similar to the real Nazis.  You use a superficial standard to place labels and then you use those labels to place a generalization on a group of people and declare that group to be inferior.  When you say that a person IS ignorant BECAUSE they don't use proper grammar, you are making a direct correlation, and being an ASSHAT.  If I were to say that whenever you compare two people, and one has bigger feet than the other, then that person will also be taller than the other, would that statement be true?  In a large number of cases, yes. In the majority? Perhaps.  But to make a direct correlation and then state it as a fact is asinine and thus awards you the title of ASSHAT.  <br>
<br>
Grammar Nazi is to Bob Square<br>
<br>
 as ASSHAT is to Sponge Pants<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Assgrammar Nazihat&quot;  <br>
<br>
-the forementioned party &quot;Grammar Nazis&quot; a.k.a &quot;ASSHATS&quot;  will be heretofore refered to as &quot;Assgrammar Nazihats&quot;  For the purpose of brevity, the term &quot;fvcktard&quot; or the phrase &quot;waste of spooge&quot; will also be considered as valid reference to the party in question. <br>
