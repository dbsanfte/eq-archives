&gt;Do u realise what you said?<br>
&gt;you are 1 step away from taking your gun and going in the town central to kill &gt;everyone.... just because they are not employed...<br>
<br>
false. I have been unemployed for a year. i took my &quot;unemployment&quot; for the first 3 months while looking for a like job (i have a masters degree, and several I.T. Ceritification), because, after all, i had payed that in over the last several years of earning ... well, a pretty damn good income. for the following 9 months, i havent sought any kind of government help. (and trust me, that 80 billion to the war effort hurt... but..) i drive by fast food places every day with help wanted signs. if i decide i WANT to work for that rate, i can. the difference? i have a pretty significant savings im living on. if that were depleted, ANY job would suffice. <br>
<br>
our system gives the poor and uneducated a choice.<br>
1) work for minimum wage, <br>
or <br>
2) have another child, and get PAID not to work.<br>
<br>
I simply dont believe that bringing another child into this world should be a substitute for an income. I support encouraging them to work. i definately dont support killing them off.  now, every time i bring up this arguement, some assh0le says &quot;what about rape victems?&quot;. well, get everyone who CAN work, but chooses to mooch of the government working first, and there will be plenty of money left over to take care of the TRUELY unemployable.  <br>
<br>
this is hardly advocating killing hte poor.<br>

Either way, the military system was wrong for the type of war, just like the french military tradition was when Germany rolled in.

Where's the hardcore evidence that Iraq was harbouring these terrorists as their own then? It was one of many excuses to declar war. That if anything about this war scares me.<br>
<br>
Not to be picky, but I would call some of the CIA's acts of terrorism. CIA is a part of the US, which is harboured by them. I would also say that the US goverment uses CIA to better the lives of the americans. Take a look in the mirror. <br>

<br>
false. sort of.<br>
<br>
teh military system was perfect for that type of war.  the POLITICAL system was not. vietnam was INCREDIBLY unpopular here in the US, and happened in a time when pacificism, hippys, and a huge counter culture youth movement was making serious policical waves domestically. <br>
<br>
we were cobbled by a lack of political collateral that would allow us to bear the full force of the american military into vietnam. also, with the cold war at its height, and china and the soviet union RIGHT THERE, we didnt want to leave ourselves open to a full out world war 3. <br>
<br>
we were not Beaten by a small country, we were beaten domestically by a political environment that basically got hundreds of thousands of americans killed in the name of &quot;peace&quot;.  its sad really, that a people with NO CLUE of the big picture can exert such force over the leadership of the country to get thier fellow citizens slaughtered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanzoidinkratta>Tanzoi din Kratta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/8/03 12:05:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=548.topic&index=148>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> And France surrendered because their leaders didn't want their people to die to the last shed of blood.

If the US military system was perfect back then, the war would have been won within a few months, if that. From what I have understood there was enough US troops to conquer and quell any resistance, but bluntly, they didn't have the tactics or dedication - faulty military system. Instead some of the troops shot their own officers and some of them even deserted. That's not political, that's how uneducated/unprepared (for this type of war) military behaves. <br>
<br>
Don't take away the Vietnames's credit. They did beat the US. They wore them out, no country where someone's actually allowed to voice their oppinion will want to see a pointless war fought while their brothers, husbands, fathers, neighbours gets killed on soil they had nothing to do on, for a war that's not needed - killed by a people desperatly defending every inch of their country with teeth and fingernails if needed, never yielding.

lol, or tactics were fine. our leadership knew thier @#%$. but, wiht the vietnamese army crossing borders we were not allowed to cross to attack us, hiding behind civilians, and all the while our domestic affairs keeping pressure on the powers that be, made it impossible for the military to fight a war.  when Bush gave gen Swartzkoff(sp) the power to remove iraq from kuwait, said to &quot;do whatever it takes&quot;. lesson learned from vietnam.<br>

wrong statement tanzoi: half of the france was occupied by german (due to the fooking faith that had some generals that the german &quot;can't possibly do a military action&quot;). A man, petain, was at the head of the unoccuped part of france, and make a deal with hitler to give him what he want to save is poor little head. So, the resistance was still active everywhere in france and a little administration was surrendered, with petain at his head.  Hopefully, after the war, he was conviced as a traitor and condamned. This guy is a shame for all the french people, all the resistants (without them, the Dday wasn't possible) that gived their lives to free us. The surrender joke can only be made by the uneducated guys. /bow <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanzoidinkratta>Tanzoi din Kratta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/8/03 12:31:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=548.topic&index=151>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> If the leadership knew exactly what to do, why was the  leadership education so intentsly redone after the war because there was found severe flaws in it? <br>

US KIA were slightly over 40,000, while ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) KIA exceeded 220,000.  Wounded-in-action figures are just as one-sided:  US 224,000 WIA, ARVN 1.2 million WIA.  These statistics look much worse when compared to the total populations of the participating nations.  The numbers are available in numerous places--the quickest reference is probably <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/yellow/ylbkmenu.htm">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>

I'm not saying that the conflict wasn't a blemish on our history, because I believe that it is, but the misconception that America lost more soldiers than the North Vietnamese is simply incorrect, and I'm not sure how else you'd define &quot;efficiency&quot; with regard to armed combat.  <br>

Efficeny in a war is about to accomplish your goal(s) as painlessly as possible, while causing as little damage to the current population as possible and instead make it surrender by removing it's lust to continue fighting. At least, that's my idea of efficeny in war, and that was what you asked for.<br>
Perhaps the most efficent war is the one that's over before it even started.<br>

I fully agree with this statement.  If Saddam had accepted the self-imposed exile he was presented with, none of this would have happened.  If he had fulfilled his obligations under the numerous UN resolutions levied against him, none of this would have happened.  If the UN had brought stronger multilateral economic and social pressure to bear prior to the invasion, and if certain key nations had not surreptitiously violated the Iraq sanctions in an attempt to secure short-term profits, none of this would have happened.  <br>

It's from the Canadian National Post (non-US source, for those keeping track):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PARIS - One evening in February 1778, Benjamin Franklin, the newly appointed envoy of the United States to France, was hosting a banquet at his Parisian residence. The guests were 18 Europeans and 18 Americans. Just before dessert, Franklin asked the guests to leave the table and stand against a wall. He wanted to measure them to see who was taller.<br>
<br>
The shortest of the Americans proved to be taller than the tallest of the Europeans. Franklin had organized the exercise for the benefit of his guest of honour, the Abbe Reynal, who had just published a hefty tome arguing that, when transferred to America, all living creatures, including men, became diminutive. Thomas Jefferson, who succeeded Franklin at the Paris embassy, narrates the episode as an illustration of &quot;the irrational in the European approach&quot; to things American.<br>
<br>
More than two centuries later, that irrational approach is still present. Only this time, its proponents, reversing Reynal's theory, are concerned about the &quot;bigness&quot; of things American. This is combined with the fear that, in Baudelaire's words, &quot;The American night shall fall over the earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
To underline America's &quot; frightening bigness,&quot; Hubert Vedrine, France's former foreign minister, has coined the term hyperpuissance. The peasant firebrand Jose Bove laments the fact that the United States is &quot;too bulky.&quot; France's three former prime ministers, Michel Rocard, Laurent Fabius and Pierre Mauroy, recently published a front-page article in Le Monde to urge the EU to stand up to &quot;the American giant.&quot;<br>
<br>
For some, anti-Americanism plays a useful role in filling the vacuum left by the evaporation of 19th century ideologies. Those too lazy to do their homework on any issue could still espouse an opinion simply by looking at what the United States says and then saying the opposite. How many of the people bashing the United States over Kyoto and the International Criminal Court have studied either? The arrangement is simple: Where America is, there I shall not be.<br>
<br>
Through much of the Cold War, the Soviet Union enjoyed some sympathy and support among French elites simply because it was not America. Many French intellectuals loved Stalin because he was not FDR. They supported Kim Il-sung in the Korean War because he was fighting the Americans. In Vietnam, they sided with the Vietcong because America was on the other side. They adored the Khmer Rouge for the same reason.<br>
<br>
Today they have adopted Saddam Hussein as a cult figure in their latest quixotic attempt at stopping &quot; the American giant.&quot; President Jacques Chirac has found himself a new popularity among Parisian elites by letting it be known that he would do all he can to prevent Washington from toppling Saddam Hussein. In a recent television program in Paris, I was astounded when retired Admiral Philippe Lacoste, a former head of the French secret service, suggested that Saddam Hussein should not be asked to disarm for as long as the United States did not sign a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines.<br>
<br>
Anti-Americanism is not only a disease of the French left. Neo-fascist leader Jean-Marie Le Pen finds himself alongside the Trotskyite Arlette Laguiller in pulling faces at &quot;the Yankee Imperialists.&quot; Anti-Americanism has become the last refuge of the scoundrel on all fronts.<br>
<br>
This bias blurs France's vision of the real world and undermines French national interests. It prevented France from playing its full role in the last Gulf War until the late stages. By then, France had been excluded from the real decision-making. The French ended up taking part in the fighting but secured no say in shaping the post-bellum shape of the region.<br>
<br>
More recently, France had an even worse experience over the war to liberate Afghanistan. Having played the game of &quot;yes-but&quot; for too long, Paris ended up sending a few dozen troops after the Taliban had fled into their caves. The French troops had to stay in Uzbekistan, presumably playing cards for weeks before the Americans allowed them to enter Afghanistan. As a result, France's influence in shaping the future of Afghanistan, and beyond it Central Asia as a whole, is zero.<br>
<br>
Politics, as Aristotle taught over 2000 years ago, is about making a choice, which means taking sides. The subject of ethics is the choice between right and wrong. That of aesthetics is about beauty and ugliness. In politics the choice is between friend and foe. Of course, there would be room for doubt if the United States were to invade Canada, or even Mexico, in pursuit of imperial designs. But a normal person living in an open democratic society should have little difficulty in choosing between the United States on the one hand and Stalin, Kim Il-sung, Ho Chi Minh, Pol Pot, Khomeini and Saddam Hussein on the other.<br>
<br>
The same normal person would understand that some regimes must be defeated by force when no other option is available. Hitler had to be removed by force. Had the Vietnamese army not invaded Cambodia, the Pol Pot gang might still be in power. The Tanzanian army did the world a service by invading Uganda and driving Idi Amin into exile. And Slobodan Milosevic would not be in the dock had it not been for the American-led campaign to drive him out of Kosovo.<br>
<br>
Last week, during the Nato summit in Prague, President George W. Bush called on all allies to provide support in case war becomes inevitable. France responded with a &quot;we don't know, we shall see&quot; gimmick, hoping to play it both ways for as long as possible. But, as the moment of decision approaches over Iraq, France has to take sides. Neutrality is no option. France is not Liechtenstein.<br>

In fact, that was the first time a nation met fascist nation. France was not aware of the camps in pologne and truly hoped that hitler will be honest. the story showed how naive the diplomates was.<br>
And about the armistice, just remember that he was signed from the traitor petain, and only concern 1/3 of the france territory (and  i don't talk about the population, wich only the extreme droite (pro nazi) agreed to this armistice. the fake government in vichy is the worst shame in our history. We prefer refer to the real government moved in london, with Degaulle.

Okay, I'll mention them too.  The US supposedly supported Hussein?  That's why there are Mirages and Migs instead of F15s and F14s, right?  And T72s instead of M1s?  And Silkworm missles instead of MLRS systems?  For all the vaunted supposed US support of Iraq in the 80s (asserted but not proven) it is amusing to see where they got their weapons and where their folks get educated.  People fail to recall that Saddam's personal hero is Stalin and he's *always* leaned towards the USSR.  <br>
<br>
Expect Russia and China not to get into the WTO any time soon, since their main backer *was* the US.  Expect US bases in Germany to slowly move to Poland.  Expect French, Russian, Chinese and German firms to be shut out of the US funded rebuilding of Iraq.  Expect firms from countries in the &quot;Coalition of the Willing&quot; to play major parts in the reconstruction.  Expect the UN to whine, scream, shout and send vigorous protests to the US over this.  Expect the US to &quot;/ignore UN&quot; and go on with the job.<br>
<br>
Just for my knowledge, when was the last time a UN Resolution ever compelled a country to actually stop doing something without the guns of the US/UK backing them up?  The US/UK can enforce their wills without the UN; can the UN do so without them?<br>
