Note: Candyanea and Suladany are my better halfs chars, as I say this originally was posted on our guild website.<br>

 K, this is a LONG multiple rant w/ 2 rare raves towads the end. It's Thursday, Sep 26. After finally being able to get on, due to a patch, I figure I need to get Mandarr some exp. No one from Guild is on, so I go to KC (gag), to get into a group. <br>
(FIRST RANT- at myself for being STOOPID enough to go into KC on a patch day) <br>
So I get there, yell 54 war looking for group. I get two ooc's, first is from LCY, second from RCY, so I head to LCY. <br>
(SECOND RANT - at some lamebrane from RCY that follows me into LCY and invites me into group. Im standing there, tells are flying, mobs attacking from everywhere, im in a group and its not with anyone around me)...sigh <br>
Well, I survive that, figure out what happened and get into the right group.<br>
(THIRD RANT - at SAME previous lambrane,(wish I remembered the name), now get this, She's mad at ME for going to LCY. OK, /ignore takes care of that.)<br>
So, we settle into a groove, I'm the puller and things are ok, except for a few more than usual LD's.<br>
(FOURTH RANT - at myself again for not getting the picture after 3 or 4 people went LD then came back) <br>
I think you can see where this is going, lol. I pull two mobs, we get a room pop add, np chanter is good, knows her job. From here it went down hill so fast, i'm not sure of exact sequence. All I know is, within 20 seconds, EVERYONE but me is LD. I saw my health bar getting low, looked around, and it wasnt pretty. All I saw were names with LD after them, and mobs. <br>
(FIRST RAVE - I give this one to me. No one in that group realizes to this day I saved there butts. When I realized they were all LD, I pulled the mobs towards the door. I figured I would never make the zone, so I targeted and taunted as many mobs as I could see, and fought to the death there to keep the mobs off the group)<br>
Loading - Please Wait - You are in Halas<br>
I figure screw it, I will log on Candyanea(Wifes Cleric), get myself a quick 90 rez, and /q the hell out of there. Sounds like a good plan right? Heh, the plans of mice, men, and eqers, as they say. Anyway, I log on Suladany(Wifes Ranger) first, to go get my corpse in LCY. I cast Sup camo, and head out. Pass first 2 dogs on bridge, np. Hit the second bridge, and something whacks me. I figure I might as well try it, heh. By the time I got Suladany to Mandarr;s corps, target corpse, and turn around, I am in the middle of about 10 mobs........ <br>
Loading - Please Wat - You are in the Nexus<br>
Let me just say about this time I almost lost it. I put in a petition and it wasnt pretty. I figured I would either get banned or maybe get mandarr a rez. I also noticed there were 5 Guides and NO GM's on. I don't know about any of you, but from what I have seen in the past, I figured guides to be pretty much useless.....  Guess I was wrong.<br>
(FINAL RAVE - Ildarri (Im pretty sure), a lvl 57 Guide, sends me a tell within 5 minutes, saying Incoming rez. AND it's a 100 per center. As im looting Mandarr I send her a tell explaining that Suladany died trying to get my corpse, could she possibly rez her also. Now, anyone that has played eq a while, and delt with GM's and Guides, knows this one is a long shot. But to my surprise, I look over at Sul's PC and see that beautifull 100 per rez box. And not only that, but Ildarri stayed at the zone and kept the trains off us while we looted our corpses.)<br>
<br>
We are always quick to bash the GM's and Guides, and sometimes for good reason, but, it's good to know that some of them do care, and really do want to help make the game more enjoyable. I hope this is a sign of things to come.........................<br>
