<br>
I finally got so sick and tired of myself that I was willing to do anything, including put myself through massive pain in order to lose the weight.  So I starved myself.  I went complete anorexic, exercise fiend, for 9 months.  I would NEVER advise anyone to do that, and I even knew I shouldn't do it when I did it.  But I was desperate.<br>
<br>
My real advice is...buy a reclining exercise bike =) You can ride it and burn calories while you read your schoolbooks.  15-30 minutes a day on there and you'll start to notice a real difference *nod*  And if you are a procrastinator when it comes to reading or riding doing the two at once will always leave you with at least one reason to do either of em.  If you want to do your reading, ya gotta ride, if ya wanna ride, ya gotta do your reading =)<br>
<br>
Oh yeah...and drink so much water your eyeballs float =) (we're talking MORE than 80oz a day *nod*) <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.texnet.net/ebmagic/gargoyle.jpg" /></center>

<br>
My weight was inching back up over the winter (due to inactivity heh) so I gave it a try too. Lost ~20lbs or so in 6 weeks and it was really pretty easy. I made no changes to my daily routine, just ate the proper foods. Went from 205 to my current 185.<br>
<br>
The previous winter my weight went up and I did a much more conventional diet and exercise program to lose it. Went from 210-215 to 190ish in 3-4 months. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567">Morinkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.furysedge.com">Fury's Edge</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Morell Thule</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=reignastormraven>Reigna Stormraven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 694<br> <font color=#628CBC>(5/1/03 1:08:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmmm</span><hr size=1> I'm sure one thing that does not help me at all is my eating habits... I eat when I'm hungry and don't set certain times to eat a breakfast, lunch, and dinner with snacks in between or something like that... I usually have a large glass of chocolate milk (Addicted to that stuff, instead of coffee) and then eat a semi decent dinner... Usually don't get hungry during the day... I've never been one to eat a lot of sweets, so that's a good thing, don't have that sweet tooth lots of others have... I've even started eating less I think since Jaid went to Cali, we're 2k miles apart, and have been for a bit over a month now... So struggling to juggle the kids, house, and school in the face of his absence... <br>
<br>
As for the idea about the bike, I think its a really good idea... I'd love one, would have to look into it financial might be a bit tougher to do at least till closer to the fall, unless I start working soon... Need to finish out this semester, plan to work through the summer I think, instead of living on student loan money... <br>
<br>
Mori, tell me more about this diet though, more details about it... Types of foods and such... My problem with most diets are that they require you to eat certain foods, I'm a VERY picky eater... I love veggies if they are cooked and tend to eat them at times for a meal, but am not into fruits or salads at all... <br>
<br>
I once tried those diet pills Ephendrine (Spelling?) can't remember how its spelled... Anyway, they worked well for Jaid, but they didn't work to well for me, they weakened me and Doctor told me to stop taking them... Cause they were having adverse affects on me... <br>

<br>
The basic premise: Normally your body gets it's energy by metabolizing carbohydrates and sugars. However, fat is the &quot;backup&quot; fuel the body goes to if neither of the first two are available.<br>
<br>
So if you're on the Atkins diet, you pretty much cut carbs and sugars out of your diet entirely. You can eat as much meat, chicken, fish, cheese, nuts, eggs, etc as you want, but you can't eat potatoes, breads, fruits etc.<br>
<br>
You cut carbs/sugars out entirely for the first two weeks, to ensure your body is in a state called ketosis (meaning it's burning it's own fat for fuel). After that, you just can eat some carbs, but you restrict it a lot.<br>
<br>
Upsides - After the first few days, my appetite dropped significantly, and I'm normally a pretty big eater. It was also nice to be able to eat as much as I wanted... just no chips or anything. I also lost most of my cravings for specific foods after the first few days, so I didn't miss my &quot;old&quot; foods.<br>
<br>
Downsides - Well for me it was tougher than some, cuz I'm allergic to nuts and don't like eggs. So I nothing but meat and cheese for a few weeks, which was really boring hehe. But it wasn't that bad.<br>
<br>
Besides that, it was just a matter of a bit of self-discipline... and I really mean a bit, cuz I really didn't find it that hard. If I got a burger, I'd skip the bun. I'd order a monster-sized chef salad with extra cheese n meat. I'd have cheese-smothered spiced chicken breasts. A lot of yummy stuff hehe.<br>
<br>
One side note... my downfall weight-wise is always eating late at night. You should try and avoid eating ANYTHING within 4-5 hours of when you go to bed. Your body shuts down while you sleep, so it doesn't burn up any calories from the food you ate before bed.<br>

<br>
Cutting out all carbs and sugars feels weird at first. You'd be shocked at what foods have lots of carbs in them hehe.<br>
<br>
My basic meals were ham, bacon, chicken, pork chops, beef and lots of cheese.

I've gotta go to the grocery store at some point today, gonna read up on the link you gave and give this a try... <br>
<br>
I'm glad you two are seemingly as open as I am, or I'd be embarrassed a ton by now speaking so personally about me especially with weight... I've struggled with it since I had my first child... At the start I weighed around 150 pounds when I got pregnant with him, and with my build/bone structure that was a great weight for me... Then I gained like 60 pounds when I was preggo with him, 3 months later got preggo again, so never lost the weight... Not a lot of it anyway, no time... Only gained like 10 pounds with second and third pregnancies and lost that right away after they were born, so I always say I'm still trying to lose the initial weight I gained having my first one!  /laughs.<br>

I think the most important aspect is to be strict as hell with yourself the first 2 weeks. No carbs or sugars at all. I checked the carb/sugar numbers on every item I bought in the grocery store. I went for 0 grams of carbs for pretty much everything, although the odd item had 1-2g.<br>
<br>
After the first couple of weeks, it was much easier... I'd have a nice meat or chicken for dinner, and have a few veggies on the side for variety.

You have to tell yourself &quot;This is how it is, no way whatsoever to work around it&quot; then as time passes you get so used to it, that's it hard to go back to what you did before.  For instance: I used to really pack in the butter.  My husband cooked with it, we'd lather it on bread/potatoes/veggies.  Really just about everything that came out of the kitchen tasted buttery LOL.  So one day I just quit cold turkey.  No butter on anything.  We also cut salt at the same time.  For a month we did without even tho the food just tasted nasty at first.  But once that month had passed we tried putting a little back in the food...and the food tasted horrible.  So we don't cook with butter or salt anymore =)  Mind over matter is a wonderful thing =)<br>
<br>
The exercise bikes are generally relatively cheap.  I bought mine at wal-mart for $69 =)  I actually got two for that price as the first one had a part break around Sept. of 2001.  Since shipping from other countries was pretty much nonexistant at that time, they just shipped me an entirely new bike from one of their instate companies instead of shipping the part to me from Japan LOL. <p><center><img border=0 src="http://www.texnet.net/ebmagic/gargoyle.jpg" /></center>

<br>
My boss took regular old vitamins when he was on it, like Centrum or whatever.<br>
<br>
As I said before, I really didn't find it that hard a diet... but of course, I usually only cook for one. =P<br>
<br>
Anytime it felt the least bit hard when I was starting, i just thought of how short a period two weeks is. It is. 14 days, big whoop. =)<br>
<br>
I will admit though, after the first two weeks, I had a meal of 3 pork chops, spiced and covered in swiss cheese, with fried mushrooms and onions. It was soooo gooooood to have a bit of variety back in a meal hehe.<br>
<br>
BTW, the Atkins Advantage Bars are actually great hehe. In the later stages of the diet, I tried a few of those low-carb protein bars and they tasted like pure ass. But then I got some of the Atkins brand bars and they're really tasty hehe.<br>
<br>
Another point... it's kinda an expensive diet. What items generally cost the most in the grocery store? lol meats and cheeses. =)<br>
<br>
But as I said, I lost the weight I wanted to lose with relative ease, in a reasonably short period of time. I'm a pretty tall guy with a solid build, so 185 is pretty much right on the money for me. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:xx-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567">Morinkhan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> | <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.furysedge.com">Fury's Edge</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Morell Thule</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crystilla>crystilla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1016<br> <font color=#628CBC>(5/1/03 2:30:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=142.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmmm</span><hr size=1> Aye, Mia's been on Atkin's diet (and through osmosis I guess so have I).<br>
<br>
I am VERY addicted to carbs so I was on it sparingly and did lose about 10 pounds.  I only cut half my carb intake, but I ate more of the meat/cheese/bacon/egg stuff than I usually do.<br>
<br>
One of the downsides to it, was there was some literature on how it affected your liver (negatively) over time.  However, recently it's been touted again in the press positively.  There are many protein foods that are &quot;ok&quot; to eat on this diet, but Atkins always tried to push folks that they should be eating the &quot;good proteins&quot; not the &quot;bad proteins&quot;.  It's the bad ones that lead to liver damage if I'm rememebering my history right.  Basically look at it this way, the diet consists of eating, eggs and bacon (and a million other things).  Remember back in the 50's (or I should say remember hearing about back in the 50's) that was the staple breakfast folks ate.  Then some said it would clog your heart, so that was a fear with this diet.<br>
<br>
Atkins himself passed away in the last 6 months (can't remember how recently) and his diet is now getting looked at to be not as bad as folks thought.<br>
<br>
One possible key to keeping weight off, is - if you are going to &quot;diet&quot;, find a diet that is similar enough to your normal eating habits so it's not a huge switch.  Especially if you want to make a &quot;life&quot;change in how you eat.  For me, I used to say my stomach is Italian, because I know I would never want to try and live without carbs; I love Italian, Chinese and Thai food too much.<br>

<br>
The diet itself would let me eat a lot of the foods I generally love, especially meats and cheeses... Plus I love fish sticks so hopefully those can fit into it also... <br>
<br>
The only snag or downside that I can tell so far is my routine of chocolate milk every morning... Nearly 30g of Carbs in the Nestle Quick itself, plus nearly as much in the milk (2%)... That will be a tough thing for me to cut, as I said its like coffee for me... <br>
<br>
I've already done some checking on alot of the basic foods I eat that I have in the house now, and most have low carb/sugar already... I think most usually have like 1g of Carb/sugar or there close... In the first two weeks is it definately absolute that you need to go with 0g carb/sugar?  From what I can tell on the site itself seems like they start with limiting it to 20g a day not 0g, am I wrong?<br>

<br>
Well for me, Atkins was great because I knew I was only going to stay on it for a set amount of time. I never really considered making it a life-long diet or anything. It was close enough to my regular eating habits that it was relatively easy to do. <br>
<br>
Other more traditional diets were always tougher for me cuz I'd eat a bunch of salads or whatever and just not feel full. But with Atkins, I could eat as much as I wanted as long as I ate the right things. And believe me, eating a big T-bone is MUCH more preferable to eating a heaping plate full of lettuce. =P<br>
<br>
