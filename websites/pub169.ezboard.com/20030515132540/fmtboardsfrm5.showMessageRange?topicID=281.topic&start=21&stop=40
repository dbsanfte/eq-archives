<br>
Religeous texts are the most amended books in the world.  They are interpreted, amended, reinterpreted, reamended and so on.  What are protestants if not people who chose to interpret and amend Catholic religeous views?  Are there not some sects of christianity who accept gays and lesbians while others do not?  Was this not an interpretation issue?<br>
<br>
Judaism says women should wear skirts at all times.  I find myself quite comfortable in jeans and so do many women here in Israel.  We're still jews though, we've simply chosen to disregard certain rules as outdated.<br>
<br>
The mormon church for a long time allowed the practice of multiple wives.  However, to adept to US society and laws they issued an edict which prohibited it.  Are you still sure that religeous beliefs are never amended?<br>
<br>
According to Jewish rules, one is not supposed to drive on Saturday.  However, even in Israel, almost everyone drives on Saturday.  Intrestingly enough, they drive to temple.  Even the rabbi drives to temple in some spots.  Again, it's a religeous law that was discarded at some point because it no longer applied.<br>
<br>
Ayerish,<br>
I was not aware of the fact that women's rights and civil rights were obtained through forced military intervention.  The end of slavery in the south was obtained through the civil war, a conflict which was fought over a lot more than slavery, but women's right and equal rights were not obtained during that conflict.  In fact, I seem to recall Martin Luther King being against violent conflict.<br>
<br>
This may come as a shock to you, but the majority of muslims do not run through the street setting fires and beating people up.  Please refer back to my previous example of how the news portrays african americans.  This is simply what you see.  The majority of muslims are no less and no more violent than any person you would see in the United States.<br>
<br>
If you want proof that the majority of muslim leaders do not condone nor support violence, I would suggest heading to your local Mosque.  In fact, pick any 10 mosques in your region.  Go to all of them and talk to people there.  See what you find.  I guarantee you the majority of them abhor violence.<br>

Though the bible says women should kill two doves during their periods as a sacrafice, I myself have never seen it in practice.<br>
<br>
But if someone were to do it, they could truthfully state that it is a mandate of their religion.<br>
<br>
Back when I was a catholic, I remember going to a non-denominational christian church for service once, and I brought my bible, with very minor differences it was exactly the same. So though they choose to interpret it differently, the religious doctrine was still very much the same. <br>
<br>
Heck, I've seen Hasidim on Miami Beach swinging a live chicken over their head to make atonement, but I've never seen any other Jewish person do that =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/25/02 2:17:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> One more thing, lets assume worst case scenario Canna.  The word of Mohammed has been spoken and tomorrow the Muslim world decides that this specifically means that women are inferior and should be beaten.  <br>
<br>
a.  Does this mean that Islam as a religeon will never change?<br>
b.  Does this that all muslims believe women are inferior and should be beaten?<br>
<br>
Well lets see.  The Christian faith did not allow gay marriage or gay priests.  Gays were seen as evil, filthy and sinful.  Does this mean Christianity never changed?  No, some christian sects already allow gay marriage and priests.<br>
<br>
Your country, being a largely Christian country, adopted laws based on this religeous belief.  Gay marriage is not recognized in the US.  What does this mean about you?  Does it mean you believe that gays are sinful because you live in a country influenced by religeon?<br>
<br>
Assuming the interpretation of that passage means that women are lesser than men and should be beaten if they disobey, does this mean that most muslim men beat their wives?  If so, I can freely assume that you believe gay people are inferior since you live in a country that legalized the religeous belief that gay marriage is not right. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

I'm fairly objective with them about religion in general and there's plenty of mutual respect--they're about evenly split on the issue of militant Islamic doctrine.  Half of them think it's abhorrent, and half of them think that the world needs to change, and if it takes a few thousand innocent lives to bring about that change and reset the balance of power, then that's a justifiable sacrifice in their eyes.  Frighteningly, the ones that feel that the change needs to come about &quot;by any means necessary&quot; are the ones from upper-middle class backgrounds who have never really known true suffering.<br>
<br>
You're misreading my point of view.  I'm not lobbying for women's rights in Muslim countries, or racial equality.  What I'm saying is that Muslims need to stop massacring innocent people in the name of their God.  No, of course not all of them participate.  But I am hard-pressed to state that, on a global scale, that it's only a &quot;minority&quot; of the Muslim faithful that feel this way.  Clearly Islamic extremists have even less confidence in diplomacy than I do; their response is to bomb, murder, or throw rocks at things they don't like.  My point is that, like it or not, sooner or later someone is going to throw a *really really big* rock, unless somebody ELSE steps in and stops the rock throwing for good.  Probably a poor metaphor, but I hope you get my point.<br>
<br>
Non-intervention is no longer an option, because it's boiling down to an Us vs. Them issue.  Us is not Christians or Americans, nor is Them Muslims or Arabs, but there's a line between sanity/civilization and jihad/savagery that's becoming more and more clearly delineated with every WTC or Bali or Nigeria or Afghanistan that we read about.  When the bloodthirsty Christian regimes ruled Europe and, by extension, much of the world with an iron fist, they were eventually toppled only by a stronger fist.  History reflects how incredibly savage and primitive that theocracy was, and to claim that the theocracies that exist in underindustrialized nations today are any less dangerous is folly.  The frightening fact is that today, instead of swords and horses, they have sarin, or enriched uranium, or smallpox.<br>
<br>
Despise me if you like, but I'm not willing to risk the well-being of my family, friends, or countrymen on the perceived kindness of strangers.  Sooner or later, someone needs to say enough is enough, and all the open-minded objectivity and good intentions in the world don't mean squat when you're dealing with a culture based in violence and insanity.     <br>

The quote is saying &quot;He who fears rebellion in this&quot; as in, men who fear rebellion from their women, as there are women who wont take kindly to being herded around as a piece of property.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/25/02 2:28:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Sorry for the multiple replies Canna, we're writing at the same time I think.<br>

Anyway, if you were to go to an Indian reservation and snatch the nearest baby and take him away to be raised properly and far from the heathen pagans, would you be able to justify your act by saying your religeon said it was ok?  No.  Yet a few hundred years ago you could, and even then there were people who saw this as wrong.<br>
<br>
Religeons change, and so do the societies based on them.<br>
<br>
And none of this means I agree with the initial statement that Islam is a corrupt and violent religeon.  This statement is untrue.  I can easily say that African American culture in the US is corrupt and violent.  However, the truth is that the violence has everything to do with poverty and nothing to do with race.  In this particular case, the violence has a lot to do with the region and politics than with religeon. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

My country may be largely christian, I however, am not a Christian. And my religion has no problem with homosexuals or any other sect of people in this world. Though my country is largely christian, the majority of its people are not religious fanatics, sadly the majority who vote are though, heh, much to my dismay.<br>
<br>
If you ask most christians, they will tell you homosexuality is immoral and bad, they might not go as far as to tell you that an individual is evil, but that the practice of homosexuality is.<br>
<br>
I cannot speak for Muslims, I am not one nor do I live in a heavy muslim community, but I will tell you that the majority of Christians DO believe homosexuality is evil, and those few churches that do allow it (Of which I have seen none here in the US, but many when I visited Toronto) are in heavily gay areas and most definately not recognized by their parent organizations.<br>
<br>
Now there are countries like Iran and Taliban controlled afghanistan, where law and religion are one entity. In Iran women have absolutely no rights, I loathe to use movies in my examples, but this one is a true story so I will, did you see &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;? It is terrifying to think that things like that happen, and it does because law and religion are not seperate.<br>
<br>
Over here the only reason the conservative religious right has so much power, is because the massive liberal group are too busy watching the Osbournes to fill out voter registration forms and allow their voices to be heard, not because they are oppressed.<br>

Last time I was in the US, I heard multiple people say &quot;nuke the bastards!&quot; when talking about Afganistahn.  Your culture is all violence and you accept the killing of thousands of innocents in order to change the world!  I don't hear any of your leader opposing this!  You should all change and move to Canada!  <br>

Comeon now, we're both into the realm of wild Exaggeration here.  Muslims roaming the streets massacering people?  How about the Rodney King riots?  We should burn down LA!  How about KKK marches?  lets nuke Alabama!  Men believing women are inferior and living in a culture of guns and violence??!  Well hell, burn down Texas!  Let me indict your entire culture based on the acts of an extreme few that TV shows me!  I don't even know how to respond to you anymore.  You're basing your view of an entire culture on TV.  You don't even bother to see the political and historical nature of the conflict.  That's the same as stereotyping jews as money grubbing and greedy because we were involved in financial institutions during the middle ages. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

I agree with you on this, people might bring up how Muhamed spread the religion of Islam, how he lied to groups of people and murdered them as they slept to further spread his teachings out, there was much bloodshed to get islam to where it is today, and where it was back then... but then one could just as easily site the bible, Moses did a fair share of slaughtering as well, and of course theres the crusades, the inquisition, and so many others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/25/02 3:08:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Why not mix chruch and state Canna?

Let me use an opposite example.  Nazy Germany was predominantly Christian.  It commited atrocities that were religeous in nature, the persecution of the Jews.  Should we see this as an indictment of the Christian faith or of a few people who chose to use religeon as a political cause?<br>

Let's take a look: <br>
<br>
Re: &quot;Nuke the bastards.&quot;  We didn't use nuclear arms in Afghanistan at any point, nor did our government ever threaten to.  While a significant portion of our populace may have been expressing bloodthirsty feelings of revenge, we did what we needed to do, and made an effort to rebuild the country's social structure.  It should be noted that the country was a barren and lawless wasteland before we ever got there, so blaming America for Afghanistan's problems is nothing more than scapegoating.  <br>
<br>
Re: Rodney King.  One person died during the L.A. riots.  While I feel that Reginald Denny's death was needless and barbaric, it's hardly comparable to what happened in Nigeria.  In L.A., the riots occurred in response to an incredibly polarizing socio-political event.  In Nigeria, it was a beauty pageant.  The contestants weren't captured on video beating and kicking a Muslim.  And yes, order was restored in L.A., BY FORCE, because the residents were beyond the point of reason and the only thing they understood was tear gas and rubber bullets.  <br>
<br>
Re: the KKK.  A narrow-minded gang of proto-religious thugs who have been almost totally ostracized from modern American society and who exist in isolated pockets of backwardness, both urban and rural.  Certainly not the prevailing socio-political force in our country, despite Robert Byrd's fervent wishes.<br>
<br>
Your comparison to the Eurocentric early American government's stance toward Native Americans is off-base.  As despicable and horrifying as it is, American Indians were a conquered people.  At that point in history they were treated as well as, or better, than any conquered culture in history.  That certainly doesn't make it right, by any means, but comparing it to what's happening in Muslim societies today is grasping at incredibly slippery straws. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/25/02 3:14:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=37>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Ayerish, I am saying you are confusing a political / cultural conflict for a religeous one, that is all.

What I was trying to say is that, on a large scale, the most visible members of the Islamic faith seem to be endorsing all of the WRONG ideas, in my observation.  I thought I made that clear when I said I wasn't stereotyping Muslims...I really wasn't intending to.  I was simply saying that the instances in recent memory of Islam being a productive, nurturing, malleable doctrine are few and far between; the instances of extremist Muslim savages killing wantonly in the name of the Almighty have been far too common.  <br>
<br>
My point was that I want to know where the level-headed Muslims are.  If there's any hope of stopping this ever-escalating tradition of violence between Islam extremists and Western culture as a whole, SOMEONE needs to be the voice of reason from WITHIN Islam.  I have yet to see that someone, but I see plenty of Bin Ladens and Arafats and Shahs and Aidids and etc. etc. ad nauseum.  As frightening as the prospect is, if something doesn't happen soon to catalyze peace in fundamentalist Muslim cultures, bad sh!t is gonna hit the fan.  <br>
<br>
That's not to say that corruption, megalomania, greed, and all of those other human problems are exclusive to Muslim culture, but right now if I had to pick a subculture of humanity to lay blame on, that's where I'd point my finger.  The people endorsing and financing this behavior are playing in a very big sandbox, and sooner or later the bully is going to get tired of having sand kicked on him.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/25/02 3:29:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=39>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> edit <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

Lets assume we misunderstood each other and start over a second here.<br>
<br>
I would argue that the lack of peaceful representation of the Muslim faith is a factor of Western Press, not reality.  Simply put, the news will not show you the peacemakers because they are not as interesting as the dictators.  CNN does not cover peaceful life, they cover riots.<br>
<br>
Lets take a few examples.  Have you heard of a man called Anwar Sadat?  For most Americans, this name means nothing.  Yet this is the man who was brave enough to go against an entire region and propose peace with Israel back when the idea was unthinkable.  In the early 80's, this man who had fought Israel in the past, this man who had come up with the plan for the Yom Kippur war which nearly annihilated Israel, this man who knew how much danger he would face for his actions, dared to board a plane and fly to Tel Aviv from Cairo in order to make the first peace treaty between an arab country and Israel.  How often does the media mention his name?<br>
<br>
How about King Hussein of Jordan?  Another muslim leader, a cousin of Saddam Hussein by the way, who, while dying of cancer, tried to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians?<br>
<br>
Hey, how about Mohammed Ali?  Seems relatively non muderous to me!  Assuming you consider boxing a sport I suppose...<br>
<br>
Anyway, the point I am trying to make is that there is a lot more to this than just Islam.  The majority of the problems can be traced back to:<br>
<br>
1.  Politics<br>
2.  Poverty<br>
3.  Lack of Education<br>
4.  Oil<br>
<br>
Very few of them are directly traceable to Islam.  The only reason it seems that way is because the majority of the people in this region are Muslim and because this is the only thing that generates ratings and is therefore shown on CNN. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>
