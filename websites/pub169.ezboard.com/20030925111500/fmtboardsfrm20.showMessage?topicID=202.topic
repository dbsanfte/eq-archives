I finally got Healing Gift at 3...so now I can do other stuff.<br>
<br>
My thoughts are getting the following...but not sure which  LOL<br>
<br>
Spell Casting Reinforcement (the one that extends buffs)<br>
Divine Rez<br>
MGB<br>
Mental Clarity (guessing at the names of these, can't find an AA list anywhere)<br>
<br>
Anyhow....any suggestions for them?  I'm one of 2 clerics in the guild over 60 - the other one doens't play much lately due to real life, and quite honestly, I've no clue if she is doing AA or pure exp anyhow.<br>
<br>
My thoughts are leaning towards spell casting reinforcement...and mental clarity.<br>
<br>
So far I have run3, 3 others in tier one (just mishmashed).  Radiant Cure at 1, and Healing Gift at 3....and I'm level 62.<br>
<br>

<br>
1. MGB - Biggest speed boost to your guild's raiding game.<br>
2. Spell Casting Mastery - IIRC, this is the one that increases the chance of a specialization check.  Less mana spent on spells means you can handle more in raid and exp environments.<br>
3. Divine Arbitration - Low/No Aggro heal.  Insta-use.  Very hard to beat the utility of this in exp groups from what I've heard.<br>
4. Unfailing Divinity - If you use this at all, UD3 is worthwhile.  Mostly useful if your raid will get creamed if your MA goes down.  Not very beneficial in exp groups unless you're taking on named with a weak tank and a low dps group.<br>
<br>
From there I'd suggest Natural Durability, but I tend to favor hp.  Mental Clarity3 doesn't provide enough ROI in my opinion since it takes 12AA to get the 3rd level.<br>
<br>
Divine Rez is nice, so I'm tempted to put it 5th on the list, but I haven't been in a circumstance where anyone on our raid needed to be rez'ed with full health/mana.<br>
<br>
Radiant Cure at level 3 would be nice, but from the sounds of it, you aren't raiding in situations where RC3 makes a big difference over RC1.<br>
<br>
If you're drooling over SCR and MC3, I suggest doing the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest (if you haven't already).  Same effects and you can focus on other AA at the same time.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.split88.net/images/Rhownesig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
However since you did get your 12aa spent in that area and can move up it is really a choice to you if you are already 65 and do not have mutch use for xp groups for anything but aa I would say spend your 2aa in scm1 then go back save up your i think 9aa for mgm then I would say the resurection one. <br>
<br>
Most do not think this is something you should ever get but I persoanlly love talk to your ma before hand telling him if he drops give you consent quickly get him back have him loot and good to go as if it never happened. If he goes down and you where really counting on that ma to do most dmg but he died within the first 30 secs. hey come one we have all been there when that has happened. This little tool can be very very usefull.   <br>
<br>
But i would definatly say get your mgb first<br>
<br>
<br>
*so you do not want to takt the time to read the post here is the short version*<br>
<br>
scm1<br>
mgb<br>
resurection<br>
scm2<br>

Descriptions of some interesting or misunderstood skills based on your interests or type of fighting/raiding you do:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(1)  Divine Arbitration - Type:  Active; Max - 3; Cost - 2; Requirements:  Lvl 61/63/65.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It takes all of the total damage done to the group so far and averages it across all group members.  1st level adds 20% penalty; 2nd adds 10% and 3rd has no penalty.  So, for example:<br>
<br>
Member 1 = 4000/4000<br>
Member 2 = 3500/4000 (missing 500)<br>
Member 3 = 1500/4000 (missing 2500)<br>
Member 4 = 2000/2000<br>
Member 5 = 2000/2000 <br>
Member 6 = 2500/2500<br>
<br>
With DvA1, the 3000 HP damage taken (+ 600 points for the 20% penalty) would be divided among all players starting from full health, so each player would be missing 600 HP as shown below:<br>
<br>
Member 1 = 3400/4000<br>
Member 2 = 3400/4000 (gained 100 HP)<br>
Member 3 = 3400/4000 (gained 1900)<br>
Member 4 = 1400/2000<br>
Member 5 = 1400/2000 <br>
Member 6 = 1900/2500<br>
<br>
Pretty useful tool, and low/no aggro from using it.  3 min recast makes it a highly desired ability.<br>
<br>
 - This HANDS DOWN is one of the top two cleric abilities.  It's worth getting to the first tier at least and soon regardless of play style.  0.75 second cast and you can save the life of someone when a heal won't hit in time and you don't want to &quot;pray&quot; for a miracle.  <br>
 - Only downside is if you didn't buff all of the players, you can throw someone into low heath frenzy depending on the varied HP levels of your group when you use ie (ie not good for when more than 2 folks are taking a strong beating).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(2)  Spell Casting Mastery - Type: Passive; Max - 3; Cost - 2; Requirements: Level - 55, Must spend 6 ability points in the General Abilities; This ability gives you an increased chance of making your specialization checks.  It also reduces your chance to fizzle (or miss song notes) and increases the chance to lower the mana cost for the spell by 5, 15, and 30 percent.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This actually isn't accurate.  Many tests have shown that, over time, it's a fixed savings of 10% basically on your casts.  That's significant and basically can extend your mana pool up to 10%.  I say up to because it doesn't affect CHeal (of course).  <br>
<br>
This is also one of the top two cleric aa abilities, and one I would strongly recommend having regardless of play style.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(3)  Spell Casting Reinforcement - Type: Passive; Max - 3; Cost - 2; Requirements: Level - 55, Must spend 6 ability points in the General Abilities; This ability increases the duration of beneficial spells that you cast by 5, 15, and 30 percent. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This is good if you do a lot of buffing or hate those BoR timer recasts cause it's never long enough.  However, it's not a necessity unless you are broke and do groups that aren't revolving doors where you'll still be there with them when it's time to rebuff.  For short term stuff, it's not worth it as much if under 2.5 hours in duration.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(4)  Celestial Regeneration - Type: Activated, Refresh Time: 72 mins.; Max - 1; Cost - 5; Requirements: Level - 59, Healing Gift at Level 3.; This ability gives you the ability to cast a large heal over time spell at no mana cost. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
 - It does 2,000 heals over 5 ticks I believe (so 400 a tick).<br>
<br>
I am very glad I did this one.  It's helped on pulls that went bad, cause I didn't have to worry about the tank or someone else for a few seconds, and on raids where you do NOT want to be on rampage list...(I know a bit above the mobs you're doing atm).  It was worth me getting it when I was a primarily exp cleric.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(5)  Divine Resurrection - Type: Activated, Refresh Time: 4320 mins.; Max - 1; Cost - 5; Requirements: Level - 59, Healing Gift at Level 3; This ability allows you to provide a resurrection that restores 100percent Experience, all hit points and mana, and causes no adverse resurrection effects.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I positively love this ability.  I've used it on raids as well as exp groups.  Especially when the chanter goes down and things are bad, or the tank goes down and has a fast connection to get back in.<br>
<br>
The key on it, if you use in a raid sense, is, if you have time, is to rez normally and then once they have their gear on but haven't looted everything off their body, hit it.  It restores your mana and HP to full at the time the cast is made - so if you're naked you are at full HP and mana, but as soon as you started putting on gear, it would drop naturally.<br>
<br>
Other nice thing about it, is it's one hit of a key which can be done quickly if you get to the point of needing to use it quickly and you're in a CCH.  Target corpse, make sure they are ready, hit button and back on chain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(6)  Mass Group Buff - Type: Activated, Refresh Time: 72 mins; Max - 1; Cost - 9; Requirements: Level - 59, Must spend 12 ability points in the Archetype Abilities; This ability turns the next group buff that you cast into a beneficial area effect spell, hitting everyone within its radius, at the cost of doubling the spell's mana usage. </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I got this and have never regretted it.  From the ability to buff folks at random in PoK/PoT/Nexus, to buffing groups for a raid, it's been worth it.  The mana cost on BoA is such that if you have to cast BoA on two groups, you'll use the same amount of mana as this ... generally speaking here for a cleric with a mana pool similar to yours... so if you have 2+ groups to do, then get MGB.  <br>
<br>
Trick here, is you only need 2001 mana to use MGB on BoA, so if you have virtue and want to cast that on the MA, go ahead until you have 2001 mana remaining, then hit MGB and cast.  Don't do MGB first, then med back and do other buffs, go OOM again and med back.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(7)  Healing Adept - Type: Passive; Max - 3; Cost - 2; Requirements: Level - 55, Must spend 6 ability points in the General Abilities; This ability increases the maximum effectiveness of your healing spells by 2, 5, and 10 percent.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If you do a lot of direct healing (instead of elixers or Cheals), I recommend at some point going to lvl 1 or 2 on this.  3 is best, but sometimes if you've been in that situation where you needed just a little extra heal, this can help.  But, it's not a needed requirement at this point in the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(8 )  Bestow Divine Aura - Type: Activated, Refresh Time: 144 mins.; Max - 1; Cost - 6; Requirements: Level - 59, Must spend 12 ability points in the Archetype Abilities; This ability gives you the ability to cast a Divine Aura spell on a Player target, temporarily rendering the target invulnerable.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I've looked at this one and like it but haven't seen the point yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(9)  Mental Clarity - Type: Passive; Max - 3; Cost - 2; Requirements: Level - 55, Must spend 6 ability points in the General Abilities; This ability increases your natural mana regeneration by 1 point per ability level.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Worth getting lvl 1 or 2 if you don't group with an Enchanter a lot.  You will notice a difference.  3rd tier some say is not worth spending 6 aa's on.<br>
<br>

1)  SCF - if you want a little bit of critting action and tease the wizzies (or need a quick 2aa break from saving 5+ for these others)<br>
2)  any of the melee ones (CA, CS, ND) depending on if you get beat up a bit<br>
3)  Of course more tradeskill tannan ones<br>
<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
End result, worst thing to do is make a plan and never change it or review it.  Pick 1-2 aa's to go after now, then once done, review your mood.  Has something changed in your play/raid style?  Does something else peak your interest?<br>
<br>
For example, I never thought I'd need innate enlightenment/planar power, but through some gear upgrades I wasn't expecting, I found myself at 300 wis - with a cap of 280, so I had to stop and bank 3 aa's to boost it up to 290.  Got 2 banked atm and about to ding a 3rd now, so not sure if I want that last boost to 300 again or do something else.<br>
<br>
Always re-evaluate where you are.  Remember, your aa's are YOURS.  You might get some that are good for the guild and such, but get some that are fun for you as well...even if others scoff.<br>

<br>
Maxxing your SCM skill is a MUST for any caster. It's the single best AA we get.<br>
<br>
Divine Arbitration is also one of the best. I recommend getting at least L1 as soon as possible. At L3, it's an amazing skill, better than any other AA we get except possibly SCM3.<br>
<br>
Personally, I believe Healing Adept is a much more valuable skill than Healing Gift. It adds more healing power to EVERY heal you do. Critical heals are nice, but they're also sporadic.<br>
<br>
I also sing the praises of defensive skills like Natural Durability (raises your total hps by roughly 250-300hps) and Combat Agility (increases you chances to totally avoid hits). I've always been of the opinion that a dead cleric can't heal anyone. The longer you can stay alive, the longer you can keep healing.<br>
<br>
Crystilla and I have argued about these for a long time, but I'll mention my opinion here anyway... =P   Personally, I believe that most Class skills except MGB are very weak and not worth getting until much later. They all have their uses, but in general, the long re-use timers greatly decrease their utility. <br>
<br>
Sure, having the 100% xp and full mana rez from Divine Rez would be nice to have, but you can only use it every 36 REAL hours. For me, that makes most *other* AA abilities a greater priority than stuff like Div Rez, Celestial Regen and BDA. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://aledark.free.fr/MorkSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hinobi>Hinobi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#F7DC95>(7/30/03 3:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AA - what next?</span><hr size=1> I'll throw in my two cents also..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Spell Casting Mastery 3</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Highest priority, get it and love it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Divine Arbitration 1</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  It's only 3 points for level 1, worth getting, if for nothing else just experimenting with.  It took me a long long time to get used to it, but now I find myself using it quite a bit more, especially in zones where even exp mobs hit for anywhere from 700-1100 (Fire, Earth).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Healing Adept / Advanced Healing Adept</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> In my opinion, Adept is much better than Gift.  Adding 19% to all your heals with Advanced 3 is such a big difference.  With a Improved Healing IV or Marr's Gift/Blessing item, you're getting almost a 50% improvement on heals (sometimes).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Healing Gift / Advanced Healing Gift</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Less useful than Healing Adept, since you have to rely on the RNG for exceptional heal checks.  I'll admit a crit has helped my group come out of a pinch or maybe helped patch a tank on a raid mob doing thousands of DPS, but it's not very reliable, ESPECIALLY at low levels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natural Durability</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  A must for surviving.  I very very rarely find myself dying before going OOM.  With PoP mobs doing thousands of damage in AoEs and for the most part unavoidable, the extra 250ish hp helps a lot.  Also, getting ND3 gives a 10% bonus to all raw hp on your items.  For example, a 100hp item becomes 110hp.  It doesn't show on the item, but if you look carefully when you swap around items you'll notice.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Combat Agility/Lightning Reflexes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Another must for surviving.  When PoP mobs are hitting for over 1000 damage, avoiding the blows all together saves your life, your mana and your group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Innate Enlightenment/Planar Power</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If you stay capped on your wisdom or stamina, these are great skills to get.  Every level of IE potentially gives you 50 mana.  Every level of Planar Power potentially gives you 25mana and 5 more stamina, and more HP isn't a bad thing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Radiant Cure 1</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  For 2 points, this is one of the cheapest and most useful skills to get.  From what I've heard, level 2 and 3 of the skill don't seem to help much when trying to cure detrimental effects otherwise uncurable, which is basically what this skill is for.<br>
<br>
<br>
So those are, in my opinion, the most critical AA skills to get.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Other skills that I've gotten and the reasoning behind them:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mass Group Buff.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I raid. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A lot</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Would be stupid of me not to have this.  Other than buffing, PoP requires many MGB AoE heals.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bestow Divine Aura</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Celestial Regeneration.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I put these together because simply they belong together.  With both of these skills you can make a life saving hotkey that will put Celestial Regeneration on yourself, and then divine you... instantly.  The regeneration will defend against low HP aggro after divine drops.  This is mostly a raid function for myself, but it can be applied to groups.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Divine Ressurection</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  While an occassionaly useful tool, this was mostly just a skill I got to finish off my Exarch title.  However, this is a huge downtime saver if you have the ability to rez yourself with it.  Example:  Lets say you die in Plane of Valor at the Castle Camp.  Run back to your corpse, loot all your gear (NOT BAGS) then use Divine Rez upon yourself.  You'll come back full hp, full mana, and no rez effects ready for rebuffing and getting back to work.  (Note: If you rez yourself before looting your gear, you will be low on mana, since your gear adds far more mana than you have innately, and does not add it to your pool when looted.)<br>
Divine Rez can also be useful on raids to rez a cleric fast, or to get a rez box up instantly if you're wiping.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you actually read all that I congratulate you, but those were why I got what I did, and I don't regret any of them. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
Of course we come from different backgrounds so we SHOULD have different needs.  You raid 5x a week; I raid 1-3 times a week.  Our information requester here raids even less than I do on less difficult mobs than I do at this point so has different needs than either of us.<br>
<br>
Most clerics will agree with Mori on the class abilities.  I happen to love them because they give me more options to consider when doing my job, whether on a raid or on an exp group gone horriby horribly wrong.  When you're one of the only clerics with an &quot;opportunity&quot; to pick something to benefit the guild, it has to be looked at.  <br>
<br>
My key, Divine Rez saved a 24 person raid in HoT from complete wipe on our last raid there (we've geared up and are moving on).  End result, last 4 folks standing with 2 full heath unslowed mobs was the MA and 3 clerics who were all lom.  I Divine Rezzed the shaman in who got the mobs slowed and we won the battle.   Sure, 36 hour reuse is long and desperately want it shortened, but that means that for 2 of my 3 raids, that I do, it is up which makes it a viable tool.  Plus I generally get to use it once in between for whatever occasion.<br>
<br>
Aye, as I mentioned on the fun to have, if you get hit a lot, seriously look at the melee abilities.  I tend rarely to die with a lot of mana unless massive wipe within seconds.  It's usually only after the MA/chanter/shaman have gone down (for exp groups and almost never on a raid unless complete wipe), so for the moment I don't need to review these.<br>
<br>

Some AA abilities are much more attractive if you tend to raid a lot, while others argeared more towards more casual play.<br>
<br>
The choices you make can also be influenced by the players you normally play with. For example... no one will argue that MGB is a fantastic skill to have on a raid. BUT... when a cleric friend of mine recently returned for a long break, I advised her to skip MGB in favour of other AAs. I did so because pretty much every cleric in my guild already has MGB.<br>
<br>
In Crys' case, she got MGB early and was the only MGB cleric on her raids for a long time, so her choice to get MGB was more valuable than mine at the time.<br>
<br>
I think most anyone with a decent understanding of the cleric class will advise you to spend your next 15 AAs on SCM3 and DvA1, in whatever order you prefer to get them. <br>
<br>
After that, look us up again for more advise. =) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://aledark.free.fr/MorkSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calalily>Calalily</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rants Mod</span><br>  Posts: 943<br> <font color=#F7DC95>(7/30/03 5:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AA - what next?</span><hr size=1> Wow..thanks guys <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's given me a lot to think about.

Metab3 (Highly recommend this one - for only 3aa it is very usueful<br>

SCF1 (A bit of fun, plus you also get crit on your hammer proc - if you melee much)<br>
SCM3<br>
HG1<br>
MC2 (Will prolly do MC3 just because im gimp and dont have alot of FT available to me)<br>

DvA2 (Undeniably A must for clerics in Xp groups, I call it my chanter saver, also useful for pesky shaman's that dont self heal)<br>
RC 1 (Will prolly do 2 and 3 soon)<br>

MGB (Moving into NToV / WToV will be handy to have ability to MGB EE)<br>
DvA3<br>
RC3<br>

SCM, HA, HG, ND, CA, SCR, and CF are all very useful to eventually max out. <br>
<br>
CS is iffy, since tests have shown you don't benefit much from it until you max booth CS and its extension, ID.<br>
<br>
SCF is more of a &quot;fun&quot; skill for clerics. Not saying its not worth getting, but it doesn't really help our specialties... healing and buffing.<br>
<br>
MC... While mana regen is nice to have, most clerics I know stop at MC1 or maybe MC2. Six points for one extra point of mana regen from MC3 is a waste IMO. Even spending 4 points for MC2 seems awfully expensive for the reward. 1 extra mana regen means you can cast an extra CH every 40 mins... not much of a beneft IMO. =) <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://aledark.free.fr/MorkSig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crystilla>crystilla</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1335<br> <font color=#F7DC95>(7/31/03 1:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=202.topic&index=11>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: AA - what next?</span><hr size=1> Heh, teasing ya Mori - <br>
