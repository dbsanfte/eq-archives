He stops before the paladin guild master Valeron Dushire, and awes at the elaborate patterns on his armor and blade.<br>
<br>
           “Wow, that looks marvelous!” Karaja exclaims. “Yes, but you should not be concerned with my armor, if you are to become a paladin you must desire only to protect and serve your fellow man.” Valeron replies. <br>
<br>
           Karaja regains his composure and nods his head, “Yes sir, I do wish to become a paladin and serve the will of The Lightbringer! I will do anything to achieve my dream!” “Your enthusiasm is reassuring, I am sure you will one day be a great paladin like those you see before you.” Valeron says, gesturing to the others who had gathered around to welcome the new recruit. <br>
<br>
           Valeron rummages through a chest, and produces what appeared to be a potato sack, “Here is your training tunic, wear it proudly.” The crowd snickers quietly as Karaja puts it on, “Well ... th…thank you very much sir!” Karaja quietly grumbles as Valeron delves through the chest yet again. “Ah yes, here it is.” Valeron says, as he picks up a well-worn wooden sword. He then hands Karaja the sword and remarks, “Try not to hurt yourself with it, eh?”<br>
<br>
           The crowd claps, and then slowly disperses as Karaja saunters off. “Bah, how am I supposed to proclaim the glory of The Truthbringer with these measly playthings?” Karaja sighs, “Oh well, guess I will have to make the best of it.” he then strolls over to the cleric guild to see if his brother was faring any better.<br>
<br>
           Just then an explosion rang out from the courtyard. “GNOOOOOOME!!!” a cleric shrieked. Karaja looked around the ground, prepared for a battle with the scrawny gnomes he had heard about, but could not spot anything. “Hey, didn’t you say there was a gno...” THWACK! Karaja was hurled headfirst into a wall, and knocked unconscious.<br>
<br>
           When he awoke a few minutes later, his sight was filled with death and devastation. Somehow the gnome had all but butchered all the guards, and townspeople! He stood up and looked around, swearing to kill that “blasted short-stack”.<br>
<br>
           He then saw the gnome by some means flying through the air, searing the fleeing guards. “Ah HA! There you are!” Karaja yelled. He then leapt to his feet, and sprinted straight for the bigheaded freak. “KARAJA! NO! DON’T! STAY BACK!” Valeron shouted, but Karaja could hear nothing except his own battle cry.<br>
<br>
           “NOW YOU DIE!” Karaja screamed, leaping into the air preparing to hew the short man in twine. “Hah! Don’t make me laugh!” the gnome said as he made a gesture with his hands. “Ah! What did you do? I can’t move!” Karaja yelped, frozen in mid-air, “Put me down!” <br>
<br>
           The gnome just stood there, hovering and laughing at the man wearing a potato sack stuck floating upside down. “Oh you think this is funny eh? Well take this!” Karaja hurled his sword at the gnome. As it flew headfirst towards him, the gnome chuckled to himself, thinking he was impervious to any harm. Swiftly the sword bounced off his face, “Is that the best you can do? Hah! I knew you were a weak…AAAAHHH SPLINTER! IT’S IN MY EYE! AAH GET IT OUT GET IT OUT!!!” As the gnome thrashed about, he lost concentration of his spell and Karaja tumbled to the ground. <br>
<br>
           Seizing the opportunity, Karaja leaped to his feet and grabbed the sword of a fallen guard. “HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!! DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!!!!” Karaja cackled as he ran the gnome through, twisting it inside him for good measure.<br>
<br>
           “Oh…you will… rue the day… that you trifled… with me,” the gnome said, gasping for air. “Yeah, whatever you short freak. That will teach you to mess with the paladins of Marr!!” Karaja retorted. At that moment the gnome glowed a strange bluish color and grasped Karaja in a death clasp. “I think you will find me good company,” said the gnome, with eyes ablaze. “What the hell are you talking about?” Karaja cried. After that the gnome fell to the ground. <br>
<br>
           “No one opposes us and gets away with it!” Karaja shouted to the surviving guards. “Is that a fact?” said a voice, sounding an awful lot like the gnome. “Where are you? Show yourself coward!” Karaja screamed. “Are you alright Karaja? Who are you talking to?” said Valeron, looking slightly confused. “That gnome, he’s still here!” Karaja yelled, looking around wildly. “Uh… he’s right here boy, quite dead I might say.” Valeron said, chuckling to himself.<br>
<br>
           “Hahaha, hehehe, I’m in your mind you foolish child!” replied the voice, “And now I can use you to continue my quest! And there is nothing you can do about it! Hah! Man, I am soooo evil!” <br>
<br>
           “NO! GET OUT OF MY HEAD! GET OUT! GET OUT! AAAHHH!!” screamed Karaja flailing around. “Bah, quit your whining. I will make you the most powerful being ever to walk this land, and your complaining? Hah, your foolishness is greater than I thought, but I will turn you just yet,” chuckled the voice, <br>
<br>
           “Now we shall go to the desert of Ro to toughen you up a bit! Come on! On your feet, there’s a good lad.” Karaja screamed an unearthly cry as his eyes rolled back into the sockets, then stood flaccid and lifeless.<br>
<br>
           “Alright then! Lets go!” said the gnome, controlling Karaja’s body, “Off to the desert!”<br>
