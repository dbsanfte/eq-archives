<br>
Sunmoon, I dont' know you but...I dont' see any proof of what you are saying...This all I have learned from your posts.<br>
<br>
1.  You accuse others of ebaying and yet offer no proof.  And then ask others to beleive you are not ebayed despite the proof others have provided.<br>
<br>
2.  You schedule raids and expect the community to respect them...but you yourself donot respect other schedules.<br>
<br>
3.  You give a list of players (without names)..and then expect us to beleive that this list is proof that those players you names are ebayed but if this is proof.. then isn't this also proof that you have ebayed characters as well.<br>
<br>
So what is it Sunmoon....if these other players are ebayed based on your proof then you are as well.  You cannot exposed them without exposing yourself.<br>
<br>
Bah....I dont' really care anymore...Sunmoon and his posts are now on /ignore. <p>Wilerian<br>

Sunmoon, I stuck up for you at one point actually.  Ask Karthanon.  I also posted here, that of the people who posted to my message board, none of you shared the same IP addy.  I didn't lie about it.<br>
<br>
But, how can showing a link that encompasses all auctions on playerauctions that were completed be proof that someone ebayed?  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1052275909" target="top">This link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is proof that Izelin ebayed.  Your link is just showing that some people are trying to sell leveling services, accounts, plat, fungi tunics, etc.  Your link is generic.  My link is quite specific.  <br>
<br>
So, in all fairness, show the people you accussed of the links showing where they ebayed or playerauctioned, etc.  The specific link to the specific auction, showing all the details, not some generic link that just show finished auctions, whether they were successful or not.<br>
<br>
You are only making yourself look worse here, and quite honestly, I didn't think that was possible.<br>
<br>

I have done the same thing.  I provided links to prove all of those that have ebayed.  No difference from what you are prooving in terms of Izelin.<br>

So, if no names are mentioned, how do you know the people you said bought their accounts from others actually did so?<br>
<br>
And, to clarify, bought their accounts that already contained characters on them that had been previously played by someone outside of their household (hope that is technical enough).<br>

<br>
As long as we all live by the same rules, it's fine with me how we do things.  Not everyone on the server knows about scheduling of raids.  This is something that the readers of this message board know about.  Others that play the game on the server without knowledge of what goes on here do not know what changes are in store by Fimble and his band of lunatics.<br>

Umm, actually, any changes made to the rules are done by the guild leaders, or those who are here representing their guild.  In the Guild Leader forum, which you have to apply for, and which is checked out very carefully before access is given.  It's not just Fimble and all the mods who suddenly say &quot;gee, let's make this zone reservable&quot;..it's done by majority vote.<br>
<br>
And everyone is aware that no one can force anyone to honor the calendar...but MT, as a whole, tends to be respective....even those who don't go here....I doubt there are many guilds who don't have at least one person who doesn't come to these boards.<br>
<br>
But still....please, you have yet to answer, how do you know those auctions you listed were the specific players you claim they are?  We are all still waiting.  Yes, we are all this dumb, we need you to show us exactly which one is which, and to whom bought or sold the accounts you say they did.<br>

Who did Izelin say that he ebayed to?  Did you speak to him on the phone?  Or is there a post here made by him?  I see no proof of this.<br>
<br>
By the way, in case you don't know it, if someone doesn't say they have ebayed, it doesn't mean they did or not.  Take for example the ebayers here that are claiming they didn't buy their accounts.  How can you prove they didn't?<br>

Oh, let's see here, Fimble is the administrator of this message board and along with him, there are moderators that he has appointed who can remove messages, etc.  Along with that, Fimble and ban players from this message board altogether.  These actions removes rights from players on Morell-Thule which are not sanctioned by Sony Online Entertainment.  In fact, nothing on these message boards are sanctioned by them.  Therefore, you can post whatever you want and say that it is by vote, etc.  You don't have the rules of the game by no means governed here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=erradicatedthoughts>Erradicated Thoughts</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1934<br> <font color=#628CBC>(6/4/03 11:42 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Oh, he SAID he ebayed.....  yea right!  :)</span><hr size=1> WTS Level 60 Wizard with several AA and some decent gear.

You are right.  You keep saying you have never bought an account....yet too many people believe otherwise, and you can't convince them otherwise.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Take for example the ebayers here that are claiming they didn't buy their accounts. How can you prove they didn't?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How can you prove they did?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also..let's see. On your guild, you have a guild full of people who the current owners are not the original owners/players.  Unless you also have a guild full of people who underwent major personality changes to be just like you.<br>
<br>
People report that no one in your guild groups with others.  When one Evil Raider is on, they all are.....never one or two on at different times of the day.  All walk in a straight line, one following the other, always on auto follow, no matter what.  Heck, I saw once where you led them all, slowly, around corners, stopping so everyone was sure to catch up.    There are quite a number of other reasons why people think you bought all your characters that are in your guild.  I'm sure if you re-read the post, you will see many of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, as for Karthanon?  You accused him of being ebayed.  Or bought.  Well, please, since he's in my guild, I'd like to know when this happened, and where the proof is?  I'm not against people who ebay (if they own up to it), but I am curious.  I don't much like people who lie, so if Karthanon is indeed lying, please show me the proof that he ebayed.  Otherwise I suggest you redo your list and leave him off of it.  And all the others.  And stick your name on it.<br>
<br>
Sunmoon, you dance around questions, refusing to answer.  Instead, you throw out more accusations at others, you try to go off on tangents....but the bottom line is, when you play as many characters as you do, you can't control all of them at once.  As is obvious.  You end up training people, stealing camps, etc, because you are so busy getting your merry band of characters to wherever, that you can't handle it all.  Kudo's to being able to 5 or 6 box once you get to said camp...but it's getting there that is causing you problems it seems.<br>
<br>

Still waiting for you to explain Truyth to us. Don't think you can, but I like seeing your delusional ramblings. Reminds me of a guy in college who was as messed up as you seem (if not more) who was convinced he fought in World War II and he was a British Lord..of course, he was in his late 20's (this was in '96)...<br>

The half-elf ranger is the one you bought!  That is how you were able to go from level 38 to a different character that is level 52 so quickly.<br>

<br>
Ok, Sunmoon.   So let me get this straight.  Karthanon has a warrior who is lvl 38.  He has a ranger who just recently dinged 52.  Therefore, he's obviously ebayed becuase he got to 52 so quickly?  Umm...first off, define quickly?  Cause Karthanon (and alts) have been in my guild for...oh, at least 6 months...at least.  Longer I think.  So going from 38 to 52 in 6 months is fast?  ROFL<br>
<br>
And....sorry, no rangers in that link you gave us as proof that karth ebayed.  Try again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Just save yourself here...admit you haven't the proof you claim you have.  Say it was a different personality...heck, go see Thorena on how to handle all the different personalities...I'm sure it has some good pointers for you.  But for the love of God, quit posting all these lies.<br>
<br>
And quit evading...come up with exact links showing the exact auction where the person sold their account (not a generic link), or STFU.<br>

Where's the level 52 half-elf ranger on that list you're showing? There isn't one. So, there goes your 'proof' that I bought that character, for one thing. Don't pass GO, go back to multiboxing, thanks for playing.<br>
<br>
Still waiting on your explanation of Truyth...and waiting..and waiting...thanks for helping me pad my post count, by the way. Soon I'll catch up to Shorrty!<br>
