So what point did I miss Cad?  The fact that people get &quot;heartbroken&quot; when others just don't feel like typing words like &quot;you are&quot; and use &quot;yer&quot; instead?  Or maybe some people that like to &quot;personalize&quot; and be unique by changing spellings like &quot;ubah&quot; instead of &quot;uber&quot;.<br>
<br>
Me think a.ssholes all you are.<br>
<br>
Is that my Yoda impression, or an example of a person that has learned english as a second, or third language?  If I created a completely new ezboard name and posted like that, half the morons in this post throwing fits over grammar would be jumping down my throat, with absolutely no clue what the background of the poster is.<br>
<br>
See, the fact is very simple.  This is the &quot;cesspool&quot;.  Welcome to it.  Few people come around here that I would give any credit to for having intelligence.  I'll say &quot;yer&quot; all the hell I want here because I am not giving a presentation in front of an auditorium full of scientists or military brass.  I have no one to impress here.

I don't care who does and who does not speak English as a first language.  Frankly, it doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
As it happens, I speak French.  My written French leaves a great deal to be desired.  When I write in French, I expect to be corrected at length, and it doesn't bother me when it happens.<br>
<br>
And yes, when I write in French, it reduces the value of what I am trying to say because it is difficult for me to convey the message.  Taken out of context, my French writing would indicate to the reader that I am not literate in that language... which is startlingly accurate.<br>
<br>
All that aside, it is my firm belief that more than 90+% of the people who write here are North American or British, and the bulk of those are from the United States and have no excuse.  You have free education.<br>
<br>
I don't expect people to write PhD-level prose, but what you write IN ANY FORUM should not look like an excerpt from a monkey and typewriter session, and yes, I will think less of you if that is what your writing looks like.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>For those people that had a rough upbringing here in the good ol' US of A and were part of a terrible education system or they have a learning disability - email them asking for their address so you can send them money so they can go take some English courses if it bothers you so much.

<br>
Rough upbringing doesn't make you illiterate.  Not paying attention in school - that place where the taxpayers send your sorry arse for 9 months of the year for 13 years - is where illiteracy comes from if you're in the good ol' US of A.<br>
<br>
You don't have to be a Pulitzer prize winner to write something that makes you look like you at least WENT to public school.<br>

<br>
Believe it or not, it's second nature to many people to just see when someone is literate or not. It's blindingly obvious when someone is making a typo, or is truly unable to put 10 words together in a coherent manner. To me, someone who is obviously lacking in a thirst for knowledge is as unattractive as someone who is visually repulsive. <br>
<br>
Language is one of the things that separate us from the primates. Using it effectively and intelligently makes all the difference in someone's life. It's my right to feel a certain way about someone based on whether they have a vocabulary of more than 50- as it is for you to prefer a blonde over a brunette, or like the sound of a certain accent.  Hell, you can't change your true hair colour... but you can sure change the fact you can't spell. It's not the lack of literacy that is so heartbreaking as it is the total lack of concern some people show for the fact that they can't express themselves intelligently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But you go ahead championing the downtrodden or whatever it is you are doing. But this is one case where these &quot;poor souls&quot; bring it all on themselves. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Knowledge is free.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Hell, I see homeless people sitting on the corners here in San Francisco with their only possession being a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>book</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and their cup. <br>
<br>
An adult who cannot express themselves to the level of 5th grade english and DOESN'T CARE is the heartbreaking issue. Not the adult who may have an handicap or severe disability that does not allow them to overcome this. Because outside this little forum about a little game is the Real World. And the Real World will judge you ten times more harshly based on things much worse than whether or not you can spell or write a resume. <br>

You're painting yourself as some hero of the working class out of a bad Stallone movie right now and not getting the point. <br>

I now have a Ph.D.  Don't cry to me about your rough upbringing and how it's the educational system's fault that you're functionally illiterate.  <br>
<br>
Here are some facts:<br>
<br>
*If you make threads criticizing people for correcting other people's grammar and generally expecting at least a 6th-grade writing level to be present in a text-based communications medium, you're an idiot.<br>
<br>
*If your primary means of communication in a given situation is the written word, and you fail to put forth even the most cursory effort to make your writing appear to be well-constructed and coherent, you're an idiot, and will be judged by your peers as such.<br>
<br>
*If you revel in your ignorance, and angrily lash out against anyone who calls you an ignoramus, you're an idiot.<br>
<br>
*If you blame the public school system, your parents, society-at-large, God, the military industrial complex, etc. etc. ad infinitum for your own laziness and utter lack of motivation to learn the language into which you were born, you're not only an idiot, you're also lazy and you subscribe to a victim mentality.<br>
<br>
*If you're trying to out-rant someone, the effect of your caustic barbs and petty insults will be decreased exponentially for every spelling or grammatical error present in your rant.  Ultimately this will probably serve to prove correct whatever opinion the person you're trying to rant expressed about you in the first place.<br>
<br>
*If you find yourself constantly trying to justify your intelligence level with ridiculous proclamations like &quot;just because I don't tyep good Englsih doesnt mean Im not smart,&quot; you're an idiot, and you're every bit as dumb as you've been accused of being--you're also delusional.<br>
<br>
*Lastly, and most importantly:  the inability to competently write or speak the English language is nothing to be ashamed of, IF you're mature enough to realize your limitations and strive to improve your ability.  True students NEVER stop learning, and never completely rule someone else's opinions out--the willingness to better yourself, coupled with the maturity to recognize your own flaws and strive to constantly improve yourself are the marks of a truly intelligent person.  <br>
<br>
So the next time someone corrects your grammar, maybe you should consider taking their criticism to heart and LEARNING.  Otherwise, you're an idiot.<br>

Sorry Neff, it's not the point I am missing.  See where the confusion lies is, as Cad so put it, is that ya'll are going after the people that intentionally type in a way that isn't considered by and large &quot;proper&quot;.  However, the problem is, while you think yer trying to &quot;learn em good&quot;, yer also attacking others that don't fall into the category of &quot;lazy internet typers&quot;, those being foreigners to English.<br>
<br>
Like I said, you don't KNOW everyone's backgrounds.  They could be French or Asian, or they could be a freaking retard with a bib to collect the uncontrollable drool but managed to boot a computer.  Ya sure everyone here knows a few people, and us &quot;old timers&quot; that have been here awhile can make safer assumptions about the typing styles and capabilities of each other.  You still don't know each and every poster.<br>
<br>
Hero?  Screw it.  I'll attack everyone and anyone on here.  I fill the villian role nicely.  At least when I attack someone it's more along the lines of actions or beliefs and not along the lines of grammer vs grammar, coma vs semi-colon.  <br>
<br>
See, what does it matter how they type it?  If ya understood what they said, then regardless of what you might believe, the communication was delievered.  Online, that's all that really matters because to most posters here, nothing else matters other then that.<br>
<br>
Are you that blind?  People say I am egotistical but sheeesh.  This is the epitamy.  &quot;You don't use proper english in your internet commincations to me stranger, so you suck!  However, if you gank AoW or Stormfeather and can type a coherent sentance, you're suitable to talk to me.&quot;<br>

So let's step this rant up a bit.  Since you MENSA cry babies are b.itching about adults not utilizing proper communication skills suitable to your demands - tell us who.

I have a hard time believing Wilerian didn't misspell &quot;grammar&quot; on purpose.  Throwing chum to the grammar sharks out of boredom?<br>
<br>
Isn't that like a 3rd grade vocabulary word?  Sure, grammar is complex and making mistakes doesn't necessarily mean that you are dumb.  But misspelling grammar does, no matter how casual the forum.<br>

<br>
There's a huge difference.  <br>
<br>
For instance, in Drack's post, he uses the word &quot;epitamy.&quot;  Now, I *know* he means to say &quot;epitome,&quot; and I know he knows what the word means, so there's no point in correcting him here.  However, if he were coming at me here like, say, Estephe seems to revel in doing, I'd be all over him like white on rice, because, like it or not, it's a sign of weakness, and in a rant forum, weakness=death.  However, I'm guessing that, based on my half-a$$ed psychological profile of Drack's personality, he'll probably read this and commit the proper spelling to memory, because he's not stupid, and doesn't like being perceived as such.  I could absolutely be off-base, but I doubt it.  <br>
<br>
Here's another example...for the longest time I thought the latin expression &quot;ad hominem&quot; was spelled &quot;ad homonym.&quot;  A simple mistake, and certainly an esoteric phrase, but still one that I was ignorant of--UNTIL someone corrected me.  I've never made it since, and regardless of what their intention may have been, I'm *glad* that they set me straight, because there's just no way to convince me that being ignorant is somehow &quot;cool.&quot;  <br>
<br>
If being corrected for improper grammar makes you so upset that you fume about it in a Rants forum, then maybe you should consider taking the corrections to heart.  I hate to sound like some contrite motivational speaker, but knowledge really is power, kids. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vermikmt>Vermik MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/14/03 2:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1039.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Grammer snobs</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You still don't know each and every poster.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well, we do know something about Wilerian.<br>
<br>
How many times in this thread have posters mentioned that he misspelled &quot;grammar&quot;.  In his subsequent posts, did he spell it right?  He's obviously read those posts because he is responding to them.  <br>
<br>
For him to continue to misspell grammar, suggests that as Ayerish pointed out, he is reveling in his idiocy.  <br>

First of all, a snob is someone who completely dismisses any kind of constructive criticism (such as grammar and spelling) because he or she is so self-righteous that they're incapable of realizing when they're wrong.

12-year-olds who are illiterate should most certainly NOT be spending much time in Everquest, lest they end up like you as adults.
