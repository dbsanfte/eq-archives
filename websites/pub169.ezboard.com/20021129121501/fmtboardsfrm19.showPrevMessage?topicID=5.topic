Some comments, general and specific. <br>
<br>
Many things affect Aggro. <br>
<br>
1. Actual damage done, and how quickly. <br>
2. Possible damage that could be done, again how quickly. <br>
3. Amount of hit points. The lower the more aggro. <br>
4. The level of your character/pet. Again, the lower the more aggro. <br>
5. Distance from Mob. The farther your are, the less aggro you generate. <br>
6. Sitting = aggro generation. <br>
7. Debuffs generate aggro. (snare is included in this) <br>
8. Healing a party member (but not pets) generates aggro. <br>
9 Being at 2 bubbles of health = aggro generator. Being at 1 bubble of health = HUGE aggro generator. This aggro disappears however once your health rises above these levels. <br>
10. The Taunt skill. <br>
<br>
Root of course throws this all out the window. <br>
<br>
1 and 2 both explain why faster weapons generate more aggro than slower weapons even if the slower weapons has a greater damage per minute probability. Also, a 1 damage hit will generate almost as much aggro as a 100 damage hit due to the possibility of the weapon doing more damage. <br>
<br>
Generalized Pet aggro generation <br>
-------------------------------- <br>
Some of the taunt the pet generates is also added to the pet owners on the hate list. You will notice this frequently in places like Velketors. If you send in a Pet while Sitting down the mob will immediately aggro on you if you do it too soon. IE - you are getting aggro from just sitting down. Plus you are getting added aggro for 1-pet attacking it and 2-pet taunting it if it taunts. Even if you don't have the pet taunting just the fact that it is attacking is adding some hate to you. <br>
<br>
For non BST pets, the amount of hate added to the pet owner appears to be very significant. IE - my Necromancer 59th pet cannot hold aggro on it's own with some mobs. IE - the mobs will always chase me even if I do absolutely nothing except /pet attack. <br>
<br>
BST pet specific Aggro rules <br>
---------------------------- <br>
First, I'm not sure how much aggro is transfered to the Pet owner in this case. It may or may not be the same as regular pets. But it is hard to tell for sure since the BST pets opperate on a different aggro management ruleset. This is all based on having /pet taunt on. <br>
<br>
1. The mob will always aggro on someone other than the pet if it is in melee range of the mob. IE - it is not necessary to out taunt the pet. <br>
<br>
2. This rule appears to be broken if there are 2 pets, especially if there are 2 or more BST pets and if the mob is engaged in a certain order. At which point you actually have to out-taunt the pet to gain aggro even if in melee range. As a BST it is difficult to out aggro the pet, especially if it is taunting. <br>
<br>
3. If you are NOT in melee range of the mob. The mob will maintain aggro on your pet unless you or someone else SIGNIFICANTLY out taunts the pet. As a BST this is impossible. However if another caster generates enough aggro from spellcasting then it is possible for the mob to break from the pet and aggro that caster, same as with a warrior. However it is unlike a warrior in that the Pet can taunt mobs that are RED to it much better than a Warrior can taunt a mob that is RED to him/her. Also, instead of just being plain old #1 on the mobs hate list to gain aggro from a BST pet, it appears that not only must you be higher than the pet on the Hate list, but you must exceed the amount of Hate points the pet has by a certain amount before the mob will break from the pet. Unlike Warriors where as soon as you have more hate points than the warrior, the mob will aggro on you. <br>
<br>
4. If your health drops to 1 bub or lower. It's pretty like that even if you try to move out of melee, the mob will not stick to your pet. In a case like this, Flash of Light comes in handy. It will make the mob unable to follow you out of melee range, allowing it to stick to whatever is still in Melee, IE - your pet. <br>
<br>
The parts on the BST are pure speculation on my part at this time. But appears to be valid from my experiences. <br>
<br>
I can honestly see no reason to turn /pet taunt off. If there is something in melee (IE - Main Warrior in a raid for example) the coding of the BST pet means that the mob will automatically turn to whatever non-pet is in melee with the highest hate. It is possible that it &quot;might&quot; turn on another pet however if it has higher hate than the Warrior. In this case, yes, you may way to turn /pet taunt off. <br>
<br>
However having it on in EXP groups is good. As if the warrior needs to back out of combat for some reason, he should be able to. And whether you have /pet taunt on or off, the mob will still turn on your if you are in melee and nothing else is other than your pet. However having /pet taunt on will allow you to back out of combat if needed. <br>
<br>
My recommendation? /pet taunt on always unless there is a reason to turn it off. And other than in raids, I don't really see one. <br>
<br>
What is definitely true though is aggro management on our pets is absolutely and completely NOT like regular pets. <br>
<br>

I'll also add that as an enchanter, I've reverse-kited many times with great success (SoW is needed, though). I can easily grab taunt from my pet, then run around in circles while the pet does all the work and stays healthy. This may not seem to apply much to a beastlord, but if your health drops below 1 bub and you're all out of mana, you can pull the same stunt. I've done this a few times already with my BST and it works great. <p><p align="center"><a href="http://pub75.ezboard.com/btheshoemakers"><img src="http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/fimble_transparent.gif" alt="Fimble Fetishists!" align="center" border="0"></a><BR>email: <a href="mailto:FimblePiddlebitz@hotmail.com">FimblePiddlebitz@hotmail.com</a><BR>AIM: FimbleMT</p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19.showPrevMessage?topicID=7.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19.showNextMessage?topicID=7.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://sevendragons.net/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19.threadControl?topicID=7.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm19>Beastlord</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
