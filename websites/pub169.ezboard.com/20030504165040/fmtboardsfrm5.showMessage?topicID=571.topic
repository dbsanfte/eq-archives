<br>
Apologies for the long-winded novel.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am opposed to this and all wars in principle. I do not like violence and prefer it remain a symbolic representation on my monitor in the form of a game. War brings death, disease, destruction, sacks economies, and makes victims of soldiers, non-combatants, and residents of the contested territories. William Tecumseh Sherman's succinct observation on war puts it best, in no uncertain terms; War is Hell. War is the gravest undertaking of a nation of peoples who vie with opposing political or economic wills of other nations. It is, rightly so, the most devastating human endeavor to inflict on our ecology. It should be avoided with all possible efforts. <br>
<br>
All that said, it is naive to believe that pure, unvarnished pacifism is the solution to world problems. Human nature is capable of incredible feats and noble efforts. Just as folks like Nelson Mandela, Ghandi, Mother Theresa, and countless others, exhibit the apogee of our nature and all that can be found good with us, so it is with the other end of the spectrum. Saddam Hussein, Adolf Hitler, Stalin, Slobodan Milosevic, and countless others, have shown us the darkest side of human nature. They indeed have shown us that victims of war, corrupt power, and tyranny do not need to bear arms in conflict. Indeed, they have shown us time and time again that the victims of violence and abuse only need to live, walk, and breathe as free peoples. Anyone of us could have been born, were it for fate or chance of our ancestors, under these cruel leaders. Some of us even have family members or relatives who experienced, first-hand, the horrors of such aggression and violence. The elders of the nation of Israel understand and remember with terrible clarity the ruthlessness of a regime, and the annihilation of a people. These elders also remember the liberation of the camps, many by American GIs who were appalled and disgusted with the conditions they found. Some of our grandfathers may remember well the emaciated souls they found at such horror chambers as Dachau. What will their grandsons find in the outreaches of Baghdad?<br>
<br>
Thus, in the midst of noble efforts of opposition and vociferous dissent with war and violence, war is visited to us once again. The leaders of this nation have determined that is in the interest and the safety of our nation and its allies to loose the mightiest military power in world history on a regime that is, by all accounts, most brutal and dangerous to regional neighbors and the people the regime rules over. A regime that has invaded its neighbors, raped, murdered, gassed, beaten, repressed, and caned its very own citizens. <br>
<br>
There are things just as horrific as war, as any Kuwaiti, Jew, American, German, Muslim, Russian, Croat, Serb, Sikh, Shiite, Somali, South African, Iraqi, Tutsi, Bosnian, Japanese, Manchurian, Kurd, Viet Cong, Korean, Cambodian, ad infinitum, who has experienced such horrors, will tell you. There are things that exist in the absence of war that are just as cruel and terrible. As such, it is sometimes necessary to confront those would would do harm with power, since power is the language of tyrants. To demur from the violent is reckless and encourages them to seize more power. A Czech who remembers 1938 will certainly understand this. <br>
<br>
Thus the die is cast. The time for debate is passed, the task has been passed to our military, a military that is comprised of all volunteers. Our brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, husbands, wives, cousins, friends, and neighbors, all chose to serve and wage war on our behalf, all of whom understand, quite so, that war is the last act they wish to engage in. They understand, perhaps better than most, that combat is deadly earnest and much less preferable to a bar-b-que with the family. But they go in our stead and with our prayers, in spite of the fear, terror, and with letters we send them, all asking, &quot;When are you coming home?&quot;<br>
<br>
I come from a long line of those who know and understand war. My father, who died in 1991, was an unfortunate German combatant in WWII, who faced off against Russian snow troopers and American GIs up to the end, as a youngster of 17 years, who was caught up in the hopeless last defense of a dying nation. Captured and sent to a Soviet camp, he survived the bitter cold, disease, and inhuman conditions to emigrate to this nation, to seek and live in peace, because he understood what it was to wage war. My mother remembers to this day the sounds of bombs falling from Allied planes over northern Germany, and watching her town burn to ashes. She remembers, when she was very young, what happened in Germany during Crystal Night. To this day she remembers what hunger is and keeps the pantry loaded with enough food to feed a family for weeks, even though she now lives alone. She also emigrated here to find peace and prosperity, to raise her children in a place where food is plentiful and no war comes. My eldest brother emigrated here and found war in Viet Nam, serving our country and the interests of an administration that did not fully comprehend the consequences of limited actions against an entrenched guerilla enemy. He witnessed first-hand the horrors and tragedy of war, the sleepless nights and moments of sheer terror when the bullets flew. He prefers peace. As it was my turn, in Daharan, then in Riyadh, watching the SCUDS come in, terrified that gas attacks were underway, donning MOPP gear day and night, seeing the destruction left behind by the Iraqis as they left Kuwait fleeing coalition bombs, ordnance, and troops, seeing the pall of burning oil wells turning the noon into night, hearing the stories of Kuwaitis of the brutatity of an ill-educated, abusive 'military' force, eating sandy MREs, sleepless nights of watch, and the bodies... the many bodies... <br>
<br>
I live now in peace, in the US, because I am fortunate enough to have had a family that survived and made the choices to come here and live in peace. I am fortunate because I live in a country that does not kill me or its citizens for voicing opposition to war. I am fortunate to have served in the greatest all-volunteer military force ever, and am fortunate to have seen the trauma of a nation that suffered under war and brutality. I am fortunate because I have seen the awesome and terrible specter of war and violence, which has taught me to respect our nation, with all its problems and differences, and debates. We have many issues that remain at hand; racism, ignorance, intolerance, indifference, and countless other issues. But at least we have the means, resources, and Constitution to address those issues in a civil format, in a place where we do not have to die to erradicate these problems. <br>
<br>
To all those who are serving and involved in this struggle; you have my prayers and support. I know you are under capable leadership and understand the task before you. Please wear your Kevlar, keep your helmets on, and please write home when you can. Come home soon, you are missed. <br>
<br>
To all of those who remain behind - Please continue to voice your concerns to your elected leaders. Do your duty and vote. Oblige yourselves to ask our representatives the questions that need to be asked - what are you doing, where are you sending our troops, what's the issue at hand, when can we expect this to be done, have they been cared for, have you done everything you could to avoid war, have you done everything you could to prepare for war, have you a plan to bring our soldiers home... <br>
<br>
Keep your representatives well aware that the task of war is most serious and should be held with sobriety and awe, and that the price of failure is the blood of someone who you may know, whom you may have shared many afternoons with in your backyard, having some beers, and discussing the point spread in the next Magic game and not the weighty matters of war, peace, and death...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Maybe this isn't one, but maybe it is.<br>
<br>
Saddam is a bad person; maybe the good of removing him will overwhelm the bad of having to do it.<br>
<br>
Is one person's life worth a 1000?  Saddam has killed 5000 kurds, and that's only the kurds.<br>
<br>
Part of being a soldier is putting yourself in front of others who, for whatever reason, can't.<br>
<br>
Soldiers give up their freedom so other's can be free.  Sometimes that goes for their lives, too.  <br>
<br>
Maybe it isn't right.  But, maybe,just maybe, some little boy or girl will be able to look up at the sky and dream a dream Saddam would never have permitted him to live.<br>
