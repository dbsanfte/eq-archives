Well guess what I DON'T agree so you can not say everyone.  Do I have a cleric? YES.  Is she above 46? YES. Is she an Alt? YES. Do I have a voice in this? I believe EVERYONE does, I believe so becuase anyone can start a cleric and get to epic level.<br>
<br>
Should something be done at Verants end to speed things up? I deffinitely think so.<br>
<br>
No-one is going to read this but here goes -<br>
- You can't predict what FFA will be like becuase it has never happening.  We are a completely different community then any other in EQ. Yes there will be arguments but no more stupid ones than we have now. Will we desolve into anarchy and flick the switch and turn MT into a PvP server? Not on your life.<br>
- I put forth that if RF remains on rotation that Faydedar (Druid), Shissar(Chanter), Magi P'tasa (Mage), Sev (Warrior), Gore (Bard), General (Rogue) and others all go to lists also. I would have said VS for Wiz but he is already BUT for a whole different reason, so I say move him to a list by Wiz instead of guild.<br>
- FFA will be there to make sure that the majority who get their epics will be heavy players in the community.  As of now all you need to do is buy up someone on the list when they leave the game or get your Alt on the list and bam you get your epic handed to you, it may take a bit of time but you'll get it.<br>
<br>
I liken this situation to a  quote from &quot;A Knights Tale&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;How did the nobles become noble in the first place ........  They took it ..... at the point of a sword.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This doesn't mean ganking, it means using your strengths and resourcefulness to came out on top in a knightly manner.  The epics are meant to be a status symbol, this list cheapens that status.  Instead of a cleric saying &quot;Yes I rallied my guild together in record time and we worked like a well oiled machine to react faster than those who opposed us&quot; the only thing you get is &quot;Yeah, my time has come to be your rez B*tch come help me&quot;<br>
<br>
If you don't wish to at least try FFA for a short period of time to see how much you hate it, than at least look into these lottery schemes people have suggested.  Why not have a chance for a cleric at the bottom of the list to rise up in the ranks.  It will give them hope of getting there epic before hell freezes over.<br>
<br>
P.S. These are my own personal thoughts and have nothing to do with my guild in the list.<br>
<br>
P.P.S.  We'll see what happens when my cleric gets to this point in her epic. <p><table><tr><td><select name="GeddineChars" size="1" style="background-color: Green; color: White; font-size: xx-small; font-style: normal; font: Verdana;"><option selected>Baroness Geddine   -=-   60th Halfling Heirophant<option>Luminae   -=-   46th High Elven Cleric<option>Synndic   -=-   41st Half Elven Ranger<option>Sukan   -=-   30th Vah Shir Bard</select><br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=58538 target=_blank>Baroness Geddine</a>       <a href=http://dm-mt.dynu.com>Desperate Measures</a><br><img src="http://dm-mt.dynu.com/pics/sigpic.jpg" ><br>"Of all the things I've lost,<br> I miss my mind the most"</td><td>&nbsp</td><td><a href="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.gaijindesign.com/lawriemalen/jedi/anakin.jpg" width="285" height="123" border="0"><br>:: how jedi are you? ::</a></td></table>

These mobs don't need to go on rotation.  There are not huge backlogs of people waiting for them, and guilds ready to destroy each other for the spawn. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74028"target=new>Neuro the Strategist</a><BR>

I have seen many arguments on both sides, and my opinion is that it should stay on rotation.  Yes, something (don't know what) needs to change.  We do need to either spam VI to get the spawn rate increased, shorten the time before it goes to the next cleric on the list (say 2 hours rather than 3), or something that hasn't even been discussed or something that got discarded before the idea is fully developed.  Cleric's are one of the few classes, that whenever an Epic Mob is up, it drops what we need.  I know people who have killed their mob's over and over and it hasn't dropped.  <br>
<br>
Yes the list is frelling long, but here is a question for you all...CAN YOU STAY UP FOR UP TO 7 DAYS WITH NO SLEEP???  That is the maximum he can normally take to spawn.  I don't know about the rest of you, I can't do that.  I would rather be awake to fight such a mob, and have everyone with me awake, that way no mistakes will be made (yes deaths will occur fighting such mobs, but this way there are down a lot more rather than having people at the keyboard half asleep fighting).  Yes it sucks that the list is so long, but I would rather have to wait on a list, then have it yanked 5 min before my force comes along to help.  I have seen how some of the people (not all and not the majority, but enough) are when it comes to loot and mobs, I would rather not have to fight just to complete something that takes a very long time to complete.<br>
<br>
And for those of you that are complaining that clerics have it so easy for their epic, some of us go out of their way to rez someone...even if they are halfway around Norrath, with no thought for what we will get out of it (though donations are always nice).<br>
<br>
Just for everyone's information, I still have a long way to go before I am on this list.  I really don't like the idea of having to wait over a year or two before I can finally get my epic, but I would rather have to wait than fight everyone on the server for it.  Yes I do have alts, but my cleric will always be my main.<br>
<br>
Well, just my 2cp worth<br>

<br>
As it has been said, most people who want FFA really don't understand it.   IF ragefire goes FFA, here is what is going to happen.  <br>
<br>
REV/TRI/FE/FOV/TW <br>
<br>
Will have Ragefire watched literally 24/7.  When he pops it will most definitely be one of those guilds getting the kill.  FE will probably get the most being they have the most resources, and manpower.<br>
<br>
What does that mean, the other clerics, and other guilds will not get to touch ragefire.  Until these 5 guilds get all they need out of it.  <br>
<br>
I am not going to vote on his, just stating a fact, the Rotation does give the lesser powered guilds, a chance.  This isnt anyones decision but the clerics.  But just wanted to note this information to you all.<br>

If you vote Yes to this, you are voting to get rid of the Ragefire rotation permanetly. This is just the opening FFA supporters need to say 'Screw the Rotation' and if this vote passes, they will the second that month is up and those not in a guild who can spare people to watch for Ragefire 24/7, and get the forces up, buffed, and attacking in 10 minutes will not get their epic for a very, very long time, unless they can convince a guild who can to help them. <br>
And Sol and such are right, experimenting on this is redundant. <br>
It's like jumping off a 5 story building to see if you can fly. It's been done before, and you aren't gunna get a different result then *SPLAT*<br>
I don't see how this rotation can be improved, Verant needs to step up and raise the rate of spawns. <br>

<br>
FE only has 1-2 clerics who still need RF. So ok, say we grabbed the first two spawns. Then I highly doubt we'd ever touch him again. Maybe once in a blue moon if a new app needed it.<br>
<br>
What reasons does that leave? Farming him for cash? Why? We have lots of pp in the guild bank. To spite &quot;the little guys&quot;? Why would we pick up and leave a raid just to beat some unguilded cleric to the punch?<br>
<br>
All you'd see if he went completely FFA would be the big guilds grab a few RFs each, then be outta the picture. IE. He's inaccessible for a couple months, then it's open to anyone with the forces and the interest. A couple months is a lot quicker than waiting over a year.<br>
<br>
I'm not really a FFA advocate, just saying that I think your assessment is way off-base. =) <p>        <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567">Morinkhan</a><br>

<br>
People join new guilds all the time, and it could be forseeable that making him FFA will force clerics to continuously join a larger guild if they want their epic, therefore a steady stream of clerics could come through again and again once they hit the min level requirement for those guilds.<br>
<br>
And on a different note, that although it's true, I positively <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>hate</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> hearing is something to the lines of - we'll roll over and let the uber guilds get their fill and then when they're done, we can start fighting each other for the scraps months down the road.  It can apply to any of the rants, not just RF debate.  <br>
<br>
I know it's true, I know it's what might/would/does happen, but I just hate thinking thinking of myself as a second hand citizen hehe.  And no, I'm not joining a higher guild.  I'm perfectly happy right where I am, so I am partially to &quot;blame&quot; for this predicament, but man, I just had to get that off my chest hehe....<br>

My point: I don't think FE would monopolize the spawn, there's no real point in it for us.<br>
<br>
For your point to be valid, FE would have to monopolize the spawn, thus the only way for anyone else to ever get their epic would be to join FE.<br>
<br>
If there's 5 &quot;uber guilds&quot; on MT, each guild needing an average of 3-4 epics, that's 2-3 months before all the top guilds are completely epified. Then it's wide open for the smaller guilds. Isn't waiting 2-3 months for a chance at your epic better than a guaranteed year+? <p>        <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567">Morinkhan</a><br>

Didn't Neuro say that FE could sit on Ragefire because the Heart can be MULTIQUESTED? I need to go find that quote somewhere...<br>
<br>
Fury's Edge may have a lot of cash in the bank, but... Cummon. 200-300kpp for the MQ, plus all the Nagafen loot that drops from him too? That is a lot of money. 300kpp is an *insane* amount of platinum.<br>
<br>
Frankly, I salute Fury's Edge for NOT forcing this to go FFA by sitting on Ragefire. Like they could. At. Any. Time. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=43032"><img src='http://mywebpages.comcast.net/theharters/NewImzy2.jpg' border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukellimloh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kellim LoH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/02 11:51:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Free For All on Ragefire 1-31 October ONLY</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  For example in order for me to fulfill my EQ dreams I have to leave a nice band of close friends and become a cog in the wheel of an &quot;uber&quot; guild in order to even have a chance at RF. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you'd leave a &quot;nice band of close friends&quot; to get a shot at an item, then that reflects on your character, not the uber guilds.<br>
<br>
Unless you're in the top guild on the server, you accept the fact that you won't be seeing certain mobs in the very future, either because the mob is outside the capabilities of your guild/alliance, or because you'll lose races for that mob to guilds that are more capable (in raid terms) than your own.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, that's an acceptable trade off for most people, the fact that you know your guildmates already, and feel comfortable and at home with them outweighs the benefits of joining the more capable guild.<br>
<br>
As for the issue of whether or not the top guilds would monopolize the spawn, I think it stands to reason that the bulk of the kills, upon it going FFA, would be had by the top raiding guilds on the server.<br>
<br>
The question is whether or not those guilds would kill Ragefire when they didn't have an actual main who needed the spawn.<br>
<br>
In any event, after seeing the controversy on this server surrounding Ragefire kills, I'm firmly convinced that I wrong in thinking a FFA system could be harmonious and would prefer to see the current system maintained as is.<br>
<br>
It may not be fair, it may not be perfect, but the alternative would be a huge headache. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=119554>Sir Kellim</a><BR><a href=http://reviction.lohnetwork.com/>Reviction</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ugeldanmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GeldanMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/8/02 8:49:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Free For All on Ragefire 1-31 October ONLY</span><hr size=1> You know... this is why I HATE trolling the boards sometimes, people just rip your thoughts apart and take them out of context to prove they're right. FE has been wonderful in comparison to many of the uber guilds of other servers. I have nothing against them and for the most part highly respect their membership and leaders. <br>
<br>
However I have to respond... <br>
<br>
Morinkhan:<br>
<br>
Suuure there's no point now... but what If cleric X apps and joins FE and needs RF... it won't take long for that cleric to get his/her epic if RF were FFA. Therefore any smart cleric out there that wants their epic knows exactly what they need to do.... join the most powerful guild on the server and chances for epic increase exponentially. It's very simple. <br>
<br>
I like playing EQ... I like being with friends and killing powerful mobs... but I don't like camping 24/7 for what you say? 2, 3 months just for my epic?! I'd rather wait a year on the list and have to camp 5 days, 24/7, then spend 3 full months, 24/7, camping for one frigging item and mob. Talk about evercamp and a serious case of burnout... <br>
<br>
Kellim:<br>
<br>
Your right... now that more and more mobs are FFA, those who race fastest win... sad but true. <br>
<br>
I doubt it's very rare for people to have left guilds that aren't motivated, but are friendly, simply for the chance of better loot... have you ever left a guild for a better more motivated one? I'd really be suprised if you said no and if so, what prompted that? Loot? naaa... um killing big mobs right? riiiight.... People usually move to be with those they know but that doesn't dampen the desire to be better and to make yourself and those around you better even if your just in the low to mid high end game. <br>
<br>
Just my 2cp... I support the rotation with all my heart. I feel it's extremely fair to those who have worked hard to get to that point. Any other way encourages more Alts and ebay power levelers to race ahead of a person that has played their char for years. So, yes I love the rotation. (I've found you rarely if ever find an alt or ebayer with the patience to wait that long) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>

No one here has said they cannot kill it. Most are simply saying they would prefer a more logical, structured system, one that doesn't demand endless wasted hours of camping. <br>
<br>
Not ONE person has said GIMME GIMME. Your notion that we are just asking for welfare is crass, and incorrect. You have yet to offer one valid suggestion here. <br>
<br>
So you support the FFA system, good for you. I personally do not. Good for me. Both systems work, some better for others. We are just trying to come to an amenable solution for all parties, tho' it appears impossible, it is doable with enough cooperation.<br>
<br>
Instead of adding fuel to the fire, maybe you could try to post a suggestion that hasn't been brought up. But to sit back and call people whiners when we are attempting to discuss things rationally and logically is just plain non-productive.<br>
<br>
What is being proposed is a RADICAL change in the way things are done, certainly some will be unhappy with it. Hopefully tho, we can reach some agreement that all can live with.<br>
<br>
At least I hope so,<br>
