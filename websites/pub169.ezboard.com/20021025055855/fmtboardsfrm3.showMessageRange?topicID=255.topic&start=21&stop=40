<br>
Short and sweet... Rustem started a thread in the off-topic section of the old boards, relating to the palestinan/israeli conflict. It was actually a very civil debate with various people taking part, no flaming, just people giving their opinions.<br>
<br>
Rustem stated that he supported the Palestinan side of the debate blah blah. Eventually people lost interest, the thread fell back and people forgot about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ONE MONTH</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> later Rustem made an slightly anti FE comment and Fenny posted that she thought he should be removed as mod because of his bias.<br>
<br>
This was followed by the Sunmina Jihad (tm), where basically she took a bunch of out of context remarks, claimed Rustem was a terrorist (and we all know what a hot bed of terrorism Columbus Ohio is), requested he have his mod status removed, requested he be banned from the board, claimed to have reported him to the FBI, and claimed to have contacted VI  in an effort to have Rustem banned from EQ because  &quot;Terrorists shouldn't be allowed to have video games&quot;<br>

After Sunmina threatned RL violence agasint Rustem and several of his supporters and Rustem removed himself as a moderator and from the board FE in unison declared these boards a cesspool and vowed never to return.

Lara, I think you are missing the human element as well.  You never know who on these boards may have been abused or such.  Perhaps those people are allowed to immediately carry out the Sunmina Jihad (tm) (thanks Bry!) on her and the mods must submit to their wills?<br>

 As to what she claims, there's no real reason to disbelieve her, unlike certain other members of her guild she has not demonstarted a history of untruthfulness.   <br>

<br>
<br>
anyways, i read her letter..and if i was fimble i would;<br>
<br>
1) feel sad for her watching her degrade herself like crazy, sucking up, acting inferior and hurt just to win by getting a person banned from a forum.<br>
and the terrorist part was.. i dunno, the most fvcked up thing ive seen here so far. she made a complete fool out of herself, and i take it that judgement lives on here due to all the replies she receives.<br>
<br>
<br>
or i would;<br>
<br>
2) just think that i had a psycho on the line and ignore it. these kind of people are bottom scratch in society. nobody probably knows they exist, and they build up SO much anger and SO many opinions in that little rathole of theirs with internet connection.<br>
they live in denial. they think they are intellectual and stand above society and the pitiful people, as you can understand from reading her all-knowing posts.<br>
when these people die of overdose or overeating nobody will notice til they smell the rotten flesh.<br>
<br>
<br>
would anyone really believe she was a victim in this matter? obviously, she IS a victim, but in this matter it was SO obvious she just needed a doggy walk and some fresh air. or some therapy. thats all.<br>
<br>
i get so tired of all the psychos getting a voice on the net. it was better before..in the early 90's. they hid in the shadows, unheard. now they are just polluting the cyber air with their cynical crap which is all based on their personal ghosts. go fvcking solve your problems! get therapy! dont take it out on us, sunmina!<br>

1) Make a further a.ss out of her-/him-/it-self<br>
2) Allows me to continue to make, moreso, an ass out of her/him/it/whatever.<br>
<br>
You see Sumbishonastreetcorner, while my initial post in the other thread attacking punks like you and Myriddan may have touched, in your opinion, personal levels, you went too far with an allegation aimed at someone not involved in this (being my son).  I've never made any reference or even an inuendo about your sister, your nationality, or your location/situation.  <br>
<br>
You can make feeble attacks on every aspect about me as your uneducated, immature little bish mind can come up with.  Just try to make sure you know that I am the target, not my kid.  <br>
<br>
Please don't bother to apologize, because it wouldn't be sincere.  You probably don't know the meaning of sincerity since you came off pretty sincere back when you said you were never coming back.  <br>
<br>
You want for me to make some comment about your sister?  Maybe something along the lines of suicide bombers taking out your whole family next time?  You want to welcome me to your level.  If I do sink that low, keep this in mind.  While I am there, stfu and get me a beer.  I won't be long, please make it quick as the natural evolution is forcing me back up the food chain to where I originally belong - better then you.<br>
<br>
It's not an over-ego complex, it's not snobbish...but I can honestly close my eyes...compare the simple fact of judging your posts vs mine that I am by far a better human being then you in pretty much every aspect a human can be judged.  While you laugh about the subject, my stomach churns.<br>
<br>
The other day someone asked me why I was a decent person in game and such an ass on mt.com.  My answer was that in game, I log on to have fun and when I see idiocy I can /ignore it.  On mt.com, I log on to encounter the idiocy, release the stresses of my day, etc.  Yea, I pretend to be a tough guy.  The safety of being behind a keyboard and monitor enable me to say everything on my mind with no regards to feelings, decency, respect, etc.  I can say things to make you cry and not give a damn here, where as in the real world I would never say them at all (if i could help it).  The difference though, is even things like racism and that which harms a child (my child or not)can't even fit here.  Even with the &quot;safety net&quot; as I mentioned - it just doesn't belong.<br>
<br>
So continue to bottom feed with your UBER EQ character.  At least your EQ character might be impressive, even if your real life character has much to be desired. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/urerunthenecro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rerun The Necro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/28/02 10:20:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hey...</span><hr size=1> This @#%$ piece of trash Sunmina crawled out of her bomb shelter again ?<br>

Well a hearty welcome the hell back to mt.com to the two of you!!!! God I've missed you two pieces of maggot puke so much! Thank you for coming back to my cesspool! Glad you could join us. Please, don't go crying and crawling away EVER again! I can't tell you how much you've been missed. The crops just didn't grow near as well without the manure that spews forth from yer mouths and attitudes that reak of fresh sewage before treatment. <br>
<br>
Really...I am very happy to see you tinkie-winkie dipsh!ts come back. Now please, proceed with the moderator firing demands...or are you going to demand that TW be banned from this site now?<br>
<br>
I could care less about the rest of FE and this FE/TW thing...I'm just so thrilled that you two are here now...again...after saying you wouldn't EVER come back here.<br>
<br>
Bring out the sheep that you know I so love. We're gonna party now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok It, I've been reading what you've said here and on FE.com and ya know what...I don't see anything in this post whatsoever to comes close to being &quot;personal&quot;.  You said these words hurt you?  OMFG.  It has feelings???  And obviously oversensitive ones at that.<br>
<br>
Why am I saying this here and not at FE.com?  Because FE.com isn't a rant board.  This has no place there.  I went there this last time to apologize that the mess was brought there, but do not kid yerself It.  I was by no means apologizing to the likes of you.  Oh and Myrridian, nah, I won't get yer name right because you're not worthy of such respect.  Yer a tool.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion It, you can try and maybe succeed at making yourself out to be the hapless, poor little victim to your guild so long as they don't read this post and the post where ya made yer comment.  <br>
<br>
No, your feeble words do not hurt me.  Just like everyone else, I turn the computer off and they are gone.  You can't, however, justify your disgusting comment being a defense over the above post.  It carries no legitimacy, It. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=255.topic&start=61&stop=76>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=255.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=255.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=40><img src=http://sevendragons.net/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.threadControl?topicID=255.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=255.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3>Rants</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
