Now.. if you want to perma camp  Lodi hey whatever, but being a punk about a quest part that only drops off Lodi is a bit childish. Yer makin bank off the sheilds , it wouldnt hurt you or yer rep to leave the map parts  on the corpse. Hell, if you were doing this for any other reason than to be an ass you would advertize to folks you would sell the map rights for X pp either in the boards or an auc channel.  <br>

1.  If he wants to perma camp Lodi and has nothing better to do with his time, who the heck cares.  <br>
<br>
2.  If he is polite enough to allow people to take the spawn if they ask POLITELY, and sit back and wait and HELP if they need it, then more power to him.<br>
<br>
3.  As someone who has actually been there while he was killing Lodi, just to watch because I had never even seen the dang turtle before.  I dropped a couple heals on him, and he was kind enough to INSIST that I take the Knottet Turtlebone Ring, even tho I didn't want any loot, when he could have sold it, he is not there for the Loots, nor for anything other than because he can, and evidently enjoys killing Lodi.  <br>
<br>
Maybe if you asked nicely he would let you play in his sand box, but if you are going to be rude and kick sand, expect to have sand kicked back. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=freecaster>Freecaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#628CBC>(6/30/03 9:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1016.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: favor</span><hr size=1> Okay.. my 2cp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... if he's gunna perma camp it, more power to him, if he knows what the spawn time is, more power to him, if he lets people loot things (be it because it's lore or whatever), more power to him... if he's going to sell the loots that he gets from Lodi... more power to him.... if he's going to KS then boot his a$$... otherwise, there is NO such rule against perma camping... people do it in rathe, people do it in all other zones, this one just happens to be a rarer spawn that gives phatter lewts.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kuroni>Kuroni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/1/03 1:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1016.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: favor</span><hr size=1> Well, maybe it's a &quot;you had to be there&quot; kinda thing.

<br>
Perhaps all the nasty things I've heard about him biased me, but I know it didn't bias my husband, Lananin. I was sitting there on one of my alts with Lan watching the conversation in tells. Lan doesn't type too well so he doesn't say much. This is how it went:<br>
<br>
Lananin tells Flesh: We're just here for the belt.<br>
Flesh tells Lan: Laff<br>
Flesh tells Lan: you can just sell the shield and buy a belt.<br>
Lan tells Flesh: I don't want to buy one.<br>
Flesh tells Lan: Laff<br>
Flesh tells Lan: Whatever<br>
Flesh tells Lan: So are you going to be here for the next 2 weeks.<br>
Lan tells flesh: I don't know.<br>
<br>
As I said before I don't keep logs on, but to the best of my knowledge that's a pretty accurate conversation. Maybe it's just me, but I detected a not so pleasant attitude in it. I asked Lan why he told him this, Lan said maybe he'd want to just join up and kill together. If the belt dropped we could keep it, and he could keep the rest. Obviously that didn't happen though. I also don't expect people to read minds, but usually my response to someone that stated what they're after would be to team up if it wasn't the same thing I was after. I would never respond with &quot;Laff&quot;.<br>
<br>
As for the previous night, the monk that came to help us kill it the first time pretty much thought the same we did. Our thoughts: he just stayed back thinking we were going to wipe - not to mention the fact there were 4 gms on at the time. Lan's not 65, and barely has 4500hp so he's not the strongest tank in the world. Also, the monk didn't show up until Lodi was about 35% or so.<br>
<br>
As for the day the conversation took place. There was just the 2 of us there at first, Lan and I. At that time is when Flesh made pets for himself and his shammy. He didn't make pets the night before. I'm quite sure he could have easily ks'd us, and I do believe that was his intent especially after all the &quot;Laff&quot; and &quot;Whatever&quot; comments (yes, there were more than what I posted here). <br>
<br>
Soon after, Reave was bored and showed up. He was going to help us kill it, but then he got a group in POE so Cherie came to pick him up. It wasn't some evil plot lol. Shortly after that, Aerwen and Draqcon showed up. Again, not because of an evil plot, but because I was sure Lan and I would be ks'd even if we engaged first. My thoughts were right, but he just couldn't outdamage a ranger and another sk.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I suppose people do have the right to perma camp things. As far as insisting for others to loot, one could argure that some things are lore and maybe he just couldn't loot it. It's the thought that counts I guess lol. So maybe he's not all that much of a bad guy, but after my experience with him, he's not the greatest either. I wouldn't rate him as low as Giggit, but I surely wouldn't nominate him as a friendly or helpful player.<br>

Once again you cant deny the fact that those 3 quotes were EXACTLY what you said on that day.  Those quotes were also 45 minutes before the spawn.  I believe everybody would agree with me that you had the intention of ranting since the mob hadnt spawned when you said those words.  <br>
<br>
So far as guild tag goes, i did mention Bearloverb (Triune) camping along side for 2 straight weeks and she had 50% of the kills.  I would like to repeat myself, why does one Triune co-existed with me for 2 weeks while another one started such a commotion in one day?  Isnt it best for Jordaan to ask Bearloverb? Oh yeah Shadhir (Aurore) soloed the mob, also for straight 2 weeks, and i rather KS you.<br>
<br>
&quot;I would never repond with Laff.&quot; Being that your husband is Lananin, you could had been doubleboxxing the 2 characters and maybe the enchanter which you failed to mention above.  Here is out it goes in 2 minutes of log:<br>
<br>
Kuroni says, 'Hehe seems i'll be late for ranting you on the mt boards after today'<br>
Kuroni says, 'Someone beat me to it so i've been told'<br>
You say, 'laff'<br>
Kuroni says, 'Must be ex tw sks?'<br>
Lananin says, 'Laff' &lt;----------------<br>
Kuroni says, 'Something about tw sks.. just not worth the space'<br>
<br>
Once again 45 minutes before the mob spawned that day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sourrrevenge>Sourr Revenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#628CBC>(7/1/03 3:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1016.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re:favor</span><hr size=1> I dunno Flesh, you had some folks come here to defend ya.

I remember the time when a guild would perma camp him because they could get there and kill him in time and no one said @#%$ and hoped that the next time they would be there first.<br>
<br>
This situtuation has turned the same way except now lodi is not a guild kill its a personal kill since he can be soloed by a shammy or whatever. <br>
<br>
Flesh wants that spawn he invests his time to get that spawn and kill it, Im sorry if you are not dedicated enough to do that then you aint got no reason to @#%$ b!tch. <br>
<br>
Why is AL, Triton etc on top? Because they are there for every spawn. Because they will beat you get the gear and advance in the game before you. Its all dedication. <br>

However, I don't see you adding in all of your parts of the conversation either.  You had NO clue if I was two boxing or not. It just so happens I wasn't. <br>
<br>
Yes, my husband typed Laff. I think it was more to mock than anything else. As for me I tend to reply with things such as LOL or type the word out correctly. Sometimes I even see it more fitting to make complete sentences.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter is you can perma camp Lodi all you want. Obviously you don't have better things to do. Like I said before we didn't have much of a problem, if any problem, with you the first time we killed it. The problem arose the second time we were there. My interpretation of it was you just got pissed off about the threat of having &quot;your&quot; spawn taken away from you two times in a row. The conversation with Lan came FIRST. Everything I said came later.<br>
<br>
As far as Jordaan is concerned, this isn't his problem. He wasn't involved, nor does he need to be involved. This was a problem between you and me.<br>
<br>
The fact of the matter isn't quotes from me. The facts are you perma camp Lodi. Maybe sometimes you're nice to people who want to kill, but I don't/didn't consider the things you said to Lan as friendly or encouraging to go ahead and kill Lodi. Something you claim to be so generous about doing.<br>
