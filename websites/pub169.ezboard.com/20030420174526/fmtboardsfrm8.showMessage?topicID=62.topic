<br>
i dont think so.  these rules for the calendar were set long before i ever offered my time and my money to host the site, and manage this freakin calendar.<br>
<br>
i did it as a favor to azmokar.  and people email me telling me when other people have broken the rules.  i mean come on, people sometimes miscount and may accidentally schedule a day in advance of the 14 days, but blatantly posting 3 weeks or more in advance??<br>
<br>
i try to enforce the rules just on the website, not in game, to keep things more orderly.  these are rules i sure as hell didnt write, but were agreed upon a long time ago by the top guilds at that time.  <br>
<br>
and since some of you are relative newbs to the server, before the rules, the calendar would be booked well over a month in advance, with the same guilds raiding the same planes (this was a plane issue at the time) over and over.  <br>
<br>
self appointed?  good god you have to be kidding, i do this because if i suddenly decide NOT to, no one else will. <br>
<br>
so cut me some slack.  and post within the rules, its quite simple really. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucalystraangenoire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calystra Angenoire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/9/02 8:04:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: calendar</span><hr size=1> Just a question here.

If that was not your intent, then I do apologize.<br>
<br>
In fact, I do understand why the 2-week rule is in place, but perhaps a 4-week rule might be better?  or a &quot;in the calendar month&quot; rule?<br>
<br>
In any case, tattling will never help.  If there were raids scheduled outside the rules and someone coming within the rules wanted to schedule one and asked that an outside-the-rule post be removed, I suppose that would be reasonable.  But if the slot is not in contention, is there any actual harm in posting outside the 2 week rule?<br>
<br>
But the tattling about &quot;so-and-so posted 1 day beyond the 14 day rule&quot; just for the purposes of getting the post removed is childish crap, and I'll happily say that to anyone guilty of so doing.  <br>
<br>
Other thoughts:<br>
<br>
- MT kind of has a gentlemans agreement among the raiding guilds, is there really a risk that FE or some other guild (and let's face it, it's really FE we're talking about ) is going to wake up tomorrow and hog up all the spots for a generally accessible raiding location?  If the risk of that is low, is the 2 week thing really needed as a rule, or just as a sort of guideline (within 2 weeks is considered solid, outside 2 weeks is more of a warning, to be confirmed at 2 weeks)?  Morell Thule has a growing body of adult players with jobs and families for whom 2 weeks may not quite be enough morning to schedule a whole day of time for raiding.<br>
<br>
- Does MT really need tattletales running around checking the time stamps on posts like the little class nerd who was always yelling &quot;Teacher! he's breaking the rules&quot; ?  It is because of people like this:<br>

<br>
if people in the community arent watching the calendar and reporting when someone breaks a rule thats been agreed upon and has served the server for almost 2 years, then why have any rules?<br>
<br>
you can call it any childish name you want, but its what most people appreciate and support.<br>
<br>
you are missing the point anyway.  if people are allowed to schedule 4 weeks in advance they can monopolize certain zones at certain times, and believe me these rules have squat to do about FE.<br>
<br>
they dont raid the zones you all are scheduling, and they dont give a crap about the calendar for the most part because it simply has nothing to do with them<br>
<br>
FE didnt even exist when the rules were written.<br>
<br>
RA, Sinister, CoTU, HF and i think im forgetting a few were the &quot;Big&quot; guilds of the time, and they were just raiding hate, fear, vs, trak...<br>
<br>
those guilds no longer exist or have combined and evolved so far beyond what this calendar is for its not even applicable.<br>
<br>
if this system has worked literally for years, why in gods name does scheduling 4 weeks in advance make things better?  just because your guild scheduled 3 weeks in advance and blatantly breaks the current rules doesnt mean it should be changed.<br>
<br>
obivously its been done and its failed or else the 2 week rule wouldnt be here.<br>
<br>
im not going to argue this point.  its moot.  the rules are the rules.  if you can get anyone to support a change in them, thats perfectly fine with me, and we will change them.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uqikkiq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/9/02 10:58:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=62.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: calendar</span><hr size=1> At the moment, I'm not in a guild, having given up my high level characters for dead, taken a break and started over... so it wasn't &quot;my&quot; guild anymore that scheduled something 3 weeks off.<br>

However, that said, the time will come sooner than later when I will be back raiding and with a guild.  It might even be one of the guilds that booked early.  For the time being, I'm content to be on another server where oddly, things seem to work well without your rules.  <br>
<br>
Ask yourself, if the rules work so well, why do poeple even suggest that there might be flaws, or at least might be another (possibly better) way?  What makes a rule written years ago so appropriate now?<br>

No, it's not obvious that it's been done and failed.  I've never seen a hint that it's been done at all.<br>
<br>
Why should change be looked at?  Because the original guilds that made the rule are gone or what they do is no longer applicable to the calendar.<br>
<br>
Even law makers re-evaluate situations from time to time.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself why you and and the other &quot;higher ups&quot; that seem to exercise this sort of control over how things work on MT are so reluctant to even entertain thoughts of change?<br>
<br>
That &quot;it's worked in the past&quot; is not an answer.  That's a cop out.  We don't live in the past, we live now.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I can't think I've got anything more to add, and this really doesn't need to devolve into a pissing match.  Feel free to lock the thread before it gets out of hand.

The mobs this rule seems to be &quot;broken&quot; on the most are Vox and Naggy. They are on a one week spawn so people try to slip in a day or 2 early so they get the mob and keep others who are trying to abide by the rules any chance at it. <br>

The line needs drawn somewhere. Right now it is set at 2 weeks. Mabey that time frame does need re-evaluated, but no matter what time frame you select someone will post outside the window.<br>

If the players do not watch and lets the Mods know when these rules are broken then what is the solution? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=183727">Sumamdar Spirithealer</a><BR>

Eventually, they were ended and the old system reinstated.<br>
<br>
Also, if your saying that FE is the major controlling factor in the calander, then you simply have alot more to learn before commenting on these subjects.<br>
<br>
Otherwise you just look ignorant. <p>"For a day I had my dream. And on that day, it was my duty to end that dream."
