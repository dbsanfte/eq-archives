Entering the Dreadlands she shouted out her warcry and greeting: “ROAR!!!” Immediately her elven ears picked up the voice of her lover shouting back to her, calling her “Usst Ssus’Z’har”, my Sunrunner. Her heart leapt in her chest at hearing this term of affection echoing the hills of the land. <br>
<br>
Within minutes she saw Nathomin running swiftly to her, his long hair flying, free from it’s knot. With daggers still in hand and his blue skin shining from the efforts of his recent battle, Nathomin rushed into Malaehi’s arms, kissing her passionately. After a few breathless moments, the rogue pulled away with a chuckle as he sheathed his weapons and watched his love blush madly, still unused to such displays of passion. He took her hand and said: <br>
<br>
“Come my love, your Goddess has granted me this beautiful day and this feeling of love in my heart. I wish to celebrate love... keeping you blushing for the entire evening and glowing for days to come yet.” Malaehi gasped and felt herself being dragged along behind the rogue who was determinedly headed for his camp. He stopped and turned her back into his embrace, eyes sparkling with sheer joy. <br>
<br>
“I love you.... incredibly so much, Malaehi! I love the Goddess you serve as well, for she has opened my eyes to the true beauty of this land and of this life.” He turned his eyes up to the sky, pulled back from the embrace and proudly saluted “Hail Erollisi Marr, Queen of Love, the source of the happiness I feel now!”<br>
<br>
Malaehi felt a cold chill up her spine, and turned to face the cold North wind, hearing the haunting voice in her head again sneering “Death comes to you soon, Malaehi, you have broken your vows.“ Nathomin was so caught up in the joy of the moment that he failed to see her freeze in terror. <br>
<br>
“What is this, the rogue forsaking Innoruuk for His antithesis?” the wicked laughter continued “He speeds his death as a traitor, Malaehi, his fate is now sealed, as is yours”.<br>
<br>
“Nooo!” Malaehi screamed to the voice in her mind. Just as Nathomin turned in shock to question, a Giant lumbered over the hill and kicked Nathomin in the back. Stunned and without weapons in hand, the rogue stood dazed as the Giant pounded on him mercilessly. Malaehi quickly fought the Giant, casting a spell to destroy it's brain, then chanting for roots to come out of the earth to immobilize him so they could escape. Malaehi quickly grabbed her stunned lover and raced up the hill and into the tunnel.<br>
<br>
The emerged into the Frontier Mountains, safe at last. With daggers in hand and a fierce look of revenge on his face, Nathomin headed back to kill the giant. <br>
<br>
“Please don’t... Nathomin, another will come along and finish the job... I wish to speak with you.” Nathomin sighed, sheathed his weapons and let it go, finally noticing something strange in Mala. <br>
<br>
“Sunrunner, what is it?” Malaehi walked out of the tunnel, down the hill and started to make her way up the steep, jagged cliff of the Guardian’s mountain. Nathomin sensed Malaehi’s serious mood and chose to follow without question. After the strenuous climb, they arrived at the peak. Malaehi stumbled, feeling a bit dizzy form the height and this overwhelming fear that gripped her. Nathomin quickly caught her, pulling her into his protective embrace “What is it, Sunrunner?” <br>
<br>
Mala pulled away nervously, “Thh... this is a beautiful place is it not...?” Nathomin chuckled and walked up behind the enchantress, snaked his hands around her and pulled her in close, kissing her neck tenderly. Malaehi turned her head and their gazes locked. For an eternal moment, ice met fire, love met hate, Koada’dal met Teir’dal... Malaehi knew at that moment, that she must decide.<br>
<br>
“I love you, Nathomin.” <br>
<br>
The rogue looked as if he‘d been struck, Malaehi had said it at last. He turned her completely around to face him, took her face gently into his hands, and kissed her slowly still staring into her eyes. But, something was wrong...<br>
<br>
Malaehi’s expression went cold, emotionless, even her voice ... it was like that of the undead. With a sense of foreboding, Nathomin continued his kiss, determined not to ruin this most precious time. Malaehi stood there is if she were the guardian statue. He pulled back in frustration, looking bewildered.<br>
<br>
“Nathomin... But, our love is not meant to be... and I cannot live in this torment anymore. The Ancients ... they will punish me for breaking my vow of chastity and taking a lover.” <br>
<br>
“I will end the life of anyone harming you, SsusZ’har” Nathomin said without blinking. He sighed and reached forward, but Malaehi stepped further, inches from the edge. The sound of pebbles dropping over the edge over the edge rang like sweet music in her elven ears as a feeling of euphoria entered Malaehi’s mind. She closed he eyes and swayed in the breeze.<br>
<br>
Nathomin’s eyes narrowed tightly, voice dropping to a cold whisper “What are you doing Malaehi d’Aeliu? Come here now,” pointing to his side.<br>
<br>
She could not hear him at all. All she could here was the soft sound of her Mother’s voice, singing a lullaby in the tongue of the Ancients. That was the most peaceful moment she had ever known, and all she wanted was that feeling again. Looking off Nathomin‘s shoulder, Malaehi‘s eyes glazed over with sheer madness. She envisioned her mother, standing off into the distance, opening her arms, beckoning her to come. <br>
<br>
“Ilhar Malaeliu...I’ve missed you so. Please.... I can’t take this anymore. I cannot live like this. The Ancients ... will see me bleed for my crimes ... I feel as if I am dead, Ilhar, please make it stop?” Tears poured down her face as the vision of her mother, turned her back and walked away. “Noooo, don’t leave me!!” The bitter laughed echoed in Malaehi’s mind, drowning out the sound of the approaching Giant.<br>
<br>
“Where is your Mother, lover? What is going on?!” Nathomin turned and faced the startled Giant, quickly grabbed his blades and set to work to destroy the intruder. Fear crept up the back of Nathomin’s spine. He quickly glanced over to his lover to see why she was not casting. That glance sent Nathomin reeling back as the Giant landed a crushing blow to his shoulder, rendering his left arm paralyzed and knocking him back several feet, away from Malaehi. He snarled, seeing the Giant turn his attention to his lover, then swiftly sliced his blade across the back of the Giant’s knees, through skin and tendons, crippling the roaring monster and sending it into a raging fury. Once on it had fallen half way, the rogue drove his blade into it’s back again and again, finally twisting his wrist up, puncturing a lung. The mountains echoed with the dying gasp of the felled Giant as Nathomin struggled to free his blade where it was deeply embedded.<br>
<br>
The air went completely still as Malaehi turned to face the setting sun. Nathomin left his buried blade, stood up on the Giant’s back, and immediately ran towards his lover. But, he reached her a moment too late, grabbing the sleeve of her pure, white robe which gave way freely as she stepped off the edge into oblivion, ending her life.<br>

<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
The wind was cold and harsh in the mountains of Kunark. The howling was either the wind or the Giants starting up one of their strange rites. The fires down in the valley below flickering while the Giants there went about their business. The warrior with the scared face and the gray streaked beard watched the valley below.<br>
<br>
&quot;Lord Mallo?&quot; The High Elven voice blended into the wind almost unheard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Winnihym don't,&quot; Mallo's words were lost as he pulled Winnihym up from where he was about to kneel. &quot;Just don't do that, I'm no great Lord just a simple Knight. What is going on friend? I thought you were off to thin out the Froglok populace?&quot;<br>
<br>
Winnihym's face was naturally grave, serious, except when he was telling his awful jokes. But, urgency was in his voice. &quot;I have heard from a traveler that something has happened to Malaehi.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Happened? What? Where?&quot; The weapons set near at hand were quickly picked up as Luniel began casting spells speeding them all on their travels.<br>
<br>
&quot;Frontier Mountains Lord.&quot; Winnihym's voice matched his grave expression. &quot;She is dead Lord, Tunare willing I'll be able to return her to life but we must hurry Lord.&quot;<br>
<br>
Luniel's husky voice cut through. &quot;Mallo? Our business elsewhere?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you handle it Luniel?&quot; was Mallo's returned question. &quot;Aye easy enough.&quot; The Ranger smiled, for now she could move swiftly and unseen through the mountains and not worry about the beasts hearing Mallo and thinking him a snack.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok I'll follow Winnihym&quot; Mallo turned to find the High Priest of Tunare already gone. &quot;Zek!.&quot; The oath was mild for it was known to all that Winnihym was tireless in his desire to see things whole and in proper order.<br>
<br>
It was but a short run to catch up to Winnihym where Malaehi had already been called back from the great beyond. The sight of her standing dazed from her resurrection, overlooking her broken, bloody corpse at the bottom of the towering cliff stung Mallo, his mind knowing this must have been foul play. At that moment, out of the corner of his eye, Mallo saw his enemy. If not for the sight of the Rogue, Nathomin, running away from the area, Mallo might of noticed that Malaehi was not all joy to be alive and well again. In fact, when Malaehi's eyes met Mallo's she seemed ... terrified.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damned he got away again. I'll kill that Teir'dal yet.&quot; Turning to Malaehi he asked harshly &quot;Did Nathomin cause you injury, Lady Malaehi?&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi's voice trembled as she admitted &quot;Nay my lord... I did this.“  Mallo turned to stare at her, stunned. “...for I knew you'd never accept what I have to ... must tell you.&quot; Malaehi shivered in fear and the shock of the resurrection. She cringed away from Mallo, knowing full well that he was not noted for being even tempered.<br>
<br>
Mallo looked at her with a worried glance &quot;You have nothing to fear from me Malaehi.” He paused and quickly assessed the situation, turned to face her, eyes hard has diamonds... <br>
<br>
“Unless ... you fell in love with Nathomin. Then, I'd have to kill you and then him.&quot; Mallo's smile meant the comment as but a jest. An impossible thing but Malaehi's face was stricken.<br>
<br>
&quot;No .. you couldn't.&quot; She stammered.<br>
<br>
&quot;Couldn't or wouldn't?&quot; Was the simple response. Mallo was becoming distracted by a slight noise behind him. The smell of a scent only sold in Neriak.<br>
<br>
Looking over Mallo's shoulder Malaehi yelled. &quot;Run Nathomin! RUN!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin's shout, &quot;MALAEHI !&quot; echoed from the mountains around them.<br>
<br>
Turning, Mallo could see the Teir'dal Rogue running from him. Only his voice could follow as fast as the Rogue was running and chasing a killer like Nathomin in the dark was not wise. &quot;YOUR DEAD TEIR’DAL .. YOUR DEAD DO YOU HEAR!&quot; The shout was answered by the roaring of some beast off in the hills.<br>
<br>
Malaehi's shout also echoed from the walls of rock. &quot;Mallo, NO! Flee Ssins'Veldre!&quot;<br>
<br>
Winnihym's dry voice cut into the rising emotions. &quot;I leave you in peace, friends. I'm off to do battle with the Sarnaks, with my old friend. Good travels.” He paused, taking Malaehi's cold hand into his, “Great Enchantress, will there be anything else this humble servant can do for you?'&quot; At the shake of her head, Winnihym departed leaving matters between his new Guild leader and the Enchantress to be settled in private.<br>
<br>
The next sound was the Teir'Dals voice. For the first time in all the meetings Mallo could remember raised above the assassins normal whisper. &quot;Mallo, you want me dead so be it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi's cry of &quot;NO!&quot; cutting into Nathomin's words.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you want me dead Mallo, let it be in light of truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo's voice was low pitched and cutting. &quot;What madness have you caused now<br>
Nathomin?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin was a mess. His normally coifed hair and almost foppish dress tattered and windswept. The harsh climes of Kunark were not kind to the son of Neriak. &quot;You will have my death in a moment, but allow me time.&quot;<br>
<br>
With thoughts of yet more treachery and villainy Mallo readied his weapons before asking. &quot;Time for what?&quot;<br>
<br>
The Teir'Dals eyes sought out Malaehi, her name was whispered almost lost in the mountain winds. &quot;My lady you have enchanted me! But I'll not die for an enchantment. You have spoken to me, but I'll not die for words. I will die! By your Lords hands. But not before I give you the gift I meant to.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kneeling before Malaehi, as she watched him with wonder in her eyes. &quot;I give you my heart.&quot; Malaehi tried to stammer out her negation of what Nathomin was saying but his soft voice continued. &quot;Let Erollisi judge me.&quot; As he nodded to Mallo.<br>
<br>
Her voice cracking. &quot;Mallo, please... do not do this. If you have a heart in your chest Lord Artanos. Do not do this!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin stands to face his long time foe. &quot;Do it Lord Zealot.&quot; blinking to conceal the moisture in his eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you love this creature Malaehi?&quot; The Half Elves voice held incredulity at the thought. Mallo's fist crashed into the Teir'Dal pushing him away from Malaehi as he continued to speak to her. &quot;He has bedded more women then a prize bull!&quot;<br>
<br>
Anger flooded Nathomin's normally expressionless face, as Malaehi began to weep. &quot;More women then a prized bull?&quot; Nathomin's laugh was bitter.<br>
<br>
&quot;I doubt they meant more to him then the a bull cares for his cows.&quot; Mallo's voice was rising his sense of betrayal here on this mountain side growing.<br>
<br>
&quot;My Lord Mallo please no, not .. it is my fault.&quot; Malaehi's voice was stricken.<br>
<br>
Mallo's next question seemed to rock the High Elven woman. &quot;Are you a Lion<br>
or not Malaehi?&quot;<br>
<br>
The question snapped her upright, her voice firmer &quot;I AM a Lion!! But, do NOT DO THIS!&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin's eyes were cold. &quot;Come, do as your heart decrees Lord Zealot and let mine rest.&quot;<br>
<br>
The mailed fist struck Nathomin again, voice still questioning the enchantress &quot;Then how can you love Nathomin??”<br>
<br>
Malaehi smiled fondly looking into Nathomin's eyes, &quot;Because I have found a heart in him. I have found a soul that has been lost ... ripped away by the vile injustices of this land, Lord Artanos.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo's laugh echoed from the hills waking the beasts that stalked. &quot;In Nathomin? Cyrrics lapdog? He has told you some tale nothing more. Lies to turn you from your goddess. There is nothing of the Goddess of Love in Nathomin I know him well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you?&quot; She asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know me not!&quot; The Rogue exclaimed finally, stung to anger. &quot;You know nothing<br>
but your own arrogance, your own self righteousness!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You were Cyrric’s man, and Thelasker’s were you not? WERE YOU NOT!&quot; Mallo hammered his fist into the rogue's chest again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye I was. Service, Lord Artanos, service only.&quot; Nathomin sighed as a reply.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then tell me what I know. You were in service to the man who would be Overlord of all.&quot; Mallo interrogated.<br>
<br>
&quot;But service none the less.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Service you betrayed to join with T`Vlos when a better offer came.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you even know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do I know of services Nathomin? Aye I do, and I have never betrayed my own. As you betrayed the Order for T'Vlos.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi turned her eyes to her lover, in shock. Her whispered, &quot;Tis, true??&quot; showed that Nathomin had not spoke to her of his long years of service with the Order of the White Hand.<br>
<br>
Nathomin shook his head, not in denial but to gather his thoughts. &quot;I did not turn from the Order, but they willingly turned on me. I went in service to T`Vlos to steady an ally.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo's voice was mocking. &quot;To bed Cynful’s wife.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To bring a house back to life that was crumbling under a fool's pride, Mallo. I will not deny my passion for Ravensky.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is only one problem with that story. T`Vlos was never an ally to the Order. Nathomin I know that house better then most in Neriak.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They were at least a house that was strong Mallo and Neriak needed that strength.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi stood near, not able to think of something to stop the growing feeling that one of these two men would be dead soon. She could only bite her lip and pray to her goddess for peace to settle on these two.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye before Cynful fell they were strong.&quot; Mallo acknowledged.<br>
<br>
&quot;And when he did it was his pride and arrogance that took him down.&quot; Nathomin spat, thinking of the wizard he hated.<br>
<br>
Mallo's smile was fond. &quot;Aye what pride and arrogance he could have been great a most worth foe. Pity Rallos Zek so fit to weaken him so. But, you were there to take his place. Your lies are clear as T`Vlos was never allied to the Order Nathomin.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We were allied in purpose Mallo.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin's question brought Mallo's musing to an end. &quot;Are not the AnDarim your allies?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No. They are not Nathomin. Coeur de Lion walks alone.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;They are in purpose Mallo, many of the light dwellers follow you in purpose even if not formal allies. It is so between T`Vlos and the Order. Service Mallo, I've lived my life a man in service as one Lord or another who have butted heads with your Lions.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know what service is, but I think you stretch it when you try to claim going to T`Vlos as an act of anything but opportunism.” Mallo turned to look at the bewildered enchantress “Malaehi, how come you to be dead here with him standing over your body? Answer me that?&quot;<br>
<br>
She stayed on her knees, head bowed, still in prayer stance and whispered &quot;I do not wish there to be conflict. More conflict that is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Weary of her evasiveness, Mallo raised his voice in anger, &quot;ANSWER ME THAT?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her head flew back revealing tear streaked face &quot;Because sire the fear of this... he didn't do anything to me. This was MY choice... I chose to end this madness as I CANNOT have you both. Don't you see?? I would rather end my own life than lose the love of my passion OR the love of the Goddess and the Lions&quot; Malaehi's hand reached up to her shoulder where her sleeve of her white gown had been torn off. “Nathomin tried to stop me...”<br>
<br>
&quot;I see.&quot; Mallo's eyes were dark as he looked from one to the other.<br>
<br>
Malaehi stood up to continued her plea &quot;Please, milord, you cannot kill him ... not cold blooded murder.&quot; Her hand settled on Mallo's sword arm as if to slow it or stay it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not cold blooded lady Malaehi never that where Nathomin is concerned&quot; His arm moved, gently freeing itself from Malaehi's touch.<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord Artanos, I confessed my love to Nathomin and then sought to end this torment. I knew you and many of the others would never accept my love for Nathomin. The House of the Ancients will have my life for my crimes, as it is. So I sought... a way to ... end it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo's grin was feral not humor reached his eyes. &quot;I can end the torment... no Nathomin no torment. Very simple.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But I love him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And I... &quot; the Teir'Dals words seemed to die part way through the sentence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Can you even say it Nathomin?&quot; Mallo asked. &quot;Can you get the words past your lying mouth?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have found love with her. Believe it or not. I care not.&quot; Nathomin shrugged at Mallo.<br>
<br>
&quot;Love with her like your love for Ravensky and all the rest.“  Mallo snorted.<br>
<br>
Nathomin could only shake his head. He stared at the High Elven woman like a man in the desert praying that it was really water and not the sun shimmering on the sand. &quot;I can hardly believe it myself. &quot;The whisper was in dark speech only poorly understood but the tone was clear.”<br>
<br>
&quot;What new opportunity do you see here Nathomin? For I believe you not.&quot; Mallo snarled.<br>
<br>
Nathomin's hands opened up in an attempt to reason. &quot;Opportunity for what? Death price by all of the Lions? Most of your band is not as fanatical as you, but even the fair Luniel will have her doubts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi's cry cut off more words. &quot;Stop this!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo glared at Malaehi, &quot;I will not! This is my enemy!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And ever it has been Mallo Artanos&quot; she flashed back.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you say to me Malaehi that Nathomin is going to suddenly not work for the good of the Order or T`Vlos. He has had more masters then can be counted.”<br>
<br>
&quot;Sire, ... Mallo, he has sworn an oath.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Another??” Mallo's laughter barked through the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gods above Mallo how misinformed you are.&quot; Nathomin's mocking tones had returned somewhat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Our guild sister, Sinstara, heard it Mallo, all of Burning Woods heard his cry.&quot; Malaehi turned to Nathomin coaxing him &quot;Tell him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin looked from one lion to the other, the young and the old. &quot;I swore to Innoruuk that shriveled seedless ... I will go to Innoruuk’s own house and pay him for his games. He once convinced me that my heart was His gift. I swore a long time ago to leave the realms of the gods to the gods. Now I will see Innorruk’s house burn.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Is that not enough my Lord Mallo?&quot; Malaehi pleaded.<br>
<br>
Mallo replied with a deep sigh &quot;No, not it's not enough for the lot of the Teir'dal is to hate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin shook his head and continued &quot;But Innoruuk would play games and deny me the chance to walk by Malaehi's side. Well, let all of His followers fall for believing in Innoruuk’s lies as I did.&quot;<br>
<br>
Determined to win this, Malaehi pressured &quot;Teir'Dal are Tunare's children. Don't you see? How can you son of a human and a fellow elf not see this Mallo?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, Malaehi they are the Children of Hate. One of the most vicious fighters I've seen on Hate's doorstep is a Rogue of Innoruuk. It is only a trick.” He stepped forward into Malaehi, raising his voice “I know them better then you, child of Erollisi, for does not War walk mailed fist in hand with Hate and Fear?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin's smile showed that he did understand. &quot;Aye War the Lord of Blades.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi bit back tears of frustration. &quot;Mallo, you see them as the bastards of a vile twisted God, but YOU yourself are playing into the game of this God... You are a pawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Turning first to Malaehi. &quot;Me? Lady Malaehi I'm a simple yeoman caught up in things beyond him. I've always been a pawn.&quot; Mallo just smiled. &quot;But Lord Rallos Zek has been good to his pawn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi had one last argument. &quot;Rallos Zek is a fierce god of war, but war has reason it does it not?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mallo there was a time when I hated you, now..&quot; Nathomin laughed bitterly.<br>
<br>
Turning to Nathomin. &quot;I've waited long for you to gain the strength to be a worthy foe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin's voice was soft as he put his weapons away. &quot;Now I have come to admire you, do you know that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you claim it.&quot; Mallo began to tighten his armor and check is weapons.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is the purest thing you know Mallo? Please answer me that before?&quot; Nathomin's fingers opened the buckles on his gorget.<br>
<br>
Thoughts of Luniel and the plains. &quot;Love is purest, war is close.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi looked as if she would fall as Nathomin nodded. Her hope had grown with Mallo's answer. &quot;I love him! Why is that wrong?!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because he is my foe and because of this.&quot; The wave of Mallo's hand tore the badge of house T`Vlos from Nathomin's cloak as he threw that at Malaehi. Hit in the face with the badge, she grabbed the badge trying to rip in two, as the maniacal laughter rang through her head.<br>
<br>
&quot;Malaehi my love his only proof will be my blood pooled at his feet.&quot; Nathomin knelt at Mallo's feet and bared his neck.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, nay do not.&quot; Malaehi's hands reached for Mallo's arm but it wasn't moving. &quot;I love you like the father this child has never had sire. Don't do this.&quot; The anger in Mallo's face made it hard for Malaehi to continue.<br>
<br>
Mallo stared at the Teir'Dal at his feet, weaponless and he barked &quot;What is this? Get up Nathomin, get up!&quot;<br>
<br>
For once, Nathomin's face was serene, peaceful. He looked up directly in the Warrior's face and said &quot;If my word is not good enough Mallo then take my blood.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo raged &quot;WHAT IS THIS? ARM YOURSELF!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Kill me as you would, Lord Mallo&quot; the rogue challenged him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Arm yourself!!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will not.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo looked bewildered at this turn of events &quot;You have a chance not a good one but a chance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin replied in the tongue of the Ancients, &quot;Nau.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malaehi shook her head to clear her thoughts, &quot;You see Mallo? Nathomin has changed. You KNOW honor as a Lion. Is this Honor? Is this Honor to kill him like this. Dare you destroy the only one I have loved have given myself to?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her voice faded into the wind with no effect on the Half Elf &quot;You'll be dammed before I'm done with you now arm yourself&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Feel privileged, Mallo Artanos and end my torment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo stepped forward sword rising slowly. Malaehi threw herself on him, her hands beating on the armor plated chest and shoulder of the Half Elf. &quot;My blood has spilled for this one care you not? Stop! CARE YOU NOT FOR LOVE!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mallo's sword crashed into its sheath. &quot;Damn you, Nathomin! You might have been a worth foe... one day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nathomin ready to die, expecting to die, looked up to see the armored figure crashing off through the woods. &quot;Mallo! Mallo where go you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I see you not, Nathomin.&quot; was his bitter reply.<br>
<br>
Nathomin jumped to his feet &quot;MALLO ARTANOS!&quot;<br>
<br>
The Warrior's last words &quot;A pity about you...” sounded through the forest, Nathomin and Malaehi each taking them close to heart.<br>
<br>
Just as Nathomin turned to take Malaehi into his arms, she doubled over in agonizing pain, screaming... “Noooo!!” A Koada'dal wizard appeared standing above the scene.<br>
<br>
“You are Summoned by the House of the Ancients, Malaehi d'Aeliu“, the wizard spoke these words as if they tasted of acid. He chanted the words to create a portal, gripped Malaehi by the throat and pulled her into the blinding brightness.<br>
<br>
Nathomin found himself alone shouting “SUN-RUNNER??!!” Wearily he gathered his things and trotted off in the direction of the docks to the Overthere outpost.  <br>
<br>
He was never seen again. <p>Malaehi d'Aeliu - Phantasmist, in the service of Erollisi Marr<br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Out of the dark oblivion... Malaehi regains consciousness. Warily, she lets her elven ears pick up the sounds around her before she stirs. Locked in the dungeon room in the bowels of Felwithe, she has lost track of day and hour. Everything is eerily quiet and the stale scent of smoke permeates the air indicating the candles had been blown out about an hour ago. <br>
<br>
Slowly Mala raises herself from her crumpled position on the floor. Agony slams into the back of her skull and throbs at her temples. She gingerly moves her hand to the back over her head, feeling the dried blood matting her hair. The wound must be days old now. <br>
<br>
Her mind flashes back to the face of the guard assigned to her quarters, a masked Koada’dal Imperial guard of Erollisi Marr. How could one who serves the Goddess of Love cause this kind of agony, she wondered with fresh tears threatening to fall from her weary eyes. <br>
<br>
And there is when she had her moment of clarity... the followers and fanatics of the Gods are the ones missing the point, twisting things to suit their need for power and dominion. Nay, she could not hate her Goddess for the actions of Her blind followers. <br>
<br>
Malaehi slowly rose to her feet, steadying herself against the wall as a wave of nausea came over her. After emptying the meager contents of her stomach, ready to pass out again, she felt a cool draft of air as her chamber door silently opened behind her. <br>
<br>
Mala froze, then squared her shoulders and through her clenched teeth she said “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>If you came to finish your job, then do so you pathetic coward daring to wear the uniform of our Goddess... Go on end my life before I slip myself onto your blade.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->”<br>
<br>
Malaehi heard the sharp gasp from the intruder behind her, as she turned her nose caught the familiar scent of roses. In the doorway, stood the High Elven Priestess Kae, her face displaying shock and horror as she looked upon Malaehi’s condition, robe ripped to shreds, dried blood staining her back and shoulders of her tattered gown, bloodshot defiant eyes overpowering her deathly pale face. The stench of the cell was overpowering so Kae grabbed Malaehi by the arm and led her into the dark corridor, bidding her to be silent.<br>
<br>
For what seemed like hours, Malaehi was led through corridor after corridor, twisting and turning, seemingly going deeper into the dungeon. Once they got to a dead end, Kae chanted some soft words and the two of them slipped on a cloak of invisibility and passed through the wall as if it were air. <br>
<br>
The cool fresh air brought the exhausted Enchantress back to her senses as she realized that Kae had led her outside. Turning to see the pool of water, Malaehi stumbled over, fell to her knees and drank like a madwoman. <br>
<br>
Kae watched all of this with her heart in her throat. Once her thirst was slaked, Malaehi slipped into the pool of water to bathe hissing in pain as the water stung her wounds on her back and head. <br>
<br>
Just then a cloaked figure approached Kae, then turned and whispered a few words in Mala’s direction. The enchantress felt her body levitate from the water then felt the electric tingle as her body was surrounded by the blue aura of a Cleric’s touch. Kae offered her hand and Malaehi walked across the air, approaching her and the cloaked Cleric. <br>
<br>
She heard the cleric cough discreetly, a male voice, when she realized her state of undress. Kae offered her a fresh robe which she quickly donned.<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Will there be anything else, Mistress Kae?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” the cleric asked. Kae handle him a heavy sack of coin and answered “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Just your silence, Vicar</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->”. His head nodded under his heavy hood, then Kae chanted an invisibility spell and he vanished. Kae then chanted the words that would erase his memory in a reoccurring fashion. <br>
<br>
After a few more minutes, Kae turned to Malaehi. “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>You must leave here and never return Malaehi d’Aeliu. You have broken your vow of chastity and attempted to take your own life.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” Malaehi tried to interject, but Kae’s hand came up quickly to silence her. “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>These are punishable by death, child.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” <br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Does it matter naught that I am sorry...that I ... regret EVERYTHING I have done?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” Mala pleaded. <br>
<br>
Kae pulled her close, looking into her eyes, searching... “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Do you? Do you regret everything Malaehi, my child? The passion you felt? The love you made?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” <br>
<br>
Malaehi pulled away as if stung, snorting “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bah, love... where is this love of mine? Mallo Artanos was right I perceive... he came took what he wanted from me. I was foolish to be lead by my feelings... I knew NOTHING of the man Nathomin... nothing of his deceitful past.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” <br>
<br>
Malaehi inhaled deeply and stared off into the distance. “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>So...? Now he has gone.  AND I do not feel at home in the House of Mallo and his Lions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” She turned to look at Kae defiantly “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>He did not even TRY to come save me from this prison I have been in here?  And where are the Lions?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->”<br>
<br>
Kae turned away from the raw hurt that Malaehi was displaying, unable to form the words to make the situation change. “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>It has come to pass, young one. And... you are stronger from this ordeal.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->”<br>
<br>
Malaehi chuckled bitterly “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Strong, you say? I feel ... hollow.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” She closed her eyes and inhaled the cool night air deeply, letting a cleansing breath flow freely. <br>
<br>
When she opened her eyes, their color cooled slightly. “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>My heart belongs to me, and I will never waste this precious gift again.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” She captured Kae’s gaze “<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Not for any man, not again.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->” <br>
<br>
Then, she quietly took her bags and silently disappeared into the night in search of her own path. Not of Lion's not of a man's.... but of her own.<br>
<br>
Kae suddenly felt very, very old as her heart weighed heavy in her chest, knowing that her daughter still had more ahead of her. With a whispered prayer of protection, Kae faded into the shadows of the Castle.<br>
<br>
The end. <p>Malaehi d'Aeliu - Phantasmist, in the service of Erollisi Marr<br>
