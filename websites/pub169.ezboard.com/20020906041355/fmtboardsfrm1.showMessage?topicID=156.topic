It's been fun, and I've made a lot of good friends.<br>
<br>
But lately, when I play, there's this feeling I've been getting.....stress a little, and some other emotions I can't quite define.  So yesterday, I logged my mule into the bazaar, and walked away.  I played around on my other computer, watched tv, read a book, took my son and his friend to the beach, did some contract work....basically all non-eq stuff.  And I didn't miss EQ.  In fact, everytime I walked over to the mule computer to chat with a friend, I would start getting that uncomfy feeling again....<br>
<br>
So, right now, I'm backing away from EQ.  It may be that I just need a break for a week or two (or more)....or this may be it.  If this is it (and even reading these boards is just no fun anymore, either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )....I wish to say goodbye....and that I will miss many of you.

<br>
I think what really did it was I did a /played on me....50 days on two characters.....that's 100 days that I all but totally ignored my son, my family, and me.  <br>
<br>
However, if this is a break , well....I'll guess I'll see you all later then  LOL   I honestly don't know which it is right now....not until some time passes....<br>
<br>
Anyhow, at least for the rest of the summer, be happy, be nice, and have fun in whatever you do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
For the last three months or so I have been going through that exact same thing.  I walk over to the machine, double-click the EQ.exe icon, login, logout.<br>
<br>
I just could not bring myself to play.  I had those uncomfy feelings you have.  I finally determined that mine were due to being bored (since I have sporatic play times now).  The only way to get any amusement was to chat with my friends and give em a hard time for two to three minutes before logging and playing other games.<br>
<br>
Something happened recently though that boggles my mind.  I have been playing for hours every other night...just started up out of the blue.  <br>
<br>
What is even stranger is the fact that I am enjoying it again.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your time away and like a friend told me, &quot;yeah, you are going through your burnout phase, but you will be back.&quot;<br>

Really though.  I've taken weeks off EQ, even months but I always seem to come back.  Maybe that's why I don't have any character over level 37 even though I've been playing for 2 years or so.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Actually when you think about it, that's more like 175 days you totally ignored your son, family, and yourself, since 1 EQ day = 24 hours, but all those hours aren't available for spending time with people because you normally have to sleep. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=227930">Nadime</a>

Just got home after being out for 6 hours, and not ONCE did I think about having to get home quick to do this or that on EQ.  I may come back, probably not.  <br>
<br>
But, to reiterate..../play shows REAL time, not game time.  So, therefore, 1 day does indeed equal 24 hours, which is, again, repeat after me, 1 day.  And yes, I'm aware that some of the time I spent was middle of night, and while son was at school.....but I still acknowledge that I ignored a lot in my life because of this game.<br>

And, to top it off, my 6 yr old is beginning to get addicted, because he sees mommy (and daddy...though not so much anymore since daddy works late &lt;G&gt;) playing it all the time.

<br>
Cal I felt the same way before I left EQ, there was no real enjoyment in the game for me anymore.  I'd be lieing if I didn't admit I miss some of my good friends from in game.  However, I love the amount of free time leaving EQ has given me.<br>
<br>
Everquest will always be a game I highly enjoyed, the people I've met and the great experiences in game I've had were a ball.  <br>

So Cal take a break enjoy yourself and have fun with your family. <br>

Realised i havnt run with my dog down the park in months, Have pretty much quit sailing, and havnt been keeping up with physio for my f0xored knee from soccer. EQ isnt worth the timesink now to me, so I only play 2-3 nights a week, and dont have luclin on my computers anymore so theres no way I can get dragged into 8+ hour raids, or just doing monotanous new stuff.<br>
<br>
I figour it like this, when I want to play eq, I go throw on the first running gear I see and jog for at least 5-10k's (k=kilometre, 1.6kilometres = 1 mile for all you <br>
yanks). Much more rewarding than pixels on a screen really. I think its getting like that for a lot of my old friends too. A lot of my friends in eq have sorta become distant, they know im drifting, but honestly its just a game. People will spend their money, have their fun, and move on. <br>
<br>
The appeal just isnt there really, since about the release of velious I guess for me. Cheapened the game in my opinion. But in a different mood I might say it just gave me more potential /shrug. Just find something fun to do.<br>

No, my point is that a normal person is awake 16 hours and sleeps 8, whereas an EQ played day registers 24 hours, but you're also sleeping 8 hours on top of that.  So there's 8 ADDED hours.  <br>

Been in the same phase you are.  Last week I would double click my eq icon and wonder why the hell I clicked it.<br>

This week I've been studying, playing with my son, flirting with my neighbor.  It's been a good week.<br>

The fun has been lost.  I am sure it will come back, eventually.  Til then I'll ride the wave of life on a different beach and see where I end up.<br>

Don't be a stranger.  I need my /cyber one way or another. <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

I don't have kids, my family is miles away, and my husband plays EQ as well.  I have literally burnt suppers.  I have ignored knocks at the door in the middle of some great fight ( and if by chance I do let the people inside, I make them watch me play the whole time).  I tape movies in hopes that one day I will take a night off.  I have promised friends that I will be there this time, only to call at the last minute with some lame excuse.  But what stopped me from my excessive playing?  Shaving my legs.. haha.  Yep, one day I looked at my legs and they were disgusting.  Hairy as a hound dog.  I realized that I didn't even take that extra few minutes just to shave my legs cause I wouldn't be on EQ.  Now I play when I feel like it.  Even if hubby is playing.  I just say NO.  I am going to watch a movie, read a book, or my gosh .. shave my legs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
Cal, I wish you well.  I hope you will find joy in playing again but at your own pace.  I also hope that with all that RL burdens you with, you will always take some time just for yourself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .   <br>

Anyways Cala, I understand what your going through and just enjoy yourself now...take this break from EQ and enjoy RL and your family. EQ can be way to controlling at times. Plenty of fun things out there to do now other than a game<br>
