If I am correct, the calendar rules state that you cannot schedule events week after week... am I correct?  Besides, you guys hog vox/naggy all the time.  I don't even need these dragons but I have friends that do.  Why don't you be nice and let other people have a chance at it?<br>

This tactic is nothing new - folks have been chain-reserving Naggy/Vox for as long as the calendar has been around. You simply need to be the first one to grab the reservation on midnight EST two weeks before the dragon is due to pop. It's not that hard, and the guilds I've been involved with in the past all did exactly that... they'd have someone stay up late so they'd be the first to grab the reservation.<br>
<br>
Besides, while madsum is raiding Vox, Naggy is available. The next week they're raiding Naggy and Vox is open. What's the big deal? If you don't like it, just beat him to the reservation next time around.<br>

But, it's calendar posting that counts.  And it's set up so that an email is sent everytime a reservation is made, so it's quite easy to go by time/date stamp on the email.<br>

before you start speaking about things you dont know, just feel free and ask Fimble to give you the schedule times out of the calendar.<br>
<br>
I think my earliest reservation the last 4 weeks was around 8am CET (10am last Sunday), so thats 2am EST (if i am not wrong), and gives anyone else more then a fair chance to reserve.<br>
<br>
But please also ask Fimble how much reservation by more then a few days to early he had to delete the last weeks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fimble>Fimble</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator<BR>Master Cobbler</span><br>  Posts: 990<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/23/03 12:45:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Don't go to Naggy/vox raids</span><hr size=1> Of course it does!

Anyhow, why the big problem now?  The midnight rule has been in effect for at least the last 2 years.....at least.  I can say 2 years, because that's how long ago I found these boards (back when it was run by someone different) and the rules were the same.  You wanna get real picky about it?  The rule benefits those in certain time zones over others....but oh well.  Midnight Eastern time is 11pm my time.  I'm either asleep, watching a movie with family, or playing EQ....not sitting at the calendar waiting for it to hit the right time.  Am I bitching when someone gets to something before me?  Nope.  Why?<br>
<br>
Well, here's a little idea....if I want it bad enough, I'll be at the computer at the appropriate time, or someone from my guild will be.  End of story.  It's not like right at midnight Vox and Naggy are reserved.  <br>
<br>
Grow up and quit with this childishness.....it's petty, and you are only making yourself look like a whiny fool.<br>

Fimble, it's the same person that had the issue before right when the calendar went down.  He had inappropriately reserved the calendar outside of the two weeks and then cried &quot;gank&quot; when a legitimate post was made.<br>
<br>
What I wonder is if the guild leader knows the issues that are being caused here?  Somehow I'd like to know whether he/she would feel comfortable with this particular representative from the guild/alliance.  I am sure there would be another that might get better results within the system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=madsum>MADSUM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/24/03 3:06:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DO NOT GO</span><hr size=1> Ahh yeah,<br>
<br>
would for sure be nice if those people which cant follow instructions und dont understand tells would decide to stay away from our raid.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Those Warrior (wont tell his name here), who decided to run up to Naggys Lair (while we did the buffing in the room before on our last Raid), and take a look inside with forgetting to load his &quot;FD&quot;, so he agroed Naggy and got a Real Death.<br>
<br>
Then he started spamming the raidchat that he would need a rezz so that he could help us to kill the dragon and get his shot on the loot.<br>
<br>
We denied, and told him that hes banned from the raid, and that he has to wait now with getting a rezz till Naggy is down, and that he wouldnt get a shot on loot, but he also seemed unable to understand several tells and also rolled on items he couldnt even use (cause of his class) after he got his rezz.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
People like him and several others (which Sorbus banned from that and other raids) may be our enemies which some people are speaking about, but trust me, we dont care about such type of enemies.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Enough said now!<br>
<br>
In case this will moved to rants i may put the warriors name in here, so other raids are warned about him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thraxsilverblade>Thrax Silverblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/24/03 3:56:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: DO NOT GO</span><hr size=1> Xiaro I don’t know why you are complaining, last time I say you at a naggy/vox raid you got both your paladin books in one day.

<br>
The rules state that you cannont schedule the same mob (Naggy/Vox) two weeks in a row.  He is following the rules by scheduling Vox one week then Naggy the next just as Xiaro said in his post himself.<br>
<br>
That leaves you to either:<br>
(1) beat him to the punch every other week as Fimble suggested<br>
(2) Raid Vox/Naggy on the other weeks which is the most you can do anyway according to the rules!<br>
<br>
Whats hard to understand about this?  You also have the option of grabbing them right before a server patch.  Extra shot.<br>

So i read over the rules and saw that i was indeed titled to reserved, and even after i finished reading the rules it still wasnt reserved, so i jumped on the grenade!<br>
<br>
Granted the Sunday i reserved it was Easter Sunday so maybe the typical reservers wanted to take the day off. *shrug*<br>
<br>
Anyways, point being I had no problem reserving naggy. <br>

Second of all, I do understand that what he is doing is perfectly fine with the rules.  You guys seem to be missing my point.<br>
<br>
My point is that we should have a rule saying you can only do vox/naggy once a month.  (each dragon can be hosted by same guild once a month)  This would take into consideration that maybe there are some folks that cannot make it early enough to beat these &quot;top competetors&quot;.  I for one could care less who gets the raids.  I don't care if hunters of the undead get it or if some newby guild gets it.  I just don't like the fact that a guild has the oportunity to take one of these dragons each week cutting others opportunities in half.  Like I said, I myself am not out for these dragons.  Just trying to help others complete the goals they may have set aside.<br>

Ok first of all this really needs to be in another forum.  I understand it pertains to the schedule, but it's really more of a rant about the csm/lada working a lil harder than thou.  Take it to rants or somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Secondly this outpouring of discontent needs to *poof*  HELLO Fimble's already pretty much put the *EOS* stamp on this &quot;problem&quot;.  It's not changing.<br>
<br>
You people are insane.  I've never seen this much bitching before about this.  Hell even lesbian pro-abortion advocates don't spread their message with this much vigor.  <br>

But with me,  I have always allowed a third party make the final decision.  ie Fimble. <br>
<br>
I personally, managed to get my book from Severilous and am in the process of attempting to get Thraax his book.<br>
<br>
I do have a Naggy raid scheduled for 4 May 03,  and if the book does not drop.  in a few weeks,  I will be scheduling one again, and again and again.  until Thraax and others of the Utopian Guard get their epic items.<br>
<br>
At the same time,  I am checking all the zones that have other dragons,  it Talendor, Severilous, Gorenaire, etc. <br>
<br>
But this time,  I must agree with Madsum,  he has not scheduled the raid twice in a row.  It is an open raid as well,  so do what all the others that are after their epic pieces do,  show up,  help out, and hope that you win the roll.  Or else,  sit up until the time comes to post a reservation,  and be the first.<br>

<br>
First off, you can't fight Naggy or Vox if you are over 52.  You get an instant port out of the zone.  So, you get a bottleneck of people not leveling just to get their epic pieces.  Or you buy them if possible for huge amounts.<br>
<br>
So, you schedule your one allowed Naggy/Vox raid once a month...the item you need (scale/book) doesn't drop.  Well hells bells...you gotta stick at 52 for another month.  Umm...I think not.<br>
<br>
I do have to wonder why Xiaro is making such an issue about this if he has no desire for Naggy or Vox.  /shrug - just like tootsie pops, the world may never know.<br>
