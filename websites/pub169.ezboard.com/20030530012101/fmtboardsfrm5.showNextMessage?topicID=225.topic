&quot;Debate&quot; Over the War on Terrorism:<br>
<br>
Question: You're walking down a deserted street with<br>
your wife and two small children. Suddenly, a<br>
dangerous looking man with a huge knife comes around<br>
the corner and is running at you while screaming<br>
obscenities. In your hand is a .357 Magnum and you are<br>
an expert shot.<br>
 You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your<br>
family. What do you do?<br>
<br>
Liberal Answer: Well that's not enough information to<br>
answer the question! Does the man look poor or<br>
oppressed? Have I ever done anything to him that is<br>
inspiring him to attack? Could we run away? What does<br>
my wife think? What about the kids? Could I possibly<br>
swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of<br>
his hand? What does the law say about this situation?<br>
Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing me?<br>
Does he definitely want to kill me or would he just be<br>
content to wound me? If I were to grab his knees and<br>
hold on, could my family get away while he was<br>
stabbing me? This is all so confusing! I need to<br>
debate this with some friends for a few days to try to<br>
come to a conclusion.<br>
<br>
Conservative Answer: Shoot the son of a bitch! Then<br>
take your family to a baseball game, eat some hot dogs<br>
with apple pie, sing the national anthem, go to church<br>
and praise the Lord for one more day of freedom.<br>

So I would hope the conservative enjoyed that hotdog, because odds are from here on out, Nasty nate is gonna want more than just your Cocktail fruit, and guess whose tail the @#%$ will be filling...<br>
<br>
I mean @#%$, if the guy is such a marksman, why not shoot him in the knees so you disable him, but he's not dead?<br>
<br>
Its not conservative against liberal, last I checked, murdering someone isnt a part of either of those doctrines, or was it a part of both? Death never did anything but bring more.<br>
<br>
And before anyone brings up Self-Defense, dont, because unless that person also has a gun (And many times even then...) One can defend themselves without leaving a widow, an orphan, a crying mother, etc. behind.<br>
<br>
Im totally for people's rights to own guns, criminals would get them illegaly anyways, so why not let normal people defend themselves if someone tries to shoot them. But as with most things, there is a down side. Have you ever beaten someone so hard you thought you might kill them? Or come really close to it? Your average joe isnt a martial arts master, so it usually takes some time to kill someone with your bare hands. Which means you have more time to actually THINK about the consequences and brutality of what you are doing.<br>
<br>
with a gun, theres an eighth of an inch and a click. And its over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/udvenmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DvenMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/19/02 5:50:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: and den...</span><hr size=1> Qartum &gt; All<br>

If you or your family is in immenent mortal danger I believe it is an extenuationg circumstance. Baring a fuctard of a DA, you'de prolly get a weapons charge and get work release or probation.<br>

We were soldiers! I loved the old cowboy guy as the Sgt. Major, it was a good departure from his cowboy roles!<br>
<br>
As for the gun =p Well, first off you live in Texas! and by &quot;authorized&quot; I take it you mean you have a Concealed Weapons Permit? Or are an MP or something? Yeah you wont be convicted most likely, because you have all the necessary paperwork and training.<br>
<br>
But I'll tell you, I spent 4 years working in the police department alongside cops, and I once had this conversation with a couple of them about guns. And they told me about how tricky the statutes are, and how very few times you can actually SHOOT someone and not go to jail, I mean, if someone breaks into your house but tried to escape and you shoot them, you are headed for the slammer, even if they were armed. Hell, cops are even supposed to let suspects ESCAPE rather than shoot them sometimes. (unless its something very serious)<br>
<br>
Some of us (not you because you are in a job where you actually USE guns =p), but some of us, base our legal advice off Steven Seagal films, like, &quot;I shot an evil doer, so I wont go to jail!&quot; &quot;Self-defense!&quot; And in a lot of those cases, the shooter ends up doing more jail time than a mugger would.<br>

(And, Qartum, any man would do so, no matter his politics. Jingoistic bullsh*t like this does true conservatism more harm than Ted Kennedy could wildly dream. Where the hell is William F. Buckley when we need him?)<br>
<br>
Whether you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> walk free is up to the courts, and the courts are human, fallible, and subject to the political pressures of the day.<br>
<br>
I can't give legal advice, but if I was to shoot a man attacking with a knife, I would:<br>
<br>
1. Unload &amp; set the gun down where i fired it,<br>
2. keep all witnesses on the scene,<br>
3. not touch/tamper with the scene in any way,<br>
4. call the police on my cell phone,<br>
5. surrender hands-on-head, indicate the firearm on the ground, &amp;<br>
6. tell the arresting officers (they have to arrest you) &quot;I shot this man in self-defense. Therefore I need a lawyer and can't make a statement at this time. I'm sure you understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
At that point I'd feel reasonably assured of walking assuming a good lawyer &amp; no heavy political pressure.  <br>
Worst case scenario: aggravated manslaughter. <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="5">

never been much for hunting, bow hunting is a challenge ill give you that. any other sort of hunting out side of BOWIE KNIFE hunting isnt close to a sport. we got satellites, fake scents, infrared scopes, herd reports, not to mention that a rifle from old (when they had to hunt to live) had like a 10th of the range of a rifle of today. to think some hunters seem to think its still too hard and they need a rifle that spews out 120 rounds a minute to get thier prey. dont get me wrong id never tell anyone they shouldnt hunt, its thier time, its legal, and its a recognized past time. just dont try telling me its a sport or a challenge. oh sure you wont get one everytime you got out so you can say thats the challenge but its not like the challenge of hunting from old, where if you missed you starved. <p>DESEPCHUN <BR>EXILED PRINCE OF ERUDIN<BR>Forever Exiled Elite<BR>Member of the EXILED GATEKEEPERS</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uayerishstormcaller.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ayerish Stormcaller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/20/02 11:02:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  .</span><hr size=1> Make sure you keep the gun and ammo in an easily accessible place, so your kids can get to it if some bully gives them a hard time at school.  <br>

<br>
I own a gun.  I keep it locked in a safe beside my bed, and only I know the combination.  I don't think people should be forbidden to own or carry firearms; I just think they should have to undergo systematic and thorough background checks, and there should be a 30-day waiting period.  In my opinion, there is absolutely no justifiable argument against a waiting period for gun purchases.  I think gun owners should be required to pass an intensive training, safety, and responsibility course BEFORE they purchase a firearm, in all 50 states.<br>
<br>
I also think there should be a limit to the amout of guns people are allowed to own.  Yes, people collect guns as a hobby.  That doesn't mean that you need to own enough guns to outfit a small army of Sandanistas.  And before you make a comparison to other collectors, keep in mind that stamps can't kill people.  Would I kill to protect my family?  Absolutely.  Do I think that people use that sentimentality as a loophole to get away with all manner of dangerous violations?  Definitely.  Do I think that stricter gun control laws would reduce the number of firearm-related fatalities in the US?  Maybe.  <br>
<br>
We won't know until we try.  <br>

<br>
i say if you really want to see a Firearm propelled sport, then what you need to do is have everyone interested draw a number. the first 1000 get to hunt for the season. they fly away to Random_wooded_location_001, which is spiderwebbed with a network of viedo cameras and such much the way of modern day &quot;reality shows&quot; are set up. then the hunters enter the stage. one week, 1000 armed men, whos left standing? it would be a morbid trophy though, what would you guauge it on? ear lobe size? spacing of the eyes?  <p>DESEPCHUN <BR>EXILED PRINCE OF ERUDIN<BR>Forever Exiled Elite<BR>Member of the EXILED GATEKEEPERS</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/utangrisner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tangrisner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/21/02 5:32:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.free3-d.com/gifs/barbarian.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> now THERE's a SPORT!<br>
<br>
to issue a few caveats...   I don't actually hunt much myself...  I greatly prefer &quot;going out in the woods and shooting guns&quot; to any structured &quot;hunting&quot;.   My way includes a LOT more action and excitement...  and no furry woodland creatures have to die for my gratification/entertainmant. <p><html>
