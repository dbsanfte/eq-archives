<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Heisenburg. I'll be blunt. You are nothing. If fruit had an IQ, I'd say eggplant &gt; you. More to the point. Your logic, if you can call what you use, as logic, is flawed<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
we will just skip this part since  it is silly personal targeting and you fail to show proof to back up yer  vague accusations.<br>
and prove  them false by the fact you chose to return and post.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I came here, and I gave <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">pretty straight up advice</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hmm first paragraph? of your &quot;advice&quot; yeeeah ok i grant you that. at least where it applies Omnipotus and hell even to trugwa. tho it is a bit longwinded and filled with just pinch of self agrandisement.<br>
the second paragraph?  Mud does not equal facts and what we are dealing  with here are facts some mentioned some not tossed onto the boards. So we can leave your &quot;straight up &quot; advice outa this this one.<br>
<br>
3rd paragraph of advice? just pleasant fluff to  make yourself sound better.<br>
so  yer advice seems  to be more packaging and far little content.....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>but you, who <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">got shown the door</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> one day decided to have a vendetta. What do you do? You're the kind of guy who posts on a long forgotton thread just like Telena, as it's the only way you know how to *get even*<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again we see you add lots of fluff and try to &quot;spin&quot; things<br>
facts: how did you show me the door? and what color was it /grin<br>
As far as i can recall you made  a really stupid flawed statement in the bazzy and i called you on it.  you were so upset you logged onto yer Main with an FE tag expecting some kinda recognition( like your Main's reputation is going to validate yer previous stupidity?). For a moment i thought  you were someone i knew from the boards not realising you were the moron who had just spouted off some of the  most inane statements i had need come outa of the mouth of an ass in a looong time.<br>
So then you have to open your mouth and prove you're the same ass that was previouusly oocing the bazzy. and things devolve into silly insults. Of course  Now you got me curious as why i thought  i knew you and i go surfing and  discover yer just a damned quitter  and that is why i remembered you.<br>
<br>
Vendetta ? nope we only exchanged repartee for a couple of days on the boards and that was mainly because you showed your actions to be a perfect example of what i despise.....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>More to the point even than that. I have no problem with NL or EG(well aside from a number of them somehow having the old password to FE's channel and being dicks about it).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
?? ok i can see where this has to do  with either topic of discussion???..... hmmmm maybe not?<br>
<br>
lets skip  the rest of  long examples (spin laced with fact)of how great  a guy you are /were because that was /is not what i was targeting and referring to<br>
<br>
except for the WL part:<br>
You recruited people, made them promises, sold them on  an idea of doing certain content,  then after just a few months<br>
you were the first one out the door ????? WTF lol pathetic<br>
THAT is the biggest issue i have with you...<br>
well besides the fact that a quarter of the time i read anything you post or have dealings with you in EQ .. i discover the most annoying combination of arrogance/stupidity/assinine behavior.<br>
the other 75% is on the other hand tolerable...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Heisenburg, you'd do well to keep your mouth shut. You're not one of the brightest of the bunch, and you are by far the quickest to spout off when you think it's trendy. Get a spine, get a life, and good lord, find yourself some facts before you think you're even half correct. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
perhaps you do well to follow your own advice there<br>
and yet again no fact = conclusion just some personal targeting fluff.<br>
<br>
in closing:<br>
<br>
you choosing to post here pissed me off. <br>
 <br>
 i should have left your irresponsible choices in the past ......   <br>
even if  you posting on this topic is  extreme irony &lt;chuckle&gt;.<br>
<br>
Anyways i apologise for bringing up your old history and hurting your feelings.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I agree with sharn, Heisenburg yer a chump.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hvyarms the only thing i can draw from this:<br>
I upset you when I<br>
<br>
A:Called out sharn (his past history) for posting on a topic that mirrors his previous choices. ?<br>
<br>
Yeah should have bit my tongue and made some comment along the lines of  &quot;How ironic that you should post on this topic&quot;.<br>
<br>
B:Hurt your friend's feelings.<br>
<br>
Sorry you're upset.... Make him promise to try  harder to stick to fiction and not claim it as fact and draw conclusions from it.<br>
And he could work harder on  the  &quot;spin&quot;thing as well.<br>
<br>
This is a dead horse<br>
(since i doubt anyone is going to resurrect it with facts concerning certain topic related situations)<br>

We leveled up to around 30 where he sped past me like 5 levels and stayed around that high throughout the rest of the time I played. Well, this has nothing to do with this rant, but I do like curious inc messages. Second, Phal has always been really nice, as well as his friend or brother, can't remember, Alanerus, or something. I don't remember him ever lying but I do remember making a lot of punting the football halfling jokes. <br>
<br>
To sum it all up I seriously doubt Phal would lie, and his guild has always been really nice to me, so I don't see why anyone would slander him or his guild. BTW I always thought tells were useless when ranting because 1, the person would either never relay to the GL, or officers, or they would simply just twist what I telled them and try to invoke the guild's hatred of me. <br>

P.S. Phal, do you really have 8 million AA?<br>
