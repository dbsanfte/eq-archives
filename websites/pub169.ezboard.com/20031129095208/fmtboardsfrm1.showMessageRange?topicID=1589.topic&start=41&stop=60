<br>
1. Burnout<br>
2. Guild Politics<br>
<br>
I was quite an RP nazi in my day &amp; one CdL guild meeting about our membership policy turned into a rather heated debate.  I disagreed with a few issues &amp; decided that it was worth quitting over.<br>
<br>
I still stand by my convictions, but think that the guild meeting was the tip of the iceberg.  The GoB was up &amp; running and I simply did not have enough hours in the day to devote to the schedule.  Like Fogel said, EQ was becoming less like a game &amp; more like an occupation.  It also didn't help that my wife &amp; I were going through dramatically difficult times:  she was pregnant with our first child <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> we were in the process of buying a house.<br>
<br>
That didn't leave the resources, nor the free time to spend dawdling around Norrath.<br>
<br>
I remember the days of the Pride rolling over the hills in droves with remarkable fondness, but thank the maker that I'm currently not a part of that lifestyle anymore.  <br>
<br>
My job, my hobbies, and my family take up the &quot;lion's share&quot; of my time these days, which is as it should be.<br>
<br>
I like games that I can stop playing on my time.  EQ doesn't work like that, and probably never will, even if Verant does institute things like multithreaded dungeons.<br>

<br>
The first, in November 1999 lasted about 4 weeks.  I'd lost my corpse after the Halloween event, and alread was into the xp grind.  I almost gave up on the game, but...<br>
<br>
I came back in December, refreshed and with a bunch of my RL friends that had started playing.  I even moved servers to MT because one of those friends thought the economy was much better here and had an uber friend who was going to PL us back to where we were on E'ci.<br>
<br>
I left again in September 2002 for about 6 weeks.  By then I was tired of being Iillil, fed up with the enchanter class, fed up with this message board and the MT &quot;community&quot; and not really liking the high-end game very much.  I was very tired of most of my deaths being other people's fault even in the mid 50's.<br>
<br>
I returned to E'ci in late october/early november and levelled up my old mule mage in secrecy.  Then moved back to MT and carried on.  By level 62 EQ had become boring again.  I woke up one day and realized how much of my life it had actually sucked out.  I vowed never to let another summer be absorbed by a video game, so I left for good in March of this year and haven't been back.<br>
<br>
There were other factors too.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, guild politics gave me an ever increasing distaste for the game, particularly here on MT.  The idea of guilds, I thought, was that people could band together to help each other out.  The way it turns out is that guilds exist for people to @#%$ each other over, whether it's an &quot;uber&quot; guild controlling a spawn or the dreaded rotation lists, it was too much bullshit for me.<br>
<br>
Second, as Kesin said: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>reading this board makes you want to quit eq anyway.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I have to concur with that.  There's a lot of people on the MT boards who really make you not want to play the game, or at least not on this server.  I actually quit these boards a few times, but unfortunately they're almost a necessary evil to find out what the latest bunch of self-declared leaders have made for stupid rules to control how everyone else plays.<br>
<br>
Third, I got tired of the uberer-than-thou attitude that so many players seem to have.  If you're not decked out in the best possible gear, you're deemed useless.  That makes the game miserable for most people.  By the time PoP came out it was starting to become unbearable.<br>
<br>
Fourth, I think Sony caters too much to the ubers and the top-end players.  The bulk of the fun was in the climb to level 50/60/65, not in the repetitive grinding.  Their handling of class balance was a joke from day 1, and there are a hundred other problems with their concept of game design that all add up to a real pain in the arse after 4 years.<br>
<br>
I can't say I wasn't entertained for all that time though, and I don't regret the money spent on EQ, but I don't miss it either.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qrgauthil>Qrgauthil</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www3.sympatico.ca/pdcowan/squid.gif" BORDER=0> at: 6/9/03 12:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xxmoppo69xx>XxMoppo69xX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(6/11/03 10:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1589.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: For all those that quit EQ....</span><hr size=1> Lost the Feelin that i used to get playin the game, when i used to start it up i got a sweet ass feelin but i just started to hate it and only played because of the people...I Still miss everyone but i have NO desire to come back or even start playin another online comp game, i got my life back in order and got some great @#%$ goin for me. <br>

I just flat out logged into EQ and deleted them without a second thought. However, the reason I quit in the first place, was a bit more complexe then that. <br>
<br>
The simpelest way I can put it is that I quit because I had found the girl of my dreams. And I just could not let EQ drain my time and life. I thought that I had no chance at her unless I made a very big change in my life, starting with paying more attention to RL. I really do regret that descision because of all the friends I pushed out of my life when I quit EQ. <br>
<br>
Alas, I have been back and playing EQ for about 3 or 4 months now. I have met a lot of my friends, but many are gone now or have started new chars. This time however, I try and keep a balance between EQ and RL. I also regret that I deleted my chars because now I have to play as Neokknight (with two K's).<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Silly at times, yes, but mellow nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Being as such, I really don't have the drive to &quot;push&quot; myself to the level of commitment that seems to be required to reach the highest levels of advancement in EQ.<br>
<br>
It's a cycle for me, really:<br>
<br>
1) Start to play, expecting to only log on a bit at a time, and play at my own pace.<br>
<br>
2) Get bored due to lack of advancement and inability to find anything interesting to do, outside of raiding.<br>
<br>
3) Buckle-down and join a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
4) Have a great time, learn lots of stuff, see new content, and earn new gear.<br>
<br>
5) Begin to feel like I owe it to my guild to play constantly, because they helped my achieve #4, and begin logging WAY too many hours in-game.<br>
<br>
6) Begin to burn-out, realize that my Real Life is starting to suffer due to the amount of time I spend in-game.<br>
<br>
7) Quit the game, generally annoy and disappoint those in my guild due to leaving with little notice, lose all advancement momentum and contact with former friends due to long periods of inactivity.<br>
<br>
8 ) Get Real Life back in order, realize that I have a lot more free time than I expected, decide to try playing EQ again.<br>
<br>
9) Return to #1<br>
<br>

Yeah, I have no willpower.

<br>
For three years I had the same partner and friend in the game and I wanted to keep grouping with this friend. This shouldn't really be a problem but we both got accepted into a raiding guild and that meant that when I was online, there was a good chance we'd both be raiding instead of grouping as we used to.<br>
<br>
Also, to keep up with her flags and keys, I would have to be online most weekdays and weekends to make sure I didn't miss a flag. I wouldn't want to log online to see her raid in a zone where I couldn't go, as I always had the best fun when we were grouped together.<br>
<br>
Before meeting my current GF, I didn't have any problems virtually living inside Everquest. But even though we both played the game, I wanted to spend more time outside the game. And I knew that it wouldn't work with me spending time with her in RL and at the same time trying to keep playing as much as I did. Sooner or later it would come in between us and would also ruin it for me when it comes to the game itself.<br>
<br>
Therefore I made up my mind to say goodbye to the game since I also knew how much of my time the game had taken over the past three years. I had skipped family and friends to stay online, something that I am not that proud of today. Yes, I was addicted to the game and my friends online.<br>
<br>
I never regret quitting, though I do of course miss my friends in the game. But I don't miss the game at all. I have rediscovered the life outside EverQuest and am very happy that I made that decision.<br>
