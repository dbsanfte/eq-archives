Anyone is allowed to have strong anti US opinions, including citizens of the US, which I am.  To disallow this is to go against the right to free speech.  Free argument and speech is a wonderful right, you should appreciate it a bit more than you seem to.<br>
<br>
As far as Somalia.  The US did not achieve its stated objective of restoring stability to the region, capturing or stopping Aidid and had to pull out its troops.  It lost multiple highly trained soldiers to rampaging mobs.  This is a loss.  Kill ratio is not a mark of victory.  If it was, Vietnam would be a victory.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We simply discovered that the only way to bring peace to the region was to wipe it from the face of the Earth, an action we were neither willing or obligated to undertake. The region is still as anarchic, violent, and corrupt today as it was 10 years ago, but there's no reason for more Americans to die there.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, we discovered that our military command was stupid and suffered from severe underestimation of enemy capability, as you seem to.  We discovered that high tech does not make us invincible.  We discovered that we were unwilling to commit the forces and resources required to bring true peace to the area (A decision I agree with).<br>
<br>
To be honest, I dont understand you.  You state multiple times that people should go out there and educate themselves but when someone presents an opinion negative to the US you resort to the &quot;don't talk bad about us you ignorant foriegner, you have no right to talk&quot; argument.  I just don't get this.  How can you hope to promote educated discussions on any topic when you tell someone they have no right to talk?<br>
<br>
I'm a US citizen, I pay my taxes, I vote.  I contribute to the success of this country.  I have as much right to state my mind as anyone else.  I love how you try to present anyone who disagrees with you as having anti US bias though, do you think this adds strength to your arguments?  Do you think it adds credibility?  At what point did I say I hated the US or thought it was evil?  At what point did I say it was &quot;unchecked US agression&quot;?  Do you really see the world this way?  Do you really believes that everyone who has a negative view of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>some</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> US actions has an anti US bias?  I just don't get this.  <br>
<br>
Point of fact, I love this country, I've said that multiple times before, and I admire many of the wonderful things it has achieved.  This gives me much more than a right to state what I think is wrong with it, it gives me a duty to speak my mind and try to correct the issue.  To see you resort to &quot;you're a foriegner, you don't have a right to speak&quot; is mind boggling.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I just dont get how you can claim to want to see Americans educated about topics and then resort to this sort of argument. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

<br>
Serious post coming up, and nothing that follows this sentence is in any way meant as a personal attack.  Nothing.  <br>
<br>
I don't think that &quot;everyone&quot; who disagrees with me on any issue regarding the U.S. holds an anti-U.S. bias or is wrong.  I realize that I do come off that way, because I'm passionate about what I believe in, but one of the things that I love dearly about this country is that we can HAVE discussions like this in a free and unregulated manner in an open forum.    Despite my bristling and occasional jingoistic tendencies, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I read all of them and consider each for its separate merits (except for Kreket's--his I mostly just skip over and giggle at, because I'm pretty sure he's deranged and just desperately wants some attention).  Remember, we could NOT have a discussion like this in Iraq...Saddam doesn't hold those who speak out against him in very high regard.  I firmly believe that America is the best country on Earth, for no other reason than the fact that it attracts the best and brightest citizens of all of the other disparate regions and brings them together in one place where the overriding rule is tolerance.  It's a rule that not enough Americans adhere to yet, but with every successive generation we get better; more diverse and more accepting.<br>
<br>
Is that why I think we should disarm Iraq?  No.  There are plenty of Saddam-wannabes clamoring for attention all over the world.  I think we should disarm Iraq, by force, because it's the only logical option that remains.  I belive, and admittedly this is nothing but a well-educated and objective opinion, that Blix will NEVER find evidence that is satisfactory, and even if he does, the anti-U.S. contingent of the U.N. will still bend over backwards to prevent war.  In a way, that's their job.  But realistically, there are times in human existence when armed conflict becomes necessary, no matter how many antiwar and anti-violence marches there are.  This is one of those times.  Hussein is far too adept at subterfuge and bait-and-switch to get caught now--he's been deceiving the U.N. for nigh-on 20 years.  <br>
<br>
I've jumped the fence on this issue a few times in the past six months, but the more information that comes out, the more I feel that an invasion is going to be inevitable.  I've spoken out in this very forum quite strongly against military action in Iraq, and trust me, I'm the most vocal Bush critic I know, but the bottom line is that Hussein is absolutely pushing this as far as he possibly can, and in the long run this whole affair has the potential to destroy the alliances built after WWII and drive a huge wedge between Europe and the U.S.  Nothing would please Hussein, bin-Laden, and the rest of their ilk more than to see the West reduced to the kind of petty, squabbling circus we've all watched for the past 6 weeks.  The U.N. is a mockery right now, and the spectacle perpetrated by France (and to a lesser extent, Germany) in the past month has been downright embarrassing.  The *only* function it has served has been to illustrate how incredibly non-functional the U.N. can be--and I'm not saying that because I think the organization should bow down and pander to the U.S., I'm saying it because it's an inarguable truth.  <br>
<br>
We went easy on Saddam 12 years ago.  He didn't learn, and in return for our mercy he's repaid us and the rest of the free world by funneling money into some of the most notorious terrorist groups in the world and grossly inflating his own personal wealth at the expense of his people.  Like it or not, he's become a symbol, and something symbolic needs to be done with him.  I was about half-serious when I talked about isolationism earlier; there's a pretty significant movement in this country to simply shut ourselves in and lock the doors in light of the events of the past two years.  Some of those events are our fault, and it's been said that we &quot;had them coming.&quot;  Pride goeth before the fall, and all that--you know the story.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't move to defend ourselves and our perception of freedom, and you know as well as I that if someone who spewed the kind of rhetoric that Saddam spews was about to come to power in a country like China, somewhere in Europe, or (God forbid) the U.S., they'd be taken down before they ever even got near political office.  Saddam is a holdover...he's a loose end and a lesson learned.  The sooner he's dealt with the better, and if he doesn't have enough common sense and humility to accept the exile he's been offered, there really is no diplomatic solution.  The man cannot be reasoned with.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the bottom line is I'm tired of hearing uninformed, ignorant twits who don't like the fact that they're lazy and jockey a Burger King counter spewing angry spoonfed opinions.  I'm not saying you're one of those people, because I know you're not, but our country and the world is full of them.  Our government is not &quot;out to get&quot; anyone.  Bush may be stupid, but his advisory staff and his cabinet are top-notch.  They wouldn't press this strongly for something like this lightly, and ultimately I, as an American, have to put my faith in them to do what's right.  As far as overwhelmingly powerful superpowers go, America is pretty damn benevolent--but I resent the opinion that this whole thing is some immature crusade to discipline a petulant child.        <br>
<br>
There's more that I want to say, but I'm tired and I'm going to sleep.  I hope this didn't come off as insulting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fogelxanedu>Fogel Xanedu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1160<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/20/03 12:51:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=106>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: guns</span><hr size=1> Good post. <br>

I'll say that isolationism is never the way to go. We tried Isolationism during world war 2, and we still got sucked in, where as if we had joined earlier, the situation wouldn't have been so grim. We could have trimmed down our losses while taking normandy, since germany wouldn't have much time to build ample defenses, and we could have avoided pearl harbor.<br>
<br>

Also, arguing with Bogga is pointless.  The post about Americans siding with Israel is why all Muslims hate us was eye opening.  We don't support Jews.  We support the persecuted.  We helped Kuwait.  They aren't Jews.  Americans don't ask what your religion is before they jump to help you.  Bogga claimed Americans didn't have a deep history like other countries.  Thats a good thing from where I stand.  That means I'm not indoctrinated into a culture that breeds hate and contempt of anyone else and their religion.  We don't give a rats ass what god you call yours.  The last four wars/battles America fought were for...Muslims!  They tend to go blind/deaf/dum when you mention Jews.  Their hatred blinds them.  Any thanks?  nah.  We DO care if you try to force your god and your ways on us or others.  This includes attempting to KILL people because they worship a different god.  You can see all types of religions being preached on the lawns and malls of any college at any time, peacefully.  That same peaceful crowd would RIOT the first time ANYONE told them &quot; follow MY god or DIE&quot;!<br>
<br>
  And as to Americans not having much history I say this.  Look what we have done in the little time we have had.  Bogga says we are evil.  He thinks dropping nukes was an evil thing.  I disagree.  We were dragged into that battle.  It would have cost MANY more Americans in the land battle.  Dropping the bomb ended it.  nuff said. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vmtankersley/grim_sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I would like to state again, for the record, that I love this country.  There are so many good things about it that it amazes me.  I can list all the good things if you want, it would take a while but I could.  However, what's the point of that, you already know most if not all of them.  Besides, if they're good, there's no need to discuss them since there's nothing wrong with them.  Please take all of that in mind when you read the next few paragraphs.<br>
<br>
I believe that many of the problems in the middle east and the persian gulf (no, these are not the same region) were caused by outside influences.  I believe the US was a large part of these outside influences for both good and bad.  Whether it was part of the cold war and support of Israel or developing oil resources without regard for native culture, the US was heavily involved.  This is neither an accusation against the US nor a claim of innocence for the rest of the world.  I could list the various ways in which European countries have screwed up in the middle east but that is not the aim of this discussion.  <br>
<br>
I believe the US was acting in its own self interest in these actions.  Again, this is not an accusation of evil.  As the head of a nation it is your duty to act in the interest of your nation and its citizens.  All those people who say foriegn aid is a charity are, for the most part, very wrong.  The return on investment on foriegn aid is sizeable and well known in advance of giving it.  Saying we went in to rescue the Kuwaitis out of good will is wrong.  We went in because our interests were threatened.  Again, this is not an &quot;evil&quot; act, it's a very justifiable act by a leader looking out for his nation.  <br>
<br>
With all that said, I do think the US made and is making a very serious mistake in the persian gulf by adopting a policy that is more concerned with short term returns than long term success.  The primary example I suppose is Iraq.  We clearly used them as a buffer against the Iranian fundementalists who, at the time, seemed like a major threat to our oil supply.  Rather than looking long term after the war was over and strengthening those ties, we ignored them.  We failed to learn the lesson of WW1, we left a broken country in our wake and we wonder why they lashed out.  After WW2 we seemed to learn that lesson and rebuilt Japan and Germany pretty much from scratch.  This left us with two valuable allies.  With Iraq we did no such thing.<br>
<br>
Both after the Iraq / Iran war and after Desert Storm, we left the Iraqies to fester under sanctions and conditions that were biased to say the least.  We implemented no fly zones to protect the Kurds while we allowed the Turks to slaughter them wholesale.  We enforced crippling sanctions because of possible nuclear buildup but did nothing when Pakistan did the same thing and paid off Korea when they wanted to do the same.  We said nothing about European contracts for Iranian oil (A country known for sponsering terorrists) but tried to block off sale of Iraqi oil.  Keep in mind, in no way am I saying what Iraq did or does is right.  I am just saying we ignore the same behavior in other countries.<br>
<br>
Now comes the current crisis.  What do you think the US will really do in Iraq?  Do you honestly think we will go in, remove the current goverment and then spend the billions and billions of dollars and the thousands of lives required to really rebuild Iraq from the ground up?  Or do you think we'll bomb the crap out of them and then leave?  I find it difficult to believe that we would commit the resources for a Post WW2 Japan rebuilding.  I find it hard to conceive of our current president ready to accept the losses and authorize the funds to do this.  <br>
<br>
This type of conflict just doesnt work, and I thought we would have learned that by now.  Either we go and we kill every last single one of them, man woman and child (a viable solution but one which I hope no one advocates) or we defeat them, stick it out for the duration and make sure the newly rebuilt Iraq doesnt see us as an enemy.  I dont think our current president has the balls for the second option.  All he's doing is slapping a bandaid on top of a festering wound.  He's not curing the problem, he's just hiding it from sight so his citizens feel like something got accomplished.<br>
<br>
It bothers me that somewhere in Iraq children will be growing up with a hatred of the US.  It bothers me because one day one of those kids will grow up and get their hands on the controls of a plane or the detonator for a nuke.  How will they feel about us at that point?  Will they see us as America the liberator, the country who freed them from tyrany and poverty?  Or will they see as America the aggresor, the country that bombs them on a regular basis?  What we did to Japan or Germany was a thousand times worse than anything we have ever done to Iraq or any arab country, but you dont see them willing to die to kill us these days, do you?  Don't you wonder why that is?<br>
<br>
Sometimes you just have to use violence.  Sometimes war is necessary.  I have no issue with this.  But this, this is a show war, nothing more.  A video game played for CNN and approval ratings.  It's a mistake, and it'll cost us in the future.<br>
<br>

<br>
The points you brought up pretty much illustrate all of the reservations I have about this invasion.  With the exception of it being a &quot;show war&quot; for CNN, I agree with just about everything you said (and even THAT point, to a certain degree.  I think everything ends up being show business in the end; it's the devolution of our global culture).  <br>
<br>
I don't know what will happen after the conflict ends.  It's almost entirely dependent on how long our involvement lasts, and what help we get from the rest of the U.N.  I think if we can shut Hussein's elite guard down and capture key strategic points fast and (relatively) painlessly, that the odds of Iraq being rebuilt and receiving tons of aid are good.  On the other hand, the longer the situation drags out, the more resources we expend to maintain a 150,000-man force at full alert, the less money and compassion Iraq receives after all is said and done.  Is this right?  Hell no, but it's reality.  <br>
<br>
I fully agree though, with your points about short-term blindness versus long-term gain.  Hussein is a direct descendant of that approach to foreign policy in the early '80s.  Pretty much every military action we've been involved in in the past 20 years was launched to remove a regime that WE put into power, thinking it was the lesser of two evils at the time.  We're learning, and the rest of the world is learning with us, but the sad truth is that no one is more qualified to make those mistakes and decisions than we are.  No other superior military force in the modern era has ever had the compassion and concern for the countries it's defeated than we have (and by we I mean NATO overall, but let's face it, most of the time NATO goes as the U.S. goes, with good reason).  If another nation is willing to field the military force and show the same broad-mindedness that we do, I would LOVE to hand off the torch; I'd love to have the luxury of living in a country where no one cares what my government does and we can all sit around eating chocolate all day criticizing the superpowers and not worrying that when we get on the subway in the morning that someone might open a can of Ricin in the next car.  <br>
<br>
With all of that being said, what are the long-term repercussions for leaving him in power?  Does anyone know?  Even the most liberal anti-war pundits admit that, left to his own devices, Saddam would do as much damage to the West as possible.  He's an egomaniacal, murderous despot with a God complex, who has convinced himself and those closest to him that he's some kind of avenging Arabic divine being.  Sure, there are other leaders in other countries that preach the same type of rhetoric that he's preaching, and I have no doubt that sooner or later all of them will be dealt with, because sooner or later they will threaten our interests; it's what despotic conquerors do--a fatal flaw, if you will.  Just ask Milosevic.  Hussein is, for all intents and purposes, pursuing the exact same agenda that Hitler pursued, and that's not an exaggeration.  The only difference is that Hitler was white.  So I mean, what's the alternative?  Should we back off, and continue to let Saddam play hide-the-smallpox with Hans Blix and his gang of pacifistic keystone kops?  Do you honestly think that Hussein would ever step down, or ever stop developing weaponry?  He's already said that he views himself as the savior of the Arabic world and that he believes he'll lead them to wholesale victory over the Western world.  Does anyone really expect him to wake up tomorrow if we back off and decide to turn over a new, peaceful leaf?<br>
<br>
Of course not.  If Bush were to do a complete about face, and start concentrating on the multitudinous issues that we're dealing with domestically, it would only fuel Hussein's fire, and make him even more arrogant, insolent, and violent than before.  When Bush Sr. went easy on him, all he did was use it as a leverage point to consolidate his power and influence...there's little doubt that he'd do the same again, and I'd bet within 5 years we'd be dealing with Iraq as a nuclear power.  Remember, North Korea signed a no-nuke treaty after we'd tried various times to pursue diplomacy with them, and now we've got an utterly insane fascist threatening the world with nuclear armageddon if someone doesn't pay attention to him.<br>
<br>
So I guess I'm asking for alternate approaches, and opinions regarding what's going to happen if we DO back off.  Is France going to be ready to be a reliable watchdog?  Is the unified Germany going to be able to spur the fairly weak EU to keep a leash on the world's dictators?  Can they even field a force capable of winning decisive victories without relying on the U.S. to provide the bulk of the military deployment?  Is Iraq just going to go away if we plant inspectors in there and let them drive around from hospital to university to palace for the next 4 or 5 years, chasing Hussein's tail?  Does anyone REALLY think that Saddam isn't hiding weaponry, and won't use it the first opportunity he thinks he'd get away with it?  Better yet, does anyone really believe that he wouldn't sell such weaponry to the highest bidder, as long as they promised to use it against the Western infidels?  <br>
<br>
For my part, I think the answer to all of those questions is a rersounding 'NO.'  I'm always interested in hearing other opinions, though.        <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qikkiq>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 99<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/20/03 10:46:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=116>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: guns</span><hr size=1> If we listen to the US, Saddam has been defying this, that and the other thing continuously since 1990.<br>
<br>
Why it is so important to get Saddam now?  That is the fundamental question.<br>
<br>
The answer is actually quite simple, and it has nothing to do with oil, weapons of mass destruction, terrorists, Al-Qaeda, Israel, Islam, NATO, Kurds or anything else like that.<br>
<br>
The answer is that the economy was in pretty good shape from 1990 until about 18 months ago.  Nobody needed to go bomb Saddam because there was money to be made in the stock market.  Buckets of money in fact.<br>
<br>
Now though, the economy's in a downturn.  Like Caesar before him, GWB has the task of getting his people motivated and happy... and that's hard to do when Joe Average has just been laid off, his 401(k) has lost half its value, and YOU just got to be president of the most powerful allegedly democratic society on earth by a thoroughly undemocratic process that reveals one of the dastardly flaws in that society.<br>
<br>
So what do you do?  You take Caesar's approach:  Bread and Circuses.  Give the masses some blood and gore to take their mind off the problems at home and they'll stop bitching.  Best of all, if you start a war, you create jobs (soldiers, and industrial jobs to support the war).  You get to inject money into the economy (military spending) without looking like a 3rd world reject printing money.  It doesn't matter whether Saddam is hinding photon torpedoes that he stole from the USS Enterprise... all that matters is that the US goes and kicks some foreigner's ass to take the American people's mind off kicking their own government's ass.  Iraq is a convenient target because their leader is kind of an ass and the country has a funny name and if Adam and Eve got kicked out of the Garden of Eden between the Tigris and Euphrates then by God, no beret wearing fat-boy with an attitude is going to rule there.  Frankly, Tuvalu would be just as good if more than 10% of the US population could find it on a map.  Frankly, I'd have more respect for the US if they'd just come out and say this to the UN:<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, we're going to Iraq to kick ass and take names.  We're having social issues at home and a good little war sorts things out.  We recognize that it's no more important to boot Saddam now than it ever has been.  However, it's CONVENIENT to do it now, it's not a bad thing for ANYONE if he's gone and best of all, anyone who wants to can participate and maybe get some of the same benefits we get.&quot;<br>
<br>
At least it would be honest.<br>
<br>
*THAT* is why the US is so willing to go it alone.  *THAT* is why they're willing to pull every trick to make it look legitimate when they know full well that it's no more necessary now than it was a year ago, or 2 years ago, or 5 years ago.  It's no more necessary for Iraq than it is for North Korea, or Libya.  It's not about oil, the US has lots of oil and they can much more easily take over Canada if they need oil.  It *IS* necessary for the US government to control its own people though and that's what this is all really about.<br>

Across the former Iron Curtain, indignation over Chirac’s rebuke on Iraq <br>
By VESELIN ZHELEV <br>
Associated Press Writer <br>
<br>
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgaria’s president angrily summoned the French ambassador Wednesday as critics across the former Soviet bloc lashed out at French President Jacques Chirac for telling Europe’s eastern newcomers to ‘‘keep quiet’’ on their pro-Washington stance on Iraq. <br>
<br>
Their indignation, coupled with a refusal to withdraw support for the U.S. threat of force against Saddam Hussein, underscored how the ex-communist countries of the ‘‘new Europe’’ are finding strength, solidarity and unprecedented influence by sticking together. <br>
<br>
‘‘This is no longer Napoleon’s Europe but the Europe of dissidents like (former Czech President) Vaclav Havel,’’ an editorial in Latvia’s Diena newspaper read. <br>
<br>
‘‘Chirac is doing exactly what he criticizes the United States of doing: telling other countries what to do,’’ said Guntars Krasts, head of the European affairs committee in Latvia’s parliament. <br>
<br>
The French president made the comments Monday after many of the 10 ex-communist countries invited to join the European Union in May 2004 signed declarations of support for the United States’ tough position against Iraq. <br>
<br>
‘‘It is not well brought-up behavior,’’ Chirac said of the declarations. ‘‘They missed a good opportunity to keep quiet.’’ He warned that those nations were on ‘‘dangerous’’ ground because the parliaments of the 15 western European countries that now make up the EU still must formally vote to admit the eastern newcomers. <br>
<br>
In Bulgaria, which has offered a 150-member non-combat unit in case of war, President Georgi Parvanov summoned France’s ambassador Wednesday in a show of displeasure. <br>
<br>
At a meeting with the envoy, Jean-Loup Kuhn-Delforge, Parvanov ‘‘expressed concern about ... the emotional statement’’ by Chirac, his office said. <br>
<br>
‘‘Bulgaria insists on mutual respect between EU members and applicant countries, between big and small states,’’ Parvanov said. ‘‘Pressure by one state on another should not be allowed.’’ <br>
<br>
French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, in Sofia for discussions on countering illegal immigration, sought to smooth over the controversy. <br>
<br>
Chirac only wanted to tell prospective EU members that joining ‘‘gives a lot of rights but also creates a lot of obligations, including solidarity,’’ he told reporters. <br>
<br>
But as Chirac’s remarks sank in Wednesday, fury erupted. <br>
<br>
‘‘Chirac’s outburst must be understood as the recognition that a dream is beginning to unravel. The New Europe imagined and created from rubble after the last war will not gravitate necessarily around the Paris-Berlin axis,’’ the Romanian newspaper Ziua said in an editorial headlined ‘‘Le Petit Big Brother.’’ <br>
<br>
Not all of Chirac’s targets took him to task. <br>
<br>
A Hungarian official sought to play down the fuss, and Polish Foreign Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said his government respected France’s right to express its opinion, and he warned against ‘‘too much emotional rhetoric.’’ <br>
<br>
But reaction elsewhere was ferocious. In many countries, Chirac’s remark was translated as ‘‘shut up’’ rather than ‘‘keep quiet,’’ only fueling the collective sense of outrage. <br>
<br>
The Lithuanian newspaper Lietuvos Rytas said in an editorial: ‘‘It looks like Chirac has forgotten that eastern European countries broke free from communism and ... will not be the silent servants of Paris.’’ <br>
<br>
In tiny Slovakia, the daily Pravda wrote Wednesday in a commentary that ‘‘neither Slovakia nor any other candidate country will enter the EU to keep silent, but in order to make their voice be heard more.’’ <br>
<br>
Romanians, who have been fascinated by French language, culture and architecture for more than 150 years, snapped at Chirac as a ‘‘hypocrite’’ and accused the French leader of misreading its support for a quick and decisive end to the Iraq crisis. <br>
<br>
‘‘What Chirac ... doesn’t understand is that Romania is not pro-American, nor anti-French, nor anti-German, and least of all bloodthirsty for Iraq,’’ said Cristian Tudor Popescu, editor-in-chief of the daily Adevarul. <br>
<br>
‘‘Did the Europeans and especially the French ever understand what Romania endured under communism? Romania is desperate ... Romania sees in the United States at this time the strongest guarantee that it won’t have to return to the quagmire.’’ <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Chiraq is turning out to be a quite the hypocrite, get pissed at the US for pushing it's opinions,  yet threatens, economicaly and politicaly, countries who dont agree with him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qikkiq>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/20/03 11:53:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=119>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: guns</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ok Qikkiq, so according to that argument the U.S. and the rest of the world should simply ignore news like this and simply go about our business, concerning ourselves with our domestic policy and leaving someone else to deal with the world's problems.

<br>
Absolutely not.  You should not ignore that news.<br>
<br>
The correct solution is to get a destroyer, BOARD those ships, show the world those illegal weapons of mass destruction, THEN go kick their owner's arse.<br>
<br>
The solution is not to tell vague stories of terror ships as justification for starting a war.<br>

If the police hear that you are a thief with a warehouse full of stolen goods, should they kill your family or should they find the warehouse and prosecute you based on the evidence they can hold up to public scrutiny? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qikkiq>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/20/03 11:56:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ayerishstormcaller>Ayerish Stormcaller</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/20/03 12:14:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> If the police hear that you're a criminal with a warehouse holding 40,000 tons of nerve gas that, released into the air, would completely decimate the ecosystem for thousands of miles in every direction and probably cause the economies of several countries to flounder irreparably, I highly doubt they'd just rush the warehouse and arrest you.  <br>
<br>
But you're right, the story is still developing--I was just using it as an example to support the fact that there's a little more to this situation than baiting-and-switching to improve the American economy.  I'm still waiting to hear some alternate ways to resolve the impasse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=435.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=435.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=435.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=435.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=435.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=435.topic&start=121&stop=129>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=435.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=435.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=120><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=435.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=435.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=435.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=435.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5>Off Topic</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
