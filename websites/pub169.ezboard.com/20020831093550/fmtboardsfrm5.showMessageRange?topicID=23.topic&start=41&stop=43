I grew up in a dedicated Teamsters home.  Mom and Dad were both teamsters.  That meant that we spent about 2-4 months out of every year on strike, on average... whether it was because my parents local contract was up or because their local was supporting the brotherhood somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Soooo, for 8 months of the year they got to work less and reap the benefits of union membership.  The rest of the time we got to juggle bills, sell off our posessions and do everything we could, often not successfully, to stay off welfare.  All the while, non-union truckers and support workers got paid.  It sure appeared to me that the union existed to extract dues from its members without providing anything substantial in terms of support - except to maintain the jobs of the lazy sacks who SHOULD be fired but can't be because of the union, and to completely prevent pay based on merit.<br>
<br>
Unions may have had a purpose at one time... a purpose for which we can probably all be thankful.  But I feel very confident saying that their heyday has past, and they do far more harm than good.  Certainly they did nothing but make my life miserable.  I wouldn't piss on a union leader if he was on fire.<br>

So what does that tell you about the company they worked for? The union organizes the strikes when workers aren't paid enough, not in safe enviornments, and the like. Unions will never outlive their usefulness because they are part of the oversight of companies who try to make workers do more for less. Like i stated earlier, unions don't make people lazy. People make people lazy. Its your choice if you decide to work hard or not. If the employees don't work hard, the company can't compete. Not competing = no revenue..no revenue = no business and everyone at the firm won't have a job.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uqikkiq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/12/02 8:13:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re:</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Your parents spent 2-4 mos every year on strike?

Nothing really.  Contracts were typically 2 years, so there's the biennial strike over the contract because the Teamsters couldn't settle a contract about wiping their ass without going on a &quot;We won't @#%$ until we get Charmin&quot; strike.  Hell, in the town I lived in, United Auto Workers went on a 9 month strike because the company wouldn't give people a paid holiday on their birthday.  9 @#%$ months because people were too lazy to use a vacation day on their birthday like the rest of the world, and they wanted to be able to show up late on shift without being docked (I'm completely serious here).  That little bit of mental wizardry meant, for example, that truck drivers like my parents were out of work.  So, because a bunch of lazy arses in a General Motors plant wanted their birthdays off and the ability to not be punctual, I had to eat Kraft Macaroni and cheese for 6 months because it was all we could afford.<br>
<br>
The &quot;off&quot; years were typically &quot;supporting the brotherhood&quot; strikes where the United Pud Pullers of America or some similar bunch of yahoos would go on strike in a related industry and the Teamsters would pull a strike to show their support.<br>
<br>
Night shift in the car plants near where my family grew up are a joke.  Union nimrods show up to work on night shift with sleeping bags because you can't fire their sorry arses out the door.  Next time you buy a North American made car, think about the fact that there's a 33% chance it was at least partially assembled by a jackass who showed up late for work and slept through his shift instead of making sure your car was assembled properly, all for $35 or more an hour...  And when your seat belt detaches in an accident and your skull is flying like an enraged coconut through the windshield, you can sing &quot;Look for the Union Label!&quot; while you wait for the ambulance. <p><center><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/pdcowan/qrgsig.jpg alt="Qrg at play"></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=23.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=23.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=23.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=23.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=43><img src=http://sevendragons.net/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5>Off Topic</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
