((Re-posted, with permission, Nathomin's Story....))<br>
<br>
Time has a way of bringing about change in a person. Be they Elf, Dwarf, Human, Gnome or even the mixed blood... Change is inevitable... and when it happens...<br>
<br>
It started again for Nathomin when the High Elf woman child named Malaehi began to hunt the hunters...<br>
<br>
Nathomin had sensed a ... Presence, watching the T'Vlosians as they hunted. He had felt it, but until it showed itself to be a danger he would simply keep ready. Ready he was, when the figure approached in the form of a Teir'Dal, he did not let down his guard. Too long had he hunted one of his own kin, too long had he walked the blood path of discord to let his guard down in trust. Nathomin realized that the one called Burnssoburn had done him a favor... but only one that could be repaid in blood. Never trust your own kind... Trust no one. Not even yourself. <br>
<br>
And so it was with wary eyes that he watched this one ask to join them in the hunt. She introduced herself as an Illusionist and this was her first mistake. Now Nathomin would watch even harder, wait with deadly patience for the true form to emerge... and when it did... when Malaehi revealed her true form, and the badge of the Coeur ... Anger... and a bitterness emerged...<br>
<br>
From the moment Malaehi had begun to hunt with the House, Nathomin had watched her with curiosity and a wary fascination. As she spoke of her goddess, his mind screamed out that she was just like the others of her kind, speaking of beauty and hiding the ugliness that was truth. Another one to weave lies for the young and inexperienced, leading them home with promises of welcome, and false hopes of being loved as they only love their own... No, Nathomin would not believe this one. However, his matron wanted to breach the walls of hatred, bridging the everlasting war between Teir'Dal and the other races, to take a first step to bring peace between T'Vlos and Malaehi's own Coeur de Lion. <br>
<br>
This in its self was enough to put Nathomin on guard. Too long had he known of the zealot Mallo and his blind followers. Their power was undoubted, their history one of growing power and relentless destruction of their enemies: Nathomin’s own people, and others who the leader of the Lions thought worthy of death. <br>
<br>
Now into his presence one of them came, and this highbred illusionist thought to preach her lies of hope. He spoke little to her for the most part; just watching her as his past had thought him to do... Wait, watch, and let the opportunity come when the first mistake is made, when they slipped up in their lies and spoke the words that would show their true colors. Then he could dispose of them simply, quickly...<br>
<br>
There were times when he thought that poisons could be used on this deceived Elf, for this is what he thought her to be: Deceived, deluded and lied to. He felt sorry for her, and wished there were something he could say to show her that her goddess' love was very conditional as evidenced by her own people. His people were surely shown no love, least of all any tolerance. Yes, he thought a poison would be best, one to make her sleep, so that cutting her throat would be painless ... for her at least. Nathomin imagined the feeling of slicing the soft flesh of her throat open and watching her life flow out of her... Moments like these served to remind him that IS what he had had to do. And the dark dreams that followed him for many months after. They did not bring him the feeling of power that his kind spoke of, nor the glory they said they reveled in. No. No glory, no power was ever gotten from such a death... Instead glory and honor came from killing those that believed the lies of their ancient, senile masters... Those who perused in the killing of the untrained guards of Nektulos, pathetic fools who were sent as fodder to roam the forest while King Thex sent his finest to posts where they did little but seek the blood of any who crossed their path. Xas... yes, for those he knew the blood lust that his people praised... Or so he had believed for long years.<br>
<br>
Change is inevitable... <br>
<br>
Malaehi had shared food and drink with the T'Vlosians, used her incantations to quicken their blades and clear the minds of the healers, and she spoke with such ease of tongue, jesting with the best of them. When she chose to drop her Teir'Dal illusion, the Guild name she wore revealed herself to be of the blood enemy of his lord Cyrric of the Order, and the sworn destruction of those who had become his friends... his family. She served the one who had sworn death to his Matron Ravensky, the center of his strength. This woman’s people hunted his wise, caring friend Ripert Deathstone. She served that illegitimate sewer rat of Qeynos, Mallo Artanos...<br>
Ahh but there was ... something... some quality in this woman child that made Nathomin's mind itch. He would wait and watch...<br>
<br>
Standing in the midst of those who would slay her, Malaehi held herself with pride, not the self-delusional pride of her people... but a self assured one revealed in her stance... More, it showed in her genuine caring... even to those who were her lords enemy.<br>
<br>
Nights and days wore on, the hunting would be disbanded for supplies... and though T'Vlos gathered in other places... still she came. She endured jabs theological and personal. Xas, she endured them and to Nathomin's ever-increasing amusement returned them with the fire of one that would not be shaken from her place.... Aye, so very self-assured. Nathomin had to know what it was that gave this person such power... How had she reached such a place in her mind... without the losses that he had endured, without the tests that he had been put through... He had to know if she was truly what she showed.... Or was it another illusion that hid something even more dangerous. <br>
<br>
She spoke of her goddess' and the grace of that being's love. But Nathomin had found a chink in this... Love... without Passion. For she was forbidden the touch of a man, forbidden the fullness that brings love down from the lofty places of the gods... and gives it to the mortals that spill their blood for the gods eternal wars... The love between man and woman had been excluded from her teachings, denied her. The passion that fuels, that which brings lovers together... that which raises a woman to defend her children from bloody death at a raiders hand, the passion that brings a hardened warrior to his knees, and gentles his hand to touch his children with a warm heart, or a lover with yearning...<br>
<br>
This passionless love... it is a lofty and admirable thing ... for gods. But for mortals, it is a pedestal of the most fragile crystal.... And the hammer of truth has no gentleness... Nathomin spoke to Malaehi of passion, its qualities, and some of its faults... But there could be no way to teach of passion... No way to teach... Nathomin could only show and guide..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11>Roleplay</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
