Billy Bob Thorton(slingblade).<br>
<br>
however anymore it seems that its not so much thier ability to create a character or to interprutt dialouge but thier ability to have a shiny white smile above a six pack of tight muscles. in many movies we have the EXACT same character the actor played before with differant lines.<br>
<br>
take Keanau Reeves, as was mentioned in another thread. now the closest hes ever come to acting was in Bill and Teds, but how hard is it to act like a pot head? <br>
<br>
how about Arnold Scwarznhegeeghiefeefefnegioerghegger? how old is Conan anyways? weve seen him as a russian cop and a killer of terroitsts, a vengeful Special Forces Father, and a dad who just wants to buy a toy for his kid. yet its still freaking CONAN.<br>
<br>
how about Adam Sandler. now im not saying the guys not funny, which is arguably the hardest form of acting there is. just that its always the same character, now i havent seen Punch Drunk Love and ive heard he puts forth a good show, but everything else ive seen of his is like the same character again and again. weve seen he can do others, ala SNL, what ever happend to that SANDLER?<br>
<br>
any others you guys can think of? actors(real ones) and actors pretending to be actors(posers). im not talking on stage either, thats a whole differant story. much more skill required there and many more ACTORS to be found. i mean on the silver screen the ones getting PAID for acting. <p>DESEPCHUN<br>

russel crowe, i dislike him. he gives me a clumsy and plastic impression. i hated &quot;gladiator&quot;, cause it was so plastic. it didnt give me the same authentical impression as alien 1, or black hawk down for example. tho, crowe REALLY impressed me in &quot;a beautiful mind&quot;. now THATS acting!<br>

<br>
... but who watches Jim Carrey because they want a serious, oscar winning performance?.. and who watches Arnie if they want a drama piece?...<br>
<br>
Unfortunately it would seem that 'true' actors are a dying breed, there is very few actors that come to mind that aren't over lets say... the age of 50 ( De Niro, Pacino etc... ) However some that come to mind are Brad Pitt in FightClub, Samuel L Jackson in, well everything he's done hehe, Steve Buscemi ( everything ) and Jean Reno from Leon ( Although I think it's called 'the professional' in the states.. ) there's a good dozen more I could bring up, but the above are just those that jump out from my dvd collection as I glance upon it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now I don't like to bash people because they lack skill or are in this case, bad actors. The 'new breed' of actors/actresses who fit into the category of ' can't act - but I look good on camera ' have perfect roles designed for them in the various teen movie trash titles that arose after American Pie for some reason... And in those films - i'd rather see a pretty face because that's what you expect... However <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... there are some actors who simply annoy the hell outta me - those being Antonio Banderes, David Arquette, Mel Gibson etc.. - I'd give them a chance in a film, but i'd usually walk out half way thru..<br>

<br>
he may have done some independent films im unaware of. though actually now that i think about it, he really wasnt that bad in O Brother. so you may be right there. nealry everything else ive seen of his though has been cookie cutter line rehearsal.<br>
<br>
how did i forget Ed Norton. that guy is a GENIUS. absolute Brillance.<br>
<br>
Jean Reno, totally dig that cat. Professional has got to be one of the all time top 10 films. id love to see a sequal where the Groin kicked Gary Oldman and stuffed a his grenades in his trousers before diving down an elevator shaft to the underworks of the building and meets up with his young ward later in life. perhaps after the Mobster stops giving her the money shes earned. or maybe later in her life where she has taken to &quot;cleaning&quot;<br>
<br>
oh and if you think Arny is a has been, wait til T3 hits the screen. gotta give the guy credit, even if he cant act to save his life, he can make a hell of a fun ride.<br>
<br>
now ill be the first to admit i dont go looking for great actors in those small indy theaters, and perhaps i should. im talking about what sells, the ones getting paid top $$$ to ACT, then dont.<br>

Sure, he's done some pap crap, but he's the kind of actor who's more concerned with a film getting made, and made right, than a giant paycheck.  I respect that. <br>
<br>
Jean Reno is great, but he's not immune from bad decisions either.  I have one word for you:  Rollerball.<br>
<br>
There's a trend I'm noticing to discount actors simply because they're good-looking or successful.  Tom Cruise was great in Born on the 4th of July and Magnolia.  Look at Brad Pitt; he's almost bipolar.  Compare the Brad Pitt from 12 Monkeys and Fight Club to the Brad Pitt from Legends of the Fall and The Mexican.  Regarding Samuel Jackson's plasticity, check out Pulp Fiction, Caveman's Valentine, Unbreakable, Jackie Brown, Trees Lounge, Jungle Fever... <br>

I haven't seen Out of Sight, but neither of the other movies you mention show any range (Brother Where Art Though and Three Kings).  I find him to be extremely predictable and very rarely moving.  I haven't seen Solaris (it opens today in US theatres.. so unless you caught it a sneak preview of it somehow, i don't understand how you could say if was any good in it or not).<br>
<br>
Regarding his not caring about a paycheck...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>George Clooney ... $10 million-per-picture international movie star in such films as Batman and Robin, Out of Sight, and Three Kings... star in the summer 2000 blockbuster The Perfect Storm, in which he reportedly brought home a mere $8 million dollar paycheck. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
On Cruise:<br>
Out of 20 some films Cruise has done, 15 of them have been, essentially, the same character.  Fast Times, Top Gun, Cocktail, Jerry Maguire, Days of Thunders, etc.  Not until 4th of July did he show any range or actually have a character that was deserving of having any empathy for.  I haven't seen Magnolia yet, so perhaps he is good in that one too.<br>
<br>
On Good looking actors not getting their dues:<br>
I think Pitt is a great actor. (I think val Kilmer is a horrible actor).  I think Matt Damon is a good actor. (I think Ben Afflek is a mediocre actor).  <br>
<br>
On Samuel L Jackson:<br>
Basically the same argument as Tom Cruise.  Unbreakable - he sucked.  Jungle Fever, he sucked.  SWI and SWII, he sucked (this is especially bad because his role was small enough it should have been difficult for me to notice how bad he sucked).  Ok... maybe he didn't *suck*, but his performances were very plain.<br>
<br>
So I'm in the minority when it comes to Jackson and Clooney... I readily admit that.  I'm looking for actors that can make me care about their character, that make me feel some emotion (happy when they prevail, sad when something bad happens, etc.).<br>
<br>
I like Jim Carrey and I think he can be a good actor if he wants to be, but he needs to do more than pupt on a good performance in one or two movies (I likes him in Truman and Man on the Moon) in order for me to consider them &quot;good&quot;.  10 bad movies (or, movies that don't require &quot;good&quot; acting) and only 2 good movies could easily be explained away by 1) good directing or 2) good script.  not until an actor shows the ability to consistently get me involved in what they are doing, do I consider them a good actor.<br>
<br>
Conversely, I started out loving Nicholas Cage.  The first movie of his I saw was Moonstruck then Vampire's Kiss.  I'm thinking, &quot;Wow - this guy's great!&quot;  Then I finally saw Peggy Sue got Married, Honeymoon in Vegas, and Guarding Tess and I'm thinking.. &quot;OK - not great pics, but at least he's playing different types of characters - he just hasn;t foudn the right role to really impress me again&quot;.  Then along come, The Rock, Con Air, Face Off, and Gone in 60 Seconds.  /sigh  Hey - the formula worked for Tom Cruise didn't it?  Let's star in some high action movies where the audience doesn't care a dann about the characters they just wanna see the action and I'll be a mega star!  Finally, along comes Family Man.  I'm thinking &quot;Great!  He's bored with the action stuff and wants to show some range.&quot;  Instead, what do we get?  A completely &quot;vanilla&quot; performance.  Hell, Cage didn't even manage to get me to think he cared about his code talker in Wind Talkers.  Sure, he delivered the lines, but I felt no emotion coming from him, just the same pained look in his face that Joey from TVs Friends explains to his acting class is done by trying to multiply 1368 times 13 in his head.<br>

<br>
I'll throw out Meg Ryan and Gwyneth Paltrow both show a decent range and are able to get some degree of empathy from me most of the time. (Meg sucked in Proof of Life and Gweneth's role in &quot;the movie where she was fat&quot; was pure fluff, but mostly I think they do a really god job in their movies.)<br>
<br>
Jodie Foster on the other hand... I know she's won awards for her stuff, but even in the movie where she was a West Virginia backwoods person that can't speak english, I think she sucked.  Maybe it wasn't her that sucked and it was the directing... I dunno, it just didn't &quot;move&quot; me at all. <p>Ishinru</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qkasflah>Qkas Flah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/27/02 1:23:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Meryl Streep!<br>

He suggested pay cuts for talent in Oceans 11 and Solaris to get the films made.  Yes, I did see Solaris, in a sneak preview in Conshohocken, PA, 6 weeks ago that had Soderbergh and Cameron present.  Don't ask me why they previewed it in a Philly suburb, b/c I don't know, but I wasn't complaining.  It's a great film, but most people will probably hate it, because it's a lot to digest.<br>
<br>
Please don't blame Sam Jackson for his role as Mace Windu, because NO ONE in those two films puts forth a good performance, except maybe Yoda.  You can't blame an actor for being wooden when the director's overwhelming ethos is &quot;don't worry about it, we'll make up performances digitally in post.&quot;  If you don't believe me, watch the documentaries on the Episode 2 DVD.  As far as the other arguments, well, it's all a matter of taste.<br>
<br>
Basically the only thing that really makes a good actor is a good director.  Sure, there are some people out there with incredible talent, but great directors make even mediocre talents seem impressive.  <br>
<br>
I used to really, really like Spacey until I saw &quot;Pay It Forward&quot; and &quot;The Shipping News.&quot;  Now I feel like I really need to see him in a Keyser Soze or Lester Burnham-type role before I can take him seriously again.  Another person not on the list, and further proof that this message board is read almost exclusively by upper middle class white people, is Denzel Washington.  His cop in Training Day is one of the best villains I've ever seen on celluloid.<br>
<br>
*edit*<br>
<br>
Meg Ryan?!?!  The only character I've ever believed her as is Meg Ryan.  She always plays the special girl, and as far as range, any film she's ever been in that wasn't a romantic comedy, she's completely sucked IMO.  Range isn't even in her vocabulary.  Courage Under Fire, anyone?  For female actresses I'll take Julianne Moore, Emily Watson, Frances McDormand, Judi Dench, Christina Ricci, Toni Collette... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ayerishstormcaller>Ayerish Stormcaller</A> at: 11/27/02 2:38:13 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=288.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=288.topic&start=41&stop=55>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=288.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=288.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=288.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=288.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=288.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=288.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=288.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5>Off Topic</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
