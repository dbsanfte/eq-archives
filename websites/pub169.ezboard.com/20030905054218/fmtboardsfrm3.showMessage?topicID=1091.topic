Group changed a few members as the night progressed.  Then Jorrell joins the group - a decent player I would like to add - shortly after he joined, some kylong darkmail guantlets drop.  We decide to hold them till the group breaks up or someone has to leave.  Sure enough a few mobs later the group starts to break up.  So we decide to roll on the guantlets.<br>
<br>
4 of the 6 in the group roll on them.  Jorrell's roll is highest so far.  We ask if the others in group would like to roll.  Blabberpauss declines since she already has a pair of them.  The other paladin is afk so we wait and let her roll as well.  Turns out Jorrell had the highest roll.  So when it comes time to give him the item, he says ' o wait, these are lore and I am  wearing a pair'.  I think to myself well maybe it should go to the next highest roller, after all Blabberpauss new this and passed on them.  Then he says, ' let me log on my alt Blurd, can someone go run and give them to him?'<br>
<br>
This is where I got mad.  So you want to have rights to loot an item, when you can't on your current character.  Those gloves would have been a major upgrade for 2 of the members in the party that had been camping for hours for them.  <br>
<br>
Does this make sense to anyone else?  Would you stoop so low as to roll on a lore item you had equipped, and THEN go beyond that and ask a group member to haul them to your bazaar mule for you?  I would hope most of the community wouldn't.  Would a malo shaman grouped with a shaman that didn't have it yet, roll against him for the spell if it dropped?  Hell no.  That is just greedy.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I would like to say that Jorrell has got to be the greediest player I have met; this example of the one track mind he has just completely suprised me.<br>
<br>
I am not saying anything bad about MLF as a guild, but I happened to check your website and notice he is an officer.  Is this something that your guild supports?  If so, please change your motto from &quot;for honor and light&quot; to &quot;for greed and selfishness&quot;  This officer is giving you a bad name.  I used to hold a lot of respect for you guys, but now am not sure what to think.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy those gloves that your bazaar mule needed.  I will never group with an asshat like  you ever again.<br>
<br>
BTW, I would like to thank Blabber, Snorkley, Fare, and Iadan for the great exp group.  You guys rocked.<br>

So, the group rolled on them. NOT just the two people claiming it was an upgrade. But Jorrell is the only bad one. I'm not sure how that fits if there were 6 people in group and only 1 declined. That means he was not the only *greedy* person by your definition. You should know by now, that if you want to do Need Before Greed in a group, you need to set the loot rules BEFORE rolls, not after.<br>
<br>
So, did you also roll for them? And were they an upgrade for you? <br>

<br>
As for rolling, winning then logging in an alt that in a horse's ass thing to do. It is not illegal, but most would find it distasteful. But then again, some guilds (AV used to allow this it may have changed) allowed alts to loot before a main who needed if the had higher points (this is similiar to having a higher roll). So nothing suprises me when it comes to loot and EQ. But as for myself, I seldom loot in groups as I tend to look at those i am with and see if they will need. NGB sucks as is it is hard to tell sometimes who needs things; in a pickup group i prefer to roll and then do what I choose with loot, which may include (and has) passing to someone who can use in the group i am hunting with. If a true need can be determined (which in general can only be done among freinds and not necessarily even guild groups), that is the absolute best way to distribute loot.<br>
<br>
Sometimes Pasq when you are wronged in game people bite there tounge; then it can simmer and boil over and this forum becomes the place. It can also be difficult to catch people in the game as well. I am conjecturing here as i do not know either party involved.<br>
<br>
One question to those of you who hunt in pickup groups alot. Do you state a formal loot policy up front (to include alt loots et all) before you group with them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=litgruvmt>LitgruvMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/03 9:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Jorrell/Blurd of MLF</span><hr size=1> This is very simple.

Thats incorrect.  There is Greed groups, and &quot;My greed before your greed&quot; groups.<br>
<br>
I gave up on the NBG groups after I saw a warrior get a Jade mace in Karnors in a NBG situation, and not 30 minutes after the groups was over, he was in EC selling it.(yeah, long time ago I know, but situation is still the same)<br>
<br>

And I've always been partial to the abbreviated form of their guild name cause MiLFs rule.<br>

though I would have(and have)passed on a lore item that I had.<br>

<br>
It solves many problems. <br>
<br>
Most the time, on even rolled stuff, people are nice enough to pass if they have gotten an item at camp already or have one.  I never make it limited but try to encourage people to share with others.  Its funny how little you have to encourage that but occasionally you do have the person who wants to roll on everything.  <br>
<br>
Such as the caster who had all their 61 and 62 spells who won 4 out of 6 parchment drops at a camp I had once.  Only two people in group could actually have used the ethereal parchments.  I didn't bitch or whine, I just noted to my self that this person was a greedy @#%$ and not to invite them to group again.  <br>
<br>
If you set the rules, it solves many problems.  If someone abuses the loot just dont invite them again. <br>

<br>
So let him.<br>
<br>
Someone has an alt that needs equipment, then that someone should play the damn alt rather than ganking stuff from other group members.<br>
<br>
It's a good rule... if you can't carry one, you don't get one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=81&stop=88>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=1091.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=1091.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.threadControl?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm43">Retirement Center<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3>Rants</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
