<br>
/agree Mallo<br>
<br>
The only problem is that 80 something clerics are trying to all finish their epics at once.  This will eventually calm down.  There are far far worse spawn times for other epic mobs.  We all are getting by without a list.<br>
<br>
Think about it.  30 spawns a month.  There is absolutely no way the server is going to churn out that many clerics wanting this guy for very long.  I'd wait a couple weeks or so and try again.<br>

I ain't the complete, all out a.sshole I tend to portray, but when I am ready to swap pearls and I go to SolB and I see RF Merchy there, I am going to swap.  If there is a line of 20 clerics there sleeping, bickering, etc. makes no difference to me.  The guide has no say in the matter.<br>
<br>
If it's a matter of &quot;disrespect&quot; then I apologize.  Consider it the first real evil thing Drackore does in game.<br>
<br>
And stop whining with /petition you freaking babies and stop with these stupid RF Merchant/AC in OOT/Velks Top group lists.  Like any of em are ever truely legit anyways.

ME FIRST! @#%$ the person that's been sitting at the camp 22 hours, and everyone else for that matter! There is no line, there is no list, therefore I don't have to respect anyone because it's all about ME, ME, ME getting my epic FIRST! I can't wait another day! I HAVE TO HAVE IT NOW OR I'M GOING TO EXPLODE! <br>
<br>
I've been playing my cleric 90 days and 1 more day IS going to kill me because I'm so mother @#%$ lazy I can't memorize the spell, and med 2 minutes to get the mana back. I absolutely can NOT tolerate another cleric in my guild clicking all the wiped out people on a raid. It HAS TO BE ME! One more day without the stats on the epic is going to drive me insane! <br>
<br>
It's going to make you feel SO good to walk over all those other clerics, when actually you're probably just walking over 1 since the other 20 clerics that are there probably have the same attitude as you. The next day you might even feel some remorse if you think about how you would have felt if someone did the same thing to you. It's ok though, you got your epic. It doesn't matter if people think you're a low life loser, you can always go hang out with Broo or something. Then if you are despised enough, you can always retire your character a week later, and never use that epic you just HAD to have so bad.<br>
<br>
I really feel bad for the clerics that want to be fair that have to go through this. Verant did a good thing for once, but there's always inconsiderate people out there that bring out the bad side. If you were on the rotation list, there's a good chance you had several weeks or months ahead of you as it was. Perhaps you should learn to appreciate that it's only going to be days, and stop being such an ass about it.<br>
<br>
Oh, and one last thing. I heard tonight that a GM (not a guide) was going to be poofing the pearls of those who gank the merchant from another cleric. I hope they follow through with it too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then you can email Verant to let them know how special you really are, and that it's not fair that you didn't get your epic first! <p><font color="#cc33ff">Kuroni Panakos<br>60 High Priestess<font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/udrackorespyritfyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DrackoreSpyritfyst</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/15/02 5:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New bottleneck in cleric epic</span><hr size=1> I see you are pretty emotional over this and I can respect that.  Back in the day I was pretty emotional over the rotation until I saw how god awful silly it was becoming yet it still carried some weight because it was what, a 5-7 day spawn?  Now we're talking about a 24 hour spawn and people want a list???  Give me a break!  To justify the RF rotation with &quot;i deserve it as much as the next guy but I can't play 24/7&quot; had SOME bearing.  Now we're all &quot;be nice and everyone deserves a pearl handed to them&quot; which it pretty much is handed to them being a 24 hr spawn.  <br>
<br>
Let's make a list for every single 24 hour spawn.  Isn't Lodi on a similar type timer?  I need a Lodi Shield.  I want to start a list for Lodi!!!!  No more guild mobilize and race when the alt trackers see him up.  Just make a list.<br>
<br>
Hell let's make a list for the whole damn game.  Sorry, you can't kill the moss snake, it's on a list.<br>
<br>
It just amazes me that no matter what the rare and few positive changes VI comes out with...some people just don't feel it's good enough and want to form more &quot;lines&quot;.  <br>
<br>
And if a GM poofed my pearl, then the email I got from VI saying there is no list would be forwarded right back to them and I'd get said pearl back because I would not be breaking any VI policy.  The email:<br>

Is you not respecting a cleric who has taken the time to sit there for the merchant and you show up in time for him to spawn and play &quot;it's a race to the mercant&quot; whoever turns in first gets it.<br>
<br>
That additude is what is going to cause problems.  The fact that you have no intention of showing respect to someone who has taken the time to sit there, because it is important to them.<br>
<br>
Anyone else on this server that has done anything similar to this, you have jumped on the band wagon and done everything you could to get them blacklisted, and yet as you state your intentions, you are no better then they are.<br>

Comparing this to Lodi is not the same. You don't turn something in to Lodi, you have to kill him. If you want to compare other mobs, how about this: Let's say you're in an experience group somewhere, then I come along with my group, follow your group around,  and we damage every single mob your group is trying to pull before you do.

Ok, I can't compare it to Lodi because I dont turn anything in to Lodi, just kill him.  Yet you make the same type of comparison with following my group around with PnP.  Please to make up your mind.<br>
<br>
I have plenty of common decency with respect to other players thank you very much.  I don't bust into camps, PnP mobs, etc.  However, I am saying this in different wording:  I do not, will not, and never will recognize the RF Merchant as a campable mob!  He's on a 24 hour spawn that you DO NOT FIGHT.  <br>
<br>
Now the only time I can see there EVER being a problem is when yer asleep at the wheel.  Don't cry me a river cuz I'll build a dam.  If I walk in and see it up, I will approach it like I approach every other quest giving mob/sale merchant in the game.  If yer camping it, be wide awake.  <br>
<br>
Now regardless of how you look at it (ie a turn in NPC or an encounter mob) the end result is the same.  First to &quot;engage&quot;, first to get it.<br>

So if we're going to label people that go solely by ROE just ONE time and we then treat them with the same respect....don't make it JUST me bud because I got the balls to come forward and tell you I will not respect a stupid f.ucking list for a non-combat quest mob.  Make sure you include each and every person that &quot;ganks&quot; the kill-and-loot mobs too.  You showing this philosophy to the ONA folks that killed VS out of rotation?<br>
<br>
Ya'll want to make an RF merchy list?  Go for it.  Make a list for that Cabalis &lt;sp?&gt; mob for the Chanter epic too.  Hell let's bring back the Trak and VS rotations, and let's make some lists for Lodi and Stormfeather.  Wait!  Inny and planar gods too!!! They need to be on a list.  <br>
<br>
List or not...if he's up, no one must want him cuz he wouldn't be up.  If I do get desperate enough for my epic where I would want to sit and camp him for hours on end, it would never happen for I would never stay online for 24 hours.  I will be the last cleric on MT with epic...no matter to me.  Whatever guild I might be in will have clicker clerics...I'll cover the after-rez heal and buffs.<br>

It's a sad state of affairs when a cleric comes to find another cleric there before them and forces them to random with the aid of a GM, or races to see who can click fastest to do the exchange like some would-be looter trying to jump on a corpse the instant it unlocks.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If I walk in and see it up, I will approach it like I approach every other quest giving mob/sale merchant in the game. If yer camping it, be wide awake.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I ain't the complete, all out a.sshole I tend to portray, but when I am ready to swap pearls and I go to SolB and I see RF Merchy there, I am going to swap. If there is a line of 20 clerics there sleeping, bickering, etc. makes no difference to me. The guide has no say in the matter.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now regardless of how you look at it (ie a turn in NPC or an encounter mob) the end result is the same. First to &quot;engage&quot;, first to get it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And if a GM poofed my pearl, then the email I got from VI saying there is no list would be forwarded right back to them and I'd get said pearl back because I would not be breaking any VI policy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have plenty of common decency with respect to other players thank you very much.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep, you're obviously a real respectful kinda player. Your comments, particularly your repeated references to how dissing the other clerics wouldn't be against official rules of engagement make this abundantly clear.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;List or not...if he's up, no one must want him cuz he wouldn't be up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep, I'm sure those clerics waiting at the spawn are there for their health...? They couldn't be sitting there because they're in a sticky situation with a GM hanging over their heads, forcing them to random and maybe even worrying them about official warnings on their accounts or poofing their piece or anything like that. They don't want him! Who knows why they're there, or why they were there before you were there, they must have been singing Christmas carols and passing around the egg nog or something.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If I do get desperate enough for my epic where I would want to sit and camp him for hours on end, it would never happen for I would never stay online for 24 hours.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know you're capable of forming this thought, since you typed the above quote yourself, so what's the problem? If you're not willing to do the same legwork as a_cleric2044, you don't deserve it as much as they do. If you're a respectful player, back off the people who have been there longer than you and have a little respect, why is this difficult to grasp? <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If people were doing this in the first place, there would be no GM involvement in SolB for you to complain and email Sony about</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. You think 24 hours is a big deal? Then don't diss the cleric that's been there for 24 long and hard hours straight when you stroll in and he pops. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/udrackorespyritfyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DrackoreSpyritfyst</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 447<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/16/02 2:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=93>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New bottleneck in cleric epic</span><hr size=1> Label me the monster if you will, but at least I stand before the entire community today and say I will not respect a list!  Bottom line.  A.sshole, disrespecting player, ganker, KSer, whatever you want to classify me...I will not respect a list.  I also do not consider this a camp.  I refuse to.  No loot, no exp, it sells items, you give it an item to get a new item.  I haven't seen the latest e-zine from the MT-Campers R Us group that described in detail what is and is not a campable mob, but never before the patch was RF Merchy camped to the point where people felt the need to bicker, whine, bish, and complain to the point where a Guide had to make a forced roll or list.<br>
<br>
Yes, I *WILL* walk in, I *WILL* swap my pearl if I get the opportunity, and then I *WILL* gate out.  If there are zero clerics there, great.  If there are 50 clerics there, oh freaking well!<br>
<br>
I deserve my epic, sport.  Just because some unemployed, stay at home with no responsibilities whatsoever player can afford to pick his nose at his computer for 24 hrs doesn't give him more right to it then I do.  I pay my $13 just like he/she does.  And listen closely...as this was the arguement from people in FAVOR of rotations, I use it in favor of a no-list...since I pay it, and I play it, and I did the leg work to get to that point, I deserve it just as much, no more no less, then Johnny Sit-at-camp-for-24-hrs.  <br>
<br>
And come on Corky, people are posting the times the damn mob was despawned anyways.  You really think I'm the only one that would walk in an hour or so earlier vs sit there for 24+ hrs?  I'm just the one voicing it.<br>
<br>
I don't KS, I don't disrespect people's camps for exp/loot mobs, and I surely don't brag about being the master of the gank or causing the ultimate train that runs over any poor fool to be in the way.  Yea I'm a real mean guy on MT.  MT.com yea...prolly.  In game, not really.<br>
<br>
Don't bring the Broo situation into this Lucy.  This is a totally different situation.  1) He didn't pre-announce his intentions, 2) What he did he did to a loot giving mob that requires a kill, not a trade and 3) This hasn't happened, yet.  I may not ever happen.  Who knows?  Time will only tell.  But at least you know where I stand on it and chances are good I'll be the first one to post that I did it if it happens.<br>
<br>
I don't know ya (though my brain is telling me i know yer name from somewhere about something, dunno if it's good or bad cuz, i just cant place it) and thus since I don't know ya, I am sure you are a fine player that helps many and goes out of his way for friends...yadda yadda yadda.  It's a disagreement that will never turn into an agreement or compromise.  Just settle it there.  Ya'll aren't gonna change yer minds, and I ain't gonna change mine. <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

What's been happening to other clerics is one is there, and more show up. When the others show up, they don't respect the fact that someone else was there first so someone ends up petitioning. If RF pops and the gm still hasn't arrived (if there is a petition in already, the gm has stated that if someone turns in their pearl they'll take it away - from what I've heard), this leaves an open window for anyone to turn in the pearl. This would be the opportunity Drackore could take to gank the other cleric.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy to see all the clerics getting their epics. Although, it's not a timely fashion when one has been sitting there 22 hours, gets ganked, and then has to do it again. This is why I'm so against Drackore's  inconsiderate attitude towards the others who are doing the extra effort of a full camp on RF. I'm also against the jackass clerics who petition and participate in the rolls when they know damn well they weren't there first.<br>
<br>
As the days go by this won't happen so much, but in the beginning it was amazing the lengths people would go to in order to get that pearl. Just completely unreal.<br>

So being the unemployed with no responsibilities makes that decision to sit and camp 24 hrs easier for you to do.  Congrats.<br>
<br>
The exp thing was an excellent counter given the weak stance I took with it.  Kudos.<br>
<br>
I found the &quot;kiss my ass&quot; comment a bit out of line though, considering the amount of time I spent happily partaking in the farming aspect to help you and other DM clerics get shards so ya'll could get the epic in question.  We disagree on this one very small subject and that's fine, but wow Tin.  I guess that's true gratitude.  Instead of walking past one cleric to turn in a pearl is a lot worse the telling another that was part of a group that helped you farm shards to &quot;kiss your ass&quot;.<br>

They are different events - if she said that to you Drack regarding your help (such as not needing it but thanks for the shards kind of thing), you'd have a right to be upset.<br>
<br>
But, as I think you're finding out, most clerics and other players feel the same way on your attitude of &quot;I'm gonna do what I want when I want&quot;, that's what she said the comment towards.<br>
<br>
I personally don't think it's necessary that more than one person is actually there in Solb camping the mob.  I'm still hopeful it could go back to the way it was before:  just call a camp check; if no answer, go back and see; if merchant claimed or someone is at camp-but missed CC, leave and try again another day.<br>
<br>
The merchant now shouldn't be staying up more than a min or so after he spawns (only reason he might be up that long is if someone was going/coming back from LD OR there are players like yourself who force discussions on the topic while waiting for him to spawn). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/usansisymt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sansisy MT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/17/02 11:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm7.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New bottleneck in cleric epic</span><hr size=1> Ya, know Drack even after I got may shards I returned to SF to help you get yours, I gave up on working on 60 although I was only 3 blues away.<br>

But, your statement is saying that even if I was sitting there you would walk in and in your pearl, and that is wrong, no matter how you justify it.<br>

You are the one that made the statement about being unemployed and did it in a degrading way.  So what if I am a housewife who can take the time to sit there.  That gives you no right to belittle what I do, or to say you have the right to step in and swap your pearl before I do.<br>

So, even though you were part of the people in SF pharming for the shards, you state here that you are more important in this game to turn in your pearl and degrading my choice of profession.  So yes I will tell you to kiss my ass. <p><CENTER>
