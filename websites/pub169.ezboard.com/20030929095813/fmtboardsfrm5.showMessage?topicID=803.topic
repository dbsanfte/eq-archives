On the other hand, our past is littered with witch burning, native american slaughter and a pervasive fascination with death.<br>

I think that's what's going on, anyways. Our US culture finds death less threatening than sex. I mean, once the bad guy is dead, its all over, right?

They don't want to lose money releasing a rated X film, and the producers don't want to compromise the integrity by making cuts to secure an R-rating.  Let's face it, though--the film has a scene in which a 16-year-old ejaculates into the camera, and it's real.  It also has other scenes of graphic sex...there's no way the MPAA is going to grant it an 'R' with that content.  I still think it's a good flick, and it's very honest and visceral about teenage sexuality, but there are scenes that are basically pornographic in nature. <br>
<br>
Overall, I agree though--the bass-ackwards tendency we have in this country to glorify violence and criminalize sexuality is pretty embarrassing.  Has anyone else seen the trailer for that show &quot;Threat Matrix?&quot;  Aside from looking utterly awful, it basically glorifies the ability of the government to totally violate civil liberties in the interest of national security.  The tagline is something like &quot;their authority is unquestioned, their jurisdiction is boundless...&quot;  Super!  Why not just call it &quot;Patriot Act:  The Series&quot;?

<br>
Although i can't say that i liked Ken Park. I am a Larry Clark fan though but i do belive he wen't abit too far in this one. It seems to be a trend to chock people with very visual sex scenes. Take Baisse moi, irreversible and now Ken park as an example. The scenes are no longer good, just chocking. In Kids larry clark managed to make both a chocking scene and a good one when Casper more or less rapes Jenny(While sleeping). The clip is painfully long but its not really visual. Same thing with Tod Solondz movie Storytelling. Where the pedophile teacher gets a student home and have sex with her in a not very romantic way. <br>
 But murder should be more chocking than a sex scene ever could be. I mean one should be more chocked watching the scene in Hannibal where Lector fries Ray Liottas characters brain and feeds it to him than showing an erect penis. Its natural to see someone blow the brains out of a person in a movie but it would be unnatural for a woman to not cover up her whole body with her quilt when she wakes up.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqfaces.com/photos2/broken.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sourrrevenge>Sourr Revenge</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/26/03 10:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=803.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> That brings me up to a little &quot;equality&quot; discussion I had with a woman I worked with last year.  Topless women.<br>
<br>
She wasn't attractive by any stretch of the imagination (and my imagination can stretch when I want it to, but there ARE limits).  She was pissy that men could walk around shirtless but she couldn't.  Personally I woulda preferred she had a bag on her head, but I am getting off the subject.<br>
<br>
She wouldn't hear that breasts have been long considered objects of &quot;desire&quot; in regards to sex organs.  She wouldn't hear that good, upstanding businesses like Topless Strip Joints would go out of business along with BigHooters.coms, harming the economical balance of America.<br>
<br>
What did shut her up though was (somehow, somewhere, someone knocked her up...poor fool) when I said &quot;Would you want some sick pervert staring at yer daughter's chest when she is 13 and running around with her shirt off?&quot;<br>
<br>
So that got me thinking with ya'll talking about sex being more dangerous in Big Brother's eyes then violence.  When you think about it, and look around at our society, it really IS more dangerous.  Look at the scandal that his the Catholic Church these past few years.  The defrocked priest in Mass. that got strangled to death by an inmate (some are calling him a hero).  The debate about homofags and equal rights and having their own publically funded high school.  People pass off death as inevitable.  We're all going to die.  Either from biogenetically engineered corn that causes cancer, pollution, ripping the ozone apart and baking our skin off, drunk driving accident, or all out muder.<br>
<br>
What is going to sell most?  A porno with the Olson Twins on their 18th birthday, a documentary that shows real footage of the Hussein son's torture and murder of dozens of innocents, or the DVD release of &quot;Touched By an Angel&quot;?<br>
<br>
We are a desensitized society in terms of violence.  We damn near see it every day on TV, the net, and in real life.  We see sex everyday too, but we are still &quot;fanatical&quot; about it because there are still too many people that &quot;taboo&quot; it.<br>
<br>
The movie Animal House (now out on DVD...WOOT) is a work of art because it combines sex and violence.  <br>
<br>
The point to all this?  Get laid, go to a bar, drink yerself stupid, and get into a fight.  You'll feel better in the morning.  And if you can tape it, I am sure it can be a sequal to Bowling for Columbine.  At least Cads would watch it. <p>Yer either on the right side of the fence, or the wrong side of my shotgun.<br>

Thats insightful, and a good point.<br>
<br>
In Ohio, any woman can legally walk around with no shirt on. Ive only really seen it done once, and that was two girls and a guy, all topless, walking down High street campus district. Traffic was crazy for awhile, cause these two were hot...<br>
<br>
The only reason this country is so puritanical about sex is MOST OF THE FOUNDERS WERE HARD PROTESTANTS. As long as the right wing keeps pulling the strings, through positions of power or through the voting majority, nothings going to change.<br>

<br>
A couple points of thought for yal to talk about:<br>
<br>
<br>
a)  While a lot of children play video games, the growing majority of those buying and playing video games are 21+ (those of us that have grown up with Video Games).<br>
<br>
b)  Less than 1% of all marketed video games have sexually explicit content (and all such games with sexually explicit content appear on PC, not console systems).<br>
<br>
c)  The video game industry uses a rating system and suggests that parents who buy video games for their children become familiar with said system and use it when making purchase decisions.  Many retail outlets are restricting sales to children based on the rating system, while a few are not selling M (+17 yo) rated games at all.<br>
<br>
d)  Politicians like to attack popular games that include violence (GTA: VC? what's that?)...  But you never hear them talking about some of their less popular, yet more violent counterparts.  Remember the uproar over Mortal Kombat in the early 90s?  How come none of the politicians complained about Time Killers (a much more violent game in which players kept fighting after having limbs detatched, that was in the arcades around the same time as the MK controversy)?  Because it was a crappy game and noone played it. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/vmtankersley/eyeofknobbysig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Knobby:  I played Time Killers, and it was a bad game.  But on that topic, does anyone remember Slaughter House.  It was basically a side scroller where you played Jason (yes with hockey mask)  and you went thru decorating the scenery with blood of the mosters your were killing as you progressed thru the levels.  I loved that game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
