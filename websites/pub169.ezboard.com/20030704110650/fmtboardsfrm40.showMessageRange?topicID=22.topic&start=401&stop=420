Unless you're in Triune, Fury's Edge or Reviction, you will more than likely start seeing more of the members of the Evil Raiders beginning on June 11th!  Why?  Because of changes in the new patch on that day.  Here are the most important changes that will improve game play for all:<br>
<br>
3) Group experience bonus increasing dramatically. We've been testing this on the Test server for a few weeks, and some final tuning may be needed before it is released. The goal is to dramatically improve the experience gained by groups. The old group experience bonus ranged from 2% to 20% for a 6 person group. The new bonus will range from 20% to 80%. In addition, the 6th person added to a group will not count when experience is divided. This means that in a group of 5 the total experience is divided by 5 then distributed to each member. A group of 6 will also only have the total experience divided by 5 before it is distributed to each member. Due to this large increase in group experience, we will be reducing the experience modifier given in Planes of Power zones. Those zones had a dramatic experience bonus. These zone-specific experience changes are more than offset by the increased group bonus. <br>
<br>
4) Experience range increase for characters above 60th level. This is another change that we are testing and anticipate moving to the Live servers. It will open up many of the &quot;old world&quot; zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be &quot;blue&quot; to a level 65 character has increased as far as level 50, with the &quot;light blue&quot; range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still going to be for fighting things around and above your level. This will open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo. <br>
<br>
5) Shared bank vault will be added. There are times when a player wants to trade items from one character to another. In the past making such a trade may have included dropping items on the ground or asking a friend to hold them for you. To make such trades more convenient, we are adding two shared bank slots to the interface. Any character on the same account and server can access these extra bank slots. No-Drop items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time. <br>
<br>
6) Planes of Power access changes will be implemented. Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <br>
<br>
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <br>
<br>
Level 55 and over <br>
Plane of Storms <br>
Plane of Torment <br>
Plane of Valor <br>
Crypt of Decay <br>
<br>
Level 62 and over <br>
Bastion of Thunder <br>
Halls of Honor <br>
<br>
Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have. <br>
<br>
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is. <br>

Please read my response to the question about Truyth.  You obviously cannot read very well as I have already responded about him.  If you look back a few pages, you will see my quote about the link that talks about Truyth:<br>
<br>
Again, no proof as usual<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 The link you have provided doesn't show anything. It simply shows a character that used to be in a guild and is now in another guild. There is nothing wrong with a character moving from one guild to another.<br>
Besides, this is one character, not a entire guild of characters that has moved like you see with Thunderwalkers. Are you saying Thunderwalkers is one person because they all left their guild? They always go around to the same places and sometimes all come into the game at the same time?<br>

Best addition to the game!  Those in higher guilds will be moving on to the higher tiers while the lower guilds will be able to pick up the Spectral Parchments and not have to pay the riduculous prices set by Furiousmule and the other stupid wanna-be sellers that don't know how to sell in the bazaar for the high level 63 to 65 spells.  The prices will be going down dramatically for those spells very soon.  If you didn't sell your 'Hand of Virtue' or 'Malos' spell, you're going to be wasting your time trying to sell it at ridiculous prices. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kkonnanshadowwalker>Kkonnan Shadowwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#628CBC>(6/9/03 6:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Patch June 11th will be glorious!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Those in higher guilds will be moving on to the higher tiers while the lower guilds will be able to pick up the Spectral Parchments and not have to pay the riduculous prices set by Furiousmule and the other stupid wanna-be sellers that don't know how to sell in the bazaar for the high level 63 to 65 spells. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You have done no such thing, you posted a link to complete auctions in their entirety for Morell-Thule.  I went through that list and pulled out all the character auctions to help you out some.  No rangers on that list.  I am a ranger.  Please explain.<br>
<br>
Please take a reading comprehension course.<br>

How you manage to get that as a guild move is beyond any realm of logic.  Please explain.<br>
<br>
<br>
And stop trying to sidetrack the topic with news of the upcoming release, that has no relevance.<br>

Explanation for Exidor and any other inquiring minds...<br>
<br>
Truyth used to be in the Evil Raiders guild.  He's no longer in the guild.  The link you have provided has shown the same thing.  What more do you need to know?  Are you so idiotic that you can't read?  I have said this several times.  He left because he wanted to.  What's wrong with that?  I've said several times that players leave and join other guilds all throughout the game.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=exidorgangleri>Exidor Gangleri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#628CBC>(6/10/03 10:01 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.augustweb.com/~mwhite/MovingWolf.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Exidor and his fixation with Truyth...</span><hr size=1> I'm not the one with the reading problem.<br>

What is it about this line from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Return of Truyth</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> thread that you don't understand?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I would like everyone to know that I'll be playing Truyth again. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That clearly indicates the previous owner of the character has reclaimed it and is playing it again.  Not just a move from one guild to another.  So get your head out of the sand or the pile of dung, or whatever it may be in.<br>
<br>
<br>
Boy, I wish I could make a signature just for this thread for it would keep me from having to repeat this question...<br>

<br>
And I am sure you have the proof that this took place correct?  Because if you don't, then it's conjecture and slander (no libel, gah which is the written form?)<br>
<br>
I'm guessing, since you think this is true, you must know the previous owner, know when this took place, so you'd know it wasn't the original owner who may have died, eh?<br>
