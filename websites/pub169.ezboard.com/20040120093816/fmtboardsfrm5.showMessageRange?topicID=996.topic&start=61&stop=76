Do you speak about population?<br>
North-East of France have also large muslim community.<br>
<br>
I was speaking about headquarter and terrorism 'web' (organisation).<br>
In this case Paris aera seems pretty more active than Marseille one (refering to police actions against terrorists)<br>
London, is well know as Muslim organisation headquarter (not only about terrorism matter)<br>

Zut! (A French Chute!) I think if France seemed more cooperative, in word and deed, and worked on solving Iraqi problems, like they seem to be starting to do, we would have fewer problems. French networks in Africa, and the Mideast would be invaluable, as a partner in defeating terrorism, and behind the scenes for intelligence.<br>
<br>
I think an execellent outcome, and a success, is Lybia. They seem to be coming around, I think the threat of American firepower did it, along with a firm example in Iraq and Afghanistan, HOWEVER, if you recall, France denied overfly rights to the F-111 strikes in the 80s. We have applied strong pressure, even without force of arms.<br>
<br>
I think to Americans it seems that France is trying more for points with potential partners in the Arab world, and French politicians seem more eager for political power then taking a long term approach.<br>
<br>
The source of the problems is at the turn of the century. Across the Transjordan, the Ottoman empire was deposed, and many stepped up as leaders using the tactics they used before, it is when those tactics are used on <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">civilians</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> is where it is clearly terrorism. <br>

<br>
Sorry, i still don't get the &quot;quote master&quot; degree so i'll list again...<br>
<br>
1. I find your words totally disrespectful to Iraqi people. You are saying that it is the fault of the dead people if they died because they couldn't understand what they were told to. I can only find arrogance in your sentences and total disrespect for the life of human beings. <br>
<br>
2. thread : Grats US... page 7.<br>
<br>
3. If you don't get that are more mad at you because you invaded their country than before, i can't do anything for you...<br>
<br>
4. Are you telling me that in no way Irak was monitored by thausends of soldiers till 1991? Are you telling me that you have never seen military sattelite pictures of single tanks? For someone working in Defense business, you are not that well informed... Sad for you. Irak was under control for years now and at no moment a threat for anyone besides Irakies themselves.<br>
<br>
5. More arms sold to USA =&gt; check is way much higher for Bush Sr at the end of the year.<br>
Price of a oil barrel higher =&gt; Rice, Rumsfeld + Texan friends of Bush get a way higher income.<br>
To justify the war to the congress + ONU, Bush used a report done by a LA student before desert storm, using non updated informations. He used false informations too about some Uranium traffic. You will prolly tell me that he didn't know that those informations where wrong. I will answer that when thausends of lifes depend on those information, you must be sure he can rely on them. I call this either lie or incompetence.<br>
<br>
6. I think i feel safer as a french when travelling than as i could feel as an american.<br>

I have pain because our HOME nation bascially told us to leave everything, if we didn't we would lose French citizenship, and no be protected. My family simply wanted a place to work and live, we didn't enslave anyone, and Maroc was much better after we came, since we improved the country a great deal. <br>
<br>
We were told we didn't have to leave, but it was clear to many that staying meant being murdered. America took many Pied Noir as immigrants, and gave us a home. I know a lot of refugees from FRANCE, to escape the unfairly high taxes, and problems such as the unions.  <br>

You tell me that a person doesn't understand the word STOP. I know for a fact, They usually yell STOP hold out hand and yell HALT and WOAH. Some even yell stop in Arabic.

&quot;The following interactive map and associated text provide locations and detailed descriptions of sites and facilities that comprised Iraq's biological weapon (BW) program circa 1991. The current status of these facilities is unclear. The list does not include sites with BW potential (such as breweries) that the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) monitored during the years it was in Iraq.&quot; <br>
<br>
datas from 1991 and before, status of facilities is unclear. How can you justify a war with unclear arguments?? Don't you remember having seen the inspectors (who asked 6 more months of work in Irak to conclude about the WMD) leaving Irak because of the war starting? <br>
US government decided on his own to go to war basing its argumentation on unproved or 10 years old reports. <br>
<br>
<br>
You know Srie, Algeria war was a war of independance, Algerian people fought to get their freedom and through out the ones who were ruling them. It really easy to compare this to an independance war. It shouldn't be easy to be english during US independance war and i am sure a lot of english people fled not to be murdered.<br>
<br>
<br>
What was the next instruction after STOP? &quot;Get out of the car&quot; seems less easy to understand, doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Wasn't Irak monitored like crazy since 1991? Can't you see a single tank with a sattelite? Weren't in the area thausends of US soldiers since 1991? Where was the threat in those conditions?<br>
<br>
You admit Rice and Rumsfeld make money over oil (from Venezuela you said) but you refuse to admit that when oil price is higher the people living from oil industry earn more...<br>
<br>
I point that you agree with some arguements being false in those presented to UN and to the congress. Still no agreement on lying for Bush or being incompetent?<br>
<br>
The problem is that I can feel that because of the story of your parents you just hate muslims and you are just pleased when they are bashed and killed.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=210249"> Passetemps Cleric 65 </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

No actually we didnt make it a policy to murder civilians in order to secure our independence, and we did not institute a theocracy and ask all the Jews to leave America. Your analogy is offensive.<br>

I am never pleased with people are killed. They are people, and people are people, but dictators and despots deserve to be toppled. I will not be told I am a racist, especially by a person who recites a euro-socialist dogma like a parrot.<br>

So flooding the market with oil from Iraq raises the price of oil how?<br>
<br>
I know gas prices in my home town are the lowest they have been in many months. seems like a bad deal if all we wanted was more profits from iraqi oil.<br>

Issues with oil?<br>
<br>
Bah, Oil is a big market in US, nothing amaze me to see some peeps linked to Oil market in a Gvt. Lets forget $ battle.<br>
<br>
And look at why Oil is such a recurent subject. There is few points that great for USA with Irak Oil (even, if its not the goal!!!! )<br>
<br>
First, in long term (50+ years) Oil will be low on earth.<br>
So its good to be able to provide - and to buy - some (Irak is one (the, maybe) biggest Oil stock).<br>
<br>
Irak have a 'sit' on OPEC (who is rulling worldwide oil market price), we can think that Irak voice, will follow USA orders.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Overall, the top suppliers of oil to the United States during 2002 were Canada (1.9 MMBD),<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Saudi Arabia (1.6 MMBD)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, Mexico (1.5 MMBD), and Venezuela (1.4 MMBD). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

<br>
Saudi Arabia, there is a lot to tell about them... but its easy understable that USA would want to get away from them, so wait and see<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Disclaimer : I claim nothing. But telling there is no Oil matter in Irak, is wrong as worldwide oil market will change due to this war.<br>

Addressing your comment, Yk, the best thing to make American's rich would be for oil prices to crash hard. IF our gasoline prices drop from $1.50 to $0.75 we would have quite a boom here, a lot of business depends on transportation, and transportation on gas. I want them to pump oil like MAD from Iraq!<br>
<br>
That would make a lot of oil companies suffer short term, but in the long run would do well.  <p><table align="center" cols="3" rows="2" width="80%" ><!border= "2" bordercolor="black" >

This is where our discussion was :<br>
<br>
No UN resolution allowed US to go and invade Irak.<br>
No evidence of WMD before war nor after. The AIEA inspectors had to leave Irak due to the war starting even if they asked 6 more months to go on their work.<br>
You base your argumentation (the links you showed) on &quot;unclear&quot; facts, unproven suspicions.<br>
Congress and UN were shown non updated and wrong reports about WMD by Bush.<br>
Evolution of oil prices : <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm">www.wtrg.com/prices.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
a war means oil price increases, i still think a war in middle east is a good thing for the people who invested in oil.<br>
<br>
FYI, France / Russia who lead the anti-war coalition are not &quot;leftist&quot; or &quot;socialist&quot;. They still recite what you call &quot;euro-socialist dogma&quot;.<br>
