He treats all his guild members like crap and then yells at them for saying something.  Lets not forget his fast to click the remove button if you ever challenge his ideas.  I personally hate this guy for making up a story about how I was trying to serperate his RL brother from his family.  He has drove 20+ members into leaving the guild in a single night. His own brother ( the fore mentioned one ) said he was handing the guild over to him and finding a new one.  That is if he diecides to start playing again.  Zake get a clue you aren't ready for the lead of a guild. Let someone more up to the challenge and responsibility do it for you.  You have obviously shown you are not capable of dealing with people on a social level. Everyone feel free to post your feelings on this mad trash talker we all know and grown to hate &quot; Zake&quot;.<br>

<br>
this is zake.  i lead the guild exalted fury with zaklor who is not my real life brother, i don't even know zaklors last name in rl.<br>
<br>
we kicked thorena out of the guild because she was talking dirty to everyone, and then demanded zaklors phone number for phone sex.  because he's married and has kids, and doesnt want a psycho 15 year old boy calling his house for phone sex...we kicked &quot;it&quot; out.<br>
<br>
&quot;it&quot; then proceeded to make an alt, and ask an officer for an invite.  no one knew who it was...i just thought it was an accidentally tagged stupid newb.<br>
<br>
it then created some drama... at the time though 2 members, (not 20) were upset we didnt continue CoM without a rogue, i dont think i need to explain that to anyone.  <br>
<br>
and they left pissed off, and are now going to start their own guild.  no hard feelings there although people were angry when they left.  me, them, and in the middle of this thorena burst out with haha its thorena you guys all suck.<br>
<br>
ok so whatever.  a crazy person.  gone.  we are happy about that.<br>
<br>
this post on the other hand is ridiculous.   exalted fury is a very small guild with modest goals.  we all get along and try to have fun.<br>
<br>
guild leaders...do yourselves a favor, and never tag this psycho.  <br>
<br>
<br>
btw...im probably not the greatest guild leader ever.  i think that goes without saying.  but zaklor hasnt left the guild.  i mean do you actually make this stuff up or does someone help you?<br>
<br>
finally, i want to apologize to everyone having to read this.  im sure you all couldnt care less.  <br>

First off, Zake and Zaklor aren't brothers in real life.  Just because they both start with Zak doens't make them related in real life.<br>
<br>
Now, did Exalted Fury every have 20 members online at once that quit?  I truly dont' think so.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, for some background.  EF was made many moons ago by someone, who then stuck the leadership on an alt, and joined my guild, Mithril Ankh.  We had a bunch of people leave MA to join EF when EF restarted.  EF's goals are to be a small raiding guild (or perhaps larger, but I'm thinking that's way in the future).  My guild, Mithril Ankh, just doesn't have that goal.  That makes neither guild right or wrong.  We lost a few members to EF, and we got a few back.  It's growing...it's finding where you want to be, and what you really do want out of a guild.<br>
<br>
Zake was an officer in MA before he went to EF to help lead it.  Never, not once, did Zake exhibit any tyrannical tendencies while an officer.  We had an officer who once did...he actually tried to take over the guild, so I can say without a doubt that Zake didn't do anything like it.<br>
<br>
And Thorena?  If you are indeed telling the truth, perhaps having those 20 who left cause of Zake's inability to lead a guild post here would be a good thing, to lend credence to your rant.  Only a suggestion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Your wild accusations are just hillarious! I thank you for the entertainment and the good laugh. Exalted did nothing but try to be there for you until you decided it would be more fun to try and stir things up just like you are trying to do now.  We do have a written policy on acceptable behavior for our guild members.  We are sorry that you chose not to adhere to it.  This guild isn't for everyone and not everyone will call us friend. However none of the Leaders or Officers of this guild would waste their time on fabricating a story on you or anyone else for that matter. We have better things to do with our time.  Anyone that has met and knows Zake does know better. He is honorable and takes his role as leader seriously.He is a strong raid leader and he looks out for those he leads. Never have I seen him put himself above the others.  He would never do such a fool hardy thing such as you are suggesting. So lets just tell it like it is for once Thor .... you got caught with your hand in the cookie jar and now are trying to blame someone else for it.  Good luck to you and I pray your future decisions will be wiser. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=janaemt>JanaeMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#628CBC>(5/14/03 8:47:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zake &quot;the Trash Talker&quot; of Exalted Fury</span><hr size=1>    I was asked to join this guild with some of my friends, but after watching a few raids and seeing how guild worked I declined.

Since being asked every single one of my friends have left Exalted Fury do to Zakes actions.  I will be helping them make a new guild. As far as the 2 peaople leaving that night.

To start off, I'd like to remind everyone that this is a GAME and that games are played to have fun and relieve stress.  <br>
<br>
I may feel that I am in the middle of a battle, so I figure I would go ahead and speak my peace.  <br>
<br>
I'll have to say that every single player that I have been able to play with for an extended period of time will at one time or another &quot;loose his/her temper&quot;  I have done it, Thorena has done it, Zake has done it, etc., etc., etc....<br>
<br>
As for Thorena's initial post, Zake doesn't treat his members like crap.  He is very concerned for members of EF.  He and I email each other every day with details about how to better run the guild, integrate it's members, involve everyone, raid where people will have fun, ect.  I will also admit that I have thought about dropping as a co-leader and leaving. (not the guild, but the game)  I play eq to get away from the stress of my real life.  Once the game becomes more of a stress than a stress relief, I will quit.  Simple as that.<br>
<br>
As for Zake's reply, I was told by a number of people in the guild that they had recieved &quot;nasty&quot; tells that were later claimed to be mistells.  I'm not sure how 3 other people in the guild could all get &quot;mistells&quot; from the same person.  Maybe I don't fully understand the dificulty in typing in eq chat..<br>
<br>
20 people leaving the guild???  The most we have had online at one time so far has been 18 players.  From what I know of the guild and it's alts, 5 people total left the guild along with their alts.  I believe it totalled about 12 players - which have all been replaced by new members.<br>
<br>
Thorena - As for creating an alt and joining the guild via a friend and then causing a scene.  All I can say is that has to be one of the most childish things I have ever experienced.  I just can't believe that you couldn't face the guild as yourself and had to get your alt. char. to do your dirty work.  Act your age and stand up and fight.<br>
<br>
As for Zake's leadership, he isn't the best guild leader.  Nor am I the best guild leader.  But as a team, we do a pretty damn good job with our guild and are doing great things to keep this guild running and growing.  You will better understand the work involved once you and your friends get your guild up and running.  I wish you the best of luck and hope your guild does well for you.<br>
<br>
As for the last post...We may not be the best guild in raid situations, but I'd like to see a guild that is only a month old that is perfect at raiding.  We raid as a guild to get better as a guild and know what our roles are as members of the guild.  We are not perfect, but striving to be so.  There are Uber guilds out there that still screw up on raids and make mistakes that wipe out the entire party.  It happens to everyone.  If you don't like our style of play, that's fine, don't join us.  We are striving to do well, and Zake and Myself are doing what we can to make sure that Exalted Fury continues to grow and get stronger. <br>
<br>
People can post all the crap they want on the forums.  Who cares!!  It's a game that is meant to be fun.  Play the game and enjoy it.  Don't pick every little thing that goes wrong and make a mess out of it. <br>
<br>
Zake is going to make mistakes.<br>
Zaklor is going to make mistakes.<br>
<br>
Every player on this game is going to make mistakes.<br>
<br>
Learn from your mistakes and keep playing.  People will clash, people will lie, when that happens, take the higher road and leave the issues in the grave, get over it.<br>
<br>
Thorena, I find it extremely poor taste on your part for primarily causing a scene with the guild with your alt, and secondly posting this insane topic.  Move on and enjoy the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jakiilmt>JakiilMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#628CBC>(5/15/03 2:23:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zake &quot;the Trash Talker&quot; of Exalted Fury</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>JanaeMT<br>
