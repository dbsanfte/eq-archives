IMHO if a loot drops in a Pick up XP group everyone should have a fair shot at it who cares if its an upgrade or not, since eventually even the guy who wins will SELL the item.  I have seen this happen countless times whether it be 15 mins after a group or months.<br>

Pick up groups have standard loot rules of &quot;eveyone rolls&quot; and if you can't loot then tuff titties. What a cheak to say what he did.

<br>
A droppable item drops in your pick-up group.  It's clear from your post that the group has agreed to /random on all items such as this.  Jorrell is the highest roller.  Jorrell informs the group that he has a pair, and being that the item is lore, he will log on to his alt to loot the item.  (Doesn't seem to make a difference in this case whether it was an upgrade for his alt or he was going to sell it for pp, he won the roll.)<br>
<br>
This is the point in time when, if you are upset about Jorrell rolling, winning and looting a lore item of which he already has a duplicate, you raise your concern.  No one else in the group seemed to have a problem with it, not even &quot;poor Blabberpuss&quot;, who, as you pointed out, had passed on the roll because she already had a pair.  If she or they were upset, presumably, they would have and could have said or done something.  Its not too difficult - simply voice your concern or gripe, and let the player (Jorrell) have an opportunity to discuss the situation and see if a compromise or understanding can be worked out.  Since, however, Jorrell was obviously allowed to have his alt loot the item, nothing was said at the time.<br>
<br>
Now, as to whether it was appropriate for Jorrell to roll on a duplicate lore item, I think what you will find is that there is no clear consensus on what is appropriate.  Some people believe in NBG, some believe in /randoming on all items, some have their own modified system that falls in between these two.  And while the best approach commonly voiced is to set the rules straight beforehand, general statements when the group is formed such as &quot;Loot is NBG,&quot;, or, &quot;/random on everything&quot; often do not account for subtle issues such as duplicate lore items.  Thus, if you have an issue regarding loot, the most logical, mature and efficient way to deal with it is to raise it, and let the person and the group figure out how to go from there.<br>
<br>
Instead, however, you decided to start a slanderous rant, because you did not have the courage to stand up for your convictions at the time.  As you said in your initial post:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I think to myself well maybe it should go to the next highest roller<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
How about, instead of thinking to yourself next time, you articulate your concerns and attempt to resolve the situation in a rational and competent manner.  Choosing instead to label a well respected member of the MT community as &quot;greedy&quot; over a non-verbalized, uncommunicated disagreement over how you interpret loot rules that are often subject to interpreation and over which reasonable minds can and do disagree only makes you look rash and cowardly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grishkalur>Grishkalur</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/03 1:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> So if someone had won them without the gauntlets already but couldn't use them that's ok?

<br>
Personality varies from one person to another.  For instance Broo should have been shot in head by now but hasn't because that's the way he plays, and the werid thing is that I've become to respect that.  Perhaps that day Jorrel was seeking to raise funds to purchase a new upgrade for himself that he saw in the bazaar but couldn't.  So naturaly for that day of instance he turned a bit greedier than was tolerable for the ranter.<br>
<br>
So what?  We all have our days.  To make the claim he was &quot;THE GREEDIEST PLAYER EVER&quot; is an overstatement that any decent person can see through. <br>
<br>
What this game has been around for what?  3 years now.... get a clue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bezshan1>bezshan1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/03 2:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Jorrell/Blurd of MLF</span><hr size=1> There is a simple solution to this problem.  Jorrell won the roll, let him loot the item.  <br>
<br>
Oh wait, he can't because it's LORE?  <br>
<br>
Welp, the item rots.<br>
<br>
It's a bummer for the folks who lost the roll, but it keeps Jorrell from claiming duplicate items.<br>

So everyone but Blabb rolled yes? And everyone in the group could use them right? Oh wait.... <br>

There wasn't a single leather or silk class in your group? I doubt it. What use would a caster have had for the gaunts except to sell them? <br>
Jorrell was within his rights to roll, if it was truly a NBG group only the people who could wear them AND it would have been an uprgade shopuld have rolled. Why should he not roll, even if he already has a pair when casters who can't use are rolling?<br>
What's the difference between a caster rolling on that item and Jorrell rolling on it? Not a damn thing.<br>

I wouldn't of done it just because it sounded like a inconvenience at the time and he should of thought about that before he hunted there ~grins~ I mean if you go to highborns and named pops you can expect to get Kylong Guantlets, so you should run an alt or something to zone instead of inconveniencing everyone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1091.topic&start=81&stop=88>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=1091.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=1091.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1091.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.threadControl?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1091.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm43">Retirement Center<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3>Rants</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
