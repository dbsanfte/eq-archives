Take this as nigh-gospel on most accounts, if I'm unsure I'll mention it.<br>
<br>
In the first two months of MT's life, guilds came and went.  The &quot;top&quot; guilds weren't really &quot;top&quot; because they didn't do much, and they merged and died and reformed quickly.  Hamunaptra was formed by Nautilus and Bube, and they basically grabbed a bunch of high levellers.  Another proto-guild was Unity of Blades (name might be incorrect) and Sons of the Immortal.  Sons eventually sorta morphed into Circle of the Unseen I believe.  Iron Legions was also a proto-guild that fell apart, many of it's members went to Hamu, and after a while IL was a de-facto &quot;ally&quot; to Hamunaptra, in that it's few remaining members (Ober, Ekelhaft mainly) raided with Hamu.<br>
<br>
The start of the &quot;uberguild&quot; era is the first Fear raid.  Hamunaptra is who formed it, but to be fair it was more along the lines of an open raid.  We allowed guests to tag along, especially back then because there was a decided lack of high level people.  This is approximately 2 months after MT opened.  No one had tried Fear or Hate or Naggy yet.  Hamu did a horrible 15 hour Fear raid that first day, didn't finish.  Next weekend, we went back and managed to clear Fear and kill CT.  While the majority of the raid was Hamu, there were many guests like Ekelhaft, Ober, Xziled, even the Iggles came to a few of our raids.  The next two weekends we did Hate.  Xziled was unhappy over the direction Hamunaptra was going, and wanted to be in charge, so he formed IV at this time.  After we killed Inny, Xziled and IV stopped coming to our raids, and we started being a bit more exclusive.  Hamu tried doing Naggy around this time, but failed because most of our members were over 52.  <br>
<br>
Fast forward about 2 months, to the end of August.  IV is arguably the number 2 guild on the server, they had just finally killed CT and Inny after about 2 months of recruiting and raiding.  Circle of the Unseen was formed around this time, made up of many former members of Sons, plus a bunch of other people.  (CotU might have formed a bit earlier).  HF and TW are farming Naggy and Vox at this time, they are definately 2nd or 3rd string at this point in the server's life.  Around the beginning of September, two events happened.  One, the officers of Hamunaptra essentially left the guild and reformed under a new name, Relentless Ascention.  It also included the last remaining members of Iron Legions (Ekelhaft, Ober, Smirker), and we put Ekelhaft in charge of the guild. (Sucker!) The reason was that we simply felt Hamunaptra had grown too unweildy, and removing people back then was too difficult cause you didn't have the nifty guild management tool you have now.  Hamu never 'fell apart', because it was a purposeful reformation.  About a week or two later, IV left the server en masse to go to the new server opening up, Thoxule Paells (sp).  Those IV members who didn't go to TP ended up joining CotU or Sinister, which was just now starting to get members.  Xune formed Sinister from the core of some PvP guild from UO, plus he mass recruited anyone he could get. (I am not quite sure about the timing on when Sinister started though).    HF and TW were in the planes by now, but they were mainly farming planar armor and HF/Naggy at this time, and were still considered &quot;second tier&quot;.  After farming Hate/Fear for another few months, and XPing in Kunark, RA started thinking about Sev and Trak and VS.  However, Relentless (the monk) wanted to try VS, so he organized a multi-guild raid on VS, made up of members from CotU, Sinister, some HF and TW, and even some RA members (including myself).  VS went down, and it was a kick in the ass to both RA (proving we weren't top dogs anymore) and to Circle/Sinister (proving RA weren't top dogs anymore).  RA responded with the infamous &quot;VS Gank&quot;.  Of course, by today's standards, this seems silly.  RA went in on Wed and killed VS, when Circle and Sinister had planned a raid on VS the following Saturday.   This started some bad blood between the Sinister-Circle alliance and RA.  About 2-3 weeks later, RA tried to kill Trak, and kept wiping due to the horrible lag.  It turned out we were simply using too many people, and the lag was destroying us.  Lytic took Circle and Sinister and killed Trak, which is probably the closest point any other guild or alliance of guilds has come to matching RA as the uberguild.  RA quickly worked to overcome the falling behind, resulting in some races for Trak and VS. In order to stop an all-out gankfest from occuring, the Trak and VS rotations were formed.  Around February, Sinister started falling apart, not sure why.  Xune left, then the next guild leader left, etc.  Circle absorbed many of these Sinister people, as did HF and TW.  I think Circle had some problem around this time too, because they started having problems too.  RA had free reign for quite a while at this time, with no competition in Velious for quite a while.  Unfortunately, attendence in RA was really starting to slack off as well.  With Circle falling apart, and Sinister pretty much gone, HF was the defacto number two guild on the server.  They were still behind RA, and we didn't bump into each other very much until the summer, when HF started doing Klandicar/Zlandicar for ST keys.  Even so, we didn't race each other very often, and when we did, it wasn't very hostile.  Around the end of the summer, attendence issues in RA were getting quite pronounced, and HF was having major attendence issues as well.  Solthan (who had taken over RA when Ekelhaft resigned in March to focus on graduating) and Daggen decided to merge the guilds together into a new, more cohesive guild, and Fury's Edge was born. (I know, many people don't like the name; hey, it's better than &quot;Shadowlordz&quot;)  Somewhere in here, Circle reformed into Reviction (Rev members might know the timeline better than I), and Triune was somewhere in the background.  Also, Royal Jesters was starting to kill stuff on Asian time.  Around October of that year, while FE was trying to break into NToV, TW made a huge push forward.  They started farming Velious content, Klan and Zlan, etc.  FE was killing NToV and ST, while TW started knocking on the door.  Eventually, TW decided to do NToV themselves, and a kind of unofficial rotation began in NToV.  Nothing set in stone, but we kind of kept out of each others way, generally.  Due to the bad blood between TW and HF, there was a lot of animosity between the FE and TW.  When Luclin came out, FE started pushing into Luclin, giving TW more and more access to velious content.  Eventually, FE stopped going into NToV altogether (nerfing Vulak had something to do with this =) .  FE killed 4th Warder in January 2002, AoW about 2 weeks later, and Tunare a few weeks after that.  TW was, if I recall, mainly farming NToV with the occasional foray at the THO.  FE remained ahead of TW all throughout Luclin, though many times TW was &quot;right behind us&quot;.  Usually the content we were farming was the content they were just starting to try.  Sometime last December, TW started slacking off, and Triune and Reviction took over the next spot (dont' recall exactly when, I just know that one day TW was effectively gone).  Around this time, Flames of Vengence (which was Royal Jesters under a new name) started falling apart as well.<br>
<br>
This is the history of the 'top' end of the server.  Hamunaptra turned into RA turned into FE, and has almost always been the top guild on the server in regards to content (Not trying to brag, just trying to be honest).  Other guilds have just as long and colorful a history, and they are welcome to correct any inaccuracies or incorrect timeframes I have listed. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=74028">Neuro the Strategist</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

LoV formed in the summer of 2k which makes it one of the oldest guilds on MT. I joined shortly after and have stayed and seen a lot of members come and go. We were not anywhere near the top guilds until recently. <br>
<br>
Some of the real old schoolers besides me was Ylander (first GL), Isorn, Angelia, Buller, Marmel, Inusent (had a rogue named Makker later in HF I think). Sorry if I left some names out, don't wanna make the list to long. Some of those ppl went to HF when they grew in power. Some of the old schoolers are on MM now, I still have contact with them from time to time, people like Fableman and Fixarn. I remember the old days, they were a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Pandore were the old school big French guild, I think there are people out there who could tell their history better, and retelling that hilarious incident with the cleric epic ganking and the following legendary rants. Aurore formed after them and LoV and Aurore have always chased each other until recently. I can safely say that without that competition none of our guilds would have been where we are today so /hug Aurore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You guys remember when the Trak rotation was being formed? I remember very distinctly that our goal (meaning HF) was to make sure that this server remained the most civillized server in EQ. Once SiN left, that was made much easier. &gt;)<br>

Man, those were the days... However, I do recall leaving Sons of the Immortal for reputation reasons. They were getting accused of gaking and such, made me not want to be a part of them, anylonger. Kind of a shame, as that was the last time I'd ever be guilded with Morden and some of my other friends, who ended up in CotU.<br>
<br>
By the way, I have always been a firm believer in roleplaying, and I am always happy to oblige whenever I meet anybody who does so. Remember, you can go to raids and wear nice gear, but still have the heart of a roleplayer. There is no need for animosity between &quot;00b3rs&quot; and &quot;RP'ers&quot;. I do remember all the &quot;RP-Server&quot; talk that was going on in the early days, though. Until FV opened up, and we all see how THAT turned out... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Argond Valiantfist</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Grandmaster Geezer of Morell-Thule</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133460" target="top">Geezer-gear</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mallo>mallo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>MT Legend</span><br>  Posts: 174<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/14/03 6:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1921.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   The low end of the game</span><hr size=1> A scribe writes;<br>
<br>
Neuro speaks of the high end of the game from the forboding grey tower that is the the home of those on the leading edge of the games content.  The petty concerns of the merely mortal who nip at the heels of the great and the near great, though, I doubt he knows as well.<br>
<br>
My lady and I started on this server the week it went live.  <br>
<br>
Predating all the Roleplaying guilds was Two Chalices.  Both good and evil in one guild at war with itself.  This is Eisabeaus (sp?) first guild; some of the best writing you'll see related to this game came out of Two Chalices.  <br>
<br>
White Star Legion was home to many back when the server first started.  You see their guild tags from time to time even now.<br>
<br>
But White Star Legion was not a good home for the roleplayers as they tried to be &quot;all things to all people.&quot;  Amorris, later winner of the BoTB Warrior competition, went to RA from White Star Legion; he gave me a lot of advice when I was starting out.<br>
<br>
Last I saw White Star Legion was still about as of 6 months ago or so.  <br>
<br>
The Roleplayers in that guild though split off and formed Coeur de Lion, my Lady Luniel and Tzen and Mesaoyatun came up with it and stuck me as leader.  <br>
<br>
Shortly before we formed the Order of the White Hand formed.  Thelisakar was the guild leader there and there was much talk of guild war between our two guilds.  War that was interupted by his needing to leave Norrath for demands elsewhere.  Duels and general bad blood.  <br>
<br>
As well Elven Elite is formed in June I believe.  We lost folks that were going to start CdL with us to EE in fact. <br>
<br>
August of 2000 saw the formation of House T'Vlos led by Cynful T'Vlos and his lady Ravensky.  <br>
<br>
House Rea'Morda led by Rusalka and Yaskel.<br>
<br>
and of course Coven of the Blood Rose who predates CdL.  <br>
<br>
As these guilds formed Two Chalices fell.  <br>
<br>
Citizens of Halas formed as did Elves of Surefall Glade.  Elves soon died as well, Eisabeau's second guild.<br>
<br>
Reapers of Sorrow first come to my attention later on so I'm not sure when they formed.<br>
<br>
Eisabeau goes on to EE and the rest of the RP guilds start to stage &quot;raids&quot; into zones.  Most raids are setup around a story, and there is a lot of dueling going on as the large raid forces move.<br>
<br>
2001 finds the formation of Mark of the Draconians Eisabeau's 3rd guild where she is in a leadership role, and the formation of the Hessians of Morell Thule.  Led by folks who didn't care for some aspects of CdL.<br>
<br>
As well most of these guilds are starting to lose their higher levels to RA, HF, HoH, Reviction and Triune.  Folks that have a strong interest in seeing the harder zones and or gaining new gear.  Velious is a strong lure for this.  Armor from ToV, spells, and just the allure of seeing Sleepers Tomb or NToV.<br>
<br>
Add in pressure to get on the VS rotation, you can't complete the Wizard epic if your not on the VS rotation.<br>
<br>
None of the guilds named above could field the force needed for VS in those days.  CdL had the enchanters for it, but not the Tanks or Healers for it.  EE and the Evil Houses could muster the DPS but not the Enchanters.<br>
<br>
The way of the world then was if you were in a small Roleplaying guild you would have to leave.  At about 50th level you left and joined a &quot;real guild&quot;<br>
<br>
The various guild leaders from those guilds talked it over and Gathering of Banners was formed.  The base for Gathering of Banners rose in part from the formation of the Morell-Thule roleplaying council, an OOC group of guildleaders and officers set up to deal with roleplayers' disputes.  In part it came from from the open raids I'd run all through the end of 2001 and most of 2002.  Raids driven by the Ragefire rotation, for then Nagafen had to be dead.  Clerics in Reviction, FE, or Triune would ask their friends in &quot;small guilds&quot; to kill Nagafen quickly to get Ragefire to spawn.  <br>
<br>
All the RP guilds that raided with me, all the unguilded folks that raided with us formed Gathering of Banners.  We've had our arguments; faction in Velious strained and broke friendships.<br>
<br>
Hessians and the Order didn't like some aspects of GoB and pulled out.  The old Citizens of Halas now Civis Macto joined, as did Random Acts.<br>
<br>
And here we sit knocking on the Elemental Planes.  Zones we of course will never see.<br>
<br>
On Rotations:<br>
<br>
Part of what drove GoB into being was the VS rotation.  We had Wizards -- they wanted epics.  We could lose them or we could band together to get on the Rotation list.  <br>
<br>
The Rotations were formed to keep things civil between RA and Sin / CoTU.<br>
<br>
As an up and coming guild I remember discussing with Pandore and with Cereberial back in the day the need to keep the Rotations going.  Even to the point of moderating the VS and Trak rotation when Cads got completely fed up with it.<br>
<br>
The rotations became contentious as the content became more and more trivial to the upper end of the servers guilds but they were still important to the guilds coming up.  It was worth it though because it really did make for a much more civil raiding environment.  <br>
<br>
Frankly something that largely exists to this day.  Are there times when things turn ugly.  Yes, but are they as frequent as on other servers?  I don't think so. I know that Ragefire never got as ugly here as it did on other servers. <br>
<br>
On guildwar:<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned they thought Coeur de Lion and the Order of the White Hand had a guild war.  No, didn't happen and that was for a variety of reasons.<br>
<br>
CdL did fight a war with House T'Vlos in their heyday and lost, and later we fought a war with the Reapers of Sorrow in Neriak 3rd Gate.  That was interesting, when the Rogue guildleader agro'd it did get ugly though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Most of the guildwars on this server invloved Mark of the Draconians: they fought the Order of the White Hand, House Rea'Morda.  As well The Hessians of Morell Thule fought in at least one guildwar that I can think of but I forget who.<br>
<br>
Most of my time on this server has been spent with guilds that have chosen to hamstring themselves in one form or another.  Either by limiting the classes you can play (CdL no necros no SKs) or my limiting what race you can be (Reapers can only be Dark Elves).  <br>
<br>
Is it the harder way to play the game?  I don't know; we do all right.<br>
<br>
Mallo Artanos <br>
Guildleader Coeur de Lion<br>
Butcher of the Karanas<br>
<br>
As an aside I mention the mad lady of High Hold Keep a lot in this but no conversation about the Roleplaying guilds on this server can do justice with out mentioning her and her role in the rise and fall of many roleplaying guilds.<br>

This is absolutely true.

When I finally convinced by best buddy Iluvatar to transfer here from CT, he was very pleased. He often told me how odd he thought it was that there was so little animosity among the guilds, and overall how mature the majority of people were.<br>

Bear in mind that this is a guy that has been playing on one of the original servers since the first week of EQ. He said he's been happier on MT then he ever was on CT.<br>

I think that says a lot, personally. I am proud that I am one of the many that helped lay the cornerstones of this server's foundation, and all of you who still play should be proud that you have done so well in maintaining that foundation. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Argond Valiantfist</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Grandmaster Geezer of Morell-Thule</div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133460" target="top">Geezer-gear</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faate>Faate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 411<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(10/15/03 2:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1921.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The low end of the game</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> IV left the server en masse to go to the new server opening up, Thoxule Paells<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

We went to Vazaelle, created In Virtue there, and eventually once we had cleared NToV (before anyone on Morell Thule, a server 12 months older), things started to burn out. IV sorta died, a lot went to other guilds like Agony, PO, CC, and one spinoff guild PA, but until Kane Bayle opened, there was no 'real' In Virtue again.<br>
<br>
As for morell thule @#%$, neuro hit the head on pretty much everything, though Xziled didnt just stop coming to ham @#%$, it was more of a decision he wanted to form something on his own merits, not not feed off someone else.<br>

<br>
Triune was formed as an &quot;offshoot&quot; guild from Sphere of Legends. SoL's high level players were not satisfied being &quot;bottom feeders&quot; on other high level guild's raids. The original guild leader was not me (although I'm one of the two founding members left). Braonan was the original Triune guild leader.<br>
<br>
We spent our formative months playing around the planes (I still remember our first Fear raid with Enlightened Dawn... that was a debacle if I ever saw one). We focused mainly on getting epics for our members, exploring Velious, and generally just screwing around. We weren't really interested in &quot;uberness&quot; but were mostly interested in being self sufficient enough to host our own raids without relying on other guilds. After a few months, Braonan and his wife Kyri took a break, leaving us leaderless. Since apparently, I'm a masochist at heart, I took over (this story gets more interesting, but since I don't have the energy to write the novel, I'm sure Solwene will enlighten you all if he ever reads this).<br>
<br>
Reviction formed shortly after we did and although we didn't approach the kind of vitriole that the FE/TW spats had, we were still very competitve with each other and continue to be so today. Although now I think we compete to see who can gank RZ from AV first. =)<br>
<br>
Much much drama later, we were able to work through the Velious, Luclin, and now I suppose we could be considered one of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds on the server, although we never really thought ourselves as such. We're still mostly a bunch of friends trying to have a good time; have fun kicking ass as we like to say.  <p><center>

Some of this is from memory of hearsay only so if someone can make corrections, please do. I have been vague in a few places, and even a little &quot;careful&quot; with wording to avoid digging up old rivalries. well, here goes:<br>
<br>
The twilight of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mark of Draconian</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> happened because of the handling of series of Role-Play events between Eisabeau and Ravinsky (or Rusalka?). The insueing infighting both In Character and Out of Character was devistating, and quickly lead to the shattering of the guild. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Faveo Sulum Ipsemet Ascio</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->* lead by Aaldari,  and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tears of Veeshan</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> lead by Solarianne** formed as a result of what happened. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Champions of the Light</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->*** grew substantially as a result of the break-up and the rest of the membership joined other RP guilds or scattered to the wind.<br>
<br>
At the time of the break up, Faveo and Tears were both asked to remain in the GoB, but Faveo decided to go their own way, while Tears decided to stay. (Champions was already a member I believe, if not, they were made a defacto member near this point.) The interesting part about the Tears is that it was founded based on the existance of the GoB. No need for any specific class or raid capability because that was what the GoB provided. <br>
<br>
Tears began as an RP guild with no affiliation besides the general belief that Dragons are generally evil and must be stopped. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.webhazard.net" target="top">www.webhazard.net</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> has more detail, although much of the site is now out of date. As the guild grew in numbers, a new fissure began to form. Those opposed to the way Tears fit into the GoB and what it stands for, and those who liked it. Eventually this fissure snapped and approximately 1/3 of the guild left and formed a new guild, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Protectors of Kindred Souls</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->****.<br>
<br>
Through time, thre were 3 more major events in the history of The Tears. The first was when a group of regular players all joined en masse. I forget the name they used (The Nexus?), but I believe the unofficial leader was a wizard named Astenar. (Urda help me out here.) These were some of the kindest folks I've ever met. They were a regular gaming group (about 10 of them) who liked what they saw of the Tears and decided to join.<br>
<br>
The second being the merging of the Champions of the Light with the Tears. This was a mixed bag. It filled the ranks of the Tears with with Role Players and a few missing classes, but it also pushed together Casual Roleplayers and Hardcore roleplayers. It wasn't long before some of the more hardcore RPers became unhappy with how the guild was going and some left to reform the Champs, and others went to other RP guilds.<br>
<br>
The last major event was when Solarianne, Myself, and Moline left for Triune. This in itself would not be so significant as officers and leaders do leave guilds. The problem was the fact that the resulting events nearly killed the guild as most of the level 60+ members left for Triune, Reviction, Discordians, PoKS, and some ultimately to FE. That in turn caused a number of the remaining members to scatter to guilds all over Morel-Thule including GoB members. Thankfully there were a few very dedicated members who wouldn't let go.<br>
<br>
Because of the efforts of those few dedicated members, Tears of Veeshan is still alive and well under the leadership of Ralstaan and I'm sure, he, or Salvia can explain the more current history. <br>
<br>
If I think of more interesting factoids I'll try to post them. Honestly, this is bocoming very interesting and I think it would be really cool if someone were to try and merge all these stories together to make a history of the guilds on MT.<br>
<br>
I happen to have a Gig or more of logs saved up from my *cough* days of playing on MT that might yield some interesting results. or the most part, I turned logging on 2 years ago and never turned it off. <br>
=============================================================<br>
<br>
* I leave the story about Faveo to be told by Aaldari, but I recommend translating the name from it's latin to get the general idea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
** It was a common misconception that I was the leader of Tears of Veeshan. This was probably due to my being involved in many aspects of the GoB as well as generally making an ass of myself publicly.<br>
<br>
*** Champions of the Light, if memory serves, was actually originally created as a perminent guild war idea. The Champs and an evil guild would be perminently in a guild war and RPers could join anytime they wanted. As far as I know, there were no real Mains in CotL untill after the MoD breakup. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Aseop</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> would certainly know more about this, but I havn't seen him in a very long time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
**** PoKS was founded by Danadur and any information about it should be asked of him or whoever the leadership is now. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;"> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=445727" target="top">Arcanist, Slayer of Dragons</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.webhazard.net/images/ennya/ennya1.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
