<br>
in a previous post you stated that the treatment of blacks in america was<br>
<br>
&quot;worse than the witch hunt of the jews during WWII&quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
that the Holocuast was just one man pissed off at the jewish people.<br>
<br>
First i usually feel you get bashed undeservedly, however you try to say that not allowing a black person drink from a fountain is worse than using a jewish man as a lamp shade has got to be the most idiotic, dumbfvcked, sh!t for brains thing ive ever heard, from you or anyone else here. do you realize how many THOUSANDS died at the hands of the Nazis in germany? WTF. saying forcing a black person to sit in the back of the buss is worse than hearding a 100 families into a gas chamber and then forcing thier families and friends to bury them is INCREDIABLY STUPID.<br>
<br>
second the Holocuast was not the action of ONE man. Hitler got elected on a platform of hate. hating Jews, talking about how they owned all the banks and were destroying the mother land. he promised to clean them out, take back the mother land, and was loved for it. the mass murder COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT TREMENDOUS SUPPORT. even the dumbest soldier will hesitate at killing women and children, UNLESS HE AGREES WITH IT.<br>
<br>
<br>
also do you realize there are many countries working kids for hours on end, simply to support thier families. yet somehow AMERICA is the root of all evil. yeah were not shining, but were a damn good foot above alot of people out there. do we often look out for own interests? Dam straight. if i recall correctly Sweden did fall to german occupation. many will argue that Russia won the war, perhaps, though id argue hitlers armies poor planning was responsible for many of the losses the suffered in that. it would not of happend had america not been there. PERIOD.<br>
<br>
also later in a post you talked how you broke down some Anarchist about not voting, then turned around and said you yourself didnt VOTE, WTF IS THAT ABOUT. <br>
<br>
you &quot;your dumb not to vote, its a very important right&quot;<br>
<br>
young girl &quot; your right i think i will try to vote next time&quot;<br>
<br>
you &quot; why bother, i didnt vote either, your vote doesnt matter&quot;  <br>
<br>
EH? OOOKK so mostly you were just trying to argue with her.<br>
<br>
Qartum- you talk about his obstruction of justice. first they had no business asking where he put his thing in the first place, just cause your elected doesnt mean america needs a web cam in your bedroom. so yeah of course he lied, what else was he supposed to do plead the 5th. dont think he had that right as it wasnt a criminal trial but a civil suit( i think), what else was he supposed to do?of course hes gonna deny an extra marital affair. <br>
<br>
had monica claimed she also was a victim of his sexual harrasment then sure. she didnt. she was a mistress, just becuase you sleep around doesnt mean your sexually harrasing others, but had he admitted to having an affair it sure would of added weight to Flowers claims. even though the two are unrealted it would of clouded the air. <br>
<br>
what i know about Clinton is that he started bringing the country out of the Trickle down depression it was in and made strides in international relations, also started breaking down the HUGE war machine with no war to fight that the republincans had created. what he did in his bedroom was his own business, or should of been. i watched the tape on his interview, and the questions they were asking him would of made a hooker blush, much less a elected official.<br>
<br>
also to say they( republicans ) werent gunning for him, is i think incorrect. everything the man did was subject to a special inquiry of the senate. im sure they audited his buttpaper to make sure he hadnt passed out any white house buttwipe to visiting dignitaries. <br>
<br>
now dont get me wrong, i understand clinton was not a saint. was far from a GOOD person, but i doubt you could find many eleceted officials that are. cept maybe in the house of rep and its only a matter of time before they get bought. sides if you gotta have a shady character leading the nation it may as well be one who could get away with it.<br>
<br>
to sum it all up our system is great. it really is. with the allocation of powers, the built in checks and balances, our &quot;growing&quot; constitution, i love all of it. what i dont like is the throttle hold Two parties maintain on it. both trying to act like they care for the people, yet neither really does, what they care about is getting re-elected, making money, or keeping thier party in power.<br>
<br>
i think our campaging needs lots of work also, offices should not be bought by being able to dig up the most dirt or throw out the most commericals. they should be won on the candidates own merits, not how poor the other candidate is.<br>
<br>
back to orginal topic though GORE &gt; Bush. i realized BUSH was a piece of fecal matter left behind by a flattened Armadillo that was brought to life when he decided to review the death sentance of a man on death row. this after refusing to review like 16 stragiht. yet when the election was on he needed to sway some bleeding hearts and show he could be a compassionate man, so he reviewed the case, then threw the switch. that has got to be the most tasteless thing ive ever seen. he campaigned using a mans life like an ad spot on TV.<br>

<br>
<br>
when comparing jewish hair in pillows with black people getting to drink from separate, often &quot;worse&quot; water, i was refering to what was socially accepted. not technically worse. i dont care about bodycounts..i care about ethics. ethics based on normal people, not a madman who forces his people to do what he wants.<br>
<br>
the with hunt on jews was based on a mad leader, who threatened his people to death (stasi, gestapo) to follow him.<br>
<br>
black people were treated as slaves. or animals rather. and it was socially accepted by most of the american population. thats why i consider it worse then hunting jews in the 30's -40's.<br>
<br>
hitler got his votes by listening to the people, who at the time were weak and needed a leader to shine. but in the end, it was a one man job, based on hitlers ideas. he could live out these ideas when gaining the support from a nation who just wanted to be something big, enticing the nation with good economy, world domination yadda yadda.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
excuse my language, i know its rather naive, but ive had a hectic day on the work today (first day actually..a lot to do, a lot to learn), and i cant find my vocabulary..to tired. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;also do you realize there are many countries working kids for hours on end, simply to support thier families. yet somehow AMERICA is the root of all evil.&quot;<br>
<br>
i know i know. and its still legal to rape women in some arabic countries as well. but thats not the point here.. my point was that it was hypocratic to build a newborn country - the land of the free - on slavery.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;also later in a post you talked how you broke down some Anarchist about not voting, then turned around and said you yourself didnt VOTE, WTF IS THAT ABOUT.&quot;<br>
<br>
i was refering to VOTING BLANK. u hand in your ticket, but u dont write anything on it. that way, u havent voted on any parties, but yet supported the democracy. sorry if i explained it weird.<br>
<br>
i voted blank, and i changed her mind about 'not voting at all' to 'voting blank and support democracy, but still show the gouverment that u dont support their politics'.<br>

<br>
believe it or not many things were done in this country WITHOUT slaves. there were a great many people who disagreed with slavery, did ya ever hear about the american civil war? one of the big points of that war was that the North wanted to abolish slavery and the south wanted to hold on to it dearly.<br>
<br>
 while your pointing fingers about slavery id like you to point a few also at the tribal leaders and nations of africa that sold thier men, women, and children for beads and baubles. not all slaves were kidnapped, a great many of them were traded. also after the civil war had ended many slaves were offered a chance to return to thier homeland, yet most all of them stayed. not that this justifies it mind you but america is not alone in the shame of slavery.<br>
<br>
the whole slavery versus holocuast though... dont you realize that the majority of the military had to believe what hitler preached or that the man was elected by a popular vote? scientists jumped at the chance to experiment on live humans in the name of the mother land. now im not saying all germans wanted to murder jews, but a great many of them were more than willing to blame all thier countries hardships on the race as a whole.<br>
<br>
let me tell you though if you really wanna bash american history then i suggest you research american treatment of the native american (aka indians , thanks to coloumbus). we pushed and crowded them off thier homelands into small colonies of the worst land around becuase of MANIFEST DESTINY, which the people of the times claimed it was our god given right to spread our nation from sea to sea.<br>
<br>
out of curiosity how far back does one have to go for your history to be bad, at what point do you decide that its far enough back to not be relevant anymore? im sure if we go back far enough in Swede history we can find tribes of people who would raid plunder and pillage thier own countrymen (though at that point they were just neighboring tribes). im sure we could even find swedes who happily and readily turned in jewish peoples in an attemtp to curry favor with the new occupying body. <br>
<br>
lets not forget america itself is only a few hundred years old. were still kind of new on the global scheme of things. we dont have the previous 1000 years of domination or crimes against humanity, like say oh england. yet were an easy target being <br>
the last remaining super power.<br>
<br>
lets also not forget the great many things america has done for many nations and peoples of the world. including africa, asia, and europe. hell probably every country in the world has at one time or another recieved some benefit from america. with the possible exception of antartica, and im sure if all the penguins came together and asked the united nations to help protect them from the viscious slaughter at the hands of polar bears ( or what ever might hunt a penguin) that america would be the first to commit troops.<br>

i may be wrong on this one, but i do believe one of the things that set america apart, in the beginning, was our ideas of freedoom. things like freedom of the press, freedom of religion things many nations looked at and said hey thats a good idea, now most &quot;free&quot; nations follow suit. you often talk about how much more informed swedes are than americans then make the kind of broad generalizations and way off base statements like this. /boggle<br>

even if Iraq made several nukes, the probability of them deviously transporting it to the US and exploding it is slim.  if anything they would most probably use it in a regional conflict...this is ofcourse guesswork.  nukes are also extremely expensive to produce.. and Iraq (even if Bush's speculations are 100% correct) would not have enough materials to produce more than a handful.  <br>
<br>
i mentioned SU because of the showcase on the security of the installations where nukes are stored and the ease in which materials have been removed from the country.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ukreket.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kreket</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fimble Adorer</span><br>  Posts: 1019<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/16/02 10:22:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Blekljsfd</span><hr size=1> &quot;dont assume all americans owned slaves man. also dont assume all americans are racist&quot;<br>

as far as i know, my quote would be &quot;and it was socially accepted by most of the american population.&quot;<br>
<br>
feel free to interpret it anyway u like, but please dont put words in my mouth.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;while your pointing fingers about slavery id like you to point a few also at the tribal leaders and nations of africa that sold thier men, women, and children for beads and baubles.&quot;<br>
<br>
we are already past that one. u pointed at it in ur previous post as well, and i still think the same thing about it - its hypocracy to build &quot;utopia&quot; on slavery. no matter HOW much slavery going on in the world. only cause slavery is accepted in the world, doesnt justify it, imo. (parallell: ww2 and nazis)<br>
<br>
<br>
and as for the red indians, i think i mentioned somewhere that the american soil was stolen in general. but everyone knows this, so why dig deeper into it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;out of curiosity how far back does one have to go for your history to be bad, at what point do you decide that its far enough back to not be relevant anymore? &quot;<br>
<br>
well, consider usa about 300-400 years old. what does that tell u? it tells u that usa is a modern country. during the peak, when the settlers arrived in 1850+, slavery was still a big industry in the usa. and it kept going on til the late 30's or so. after that, there was no official slavery, but yet a lot of mental slavery. blacks were treated awfully wrong. and some people think yet today that they are animals, or at least should be treated like one. and i THINK black people didnt even get to vote as late as in the 60's.<br>
<br>
same thing here as before.. im not comparing evil doings with each other. im just looking at the foundation of &quot;the land of the free&quot;, &quot;the land that would change the world to the better&quot; - the land with freedom, peace, work for everyone, happy happy joy joy yadda yadda.. is just a lie, imo. &quot;the american spirit&quot; is a lie.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;lets also not forget the great many things america has done for many nations and peoples of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
would u react here if i started talking about how much the german cars have done to the world etc.?<br>
<br>
im not comparing PROs to CONs here, really..thats not what this is about.<br>
<br>
&quot;well..he DID rape that girl over there, but then again..he gave $1 to that bum, so..hes not that bad after all!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

<br>
&quot;lets not forget america itself is only a few hundred years old. were still kind of new on the global scheme of things. we dont have the previous 1000 years of domination or crimes against humanity, like say oh england.&quot;<br>
<br>
um..its not that the american people just popped out from american soil 300 years ago and started from 0. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

consider america an extension to the biggest super power in the world at the time - united kingdom. add some spanish, italian, latinos, swedes, finnish etc. to that - this is usa. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
do u really think u started from 0, with no experience? i would say u had at least TWICE the experience comparing to just england alone.<br>
<br>
its interesting here that u mention england and &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;, since u followed their example, but shipped slaves out of africa to america. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

am i generalizing? dont forget that i havent said once that ALL americans are yadda yadda.<br>
<br>
swedes knowing more about the surrounding world then americans (both in general) is a fact. i have explained it many times before, tho people tend to not listen to my comments and stick to shouting &quot;RACIST JOO RACIST!&quot; allover the place. *sigh* (edit: or after what i have read, laralalalalla is not to be considered 'people' heh)<br>

This country was not &quot;built on slavery&quot; Yes, there was a portion of the populace that profited from the slaves, primarily south of the Mason-Dixon line. There was also an even larger portion that had nothing to do with slavery. And I think our countries greatest accomplishements have all taken place AFTER the Civil War and the abolishment of slavery. <br>

<br>
My family, sadly, held slaves back in the day. as far as i understand they were &quot;respected&quot; slavers, had a street named after them in one town. the point of that is, I DIDNT DO IT, no living american today owned a slave ( maybe a sex slave but thats a whole nother twisted area between two adults <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). so what is the sense in hating america for the crimes commited centuries ago? do you hate germany? japan? britain?<br>
<br>
If some sadist started another genocide who do you think would be the first country to volunteer thier men and women, blood and money, to protect those being persecuted? AMERICA. weve done it several times in the recent past, and well do it again, everytime. do we often serve our own interests in doing so? yup, and why shouldnt we? we're here to run our country for the better good of our people, not to be taken advantage of by every Jonn or Gregor that can get in line.<br>
<br>
it pisses me off to see how europeons( is that the right word if it is they should come up with a new one, dont want to be called a EURO-PEON <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) can see the wrong that america does or has done( and yeah ive been there personally and seen it happen personally, US NAVY thank you) but kindly gloss right over all the good our nation and our people have done. they conviently forget how we sent our boys to die on thier shores to stop a homicidal mad man that had virtually whooped all thier arses. they forget that when children starve in third world countries, american products and aid groups are the first to try to help.<br>
<br>
to sum it up i dont see how you can hate americans based on thier treatment of africans over a hundred years ago. there was a problem and we corrected it. yet your still holding a grudge against it, WHY? <br>
<br>
as far as the racism that was around more recently ( the rosa parks, MLK JR era) and in some places continues still today( dont assume its restricted to america, or white peoples cuase its not in either case). it is not socially accepted, it is not the opinion held by the majority of americans, however we will still allow them to spew thier hate becuase we believe in freedom of people, even those that have a differing view than ours. <br>
<br>
if Osama had come to america and sought citizen ship he could of stood in the middle of new york and told everyone how evil america was and how much we deserved to be destroyed( so long as he didnt threaten individual persons or attempt to carry out the destruction). hell he could of run for office and formed an islamic coalition for islamic rights in america and abroad, he probably would of been appluaded for it. he choose to fight, so we'll fight back.<br>

i dont, that was something i said cause i was mad. i took it back in some post, and didnt want to edit it. i consider editing ur (my) points weak. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
i both LIKE and DISLIKE america tho (i think i wrote more detailed about it in my first post).<br>
<br>
<br>
my impression of the _average_ american so far:<br>
<br>
- very nice and polite (so nice u believe they are just fvcking with you. in my country people DONT sit themselves next to you on the bus, if there are other seats left. in my country u dont greet strangers on the streets with a smile).<br>
<br>
- narrow-minded in such a way they are too influenced by religion, and many questions end with &quot;..cause god wants it that way&quot;. note that this impression is taken from the southern part of america. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
- generally 'uninformed' about things that DONT involve america. american students usually &quot;feel tricked&quot; when they visit europe and stay there for some time. i think this is due to the &quot;we against them&quot; feeling americans are feeded with. europeans learn to cooperate between countries. this is not the issue with americans.<br>
<br>
- the big brother syndrom is something i _hate_. it isnt about leading, its about cooperating! if u cant cooperate, it will eventually lead to destruction (look at whats happening in usa right now f.e.). the attitude of &quot;america&quot; (the face to the world outside, bush that is) is cocky and destructive in such a way usa (bush) demands the world to bend over for him. (ex. vietnam, the nuclear bombs in iraq, space competition with sovjet). its very naive, in a way. and it amazes me that countries eat that crap.<br>
<br>
- then we have that usual bullsh!t which even most of the americans themselves consider bullsh!t - bush talking about good versus evil, and &quot;we dont bow down to anyone but god&quot; etc. etc. the religious patriotism which sounds a bit like nazism, or just confusion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If some sadist started another genocide who do you think would be the first country to volunteer thier men and women, blood and money, to protect those being persecuted? AMERICA.&quot;<br>
<br>
u say that, yes.. but have u ever dug deeper into those actions being made throughout the years? u DO know that there are LOTS and LOTS of theories on why america gets involved all the time?<br>
<br>
for example - the iraq thing that is going on right now. can u list some motives to starting a war? there are no motives, only speculations..and usa wants to start a war. without motives.. doesnt that sound a bit weird to you? that usa are planning to spend $10 million on a 1 month long war, or $20 millions for a 2 months long war..?<br>
<br>
really, some say this is all about oil, and the nuclear thing is a coverup..they need a motive to win the peoples support - &quot;nuclear bombs in the hand of an arabic madman&quot;.<br>
usa doesnt want iraqs oil to get in arabic hands. they want it in israeli hands instead, so the money will support their israel.<br>
<br>
this is only a theory, but it sounds much more motivated then the possible nuclear thing. u have to admit that.<br>
<br>
i believe in this theory. and i think the best thing for usa right now, would be to take those $20 millions and clean up ur god damned ghettos. would be a start. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
another thing that is pretty interesting is that the cia educated usama bin ladin. but ive heard that the american gouverment covers this up. the plot thickens..<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways, i dont think america would involve themselves if it didnt benefit them. sorry, but i dont consider them good people who fight the misery of the world. they are only interested in securing their post as a super power. as the big brother. IMO. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
came to think of something else..bush talked about vengeance.. between the lines that vengeance would motivate taking an action resulting in dead people. wtf!? the american people just HAVE to think hes really stupid for stating something like that. really, vengeance has nothing to do with war or politics. vengeance is only ONE thing - primitive. 'land of the free', the most high tech nation of the time back then.. and they support 'vengeance'. thats hypocracy.<br>

On September 10, 2001, would you have said that there was a 100% probability that 19 terrorists could hijack 4 US commercial airliners - simultaneously, even -  and use them to literally obliterate the WTC and 3000 or so occupants and blow a big hole in the Pentagon in less than 2 hours?  <br>
