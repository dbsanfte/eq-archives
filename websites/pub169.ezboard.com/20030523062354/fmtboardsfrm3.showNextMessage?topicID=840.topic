<br>
i try tell her that i have a 65 ench otw and also a 65 paladin(tempoff lfg bot) who i just asked to come and that all groups start somewhere. no response. so i figure fine i dont need her anyways shes probably a horrible cleric and i have vanelina coming still and the paladin. so im waiting when vanelina sends me a tell saying im sorry but someone from your group(hint akili) asked me to join her group. so now im getting really pissed. <br>
<br>
a few seconds later tempoff shows up i try to ivnite but it says shes already grouped. i ask her whats up and she says someone else invited her(akili). so im like fine at least i still have west camp i can find more people i do /w lfg sham all there were 2 lfg and i do /w lfg druid all a 65 one was lfg so i ask them to come.<br>
<br>
well im waiting for them to come and lootacris does camp check i say west. about 3 seconds later lootacris and guess who else(akili) show up in west. i explain that i called that it was camped and i have people coming. lootacris basically tells me tuff @#%$ were here first and of course everything else in bot was camped but north so i had to tell the druid and shaman to never mind.<br>
<br>
so all in all i just want to rant the following people <br>
<br>
akili<br>
lootacris<br>
vanelina<br>
tempoff<br>
<br>
for being complete asses apparently for akili, vanelina, and tempoff its not ok to help someone start a group but its fine to start their own then steal your camp. lootacris is just an ass.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nolacola>Nolacola</A> at: 5/10/03 5:25:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=teadynthedruid>Teadyn the Druid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1390<br> <font color=#628CBC>(5/10/03 6:36:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=868.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: akili and friends</span><hr size=1> loot a crisis is a dick, the others ive never heard of em... but this act was pretty gay<br>

Guess it depends on what ya feel like that particular day which camp ye want. Just thought I would post this about north, its not all that bad.<br>
Sorry you got screwed. I hate it when people aren't interested if you don't have a full grp they can just walk into. Best ones always seem to be the people that can wait a bit.<br>
btw.. I have to rave my BoT grp from Sunday. It was totally awesome. People were aa dinging so much they lost count and I dinged 65, yeah.. Named dropped the FT2 belt. We did like 8 hours in DE!

How interesting to see my name in a rant when I have done nothing wrong.<br>
<br>
Here I am in PoV running to zone out and Loot sends me a  tell askin if i wanted a group in BoT, sure i says.  He or she tells me meet in bot...cool.<br>
<br>
Anyway the point being Loot invited first so I went with the first invite.  I have no idea who these people were that I grouped with because they were a pick up group.  I did not know they had stole a camp because I was not there for camp checks.  Anyone who knows me knows that I zone  very very slow.  So from zoning out of PoV and running to BoT, then slow zone into bot...then to what ever camp it was....lots may have happened that I was not aware of.  I am not a camp stealer and will not take blame for others actions when I was totally innocent.  So gonna throw my hands up at this one....<br>

When I arrived in BoT I got an invite from Nolacola. I took it thinking he has part of Loota's group. He was not so I made my excuses and left to join Loota's group.<br>
Lootacrisis did an ooc camp check and Nola really you DID NOT say west. I'm sure you think you did but no one in my group saw it. I scrolled up to re - check a couple of times to make sure and there was no response.<br>
So we go west and find one guy who did not answer a cc saying camp is his.<br>
Sorry bro that's not gonna fly.<br>
On a side note we got trained viciously a couple of times after that by someone who was invis. Not saying it was you but there were some in my group who were a little suspicious.<br>

Nobody is required to answer to a CC call. Nope, not at all. You answer so someone doesn't run out to a camp to find it camped, it is called manners.<br>
<br>
People should respect camps, it is also a matter of manners.<br>

Sometimes if you alone and trying to start a camp.  Another group will come by and take it.  That is wrong.<br>

Just because you don't call the camp....even if you are one guy doesn't mean you lose the camp.<br>
<br>
If he had group there would you have said..hey you didn't call sorry you have to leave.<br>

When does 1 guy not mean a camp?<br>
