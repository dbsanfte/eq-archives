  A while back... about a year ago, when wraith lords was around ( kinda long ago ) he managed to heat up his stealing abilities. I'm assuming I was his first victim, as nobody I had known at the time considered him a thief. Anyway, back to what I was saying, Back when luclin had just been released, when people starting leaving EC and using other areas to auction their items, like auctions:auctions, Keb got his hands onto my Warhammer of Ethereal Energy. At the time it was my prized possesion, having a value of about 9kpp. I was trying to sell it to buy myself a spear and shield, instead of having a 2hb. After borrowing 250pp from Kebraiz to buy myself an Othmir fur cap, he asked me if he could take my warhammer, which I was trying to sell, and sell it for me. Since he was a guildie at the time, I trusted him with my hammer. Once I pressed accept on the trade I realized I would never see my beloved hammer again. After about 2 months he disappeared.<br>
     Although lately I have seen him around. I've also camped his corpse in the Bazaar Arena. Fun thing to do if you have spare time on your hands. Currently he's level 54 monk, if you have new iksar models on he is colored dark red and grey. He also likes to hang out in the bazaar arena.<br>
     I would avoid making any transactions with him, unless you like having your items / cash stolen. He is kinda young. I know his uncle on eq, or who claims to be his uncle. I'm assuming that he's either so stupid that he can't realize why everyone hates him, or he's acting dumb to make people feel have the impression that he can't grasp such complex ideas... like how to transfer items... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
(Saro is an MT guild member and friend of mine)<br>
<br>
I have been trying to recall some of the things that went on a few months ago in Karnos and DL.  Dontcha hate it when you remember laughing your butt off but don't remember the joke?<br>
<br>
I don't know much about him flat out stealing from people.  But I noted the following things about this guy:<br>
<br>
-When you group with him, you get no loot.<br>
-When you group with him, he will pull no matter whether he is assigned that task.<br>
-When you group with him he will decide when to pull regardless of everyone's status.  For example, our cleric said LOM, hold pulls.  Our puller held.  Kebraiz pulled.  We barely survived.  Our cleric was OOM.  He pulled, we zoned.  He died.  Now he was freaking level 43 at the time and had *no* business as a melee in Karnor's, especially pulling, and I'm sure feign failed on him or something.  But what I do know is that a minute later, he was actually *yelling* at us for not helping him and letting him die.<br>
-If you let a corpse get to 5:50, make sure Kebraiz isn't around.<br>
<br>
I remember once seeing him in DL while on my way to Karnor's.  He was being denied in no uncertain terms, membership in any groups there by several people.  Paraphrasing one guy:<br>
<br>
&quot;Why should we group with you?  So you can get all of those nasty corpses out of our way?&quot;  ...or something along those lines.<br>
<br>
Anyway, everyone else has worse stories about this guy it seems.  I have just seen him in action actually fighting and it is not something you want to be around.  Don't group with him.  Don't group *near* him.  Don't camp an entrance when he is in the zone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sarothiasmoonrunner>Sarothias Moonrunner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 949<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/8/03 1:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kebraiz</span><hr size=1> LOL one of thooooose types eh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://www.eqfaces.com/photos2/sarosig2_copy.jpg><br>

I needed help with a transfer. Xabasis was goin to help but we had a Lore item so Kebriaz said he could help. They were in the same guild at the time.I gave him a bunch of stuff off my mid 20s monk at the time. Logged in my druid and he was gone. I sent him a tell and he said he had to pick up something in WC. Ok no prob I have plenty of time.<br>
<br>
Well half an hour later I finally get my stuff back. Well as Im putting the geasr on I notice that he has swapped out my SCHW for a pair of Large Cloth Gloves! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After confronting him about it he claimed he was encumbered and had his brother hold the stuff and he must have taken it, therefor there was nothing he could do.<br>
<br>
Well I got ahold of a GM and of course was told that there was nothing he could do because I had &quot;given&quot; it to him.<br>
<br>
During our argument Keb conveniently went LD.<br>
<br>
After sittting in the tunnel for 4 hours, talking to his guild leader,and trying to sell my Wus Trance Stick and SoS to buy a new pair of SCHW he popped back in. I sent him a tell asap. He said yes his brother had taken them but he got them back. Still trying to figure out how they did the transfer while LD <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
