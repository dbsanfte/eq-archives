1.  Back off completely and see what happens.  Iraq would either implode at which point it would be easier to implement option 2 or it would become more moderate and less of a threat.  This is what we did with Iran.  It works, but very slowly.  (not saying Iran is a peace loving moderate, only that they are slowly becoming less of a threat).<br>
<br>
2.  Go in, dismantle the Iraqi regime piece by piece.  Accept the losses that a fully commited land war will bring.  Accept the resource expenditure that a rebuilding of Iraq will bring.  Spend 10 to 20 years there helping them become a nation again as a rebuilding force, not an occupation force.<br>
<br>
I'm voting for option 2 since it has better odds of succeeding.  However, I don't think our government is willing to commit to it.  Their approval ratings will sink the moment the US populace realizes we may lose more than a few &quot;TV heros&quot;.  <br>

No rational person supports war.

I suggest a third and fourth effect to if &quot;we&quot; leave Iraq alone,<br>
1- it implodes (facists can only stay in power so long before the people revolt... it only took the soviets ~90 years or so...)<br>
2- they become more moderate (they decide they like McD's french fries and decide to start embracing more moderate philosophies so they can enjoy our fast food)<br>
3- (Saddam = Guild Leader of Phantom Knights) they develop their WoMD and bully their neighbors more than they already are.<br>
4- (Saddam = Guild Leader of Burn) they continue to try to rebuild their nation.  Due to Saddam's ArcheType AA skill boosting his charisma he continues to lead his country and become extremely wealthy.  Eventually he dies and one of his sons takes over.  2 generations of heirs from now, one of these heirs was PLed and is totally gimp and the people of Iraq finally revolt and seek out a non-gimp Guild Leader.<br>

<br>
And rational people can easily support war.  It has been and still is one of the most effective solutions to many problems.  However, if you fight a war, you need to be fully commited to it and willing to accept the losses.  I don't think the US has been fully commited to a military conflict and its successful long term resolution since WW2. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

However,  I don't believe you should have to find a reason to go to war. War should be in option when it is SO BLATENTLY obvious that Iraq threatens the sovereignty of the United States and its Allies, and truthfully the facts presented are WEAK at best. The only option I would agree to right now is a Joint-U.N. military force going in and disarming again violators, and in turn tighten sanctions on Iraq. No more Food for Oil programs. I think if Saddamn lets his people starve and die, then he will dig his own grave with the UN community. I really think being the leader of this military action is not bad, but I don't want to do this alone, and until we have France and Germany on our side then we should continue to find solutions politically. <p>&lt;a href=&quot;http://senaleb.freeservers.com/main.html/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<br>

<br>
The problems I see with allowing Iraq to self-destruct internally through decades of sanctions are numerous.  First of all, the obvious problem is that there's no guarantee that Hussein won't simply continue concentrating on his personal agenda while his people die slowly--his actions over the past decade support this.  <br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't know that the approach is necessarily a viable one, anyway.  Yes, it ultimately did work for Russia, because we were able to halt their aggressive efforts to secure countries full of resources that they needed to survive and thrive through armed conflicts.  Now we're left with a gigantic region filled with disenfranchised drunks basically being run by disparate pockets of organized crime.  That's obviously a generalization, but the kernel of truth is there.  Compare that to Germany and Japan, who were defeated soundly in war and then allowed to rebuild with our help, and it's hard to convince me that the former approach is necessarily better than the latter.  Sure, in the short-term less lives are lost, but the long-term benefits don't justify it in my opinion.  Let me reiterate:  in my opinion. <br>
<br>
Sunmina is right--it can't be a half-assed &quot;policing action&quot; if it's going to succeed on all fronts.  It has to be an all out invasion, which I think Bush has been trying very hard to prepare the American people for that eventuality.  Unfortunately, the jury of popular opinion isn't convinced, with good reason.  These kinds of decisions are the hardest to make, but based on history and everything that I've personally seen, a decisive and committed invasion is the best answer.  Otherwise we're opening ourselves and the rest of the free world up to several years of cultural and economic extortion by underindustrialized countries with incredibly weak economies but who happen to be capable of mass destruction.  <br>
<br>
