<br>
The way I see it, there are two reasonable ways for a person to respond if he or she is in this situation, and neither involve calling people idiots/tools/fools.  Assuming you're not gonna quit the game or delete.<br>
<br>
1. Decide that you don't care what people think, and keep on doing what you've been doing.  In this case, this thread and whatever else is irrelevant to you.<br>
<br>
2. Decide that you do care and want to try to fix it as best you can.  In this case, the first step is trying to understand how you have wronged people.  That means seriously trying to understand how they feel about the situation.  Then you need to sincerely apologize for the things you have done, and the harm you have caused.  Even if you disagree about the details, it's time to step up and take it like an adult.  Then you need to go about trying to rehabilitate your reputation, knowing that some people will never forgive or forget.  This will be a long process, but will get better over time.  You can even think of it in EQ terms, max kos is one of the longest faction levels.  You just need to keep chipping away by doing good things, and ceasing to do anything that may even be perceived badly.  The simple fact is you don't fix a reputation by fighting with the people you've harmed.  That's why I said your post was a @#%$ up, Yosheee.<br>
<br>
The cliff's notes version of this is in my last post:<br>
<br>
Don't @#%$ up, and when you do, apologize and do better in the future.<br>
<br>
It's that simple.  It just takes a long time.<br>
<br>
Cheers...<br>

He exhibits positively sociopathic tendencies, and he clearly lives in utter denial.  That's not even taking into account his complete lack of anything even remotely resembling interpersonal skills, or any semblance of self-realization with regard to causality and accountability.  <br>
<br>
It's hard for me to believe that this person has &quot;friends&quot; at all, since apparently at times his life becomes so boring that the only entertainment he can dredge up is to get liquored up and commit acts of virtual terrorism on people in a video game because they wouldn't let him into their club--repeatedly.  From reading his reactions in this thread, and the personal eyewitness accounts of several trustworthy and honorable folks who were present, it seems to me that your &quot;friend&quot; is headed straight into Columbine territory at a breakneck pace.  I can only hope that his Mommy and Daddy don't own any firearms.  <br>
<br>
In any case, you seem like a levelheaded, reasonable individual, and if you really consider yourself this pitiful, socially inept, self-absorbed wannabe your friend, get him some counseling, or at the very least, get him laid, because frankly, he comes off exactly like a petulant 10-year-old who needs a nap and refuses to take any responsibility for his actions.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dubbo>Dubbo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 557<br> <font color=#628CBC>(6/26/03 2:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=184>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> &quot;you know as well as I do he wouldn't do anything to cause a wipe&quot;<br>
<br>
Let's pretend for a second that he belonged there, that he wasn't asked/told to leave 9 billion times, that he wasn't intentionally interfering with and attempting to distact the raid. Let's assume he wasn't responsible for aggroing Lord MM to camp (I can't prove he did nor have I suggested he did in this thread, I only know it wasn't our monks, nobody with the raid took responsibility for the aggro, and I know it's impossible to aggro Lord MM from that distance without a hostile action on his stair guards, which btw do see invis, as you can't reach MM with any bow or any spell from that corner). Let's pretend he was a welcome Triune member, in the raid with us, who chose to FD in and block off our MT corner - he would STILL be directly responsible for our inability to position Lord MM correctly. He WAS responsible for our inability to position Lord MM correctly. PERIOD.<br>
<br>
Since you're a clueless freaking noob I will clue you in on something. Giggit FDd directly IN our MT corner, blocking it off so we could not use it to position. Lord MM is in my educated opinion the most difficult encounter in the game pre-RZ, getting everything right is important, though I wouldn't expect your dumb ass to understand that. Lord MM ripostes are frequent and unforgiving. He ripostes a high percentage of incoming attacks. Usually the result is a returnblow to the attacker which often does either 2096 or 5596 damage - he most commonly ripostes for one of these two values (per blow). Having your entire raid force attacking him frontally simply is not an option. However, Giggit decided to FD his fat ass IN our MT corner, refusing to move, and remained blocking that corner for nearly a full 2 minutes after Lord MM mysteriously reached camp. He singlehandedly ensure that we could not position MM properly, and our entire raid force had to attack him frontally. He's raided with TW, he understood how we were attempting to position Lord MM, he knew what he was doing and it was absolutely done with malicious intent.<br>
<br>
Poor misunderstood and innocent Giggit though, he would never do anything that might interfere with the success of a large scale raid or cause a wipe though, would he?<br>
<br>
<br>
You're an idiot. Class dismissed. Go play in the freeway.<br>

This was not Triune's first kill of MM, nor second or third even. MM is not trivial to us , but nor is he a major threat. &quot;Reputation&quot; on MM is sighned , sealed and delivered.  <br>

they could wipe on MM tomorrow. While it be doubtful, you never know the variables. What makes you good is always having a good back-up plan, and I believe by now Triune has excellent &quot;Plan B's&quot; in place for any situation.<br>

There's no back-up plan for A_Dumbass_Player_01 that's not guilded. That's a guaranteed wipe almost everytime.

You are both absolutely correct that Giggit was not in any way violating the EULA.  Nor could you be more wrong in bringing that up here.  EULA violations are handled by Sony, either in game through GMs or outside the game through Custionmer Service.<br>
<br>
This board has no connection to Sony.  While mentioning EULA violations here might at times be entertaining, it is not the purpose of this or the Rants forum.  The purpose of these forums is to address situations where the MT community's sense of proper conduct has been abused.  As such, this thread regarding Giggit is right on target and it is the two of you who are spouting irrelevant drivel about the EULA. <p>Sage Yugy of the Nexus<BR>

What you decide really does NOT matter. You do not set offical policy. I was trying to understand how he trained MM on you. Several people mentioned he trained him on you. Now do NOT expect me to pass  judgement on someone when i have a few questions to ask. Simply because you have made up your mind. <br>
<br>
Also again he can be in the zone he can be at the fight as long as he does not actively interfere. I am against the policy of telling people to leave zones because your raiding there.<br>
<br>
Now i would also like to point out i did not use any foul language which most of you cant seem to avoid. I also did not call anyone any names.<br>
<br>
If you have a point to make it in a civil tone or you lose any crediblity as far as i am concerned. Do not bully me but that is what you do best isnt it?<br>

Can't you read?<br>
<br>
No one in raid pulled him!  They were waiting on him to move before pulling him.  They told him repeatly to move so they could pull.<br>
<br>
People are being rude to you because you don't seem to understand what happened that night.  You continue to ASSume that all he did was stand there and watch.<br>
<br>
He did not..just stand there.  He was in THE WAY!.  He trained See invible mobs.  If you planning a raid and have a startegy that works best for you..why should you have to alter it because somebody is in the way.<br>
<br>
Obviously you have not been on too many raids Nanur cause one person can wipe out a raid very easily.<br>
<br>
Boy..You need to relax and just admit you were wrong.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I too have posted in haste and been very wrong in my posts and have apolgized.<br>
<br>
I think people will have more respect for you if you did so instead of consitantly playin the devil's advocate on this one.  He didn't make it here because of one offense but for mulitple offenses.  Wake up bro. <p>Wilerian Winterborn<br>

I'll admit that I'm not an expert in tcp/ip issues, but this seems relatively futile and worthless.<br>
<br>
It is fairly trivial for a person to post on this board from numerous ip addresses.  Any dial-up account generally assigns a new temporary ip address with every connection.  In the case of broadband, having a static ip address is generally a premium feature that costs more, as most assign dynamic ip addresses with each connection.  Then one must consider the possibility of posting from different locations.  As a result, different ip addresses would do little to prove that any two posters are different people.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, many people play eq from internet cafes and other such establishments, where many computers share the same ip address as far as the internet at large is concerned.  There are indeed ways to identify individual machines in such instances, but an ip check is far too clumsy a tool, to the best of my knowledge.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, and I might be wrong, the MAC address is the only thing close to a unique identifier of a specific machine, and even that only identifies the connection hardware.  Also, the Yosheee claims to be Giggit's friend, and might well have posted from Giggit's home, or wherever Giggit typically acceses the internet.<br>
<br>
On another note, for what it's worth, after talking to Giggit a bit on this subject, I do believe he is sorry for the harm he has caused.  I know that may be of little comfort or consequence to those posting here, but maybe it's a tiny start.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
