<br>
personally, i would build a fort in the lake of il omen, guarded by 2 level 75 dragons - a seal and a perch.<br>
<br>
morell-thule would be pvp, only for me..hehe. i would sit on my throne in my underwater castle and guard the greatest treasure of them all - &quot;bogga's nightdress&quot; which would be a chest piece with ALL/ALL AC 100, +100 ALL STATS and complete healing as triggered effect (off course).<br>
in this castle, i would also stash all my treasures found when roaming the lands, including players' corpses. to retrieve them, you would simply have to get passed me. and no rogues would be able to hide or sneak. and no succor or evacs would work in my castle.<br>
<br>
occasionally when bored, i would go out and roam the zone. i would have a special effect that would let me instant kill anything i clicked on.<br>
<br>
..and all /petitions regarding this would be simply deleted by using /deletepetition. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

#2:  Just because you are born an Ogre does not make you Evil.  In a World that you cannot KS, TRAIN, or Ninja Loot, what is being Evil anyway?  I say all races are born Neutral until proven otherwise.<br>
#3:  All city Guards would be bribeable (is that a word) to allow access into the city they guard.<br>
#4:  Mammals such as lions, tigers, bears and wolves would give NEGATIVE exp to Druids and Rangers - Treants too.<br>
#5:  Someone that can solo a Wurm, or hit for 300 points of damage should have ZERO trouble with locked doors.  &quot;I just tanked VOX, smashing her for 4K damage per minute, but I just can't seem to kick this wooden door in.....&quot;<br>
#6: A Thief would be able to climb a wall into a city (or 2nd floor)<br>
#7:  You would be able to quest for a NPC bride or groom that would then be found in the city of your choice, complete with apartment, and access to the world bank.  You would have to keep faction up with said bride or groom, or they would leave, taking your dog (and house).<br>
#8:  All Vendor spells would be no-drop, and could ONLY be bought by a level appropriate class.<br>
#9:  All visits to your guild building would result in you &quot;donating&quot; X amount of coin based on your level.  (You think those vendors just stand around WAITING for you to grace their presence?)  You have to PAY to have a nice guild hall.  THUS, this is the reason for #8, to keep people from beating the system<br>
#10: POSITIVE FACTION would be based on a TURN IN SYSTEM.  Every mob would have a no-drop item to prove their death.  You would have to turn these items to a Faction Keeper to raise faction.  When I killed 1200 Doggies in the Warrens, there is no way that Paineel and Erudian would have known I was doing all that good work.<br>
#11:  Vendors would only speak their native tongues.<br>
#12:  Every zone would have a safe house where if you are not agroed, you could enter and do things like, leave the computer.  These safe houses would be regen free and mana regen free.  MEANING - you could not exploit the system by running in there to med.  IF you run into house while on hate list - you can be attacked and killed.  If you go LD, you will go to that safe house.  THUS:  IF you LD while NOT under attack, you come back safely, and from there you could decide to go BACK to last point or stay in safehouse.  If under attack, The Mob will port back to safe house with you.<br>
#13:  If you, as a player, discover that you can attack MOB_01 and NOT get hit back, then exploit it all you want.  If you find a way to exploit MY company's mistake, why do I ban YOU? I think I would rather ban the programmer that messed up the code.* <br>
#14 I will invoke the Bugbladder Beast Code:  If you cannot see it, it cannot see you.  IF you can't be hurt, it cannot be hurt.  So no mobs hitting you through buildings.<br>
#15:  Players will gain skill points in WALKING and RUNNING in different Terrains.  Meaning, since most people can pretty much run around without falling down, then I should not take 18 points of damage for stepping off a mole-hill.  The better you get get at Running around, the less chance you have of taking damage.  CLIFFS and DUMB MOVES will still cause damage, but running on the treacherous terrain of West Commons is not going to give you damage.  I mean, come on, it is a HILL!  Once hitting 200, on running and walking, you can safely navigate all normal terrains.<br>
#16:  If a Mob cannot fall off a bridge or path, neither can you.  In other words, when I blind a mob in, say, Blackburrow, and they run the wooden bridge and never fall....then I should not be able to fall either.  I call this the GOOSE GANDER Rule.<br>
#17.  There will be a HUGE fence around THE HOLE.  There will be gates that you can open if you really feel like plunging to your death.  There will be no way to &quot;accidently&quot; fall into a hole the size if a city.<br>
#18:  You can be fat, tall, short or small, within reason.  Not everyone is buff.<br>
<br>
That should be a start for MY world.<br>
<br>
* A while back, some guild was banned for their clerics healing from a SAFE SPOT where they could not be attacked.  This was considered an exploit.  To me, I call that strategy.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Okay, Clerics, I want you to heal us from over here, so that the nasty Dragon can hurt you if it wants to.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ummm, but I can heal you just fine from that Foxhole over there...and not get hurt too...wouldn't that make more sense?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!  We have to fight fair here - all people should have an equal chance of dying....&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;ummmm okay - ummmm TAXI~!!!!!&quot;<br>

Then I would spawn a group of Druid pets with different colors and name them after Care Bears and have them guilded a The Care Bear Gang. I would then set up a Final fight against the Sleeper and the Care Bears on the Final island in POA. After The sleeper was slain by a Well timed and Critted Care bear Stare the Nameless would pop as a fart and /kill eq iteself.<br>
<br>
You would then get booted to the server select screen and a message would appear that says you have just finished EQ. Please uninstall EQ and go to your nearest store and buy EQ2. Thanks and have a good day.<br>
<br>
But who can hack eq anyways????  Haxxor the Gibson?<br>
<br>
On another note has anyone ever seen a person use Show EQ? Ive always wondered just how cool that software could be. Call it cheating but I think it would be real neat to see just what goes on behind the scenes when your logged on. I myself have not even a clue as to how to use it so dont say I am ;P<br>
<br>
And now for something completely different.....<br>

showeq - Realtime packet analyser for Everquest   <br>
DESCRIPTION <br>
ShowEQ sits passively and waits for everquest packets to pass by on the ethernet card. It rebuilds the data stream and displays useful information about the data being sent between client and server. ShowEQ needs to have root access to be able to receive the packets, so make sure you run it as root. <br>
<br>
That pretty much sums up what it is and does. Check out:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/seq/">sourceforge.net/projects/seq/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
for all youll ever need to know<br>
<br>
Just a word.... I in no way use or even own a copy of showeq but I will not withhold information for the curious....<br>
