from my computer.<br>
<br>
I guess I will add some involved comments here, thank folks and whatnot.<br>
<br>
It all got started in October of 2000. I met Jacy (I won't put her real name) over the internet. We talked to each other off and on through AOL chat from 1997 to 2000, and one day I got sick of Memphis, and told her I wanted to move out there. Mostly because I wanted to meet and be with her, partly because I wanted to GTFO of Memphis. <br>
<br>
We met in Atlanta, GA a week before I moved out there, to Tucson, AZ. She came to hang with my friends and me because my best friend's sister was getting married, and I figured it to be a good time to get an ok feel of one another (take that however you want).<br>
<br>
My best friend and I took off for Tucson, AZ, at the beginning of October of 2000.<br>
<br>
All this time, she would tell me Everquest, which I only knew of as &quot;the game she played.&quot; So, I got out there, and she finally sold me into playing this game, because before that I would say, &quot;That Dungeons and Dragons crap is for geeks and losers.&quot; Thus, I became a geek and a loser.<br>
<br>
I played the hell out of this game, for a long, long time. When I should have been going out and finding employment, I would be sitting in front of the computer playing my new rogue, mage, or whatever the flavor of the day was.<br>
<br>
Well, our roommate turned into a REAL psycho (another story, another time), and I started feeling homesick (this redneck can't stand so much dirt, rock, and cacti) so I made a decision to come back. I discussed it with &quot;Jacy&quot; and after some thought she decided to come with me.<br>
<br>
From January to March, her and I, with the help of friends and family, worked out the details of making such an abrupt exit from Tucson, and we got into our own place, an apartment in east Memphis. Pretty much as soon as we moved in, we had another phone line installed, and we got back into the game like we hadn't missed a beat.<br>
<br>
I made Maxximuus on April 13th, 2001. It was a Friday evening, believe it or not. We played heavily and whole-heartedly. We were &quot;gamers.&quot; All the while, I skipped out on what it was like to be a boyfriend, or in the very least, a man in the house with his woman. I neglected my friends, my bills, and my girlfriend for this game.<br>
<br>
Tensions came to break us apart in August of 2001 (other things beyond the game, but I'm sure EQ was an added pressure), and she went to live with a new friend, and when the lease came up in October 31st, I moved home with my parents.<br>
<br>
I stopped playing when we broke up in August, 2001. I was level 35, I think.<br>
<br>
After a significant car wreck on December 26th, 2001, left me semi-impaired for 3 weeks time, I picked up the game again in February, 2002. It took me away from the pressures of life, the big one being the ongoing court battle I had with the insurance company of the guy who wrecked my car and nearly killed me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Jacy&quot; came to help me during this time, and it was at this time we got back together. My court crap ended July 3rd, 2002, and &quot;Jacy&quot; and I broke up again at the beginning of August. We have been broken up ever since.<br>
<br>
Through all of this time playing this game, I have met some really wonderful people:<br>
<br>
Crystilla - if she's as wonderful IRL as she is to people in game, then the people who know her have someone really special in their life, and Miasma is one lucky man<br>
<br>
Shadora - what can I say, this man is a bastion of information on ways to live and deal. Whenever I get on one of my high horses, or if I needed some general advice, even through his broken English, I could and would learn alot from him.<br>
<br>
Brutuz and Atha - 2 different people indeed, but they are married <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I could sit and talk to Brutuz for hours. He's a real calm and cool, laid back kinda guy, but he's quick to stand for what he feels is right. Atha is really playful and a real go getter too. She's right around whatever is going down usually. They make each other cooler than they are individually.<br>
<br>
Qarxu - this is Q. You all know Q. He's real fun and down to earth, great person to have a conversation with. There's alot of goodness behind his words, and usually there's alot more to learn than what the words describe.<br>
<br>
Phalnobor - if you ever need someone on your side, this is who you need. You make him your friend, he's your friend to the end. He's just a real good guy.<br>
<br>
Moonleaf - talked to her one night just 2-3 months ago. She's about as sweet and innocent as they come, or at least she roleplays it very well.<br>
<br>
Hobby - my first real friend on this game. If I were to miss anyone the most, it would be Hobby and my friendship with him. There's alot of good qualities that some people have, but when you truly consider someone your friend, it isn't so much about qualities anymore. It's just the simple fact that they're your friend.<br>
<br>
Karor - never really made a true friendship with him, but he taught me a quick and stern lesson into thinking before speaking a few months back, and it carried over into real life. I wanted to thank him for that.<br>
<br>
Alwin - if anyone was my &quot;dog&quot; or my &quot;homie,&quot; this Swede kicks much ass. If you got Jacy, Alwin, and myself together, we had badass groups most of the time, both fun in chat and fun during battles.<br>
<br>
Jacy - I have to note her. without her, I wouldn't have ever played and met everyone I met. without her, I never would have found groups. without her, I would have never learned alot about life and love. without her, i would have failed miserably somewhere along the road.<br>
<br>
As far as guilds go, I want to thank the Moonwolf Clan, past and present members; The Noble Ones; Brains and Brawn (there was one before this one that I cannot remember); Protectors of Kindred Souls; last but certainly NOT least, Ancient Saga. IMO, Ancient Saga is bar-none the best guild on the server.<br>
<br>
The top 3 guilds, IMO, are AS, PoKS, and BnB. I had great, great times in all 3, and will always remember them and will try to remember everyone in them.<br>
<br>
To close, I know alot of you view me as a good person, and I know alot of you view me as a bad person. That's life. If I couldn't take the good with the bad, what kind of person would I be? How would I live?<br>
<br>
I just want you all to know, that no matter where you end up in life, I truly hope it's where you want to be. If it's with the woman of your dreams in a cardboard box, as long as you don't mind, that's all that matters. If it's alone and you're in one of the biggest houses on the planet, that's what you want, you should have it.<br>
<br>
I spent alot of time talking to really good people that I will never meet. Thank you Morell-Thule, for alot of cherished memories, but I gotta skip along and catch up with what I consider life. If you're ever in Memphis and want someone to have a beer with, most everyone who knows me here would say I'm the best candidate for that job, and I'll keep maxximuus@earthlink.net for that purpose.<br>
<br>
Also, if ya wanna email me and tell me about you, your significant other, the kids or the Jones', do that too. I'd love to hear from you. If you want to email me and insult the hell out of me, that's fine too. May not want to hear from you so much, but all is one.<br>
<br>
Thanks alot guys, whole heartedly, thank you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  &lt;---mixed emotions, eh? <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ancientsaga.com/index.php" target="top">Ancient Saga</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Maxximuus Ludicruus - 60 Wizard<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto:Maxximuus@earthlink.net"> Maxximuus@earthlink.net</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chongdamonk>Chongdamonk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#628CBC>(5/1/03 7:41:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1525.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Take this however ya want</span><hr size=1> Take care Maxx..most of us saw this coming, for sure.<br>

This game brought us a lot of enjoyment over the years, but like most things there's also a downside and in some respects this game wasn't always the best thing to spend all of our energy on.<br>
<br>
I had so much fun playing along side you, I probably would have given it up long ago but we always seemed to have so much fun playing together and had the good fortune to meet some really great people along the way.<br>
<br>
You were always true to yourself on this game and in your real life, I wish you all the best in your future no matter where life may take you and whether you realize it or not, you touched many people and made many of our days just a little brighter.<br>
