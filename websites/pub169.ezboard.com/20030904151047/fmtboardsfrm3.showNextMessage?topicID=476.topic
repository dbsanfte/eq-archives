I ran a guild raid on Fear today that was reserved two weeks prior.  Seeing as how noone else had reserved it the previous night it looked like it might be a promising raid......boy was I let down. <br>
<br>
Upon zoning in there was almost nothing in the entire zone, there were about two dozen mobs in the entire plane give or take a few.  Now I will say that I was contacted before starting by a MLF member who advised me when we were setting up that they had been in there earlier in the day to kill an epic mob and that they killed 5 trash mobs......so I expected there'd be a little bit of clearage inside and we'd just have to deal with it and there'd still be plenty of other &quot;trash mobs&quot; to kill in hopes of getting some class armore to drop left for us.<br>
<br>
  , it may have been cleared prior to their entry&gt;<br>
<br>
   Anyways we decided to press forward in hopes the zone would respawn.  We hung around for about 4 or so hours inside, inwhich time maybe another 2 dozen or so mobs spawned which we quickly dispatched.  But with 8 full groups of almost all 50+ players it seemed like a total bust and figured we should call it rather  than sit there picking off mobs as they spawned which is a waste of resources for a force that size.<br>
<br>
Anyways my question and gripe is, is it just standard procedure to ignore the community guidelines on respecting reservations.  Two weeks in a row I've gone to a fear raid where theres been significant clearing of the zone prior to a raid starting.  While I'm not sure who the people responsible for clearing Fear prior to our entry were, someone had to have done it well with in the respawn time limit.<br>
<br>
  I know the calendar rules aren't made by SoE, but are made  MT community so there isn't anyone to uphold them but ourselves.  Its seems like we could all at least make half an effort not to clear the zone within 12 hours of a scheduled raid.  Theres plenty of other time during the week when noone has it reserved and plenty other places to raid. <br>
<br>
 As for raiding the epic drops i know theres lots of players with rangers camped out in there that will mobilize to kill an epic pop irregardless of any rules and theres not jack we can do to stop anyone from doing that but for the love of what ever god you worship don't clear the whole zone. Fear was for all intents and purposes, empty tonight when we began.  Though it was the easiest break in ever lol, it was seriously dissappointing and I feel like I let my guild and all other who showed up for it down.  I was hoping for an actual challenge with some chance of reward for the guild and some friends from a few other guilds instead we got a bug hunt. Yay!<br>

Yeah, I just want it known to whoever ganked it before-hand, that SUCKED! I was expecting a challenge and instead I am sure a lot people felt like they wasted their time in Fear.<br>
But I know we had being there as a guild with a turnout for us.<br>

Uber loot and THAT is why your plane is cleared, several higher-end guilds will violate calendar to kill either Cazic or Tunare because these 2 gods require the clearing of the plane and in the end you wake up to a freshly empty plane. Next time you want to have a PoF excursion, keep an eye on it and make sure a mass of 40 to 60 people are not rushing in.<br>

now that's amusing!  perhaps they realize its a video game and are able to distinguish between what would matter and what wouldn't in this form of &quot;disrespect&quot; shown to others.  at the same time, i live in the &quot;real world&quot; and perhaps you just need to be more assertive to further yourself in the real world.  no one ever gets anywhere being a shy compliant little person.  /shrug.<br>

It was great for protecting them, but now it doesnt matter because they are done with them.  They shouldnt have to wait to go back and grab something. <br>
<br>
Most often in threads where people are saying screw the reservation system and ask why we need it for those zones, the people making those statements are in the uber guilds that have been &quot;done&quot; with those zones. <br>
<br>
See, its about them only.  Call it self centered egotism.  They believe they control the universe or something, which is quite amusing, because, as many of them like to say back at others they burn, its only a game. <br>
<br>
I can live with their choices and surely they can.  Its their actions.  While those of us who respect the calendar can feel better about ourselves, those who dont can wonder why they fail in RL. <br>

<br>
Most often in threads where people are saying screw the reservation system and ask why we need it for those zones, the people making those statements are in the uber guilds that have been &quot;done&quot; with those zones.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You do realize that the planes aren't exactly the same as they use to be.  When the reservation was started, you HAD to raid to fight there, and there were no other substitutes for raiding.  The only other raids were VS and Trak, but they only took an hour or so.  Now, they can be soloed, and there are a lot of alternatives.  In fact, if your guild is doing PoFear/Hate/Growth, you're pretty much wasting your guild's time.  Anyone can group up to level 65, and a guild of 60-65's can just start at Skyshrine and Kael armor level raids.  There's no need to go to the old planes for raids anymore.  You can solo/group most if not all epic items, and like I said, much better gear elsewhere.  Not only that, but West Wing and HoTesting are always up!  The only mobs raid worthy in those zones are considered seperate from the schedule anyways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goreanmt>GoreanMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#628CBC>(1/26/03 8:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=571.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Reservations and repops</span><hr size=1> I dont see how nothing could have been up for your Raid Lupin, I contacted u and told you that we killed about 5 or so mobs past the 10am CST timeframe that i wanted to be out by. I belive fear is on 8hr repops? It was not a MLF raid it was a open raid for Frizz's epic, I took 21 people in and we clear from west all north, Cleared  the two houses, and then cleared the grave yard infront of the ring of fire, then things got wacked pulling shissar out of the temple but we ended up getting the bird =) If repops are not 8hrs then it is my fault nothing is up on yer raid, But I check the calender and also informed you it was me who was in there. I had thought sense i did not hear anything back, everything was fine. Mabey someone went in after we left. But I know we only killed about 5 mobs at west wall after 10am CST. we where doing the battle rezes killing shissar.<br>
<br>
10am cst = 11am est your raid was at 7pm est thats 8 hours.<br>
<br>
I thought that i had followed the below<br>
<br>
Boss mobs in PoF/PoH: making a reservation does NOT automatically entitle you to boss mobs. The only restriction to taking out boss mobs before a scheduled raid is you must allow sufficient time after your boss mob kill for a full respawn of the plane before the scheduled start time of the next raid. <br>
<br>
And i thought 8 hours was repop time. If it is not someone let me know please.<br>
