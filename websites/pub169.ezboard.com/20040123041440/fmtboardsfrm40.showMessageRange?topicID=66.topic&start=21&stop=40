Second, the wipe wasnt because of me i never casted a spell and after u guys died i didnt have agro.<br>
<br>
The reason i was there was that i  was a little drunk and bored and wanted to see MM die, so i followed Triune. i was invised, all the mobs except the MM room dont see invis. so i was waitin outside the room and they were spammin me to move off a respawn of a mob that doesnt see invis, so i moved to where they were. In the corner they were rebuffing and than i cast a fd and than stood up and reinvised.. they killed the mobs around MM and before MM was pull Dubb said to get out of the corner, i moved out and MM was put in corner..there was 2 adds and ppl started to die. i stood out of the way and went back into the hall way invised. everyone died and than i got spamed with tells sayin i wiped the raid. while ppl were spammin me i aggroed 1 see invis mob cause i was too close to room i than had to fd( everyone was dead or they were usin SoS) so i didnt kill anyone. I than zoned out since there was nothin else to watch.<br>
<br>
Once again im sorry u guys wiped but blamin me for it and sayin i whiped u guys on purpose is bs. This is the honest truth.<br>

Thank you for your faith in our abilities, that you had confidence he would die. However from tonite on the only mobs you will see die on a raid will be Emporer Crush with Wolves of the Wind. If they let you along.<br>

Aye unfortunately your invis doesn't block your teenage trash talking mouth- especially the derogatory comments made to Kogbender and Thamgara, two of our SK's.

What part of YOU ARE NOT PART OF OUR RAID did you not understand? I don't care if you moved to West Commons, YOU WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. Too bad you didn't know about the Guide watching in zone who finally arrived in response to the petitions. But you're smart aren't you. Stayed invis, stayed within the main cluster of the raid, good little SK just wanna see a big bad monster die, hee hee. Me is not doing anything bad, no sir. <br>

Liar. You were showing up in /who in HoHB for some time after the wipe. Next thing we know you are in Tranq. You did not zone out. Gate potion or OT hammer I would think , unless SK's suddenly got Gate.<br>
<br>
And you're wrong, there was plenty more to watch. Would have given you jerkoff material for days. Corpses warping on rez causing death on rez. People trying to train the GY mobs away from the rest of the raid so we had some chance of a breakin team. People trapped and zoning out to HoH only to get chewed alive by the repops there. Rezzing teams in BOTH HoHB and HoH GY. Was a ton of stuff to watch, Gigster, woulda given you an erection better than anything like what you got when you f*cked with people before. This was the ultimate for you wasn't it? The BIG money shot. <br>

I stayed FD'd for like 5mins to make sure i wouldnt train anyone. I stood up and gated out.<br>
<br>
As you can see from the quotes, MM was pulled somehow with 2 adds when triune wasnt rdy. The tank tried to get MM in the corner but ppl were dyin from the adds.<br>
<br>
There was a bad pull, i was there in the middle of the raid, so they blame the wipe on me. I shouldnt have been there but like all guilds u wipe sometimes suck it up and do it again. <br>
<br>
I respect the skills of Triune and just wanted to see them in action. I wish the best of luck in further raids and I wont bother  u guys again.<br>

&quot;The honest truth&quot; eh Giggit? Funny, that's the exact same wording you used when you denied ganking Lord friggin Begurgle from a Triune app cleric months ago in this same forum, remember?

The &quot;honest truth&quot; is you are one pathetic human being.  Even if your account doesn't get banned, you think it's going to matter? You're server trash. Enjoy sitting out on the curb, stinking terribly, for the rest of your toon's pathetic existence.<br>
