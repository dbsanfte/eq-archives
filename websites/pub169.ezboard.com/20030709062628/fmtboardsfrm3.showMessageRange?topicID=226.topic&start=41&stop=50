I camoed you when we were on the move to find another of his 3 corpses, heh. You were certainly not casting. Yes I WAS fighting another mob at the time, for a good reason. We had a necro pally 2 druids warrior. Warrior had rezz effects, necro and pally were out for corpse. That left THREE I figured that I could take one around as there was no way for you with your gimp self+me to keep up enough heals for a warrior for the length of time needed. Besides the fact that I was around 50m at the time and I know you weren't that high either, after casting several foliage shields, SoE's, and getting here. Do you think getting one away, snare root, Dot Dot run back dot dot and start healing is bad? If so you are more gimp than I thought.<br>
<br>
For another thing, I did make a few lame jokes at the time, but you were the one that started everything. I'll take a bet that I am younger than you, but that's inconsequential. I'll also take the bet that I am 1. smarter than you 2. More mature than you 3. More honest than you 4. harder-working than you 5. More helpful than you etc, not going to waste my time. However, I will say this, she came within 10 percent of dying BUT by that time my heal was about to land, I think stacking 3 DoT's AND a heal is more helpful than what you were doing? Besides that, when I said that I was letting her go berserk you said that it was stupid, that I was a stupid druid, and should go die NO I am not using your exact wording, and you know it. I don't go around memorizing words fools use. If you want to be picky on spelling and exact words, here are a few words in your reply.<br>
&quot;Beserk&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;thats&quot; &quot;withing&quot;<br>
<br>
You were whupped in that last thread, why try again? I dropped the subject because I didn't see the need, but if you pull up the thread again (Can't remember whether it was on old forum or new) you can easily tell who won. Care to do it Daark? Or you &quot;Don't want to take the time for a fool&quot; your customary quote? <br>
