<br>
What could have been done different that would have caused less loss of life to Iraqi civilians, including children?  Do you honestly believe those children all locked away in that prison had a reasonable chance of surviving to ever get out?  How many children were locked up compared to the number who lost their lives or become wounded due to the battle?  I have only seen the same 8-10 children in all the press footage around the world.  I saw over 50 children pour out of that prison (and thats only one prison). <br>
<br>
What about the kids who were locked in that 4th unit of that other prison, the one where people who didnt pay got stuck in the 4th unit and all were guaranteed to pretty much wind up dead?  There were thirteen and fourteen year olds in that one. <br>
<br>
I sure hope none of you are for partial birth abortion, because thats killing children for absolutely no good.  They are fully functional children.  Now thats a real crime. Hate for you all to be real hypocrites on that.  <br>
<br>
So back to the question: <br>
What could have been done different to cause less loss of life by Iraqi's and to make the middle east a more peaceful region? <br>
<br>
You know, Vellks brought up Israel/Palestine issues (of which I have said since this whole thing started threads ago I feel needs to be dealt with..funny how Velks missed that).  So, question there: <br>
How would Saddam still being around and paying 25k to each and every Palestinian suicide bomber help make getting peace there easier?  <br>
<br>
Also, on that issue, some of you may have forgotten:<br>
1) Before Sept 11th, Palestine/Israel was a priority for Bush. We were very close to having Palestine regain its lands.  <br>
2) Sept 11th happened and Bush had to deal with Afghanistan and then follow up on Iraq (which had been a campaign promise pretty much from before this all happened. It didnt just come up.)  Sharon received harsh words during this time at first from Bush, but then as Bush needed political capital to carry out Afghanistan and Iraq, it had to go to the back burner for a minute. <br>
3) Now that Afgh and Iraq major parts are done, Bush is once again returning his focus to Israel and Palestine.  <br>
4) Whats being going on in Israel/Palestine during this time will not continue on much longer now that Sharon cant hide behind our other conflicts easily anymore. <br>
5) Sharon was an opportunist and he is still trying, unfortunately, he is just pissing of the US even more by assuming that Bush will just go along like many presidents before<br>
6) Sharon needs to realize that Republicans have been less his friends then Democrats and start watching himself -- Republicans arent as dependent on the Jewish political money and capital as the Democrats (no harm to Bush) so Sharon could end up alienating his two key allies in the world (Britain and US), both of which want him to stop this @#%$ now. <br>

See, he knows Bush and Blair have an eye on him.  He may actually be showing some common sense. <br>
<br>
I am sure there were some phone calls from Bush and Blair over the days before it. <br>
<br>
But still notice, he is walking the line, because after that he then stated a &quot;possibility&quot; of escalating action against Damascus to try and push the Syria button (he knows if he can cause more problems for us in the Middle East, he will no longer be the focus of attention).  He knows the talking heads came out about Syria.  He knows its not a military agenda for us, but if he can push the belief it is then problems could escalate for the US as we looked more sympathetic to Israel then we are.  He is playing the propaganda battle to.  <br>
<br>
This will be Bush's real test.  Iraq and Afghanistan were tests but nothing compared to this.  However, if Bush doesnt get reelected, I hold little hope of a Democrat president actually following up on the problem.  <br>
<br>
Bush, Sr had the same goal but didnt have time to follow up on it. The Clinton administration dropped the ball that had started rolling, quietly I might add. <br>

The stock market is not the economy.  <br>
<br>
We have been growing faster then a lot of economies out there.  People got jaded by the phenomenal growth in the late 90's due to overzealous spending by corporate america and people going on a credit buying frenzy.  Its called greed.  But as cycles must do, what goes up must also come down a bit.  Go figure that the largest growth in market cap we have ever seen would be followed by an equally bad down cycle.  Good old Newton had it right.  <br>

At least not for the forseeable decade.  <br>
<br>
Rather, I think the foundation for more stable societies could foster the sort of relations between the regional partners.  Once stability and security are established, then the regional economy can begin to flourish.  Markets do not survive in chaotic environments.  <br>
<br>
And, Virest, to directly answer your question - leaving Saddam in power would not have kept peace in the region, in my opinion.  The Iraqi people would have continued to suffer horrendously, U.N. sanctions would have continued to keep the Iraqi economy under a yoke, and Saddam would have eventually handed over power to his two sons, both of whom are monsters by all accounts.  <br>
<br>
Finally, I don't think anyone here in this thread sanctions the killing of children.  There isn't a single pilot, soldier, or sailor who ever wanted to shoot or bomb a family or bystander.  The tragedy of a stray bomb or missile cannot be overstated.  In a perfect world, there would be no collateral damage, much less war.  <br>
<br>
Those who would compare the U.S. forces to the regime forces of Saddam are irresponsible.  The U.S. and Britain has spent untold money and tremendous effort to avoid death of innocents in combat scenarios.  Saddam's regime has jailed, tortured, and killed children.  See the difference? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mojohurricane.com/images/eqstuff/profiles/pafsmile3.jpg"
