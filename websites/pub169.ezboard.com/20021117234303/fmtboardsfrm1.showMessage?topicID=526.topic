Just thought it was a good opinion.<br>
<br>
First of all I have a 50+ Cleric, Magician and Monk.  I just wanted to get the credentials out of the way first. <br>
<br>
1: Clerics. <br>
Yes, Clerics DO spend a lot of PP's on Peridots. However if *YOU* don't tell your group that, its *YOUR* fault. Assuming your group knows of your costs of symboling without knowing for certain is preparing to make an ass of yourself. If they won't accomodate your costs use Pinzarn's and leave it at that. The important thing is that *YOU* make sure they understand the options without making the decision for them. To cast symbol on your group EXPECTING to be compensated without requesting it/giving them the option to NOT get symbolled is self-centered. Just like wanting to roll on an item that you are not going to USE. <br>
<br>
2: Int casters/Druids/Shaman. <br>
Yes, there is more melee gear than caster gear. Because THEY NEED IT! They don't have a book which they can open up and just choose their weapons for the day. <br>
<br>
Hmm... I died. I'll just open my book up and pick up this sword and this mace and head back to my body. <br>
<br>
-OR- <br>
<br>
Alright! I made Level 56! I get a great new Area of Effect Halberd! Plus a new Set of Armor! <br>
<br>
They NEED their gear like we (Just for clarification my Mage is my primary) NEED our spells. <br>
<br>
----- <br>
<br>
Stop looking at *YOUR* immediate needs and look at a broader picture. <br>
<br>
You see, I prefer to call it Usability Before Profitability. Its a simply philosophy of treating all drops as if they were No Drops. If I can't use it, I'll pass on it. I don't treat it as vendorite until *EVERYONE* who participated in killing the mob that dropped it passes on it, be it group or raid. <br>
<br>
Why? Because when someone who can USE the drop gets it they become more effective in doing their duty in that group or raid and every subsequent group or raid. And it usually tends to be immediately effective as opposed to just sitting in the bottom of a bag waiting for a trip to the Bazaar. <br>
<br>
Placing a PP value on an item before any other consideration is greedy. That's the nature of Greed. Greed=&quot;How much can I make from this&quot;. Demanding an opportunity to cash in on something someone else can make better, more efficient, immediate, and/or longer lasting USE of it is greedy. &quot;I don't care what someone else can do with this, because I can make some money/trade this for something I can use&quot; is Greedy. It is Self-Centered and its unjustifiable. <br>
<br>
Saying that *YOU* spend a lot of peridots makes *YOUR* need more important than anyone else's is self-centered. If you didn't Symbol/Rune/Etc, your job as the groups life preserver becomes more difficult so *YOU* benefit from the peridot usage too, not just the people you Symbol/Rune/Etc. It makes your CH more efficient, it makes your MT/MA survive longer so that the mobs don't come running after you over their corpse. Stop focusing on *YOUR* desires, *YOUR* needs, and *YOUR* greed. If you do your part right, the raid/group works smoother, easier and has a better chance of coming out on top, which is the whole point of grouping/raiding in the first place. <br>
<br>
And where would the Int-caster/Druid/Shaman be without the MT/MA to center the aggro, take the damage and pray they don't have a sleepy healer behind them. Where would your haste spell go? What would keep the mob from killing in a heartbeat after Ice Comet/Splurt? When Snare and Root break? <br>
<br>
And if you're a tank reading this and going 'Right on!&quot; don't ask to roll on the spell drops, or the int/FT drops. The same applies to you. <br>
<br>
In closing, when you are in a group, everyone's needs are equal. If you are spending money, symboling, runing, etc make sure the group knows. Don't decide for them. If something drops that someone says they can use, let them, even if they just want to take it to sell in the Bazaar. That's their bad decision, not yours nor does it give you the right to do the same to others. A group is formed for the same reason all the time. Because it accomplishes something a single person could not. Stop focusing on the single person (YOURSELF) and start focusing on the group.<br>
 <br>
Better to be silent and thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt. <br>

I never take items I won't immediately equip, on the spot. I never sell my old gear, I always give it away. I never buy gear (That goes along with never taking money). And I'd never expect anybody else to be like me.<br>
<br>
But I do think that it is important to lead by example, so I will continue to be the way I am, in hopes that, eventually, people will follow suit. <p><center>Argond Valiantfist<br>Grandmaster Geezer of Morell-Thule<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133460>Magelo Profile</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=526.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=526.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=526.topic&index=1><img src=http://sevendragons.net/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=526.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.threadControl?topicID=526.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=526.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=526.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1>General</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
