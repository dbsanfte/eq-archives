<br>
And for those too lazy to go read the drama queen in action, here is the original post:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Greetings friends;<br>
<br>
I had thought that this issue would have been allowed to drop with my quiet departure from the guild. However, apparently people just can't leave well enough alone and so I'm posting here to clear the fog of war.<br>
<br>
If this post is deleted, altered or moved in anyway, you will see it next on the MT board.<br>
<br>
I left Faveo because recently it's been sliding. The alliance is trying to accomplish things and Faveo IMO is not holding up to it's end of the obligations<br>
<br>
eg. hearing folks in guild cheer about their successful hunt while we have just wiped on Vox, due in part to a lack of support from the post 51 crowd to clear the giants and the bears from her lair was enough to send me off server.<br>
<br>
So, I took a break, and quietly moved to Stromm.. and would have been quite happy there but, Cheriqui won't leave MT. So, I agreed to come back. <br>
<br>
Now.. the &quot;conflict of interest&quot;.... things are not going well in this alliance, and most of you know that.. and those that don't are either ignoring the problems or lying. I decided to remove myself because I see Cheriqui working to try and communicate with the guild leaders about these problems.. but I see my own guild leader doing nothing. You can sight any reason you like Nynnia, but if you're the GL then do your damn job, or step down. Me feeling like, this is not the way an officer should feel about the leader of the guild. So, I disbanded.<br>
<br>
In my officer post, I explained I would not be taking the HOD tag, specifically because these problems still need to be addressed.. and they have not. <br>
<br>
The final point was the change to the officer rules that did not allow us to have characters in another guild. Complete BS, since we're not a &quot;raiding guild&quot; what right do you think you have to dictate anything to me or any officer? I put 3 times the amount of time into this game as you do, and I still maintain characters in 4 different guilds. 2 of which aren't even allied to us.<br>
<br>
That is why I am no longer in Faveo.<br>
<br>
Now, the the specifics.. Nynnia, get your head out of your ass.. you're 1 part of 6 people speaking for this alliance and I finally got sick of you talking as if you run the show. Changing established loot rules on the fly because you want to. Claiming to be a raid leader for a raid hosted by another guild.. Where the hell do you get off with any of that? Further, 2 weeks ago before I left faveo you said you had to talk to me because of &quot;issues&quot; but then you completely fail to follow up. Where is the leadership in that.<br>
<br>
There has been a general call for a guild leaders meeting for weeks.. now, you seem to have all the time in the world to log in and hunt, or to help others.. well how about doing your job as a guild leader. And, I know you're going to whine about how all you do is lead this guild.. well, guess what.. that's what your supposed to do. Nobody else gets to speak for you because you won't let anyone else get in a word edge wise. You wanted a raid leader.. I offered to commit, the Order and HOD have no problem asking me to lead raids, and I will continue to do so as long as I play and they ask for my assistance. You though have to have your hands in the pie for everything.. OMFG, this is a game.. you spend so much time micro managing the guild and trying to rail road the alliance.. it's no wonder that you've recently been allowing complete and utter morons into the guild. I took care of 2 this past week for you.. Where did you find Canto, Moron'sRus??<br>
<br>
Oh, and saying you'll disolve the alliance if I take the HOD tag.. get a life!<br>
<br>
First, I never said I would, in fact, I said I wasn't.. and that was because I knew folks would ask.. <br>
<br>
Second, exactly who the hell do you think you are?? Disolve the alliance.. it would really suck for Faveo if you try that crap and both HOD and the Order leave you out in the wind, cause by yourselves, you're not even capable of doing a fear raid.<br>
<br>
And third, when this falls out, and believe me.. it will fall out.. Nynnia I'm sure you're going to try and show how none of this is your fault and we're all out to ruin you or to &quot;take over&quot; Well.. that is the furthest thing from the truth. I left quietly, didn't throw any stones and cited RL reasons to give everyone a nice easy out.. YOU decided to take it this far, and quite frankly I'm not surprised. So, when this is done, the few left standing around wondering what the hell just happened can look to you for an answer, because it's all about you baby...<br>
<br>
In closing, this is a rant, this is a flame and this is the last straw.. <br>
<br>
If this alliance folds Nynnia, it's your doing. I'm not going anywhere, so you can suck it up or get lost. The choice is yours.. I tried to do this without making anyone out to be the bad guy.. but since you can't let it go.. then I'm taking it to this level; and I'll go to the next level if you want to play that game.<br>
<br>
May the moonlight shine gently upon you;<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. All future talks will take place on public boards, so that a proper and open record of what's said is kept.. no emails, no phone calls.. I didn't bring this to the boards and start slinging stupidity.. you did. <br>

One of the few EQers who I'd trust with every plat I have. It's a shame she's moved from Faveo, but I'm sure she did it for sensible reasons and after doing whatever she could to correct the situation and make things better.<br>

<br>
Contrary to what Noreya has posted (Original post and replys on our boards) we are not a bunch of knuckle dragging, slack jawed mindless followers. <br>
<br>
To me Noreya's entire tirade reeks of someone who is thirsty for melodrama. <br>
<br>
Let me give you all the perspective of Faveo's Second in command. (Me)<br>
<br>
Nynnia and I do not always see eye to eye. Sometimes it seems we are not even reading from the same book. Both Nynnia and I are passionate people and that makes for interesting discussions sometimes. Sometimes we disagree with vehemence. Sometimes she makes decisions or handles situations in ways that I would not. <br>
<br>
Noreya has had concerns recently that she has addressed to me. Many times I was seeing what she was seeing. I agreed in many ways. However, when she spoke to me of her concerns she was respectful towards Nynnia. That was as it should have been. <br>
<br>
When she made this post, however, all of a sudden facts were twisted to suit some sense of outrage that I simply do not understand. <br>
<br>
It made me think. <br>
<br>
I spoke with a dear friend and guildie last night who gave me another perspective. Something that I had not been seeing in my frustration with the game. (On a side note...RL is pretty ugly where Nish lives so I have little tolerance for what I view as BS leaking into my game and that has limited my perspective even more in recent weeks.) In speaking with him, I remembered some very important things. This is Nynnia's guild. Nynnia will run it as she see's fit. Nynnia does not make decisions lightly and she bends over backwards to do what she thinks is best for her guild. <br>
<br>
Faveo has been around for two years, we've grown, we're in a state of transition as our core members are leveling into their upper 50's and lower 60's. We've accomplished some great things together both within the alliance and on our own. We are a family, we share laughter, joy, heartache and sometimes even tears. The Edgers go to the mat for each other, so for all Nynnia's imperfections in my humble opinion she has put together the finest group of people on the server. <br>
<br>
She is a damn fine guild leader. <br>
<br>
Any of you that have lead a guild for any length of time, know that it is a job. I do not envy any of you the stress and time it takes to fullfill your committment. All of you have my respect for what you take on and what you accomplish.<br>
<br>
I am not going to take Noreya's post appart paragraph because it serves little purpose. People will believe what they want to believe regardless of any fact or opinion presented to them. <br>
<br>
I will, however, tell you exactly why I no longer have a shred of respect for a very knowledgable player. <br>
<br>
Any point you might have had Noreya was lost in the rabid tenor of your original post...not to mention most non officers were left wanting to know what the hell happened. See that is how I spent my might last night...answering tells from baffled guildies. You brought posts from non public forums into a public forum. Why would you do that? To prove Nynnia is a bad guild leader? To show how victimized you have been? <br>
<br>
In your reply's you further insinuated Nynnia to be a liar and outright accused her of re-writing, deleting or changing posts written by others to suilt her own agenda. The only liar here is you. <br>
<br>
Next you ridiculed and demeaned anyone who posted in support of Nynnia and their guild and directly challenged your claims with actual facts and proof. It seems the world according to Noreya is a bit skewed. <br>
<br>
Up until yesterday when you spewed the blackness in your soul all over our boards, I respected you. I respected your position and your opinions while I was trying to figure out my own. <br>
<br>
Today, well I feel like I have been played. I am not only ashamed of you, but also of my self for not looking at the issues with a more objective eye. <br>
<br>
Most of all, my mind is boggling as to why you felt the need to escalate a matter that was confined to the leadership of the guild and the alliance in such a public and ugly way. <br>
<br>
You said yourself you wanted an arguement. Well you got one, but not from me. This will be the last statement I direct at you. &quot;Welcome to perma ignore.&quot;<br>
<br>
To the server in general. <br>
<br>
I love my guild. I can't help responding when someone attacks my guild mates. I usually respond with vehemence. <br>
<br>
I love my guild leader. I don't always agree with her, but she has earned my respect. I am dissappointed in my self that I haven't been better at showing it in recent weeks. We are flawed people doing our best. I guess when it comes right down to it that is all I can ask. <br>
<br>
I love my friends. No one, NO ONE is allowed to degrade them in public without being called to answer for it. I will stand by them. <br>
<br>
The Edgers are not a 24 hour love fest. We are made up of diverse personalities and again sometimes that makes for interesting conversations in guild chat. <br>
<br>
I have my home. I'll not be looking for another anytime soon. <br>
