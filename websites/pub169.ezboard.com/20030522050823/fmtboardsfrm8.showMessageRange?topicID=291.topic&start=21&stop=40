Since you didn't quite seem to grasp that meaning, let me try it a different way.  I am not referring to the fact that you did not know about the rule change, I am referring to the fact that you already knew you had been told you posted in the wrong place ~ ie I'm refering your original post and my comment that it was the wrong forum (which you have mentioned you read).<br>
<br>
Most folks, when told they posted in the wrong spot (which it was at the time) and try to post right, but it won't work, would go back to the original source and say &quot;look, I tried it but it doesn't work&quot;.  But you didn't do that.<br>

 What is this??? I had placed on the calandar that I was going to have Naggy this day, then someone tells me that I reserved it a little to far in advance, and when I come back to try to reserve it again, the calandars are down, So why are you scheduling the Naggy raid the day you KNEW that I was scheduling it??????<br>

Please remember that no one gets paid for maintaining anything.  It's all volunteer.  Do you really think someone clicks every link on this site every second to see if it's working?  How about every hour?  Of course not.  If someone notices something isn't working right, they'd normally tell someone so it can get fixed.  Folks aren't onipotent.  I'm sure others tried the calendar besides yourself so this point goes to all of those who didn't report it as well.<br>
<br>
But, even your original post is a day and a half after the initial official and valid post was created and it screams of &quot;it's mine&quot; you can't have it.  I'm not sure if you kept trying the calendar after midnight or what, but from the actions it seems like not.<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
Look at the titles of some of the posts.  Even mine on the 27th states in the title itself &quot;since the calendar is down...&quot; You don't have to read the threads themselves to have seen that much.  <br>
<br>
~~~<br>
You keep saying over and over that you had a reservation.  No - you did not.  You wanted a reservation but you actually never had a reservation.  So please quit hiding behind that excuse cause it isnt' holding water.<br>
<br>
You do have a legitimate complaint about the rule change not being posted here, and I've never denied that.  However, ignorance is not always a legitimate excuse and in this instance where, had you mentioned in a post that the calendar was down when you tried to follow the rules for your post, you would have had your post and reservation.  Communication wasn't there on both the admin's side and yours. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nerakug>NerakUG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/1/03 10:36:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 April 2003,  Utopian Guard.

Now,  What is your ultimate gain by arguing with me in all of your posts?<br>

I posted a very good solution,  and it appears to have been turned down.  I will quote my solution here as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We can argue back and forth for ever. However. i am willing to compramise. You are wanting the Warrior Piece.

Now.  Since you yourself stated that you have NOTHING to do with the boards or calandar anyway.  Why don't you just stop coming up with new and different arguments to the initial problem and actually allow Thoradar give his opinion?<br>

I don't know his future plans for it, so until that's decided, these forums will act as the MT web site.<br>
<br>
We'll be without a calendar for a while, but we're looking in to getting another one up, so please try to respect each other.  I really don't think this will be a major problem, because the guilds capable of KSing the reservable mobs are, for the most part, way past that content, but I do ask that you continue to reserve mobs and zones using the Schedule forum. Just post a new thread with the time/zone/mob you're reserving. Date/time stamps on the threads can act as who-reserved-what-first.<br>
<br>
For me and (I imagine) most users of the MT site, what deluzion did is not much more than an inconvenience. Outside of the calendar, the site didn't really provide anything that these forums and eqlive.station.sony.com/ can't provide. It was just more organized and Thorador did a great job of keeping news current.<br>
<br>
I will be changing my email to fimblepiddlebitz@hotmail.com, so use that if you need to contact me. [/quote]<br>
<br>
This is the rule that I can see in the web site down post under the general forum.  I dont anywhere see anything about a 2 week rule.  I do however see the following.<br>
<br>
[quote]We'll be without a calendar for a while, but we're looking in to getting another one up, so please try to respect each other.[/quote]<br>
  <br>
I think it is this respect that should conclude that Nerak should indeed be given the pally book, since he was more than willing to make a compromise which the other person may yet still decide to do.<br>
<br>
[quote]Just post a new thread with the time/zone/mob you're reserving. Date/time stamps on the threads can act as who-reserved-what-first.[/quote]<br>
<br>
I don't see anything anywhere in this entire post about a 2 week rule.  So someone new to EQ, or these forums would have to go by this post, since no other rule here is posted.  I do see that it says Date/time stamps on threads can act as who-reserved-what-first.  In my opinion, I think it is more than fair to give the book to Nerak, should it drop.<br>
<br>
Please show respect to your fellow EQers in this matter.  I bet if you do, you will see some good Karma come back your way.  I hope that you do understand where he is coming from, and see that there is a rational and agreeable solution in sharing the mob and giving the book to Nerak<br>

<br>
By the way, it was Calalily who made both of your posts you just claimed I did.  She is a moderator for the new rants/hated board.<br>
<br>
But, I'm addressing your issues of misrepresenting your claim, which is a separate issue from your solution to the problem.<br>
<br>
Your solution is actually a reasonable one if it was your raid that was legitimate (and that's for Thorador to decide).  But, until he rules one way or the other, it goes with the one who made a post within the 2 week mark, which is &quot;the other guy&quot; so he gets to decide how to divvy out loot.<br>
<br>
I'm a firm believer in owning up to and admitting mistakes and learning from them.  I also believe in folks being held accountable for their actions.  Therefore, that is why I keep posting because on the previous posts you kept stating you had a claim when you did not.  Give me nothing to contest and I have no reason to post. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nerakug>NerakUG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/1/03 11:03:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 April 2003,  Utopian Guard.

Closed Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> That's the rub.  There was a full page (and part of a 2nd page) giving the information on posting but it was all on the website which has been taken down cause of the hacking.<br>
<br>
You can scan a few pages here because lots of it were cut/paste in other posts when there were issues.<br>
<br>
Hopefully there is a backup of that list somewhere that someone can type in, but in the interim it will need to work off of posts, memories, etc.<br>
<br>
Couple of the basics:<br>
<br>
(1)  You can't have a mob/zone back to back.  Only exception is PoA where a normal raid to clear the zone is 2-3 days.  <br>
1a)  So for specifics, Naggy/Vox you can't claim 2 weeks in a row as they are a week spawn and you need to allow one spawn break before reclaiming.<br>
1b)  For all other reservable mobs/zones, you can't claim two days in a row; you need to allow one day in between claims.<br>
<br>
(2)  You can't make a reservation more than 2 weeks in advance for it to be valid.<br>
<br>
(3)  Reservable mobs/zones include:  PoF, PoH, Naggy/Vox, Chardok Nobles, PoG and I'm blanking on if there is something else here.<br>

<br>
But it was said in several confilcts before that the reservation timer for a SUNDAY start at SUNDAY MORNING 2 weeks earlier.<br>
<br>
And that is correct, as no one could hold me up from reserving those mobs for the WHOLE Sunday i want them, instead of reserving them for the time the raid should start.<br>
<br>
So technical its 336 hours PLUS 1 day.<br>
<br>
And dont try to state that Nerak didnt know about the 2 weeks rule, he stated in his first reply that he would simply reserve Naggy again early morning at 30th if that helps.<br>
<br>
So for that he accepted the 2 weeks rule, but he simply didnt do what he mentioned to do.<br>

However,  The Calandar was down.  That was not my fault.  <br>

YOU Madsum KNEW that I was wanting to have Naggy on the 13th of April.  You also may be one of those people that have nothing better to do with your time that to read every little post that is ever posted on any board in the world. I Dont know,  but I do know that I do not have that kind of time.<br>
<br>
It my honest opinion,  You are trying to Gank this Naggy Raid.  I had made a very decent offer to you.  You had wanted the Warrior Piece,  You also wanted to have this as an Open Raid.  Which means that people you have no idea who they are would be attending.<br>
<br>
I was going to have this as a closed raid.  I offered to save for you the Warrior Piece,  And also offered to allow you to bring the people that you KNEW to the raid as well and they would be in on the roll for all the drops except for the book.<br>
<br>
But that did not appear good enough for you.  I really do not see what the problem with that is,  It cannot be the time of the raid,  mine and yours are so close together that it is a non issue.  I would even allowed your Raid Coordinator be a Co-Coordinator in the raid,  because it is very difficult for just one person to handle all aspects of a Dragon raid alone.<br>
<br>
It cannot be the items that you wanted,  So then what is the huge problem?<br>
<br>
I am interested in hearing your response to this matter?<br>

Closed Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> The problem here is, you were in the wrong when you originally scheduled so it is not up to you to make offers to allow him and his friends to join you.  It is up to him to make the rules of any &quot;deals&quot; if he so chooses, because he followed the rules and took the time to keep himself informed of what was going on, even if all he read was this forum alone.<br>
<br>
No it's not your fault the calendar is messed up, nor is it your fault the full message of the calendar being down was on another board.  But it is your fault for not seeing the posts on THIS board that stated the calendar was down (in the title part even) and not investigating.  It is your fault for not looking into the calendar being down when you discovered it, or even putting forth the question on these boards as to why to calendar was down.  And it is your fault for not reading the rules before scheduling a raid.  When you originally decided to make this raid...the calendar was up and the rules were available for you to read.  If you had followed them none of this would have happened.  When you know you need to do a thing as soon as possible, and discover you can't...you don't walk away assuming everything is okay.  You do what you can to get what you want done.   It is not up to others to do for you, it is up to you to do for yourself. <br>
<br>
A story:  A friend of mine wanted to raid in PoF (might have been PoH but that's not important) he scheduled it too early having not read the rule.  He was informed he scheduled it wrong, and before he could schedule again within the 2 week timeframe, someone else had it scheduled.  He didn't tell that person they were trying to &quot;gank&quot; because they &quot;knew&quot; he wanted that day.  He shrugged it off and rescheduled for another date.  Because he knew he made a mistake.  There are consequences you must expect when you don't follow the rules.  And one of the consequences is that someone else may get the date you wanted.  Do the adult thing, shrug it off and  reschedule properly.<br>

<br>
That is like posting a speed limit sign for the expressway,  on a back road. Then giving tickets to people for not following the newly posted speed limit. <br>
<br>
The fact of the matter remains.<br>
<br>
That I Had in deed posted that I wanted Naggy on the 13th of April.  <br>
<br>
That the Calandar went down,  and I had actually gone to the Calandar to make that other post but could not because it was down.<br>
<br>
That there was a Rule Change.  but it was NOT posted where it could be seen by those that it actually pertained to.<br>
<br>
AND,  That is seems very dishonourable in this attempt to Gank the Naggy raid that I had posted. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=madsum>MADSUM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/2/03 3:38:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 April 2003,  Utopian Guard.

<br>
Your schedule in this forum was out of the rules and doesnt need to respected (as lots of others before).<br>
<br>
It is possible that your schedule here only was an accident, but in the past too much people tried to get mobs by scheduling here or reserving on calendar before the 2 weeks and hoping no one sees it and there reservation holds.<br>
<br>
Give me something better then your words that you tried to reserve it at calendar at sunday the 30th March before 1:45am and i cancel my schedule.<br>
<br>
If you cannot do that, now then be in Lavastorm Sunday 13th 2pm EST or you miss your chance to see Naggy alive that day.<br>

<br>
I offered earlier that he can attend our OPEN-Raid under the rules posted in our schedule.<br>
<br>
We ONLY will claim ONE Item, and i dont know atm if its the Scale or the Book (in case both drop).<br>
<br>
If 2 Books drop, then for sure ONE will be claimed for the pallys in LaDA/CSM-Alliance which stay in 52 till months to attend those dragonkills and get one, and the other will be open to roll on.<br>
<br>
If we decide to claim a scale and also a book drops, then Nerak can roll on it as all attending pallies are allowed to.<br>
<br>
I dont know why people always only read half of the boards/replys or less, and try to read more in single replys then real posted.<br>
<br>
BTW, i dont know why Nerak is so fixed on THIS Naggy, we got 2 Books out of 4 or 5 kills that last months, and instead of concentrate on Naggy he easily could have reserved Vox for that weekend, as Vox seemed to be open till yesterday or so.<br>
<br>
And there for sure will be another chance to get a Naggy-reservation this Sunday-morning (where LaDA/CSM doenst run on it). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=madsum>MADSUM</A> at: 4/3/03 10:44:17 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nerakug>NerakUG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/3/03 12:06:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 April 2003,  Utopian Guard.

I have attempted to come up with a good compromise but you seem to not want to have anything to do with that.  And then,  you start claiming that you are going to reserve for yourself the item that I was calling the raid for.  This was after you proclaimed that you were after a completely different item.<br>
<br>
It appears that you have NO honour at all.<br>

Now,  I assume that CSM is Clan SilverMoon?<br>
<br>
and Asarnil is a lvl 52 Paladin from Clan Silvermoon?<br>

AND is there not a rule about the same Guild keeping a NPC TWO WEEKS IN A ROW?<br>

I am sure that I read that somewhere.<br>
