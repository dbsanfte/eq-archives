<br>
Whatever the details of the UN resolutions, the core of the matter had nothing to do with terrorism, humanitarian concerns, or democracy in Iraq.  We were there to stop a known aggressor from trying to build an empire, to protect the sovereignty of the surrounding nations.  And aside from a handful of Al-Samud missles of questionable legality, that Saddam started destroy as soon as the inspectors objected to them, you can't point at any weapon or military force in violation of those terms. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=estephe>Estephe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/10/03 5:29:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Saddam Statue</span><hr size=1> Let s see also some fair fact about pollution.<br>

Hmm 4.5 billion already through 2006, not a 2.4 billion total and $15 billion over the next ten years.  That number looks pretty much underway.  <br>

With the above info, we produce 33% of the pollution from the top 15 countries.  Producing 1/5th of the worlds goods takes industry which pollutes.  To get to levels you want we would have to shut down 20-30% of our industrial base and commit economic suicide.  Do you know our current policy for industry and gains we have made in pollution are all not that far removed from Kyoto Protocols as is?  You cant limit our industry by the extra 1-2.5% of emission you would get and expect it to make those numbers much different.  <br>
<br>
Still one step ahead of ya. <br>
Lets see 1/5th of the worlds goods produced but only 1/3 of the pollution produced by the top 15 polluters. Seems pretty on par with our producing the amount of the world goods we produce.  Additionally, Bush passed laws reducing 2 out of 3 of the necessary emissions allowed.  The enviornmentalists still get mad about not getting the 3rd one, but lets face it, policy takes compromise in our country. They got 2 out of 3 which is not bad by a longshot.<br>
<br>
EDIT 2 (see what the first one was below): Noticed I miskeyd on the calculator.  Ok, 33% of the pollution for the top 15 polluters (not all polluters in the world)<br>
<br>
EDIT: Mis-typed the 1/10th number as 1/15th while thinking of 15 countries.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viresttaelwaggler>Virest TaelWaggler</A> at: 4/10/03 5:52:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viresttaelwaggler>Virest TaelWaggler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 798<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/10/03 5:41:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.ucomics.com/images/ch/subsections/hobbes.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Saddam Statue</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>you can't point at any weapon or military force in violation of those terms.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Yallum, the rest of this debate we have had and I believe only time will tell.  If we dont find any credible evidence of WMD in Iraq, I will be the first to tell you Bush will not get my vote. Thats how we change those things here.  Right now I believe otherwise, and until we have time to get a real inspection force in there and not just the military, I dont think anything can be concluded. <br>
<br>
I believe Bush had very credible evidence, some he shared and some he didnt, that led him to his belief. One thing I will say.  I 100% believe Bush thinks they do.  We just have to wait and see now. <br>

Our soldiers have been finding stuff in their sweeps and securing of areas. <br>
They had a preliminary inspection force to check on stuff as it was uncovered and to help prevent any materials found from leaving Iraq.  They have also had intelligence watching for movement of materials out of Iraq.  Doing this carefully, while the world watches, is what will take time.  You must make sure no one can argue what you found. You must make the find valid and reliable. <br>
<br>
BTW, they found a complete stash of laboratory equipment that appeared to be smuggled in just yesterday.  It was buried right by a site the inspectors had checked twice without discovering. <br>
<br>
Also, we have yet to be all over the underground tunnels below Baghdad.  They havent been doing the tunnel hunts yet.  That will be very dangerous. <br>

I will be the FIRST one to tell you I am all for ecological reforms across the board.  They however must be fair.  If every country shuts down 20% of it's factories, the US would be shutting down far more then most other countries, thus harming it's economic impact on an international level.<br>
<br>
After living in Europe for over three years now, I can easily admit that Americans are pollution slobs.  I was back in the US back in January and just walking down a street or driving down a highway it was evident that the US needs a wake up call.  Germany is a freaking clean place to live.  Every Saturday you will see people sweeping their sidewalks and curb sides, doing yard work, picking up trash and litter.  And they are doing it happily.  Recycling is LAW in Germany.  Separate and bag differently.  It's not a matter of paying extra money if you don't...it's a pretty big fine if you don't.  The Kyoto Treaty is not the end all to ecological reform and betterment.  Individual states such as California and New York were working on a zero emmisions law.  Realizing that zero emmisions is near impossible, they are looking for other options.  So it's not like the US is saying &quot;f.uck you&quot; while farting into the ozone.  We're just not willing to put hundreds of thousands out of work and thousands of children under State care because we closed down their parent's places of work.  <br>
<br>
Do you want to hear my opinions on population control?  It will make you all cringe, American and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Me?  I am completely against oil as a fuel source.  If we spent just a little more money on the research and development of a technology to economically substatiate the use of a new fuel source, I would get a hardon.  Oil is currently the biggest filth factor in our air.  Plus if we can get rid of our (our as in US) dependance on oil and we maintain our &quot;involvement&quot; in the Middle East, people might actually realize that oil isn't our motivation for being there for all the reasons we are there (removing threats of terrorism and hostile regimes, protecting our allies (kuwait, saudi arabia - and i call them an ally with a spoonful of sugar to help me swallow that load of crap down).  <br>
<br>
The US government, however, is just one government and one economy.  The EU is many governments and many countries.  Besides trading with each other they trade with Asia, the Middle East, Russia, Australia, and the Americas.  It's safe to assume that the EU as a whole can match if not downright exceed any donation to any other country.<br>
<br>
Rebuilding Kuwait was a lot different then what it will be like to rebuild Iraq.  However it will still take a lot less time to rebuild Iraq then it will Afghanistan.  I'll bet that when all is said and done in Iraq, we will still be in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan has been war torn and under &quot;tribal anarchy&quot; for decades.  Technology is non-existant.  There is little to &quot;fix&quot;, most has to be rebuilt from the ground up...homes, schools, official government buildings, a military, a police force, hospitals, stores, factories, water and utilities.  These things already exist in Iraq.  Some may have been completely destroyed and some may have suffered damage, but they still exist.  The education level for the average Iraqi is far higher then that of the average Afghani.  Iraqis will be able to participate in their own reconstruction efforts.  Meanwhile we need to teach Afghanis so we can get them &quot;up to speed&quot;.<br>

I think I covered them all and as you can observe - I remained quite civil.  I do hope you can manage the same. <p>http://pub78.ezboard.com/bworldnewseventsdiscussion<br>

Industrial part of the energy consumption is about 25% (nearly same % than other OECD country) of the total consumption in USA, so you are just looking at a little part of the problem. I understand you don't want to damage your economy, but you pollute more than other OCDE country to be competitive. Considering GDP you can see that USA pollutes more than twice time than EU country. <br>
<br>
 And, may be you could work on the 75% left, but well it isn’t easy to change habits....<br>
<br>
 You think it is fair that 4% of the world population produce about 25% of the CO2 emission.<br>

When i said they got 48 millions people.<br>
<br>
And that is about 50$ per capita/<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>year</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> :<br>
<br>
Since september 2001, 2 Billions$ have been donate.<br>
Afghanistan population is about 25 Millions.<br>
So let s say 19 month.<br>
2B*12/(19*25M)#50$<br>

Make the sum and yes you are not the one who spend the most. EU country give more than you.<br>
There is no oil in afghanistan for sure, so when a country as no resource to finance reconstruction (btw iraq finance a substantial part of the kuweit reconstruction) you need other country to help you. At the moment in Iraq, the few first contract made were US only industrials, we will see how you wil deal with next one's.<br>

So add up a bunch of other countries on the list and you will beat the US? I believe I agreed the EU, added together beat the US, but not by much. Additionally, notice that date on your list? March 2001.  Last I checked, this is March 2003 and much more has been given by the USA and others since then.<br>
