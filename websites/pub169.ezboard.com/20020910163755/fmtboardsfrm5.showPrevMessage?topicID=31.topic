West Nile Virus, forest fires.  Talks of a baseball strike, KMart, Enron, Worldcom.  Freedom of Expression vs Separation of Church and State.  Reparations to African Americans for something that happened many generations ago.<br>
<br>
War in Afganistan, maybe war with Iraq.  MidEast Crisis.  Tense relations with China and North Korea.<br>
<br>
What is this our country coming to???????<br>
<br>
I brought a child into this world.  In 1998, my life was saved.  I grew up.  My eyes were opened.  July 2001 my marriage ended and I won custody of the little soul that saved my life!  Then September 11th hit.  My eyes were further opened when morons, claiming to be fighting a war in the name of their God, killed over 3000 innocent men, women, and children.  3000+ people that did them no wrong or injustice whatsoever (with a high degree of probability anyways).  Just because they were in a buildings considered to be symbollic.<br>
<br>
Then the above mentioned news stories.  I look at my son now, and I am afraid for him.  Do I become the paranoid, conspiracy theory nutjob that I rant and insult on here?  Can I trust ANYONE with his well being other then myself?????<br>
<br>
I started to think:  Maybe the country I dearly love and have willingly put my life on the line to protect really isn't worth it anymore.  Maybe the USA isnt worthy to be home to someone as precious and priceless as my son.<br>
<br>
Then I read stories about Tribal councils ordering the gang raping of a girl because her younger brother was seen with a girl from another tribe.  I read about an international child porn ring spanning from USA to England, France, Switzerland, and other countries.<br>
<br>
So I started thinking some more.  My old man (rest his soul) didn't teach me to run from problems.  My mother (rest her soul) didn't teach me to hate or distrust everyone.  Life didn't teach me that everything is safe and secure at all times.<br>
<br>
Faith in God gone, faith in America shaken....what could turn things around?  How could I get rid of the feeling that I did my son a huge injustice by bringing him into this world?<br>
<br>
Then today, he did SEVERAL things to set me back on the right track.  He saw a little girl crying at the daycare center because she didnt want her mom to leave her there.  He gave the little girl a hug and said &quot;It's ok.  Let's go play!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I picked him up after work where he ran to me at top speed, arms outstretched, cheerfully yelling &quot;DADDDDDDDDYYYYYYY&quot;.  He does this all the time, but today, it felt....different.  It felt better today.<br>
<br>
We get home and I turned on the computer for him to play his Blue's Clues game as a reward for being a good little man today.  Instead, he clicked on this Air Force recruiting video someone sent me.  It's a slide show of Sept 11th and the air strikes in Afganistan set to the song &quot;Red White and Blue&quot; by Toby Keith.  I've played it several times because the song kicks ass.  Anyways, he clicks it and is watching the slide show and does something that totally floored me.  He points to the slide where they show the US flag and he says &quot;My flag!&quot;.  He points to the Statue of Liberty (it was a cartoon of the statue of liberty holding a baby wrapped in the flag in one arm and holding a gun with the other with this look on her face of a very protective mother) and he said &quot;My angel!&quot; (i just recently started teaching him about religion, starting with guardian angels and such).  The flag shows again with Air Force members saluting and he salutes!  He starts singing the song!  Now he's only 3, so he babbled most of the lyrics but one part of the song goes:<br>
<br>
Justice will be served and the battle will rage<br>
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage<br>
You'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A<br>
Cuz we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way.<br>
<br>
He sang the last two lines clear as day!!!!!<br>
<br>
Now while I HAD to correct his use of &quot;vulgar&quot; language (regardless of my personal opinion of the whole topic of vulgarity and words), I was a man that stood corrected.<br>
<br>
We replayed the video.  And I'll be damned if I didn't feel better about it all.<br>
<br>
The USA has its faults, and maybe even more then most other countries...but it's home.  It's home that was fought for and earned.  It's where you can speak your mind, where you can gather and party and mourn and voice your anger.  I'll be damned!  For awhile I was mad, angry, and scared and my 3 year old son was the one that comforted me!  He again opened my eyes.  <br>
<br>
Kids are remarkable. <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

Shall we look at any other country to compare our faults with theirs?  Can you not recall the good?<br>
<br>
Yes children may be remarkable, I don't have any... I can't keep a boyfriend to save my life, and dearly despise stretch marks SO... I can't say I know what you're feeling when you look at any child.  BUT - its not just kids... I hate my parents moreso then I love them, but I would not have the smallest twinge of hope this summer if it wasn't for them.  Parents rule sometimes too, but we focus on the faults.<br>
<br>
Almost all humans focus on the faults, and misdoings rather then the good... How could you ever be happy like that?<br>
<br>
What you need is a HUGE HUG!  and maybe a good nap after watching a movie like Lord of the Rings.  I know how guys feel about Liv Tyler! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a
