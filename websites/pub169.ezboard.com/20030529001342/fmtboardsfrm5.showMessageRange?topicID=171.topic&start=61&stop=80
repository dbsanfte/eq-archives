<br>
<br>
as far as i can see, bush works under a deep christian belief. too deep. he acts like a moron, and makes me think about the movie about mississippi and the kkk.. u know when they have the documentary part of the movie with that female hillbilly saying something like &quot;negros..they stink, they are like animals blablabla&quot; in that awful southern accent. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
this is what i hear when i see bush babbling about good versus evil..revenge..etc. etc.<br>
it is as narrow-minded as those southern mind-fried fvcks from the early 1900.<br>
<br>
he needs to throw his version of the holy book away, and open his eyes. this isnt only about his america..his freedom. this is about the whole world, and thats why the whole world is protesting against him right now. he has gone too far &quot;on his holy crusade&quot;, as they call it.<br>
<br>
much like mommy and daddy when they are fighting, and the kids stand between their legs, looking up. will they take a hit when the arguments turn to fists? and fists into divorce? and divorce into blablabla..u get the point.  ?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
as for the slavery, im reacting to how a human being can create a perfect world by forcing another to work. <br>
<br>
america was built white. &quot;colored people&quot;, as it was called back then, didnt have any privilegies. they didnt get to vote. they didnt even get to drink from the same water as the white people. the law was insane. sick. disgusting. they were taken there from africa to build america. i dont find any word to describe those minds, and i think they are the worst in history. worse than the witch hunting on jews during the ww2.<br>
<br>
this jew- and homothing was more of a delusional crusade without motives. well..he did have some motives, hitler, and im sure many people would agree if what happened didnt happened (read 'mein kampf'),<br>
<br>
but the slavery in america wasnt about ONE man with delusions who wanted to exterminate a &quot;race&quot;.. it was a twisted view of reality which was accepted by almost a whole nation.<br>
<br>
people work like that. and i believe i would have pulled the gas lever in danzig too if i was a soldier influenced by a whole country, with a mental gun to my head (the people and the police under orders from hitler). but seing this from a third person view, im just so glad i can only speculate about how i would act in a situation like that..<br>
<br>
another version is that i would be a demonstrant, taker things in my own hands and start a war against the mistreatment. on my polish side, i have a grandpa that was the leader of an underground organization to help jews and political prisoners in auschwitz. my grandpa sat there, tho he wasnt a jew. he was a political prisoner.<br>
he didnt understand german and accidently placed himself in the &quot;jew line&quot; leading straight to the chanbers, but his friend pulled him back to the &quot;political prisoner line&quot;. lol.. thats awful, but pretty funny if u can think of the whole situation with a light mind. after all, humor is what made my grandpa and his friends survive those years. tho he passed away only 10 years after the ww2, and i wasnt even PLANNED back then. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but he got to see his home again, and live there.<br>
<br>
<br>
side note:<br>
<br>
my mother told me that a german soldier pointed at the smoke from where they burnt the corpses and told my grandpa in german that he soon willbe set free that way.<br>
my grandpa then told that soldier in polish to go fvck himself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
im very proud of him. and i feel that the very same blood is running in my veins.. the need to protest.<br>
i dunno.. maybe i would be a &quot;terrorist&quot;, fighting for freedom instead of a german nazi. i dunno. i have always been stubborn, just like my grandpa, according to my mother.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways, i think its hypocritical to build the 'land of the free' on that fundament. understandable 1000 years ago, when we all were fvcked up, but today..only 200 years ago when usa really started to grow..we really should have evolved into something better.  its a too modern age for me to accept that kind of view on humanity.<br>

i spoke to a little insecure communist girl the other day at a party (she was very nice tho). u know the kind of type wearing a red knitted (?) hat, all dressed in black..calling herself anarchist?<br>
<br>
she didnt vote, cause she thought the whole system is fvcked up, much like me.<br>
<br>
but i put her against the wall, since she claimed to be an anarchist and asked her if she didnt want the ability to affect the system?<br>
<br>
-&quot;affect WHAT system?&quot; she asked. &quot;you cant affect it since its not, what they claim to be, democracy&quot;.<br>
<br>
-&quot;fück that&quot;, i said. &quot;your option is to throw stones at the police, and that will make u even more unheard&quot;.<br>
<br>
-&quot;yeah i know.. i just..dont care&quot;, she answered.<br>
<br>
-&quot;if u dont vote, u show them that u dont care.&quot; i continued. &quot;if u vote, but vote on nothing, u support the democracy u want. you are protesting on their level&quot;.<br>
<br>
then she was busted, and she admitted that she would vote if her voting paper had come to where she lived now, when studying.<br>
i said way smarter things then that, cause id been drinking, but i never recall my bewinged words when drunk. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
i dislike people not taking a stance. me personally, i dint vote on anything.. cause i think its all a fvcked up circus with political parties smearing eachother in the magazines, sending anonymous provocative mails to eachothers etc. etc.<br>
<br>
but when voting blank, i support my right to vote. my right to affect the system as a citizen.<br>
<br>
everyone should do that, if they feel like me - that theres nothing to vote on. they should still support their right to vote. their right to affect. we DO have blank papers to put in those envelops! do you in america? (i honestly dunno)<br>
<br>
&quot;soffliggare&quot; is a swedish word. it refers to someone lieing in the sofa farting, doing nothing. thats nothing to be proud of.<br>

at the voting place, i met my parents. my mother followed me behind that screen and started to discuss with me what to vote on. the guards came to drag her away, and she tried to explain to them that she was my mother and INDEED had supported me financially and therefor had the RIGHTS to affect my decision! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

then she left me alone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
my FATHER also came to me behind that screen, and he noticed i was voting blank.<br>
<br>
&quot;dont do anything stupid now, son&quot;, he said..<br>
<br>
&quot;they are registering you, u know..&quot;, he continued.<br>

Would he be allowed to present again in the next election ? I know you can't do more than two term, but is that &quot;more than two in a row&quot; or &quot;more than two in a lifetime&quot; ?<br>

Too many people still stuck on his little fiasco with Monica.<br>

I gotta give the man props though, he did a stand up job as pres I thought, and he did what any guy in their late 40s/early 50s would have done as president. C'mon, we all know we'd abuse our power to get our nut off!<br>

The guy lied about more than that relationship. His administration leaked classified documents, sold high tech weaponry to our enemies, and he (yes, HE) personally obstructed justice. Too bad the freakin Republicans dont have a spine, or he WOULDA been removed from office. <p>Q2

He can't get re-elected. <br>

<br>
Of course this poll isn't current, but<br>
a. was taken at the height of Monica fever<br>
b. predated the &quot;Bush recession&quot;<br>
c. involves no active campaigning by Clinton, a virtuoso campaigner.<br>
<br>
Then again,<br>
d. it was taken pre-9/11.<br>
<br>
It would come down to the economy vs. the war,<br>
and a betting man would be foolish to bet against the self-interest of Americans.<br>
<br>
Clinton would likely win.<br>
After all, one of the worst candidates in recent memory beat Bush in the popular vote,<br>
and Clinton is one of the best.<br>
<br>
Note: I'm not making any value judgements above.<br>
In case you care, I find Clinton reprehensible, though I couldn't care less who's sucking his dick.<br>
As for Bush, he's a frightening little man owned by a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> frightening</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> cesspool of special interests.<br>
If you held a gun to my head, I guess I'd pick the less frightening cesspool of special interests and vote Clinton....<br>
then go outside and vomit.<br>
<br>
One nice thing about living in a Bible belt state in an Electoral College country:<br>
I get to vote for a candidate I actually respect, instead of the less-fetid of two cesspools. <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans serif" size="5">

Prepubescent? I happen to be 23, so unless I have some strange disease or something, I'd think I have already hit puberty. <br>
<br>
Just because I think it's funny doesn't mean I condone it. By saying that any guy would, I exclude myself from that, for your information. I wouldn't, but in today's society, most, if not all guys, would jump on any chick they had the opportunity to. If you'd like to get into a discussion on my views of the world and it's happenings, I'd be glad to, but don't assume I condone adultery by my support of Bill.<br>
<br>
Whether he did those things or not, it wouldn't change my view that he did a stand up job as President. <br>
<br>
Edit - I still think the deal with Monica never actually happened and it was a plan, to get people thinking and watching other things.
