<br>
Not sure if they are the same person on 2 accts but its bad form to immediately log after a ninja looting like that. My apologies if my assumptions are incorrect and Levarien and Sunmoon were not in cahoots to ninja the druid epic peice.<br>
<br>
Sunmoon was not online just before we killed fay, and was not online just after he looted it...so someone must have let him know the exact moment to log in and Ninja. /shrug<br>
<br>
Regardless the event was petitioned, and i hope the ninja looter is banned from EQ. GMs are looking at their logs and will right the wrong. Why do people think they can get away with such injustice? <br>

<br>
<br>
Second tidbit.......<br>
<br>
I was set to do fay on Wednesday so I was scouting his triggered spawn point making sure the Dwarf was up. Levarian popped by shortly after asking what I was doing there, I tell him for Fay, and we chat for a bit discussing strategies. He mentions that he is planning on doing Fay for a Druid friend on Friday, and said he would help with my kill; an epic Cleric (Marck) came by as well who seemed to know Levarian.  Anyway, I am pretty pumped because these two would be a nice addition to the raid and willing to help, so I port out to bring the rest of the force to Sro after which I notice Levarian and the Cleric have logged. I gate back (bound at fay spawn point) to make sure the Dwarf is still up and land in the jaws of Faydedar(bad timing); I died twice very quickly, lucky not to get caught in a death loop. <br>
<br>
Not sure if this has any relation to what happened, but it seems odd to me that Levarian who planned on taking out Faydedar Friday was at his spawn point Wednesday and as you stated Thursday.<br>
<br>
Now, if the real Fay did pop on them I can see why they left without any warning or message afterwards lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and definately don't blame them for it. <br>
<br>
~tries not to jump on the bandwagon~<br>
<br>
They both did, afterall, offer to help with my Fay kill.<br>

<br>
1. I spawned the Faydedar that was killed by the group by turning in my Froglok Essense.<br>
2. My friend explained to the druid that was organizing the group to kill Faydedar that this was spawned 12 hours ago and that Dolgin Codslayer was up also.  They agreed to kill both and that I would have one of the drops.<br>
3. I ran to the location when my friend told me this, when I got there, Faydedar was already dead and my friend told me to get the Pod of Seawater and that the group was going to kill the next Faydedar.<br>
4. After looting, I was called a ninja and that I was going to be petitioned.  I had to leave anyway, so I logged.<br>
5. The group killed the next Faydedar and the druid that organized the group received the Pod of Seawater.  That druid spawned him by turning in the Froglok Essense.<br>
<br>
Now the rants:<br>
Even though my friend explained to the group that this was a spawned Faydedar, they didn't believe it.  They thought it was the normal Faydedar that has loot.  That's why they were forming to help.  My friend told them this was not because he was with me at the time I spawned him 12 hours prior.<br>
<br>
The group was not angry at me, they were angry because they got no loot believing that this was a normal Faydedar.  The normal Faydedar doesn't even spawn in the same place in the zone.  This was explained prior to the fight by my friend.<br>
<br>
Check with the main druid that was organizing the group to kill Faydedar.  That druid knew of the arrangement to kill two Faydedars.<br>
<br>
If any of you do not believe the facts, Verant can check to see who actually spawned the Faydedar that was killed first. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ugullo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gullo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/23/02 6:40:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Some light on the subject</span><hr size=1> &quot;... you ... saw ...

Marck is/was my mentor and friend... he is a grade a cleric, but sadly he stopped playing about a year ago.<br>
<br>
I had no clue that he is back... or maybe it's someone carrying his name, who knows...<br>
<br>
Anyway, should you ever run into him again (doubtful though) tell him Valkyris said hi and misses him...<br>

Everyone was there to help Malitzia with her epic.

It actually sounds to me like the Evil Raiders guy who bought all the e-bayed toons realized it was too much work for him to perform a 15-box Faydedar kill in a half pike position with a twist and looted someone else's kill.<br>
<br>
Fay will despawn long before 12 hours passes. I guess this was changed in the last patch, along with the nerf to the fungi tunic, right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ugullo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gullo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/23/02 12:29:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Some light on the subject</span><hr size=1> Why did he even trigger the other Faydedar and leave him running around, was this the one that i gated back into the mouth of late Wednesday? I ended my raid because I didn't want to chance running into the real Fay while triggering the fake with the minimal force I had gathered. I mean, Levarian who was going to help dissapeared that day and a Fay was up in the Oasis right after they did. <br>
<br>
/shrug... maybe, I don't know for sure. Could be innocent, I thought the triggered Fay despawned if not engaged as well. /boggle<br>

[Thu Aug 22 19:06:08 2002] Malitzia tells fay:2, 'that guy took it!'<br>

<br>
Sounds to me like Levarian and Sunmoon are the same person from that response. Malitzia says Sunmoon took the drop in the raid channel to which Levarian replies......... &quot;No, I didn't take it.&quot;  Someone said Lev was Ebayed, and Sunmoon was /auc his character in EC for 30kpp a year before(buying toons in bulk?)<br>
<br>
I came to help with Malitzia's raid on Thursday for the triggered spawn(stayed for over an hour before start but couldnt stay sadly) and there defiantely was a Fay up for awhile as it killed someone who got turned around a bit heading to the gathering point. I did a /who all Levarian a few times because IMO the raid could have used a Bard, but he wasn't on at this point.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I just don't know; I DO know this all sounds whacked though.<br>

I suppose someone may have made sure to aggro it every 29 minutes to keep it around, but I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Sounds like a bug if both fay and the dorf were up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=129.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=129.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=129.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=129.topic&start=81&stop=96>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=129.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=129.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=20><img src=http://sevendragons.net/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=129.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.threadControl?topicID=129.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3>Rants</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
