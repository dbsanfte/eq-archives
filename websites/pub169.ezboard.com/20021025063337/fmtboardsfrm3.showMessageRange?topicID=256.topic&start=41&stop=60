I fault THEM for that. They were only powerfull because people screamed! You see, mob mentality is no excuse, because its a shortcoming. It's no better than people saying &quot;I cant do this because I'm stupid...&quot; &quot;I killed 20 people because my parents used to hit me...&quot; well, boo fricking hoo =) <br>
<br>
If we see things as faults, we should change and address them, as opposed to blaming it on something as old as time itself, though yes, people get riled up in groups, they can also choose to ignore that impulse and think for a moment.<br>
<br>
As I said before, Sun and Drack dont know each other, so it doesnt take too much brain activity to realize there is no truth to what she said... furthermore, no &quot;innocent children&quot; were hurt by this, thats @#%$ sally struthers speaking, from Drack's posts, I can tell his kid is very young, not a frequenter to the Morell Thule forums or anything, so that goes out the window too!<br>
<br>
Honestly, when it comes right down to it, all it was, was an insult. No different than &quot;cuntrag&quot; &quot;asspirate&quot; &quot;fudgepacker&quot; or &quot;fimble&quot; /hide<br>
<br>
So I'd say it wasnt the power of the words, but the lack of restraint, brain power, or both from the &quot;pundits&quot; (Only Drack has reason to slam her back) Or maybe some of them just wanted to stir the @#%$, to see what happens in the next episode of &quot;As the pixelated world's message board turns&quot;<br>
<br>
I hear Canna scores next episode...

Even if those words are baseless and obviously posted to insult and anger you, it is hard to detach from the obvious.<br>
<br>
In this case, Sunmina's words DID hit close to home for many.  Those people who have children.  I don't think its any secret how important Drack's child is to him, and he'd do anything to protect his kid.  Molestation is one of the worst crimes against children and even if he can detach himself from those comments, the thoughts of it will linger and spark the anger.  <br>
<br>
Its like this:<br>
<br>
Pink Penguins eating Pockey....<br>
<br>
For those people such as myself, I instantly translate those words into a picture of sorts in my mind.  Fact is, Drack and those with children or who have children who are special to them, will take it to heart.  It may make them the better person to not respond to such drivel but at the moment of instigation, its hard to pull back.<br>
<br>
For example, Sunmina claimed her sister died... Now if I were to say,<br>
<br>
 &quot;Hey, hope the next bomber gets the rest of your family.. or perhaps at least blows their legs off&quot;, <br>
<br>
you know its going to cross the line.  She will most probably conjur up images of her family and it will impact her.  Yes, I know what I wrote and I wrote it deliberately.. <br>
<br>

  You know Wedorfa I'm really sorry to hear that anything ever bad happened to you or anyone else a child , it sucks that people are soo sick, also I applaud those who could just walk away without intervention on such a sore subject, who might consider themselves more adult by turning away, it is something I cannot and will not do not anywhere ever, not even a message board.<br>
<br>
  I myself being a Mother and thinking and hoping that I am a good mother ,did act out of pure outrage at the mental images of those comment's , Yes I acted out of rage and NO I will never take back ANYTHING I had written here on my stance on this very sore subject..<br>
<br>
  You can rant my Anger but I am a parent who will defend any child who is slandered in any way, as I said before they cannot defend them selves.<br>
<br>
  an Apology? hahaha Ya ok if that was an apology, I do not accept, I would think it more sincere to get a tell in game from Sunmina apolgizing for her sick demonstration of trying to get under someone's skin by providing her slander of children, a sick mental image alot of us could not only do without BUT in that also realize how sick she is and I know alot of folks won't forget that..<br>
<br>
 Another way she could apolgize and I might think it sincere if if she posted a LONG apology here on the boards, apolgizing to all the parents who had to sit and read this sewage she calls pushing buttons to get ONE person mad.<br>

Why should people get warnings/banned for, to take an example, racist comments now? Most people would take much more offense in being called child molesters then being called a racial epithet. These are based on the same thing, taking knowledge from RL and applying them as an insult.<br>
<br>
Why hand out a warning to someone posting a &quot;trick&quot; link, one that pops up a lot of unclosable javascript windows meant as a joke, and do NOTHING about comments like these? Yes, the link was annoying and you had to use end task to get rid of those things, but a lot of people got a chuckle out of it (moving it to funnies and putting a disclaimer on it would have been better). This kind of annoyance doesn't compare with the deep effect Sunmina's comments had on other people, people that were in no way connected to the rant. As you yourself said, Fimble, words do have power.<br>
<br>
Offensive pictures are removed right away which is of course normal, but again they don't quite reach the level of these comments, you get grossed out, whine to the mods, and the pics gets deleted and the posters banned. A lot of people are STILL outraged DAYS after these comments, yet nobody gets punished and these comments stay.<br>

In a truly esoterical sense, a word is a word.  No more, no less.  Unfortunately, man was given the ability to reason and deduct.  Because we all come from differing backgrounds and environments, our perspective is unique.  The truly intelligent have understood this from the beginning and have used communication to entice men to come to particular points of view, using only words. Men have been given the ability to control armies of men that will kill for a word in just this way.   You and I both know that the pen is mightier than the sword my friend. <br>
<br>
As reasoning people, we are responsible for our actions, including the words we write.  Consequences follow our actions, from the post that Sunmina submitted; she is evidently remorseful over her remarks.  I, for one, applaud her newfound conscience.  I hope she can navigate her day with a little less anger and a little more compassion.  I hope that I can too.  It would be great if we all could.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
Bezshan<br>
<br>
Edit:  Actually it appears that Sunmina's apology was a joke.  I had the opportunity to read her reply to his post on the FW board and from what I can see, she has no remorse for her comments, in fact she (and those in FE that posted in her defense) seem to believe that she was a victim in all of this.  <br>
<br>
That is sad.  I feel for them all.<br>

I think of it like the difference between certain curse words. You can walk into a middle-school bathroom and say '@#%$' a million times, and most of them won't bat an eyelash. But if you mention the word 'nigger' you're gonna get a few dirty looks. Why is one so much worse than the other? They are only bad as long as we make them that way.<br>
<br>
I, myself, can honestly claim that I have never ranted anybody on a public message board. I can't remember ever ranting anybody at all, on any message board, but I don't have the best memory, so I will not claim I haven't. If you folks calling for Sun's execution can say the same, perhaps you may have a case. If not, better size a knoose for yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ujalyna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jalyna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Karanas' Farmer</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/30/02 12:49:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Nobody was injured in the making of this rant.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Sunmina's comments are precisely the kind that can injure someone because of the nature and subject of her words.  Let it die...yes, but not before the comment is thoroughly denounced as the deplorably fraudulent slur it is. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ujalyna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jalyna</A> at: 9/30/02 12:51:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ugibb23.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gibb23</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/30/02 4:07:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I just read that FE link and...wow<br>
<br>
My feelings of dislike for her have turned to sadness and pity, the amazing thing is that she seems to be ranting personal attacks yet I have not seen anyone get as personal as she does. The hypocrisy is just amazing.<br>
<br>
She obviously has issues, I say stay the hell away from her, she has problems enough.<br>

That is from Sunmina in reply to my &quot;non-hostile whatsoever&quot; post on FE's public board (post cut and pasted below before the mysterious &quot;edit&quot; happens).<br>
<br>
Anyways, I think in a court of law in almost any country, me being prosecutor, Sunmina being the defense...I could sleep through the entire trial, wake up, bring this in as evidence to judge and jury, and go back to sleep.  This is just one paragraph, but the most obvious pick aparts are right there.<br>
<br>
Left out something in the last two sentances (i'll correct it for ya though).  Go back to your cesspool where personal attacks are allowed and encouraged.  Here, we will attack you at will, but if you attack us, they are locked.  This thread might not be locked anytime soon because you haven't attacked us here.<br>
<br>
Hypocritical piece of sh.it eh?  =)<br>
<br>
Nah, I will NOT go to another guild's message board and attack them.  When I heard Moony went there taking issue over Sunmina's posts I went there to post the below message to cool the fire.  It's a me/sunmina issue, and the entire FE guild doesn't need to be subjected to it if they do not want.  <br>
<br>
And I'll tell you something psychobish:  Cry to yer guild and yer friends all you want about being the victim and yer right/Drack wrong.  Convince as many people as you can that Drack is the debil.  Your guild and your friends SHOULD stand by your side, as that is what guilds and friends are for.  However, your best bet is to shut yer mouth as your case dwindles with each sh.it spewed word that comes forth.  Post not in the cess pool, and I have nothing further to say about this.  Post again, and just like when I started this whole ordeal, I'll come forth again.  <br>
<br>
My post from FE.com:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I said I wouldn't post here again, but because this was brought here in relation to me, and to cool some of the flames, I am here one more time.<br>
<br>
I don't want it banned, I don't care what it says over in the &quot;cess pool&quot;. It may have been a new low for the cess pool, but it doesn't matter. <br>
<br>
I brought it on, I accept that's what it could come up with. I wanted the little Sunmina/Myriddan vs Drack war over there. See, what Sun might say over there and what I might say over there might not reflect the people we are in game or in real life, but while we're over there...we're who we are at that moment in time. <br>
<br>
So kill the Moonleaf thread, edit this one to something &quot;witty and creative&quot; like you did to me last time. To non-FE people, leave it at mt.com please, i beg you. <br>
<br>
I won't apologize for Moonleaf's strong feelings over the issue (because i agree with them), but I do apologize that more people are being subjected to it then desire to.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Lyssia was going to throw those posts in Moonleaf's face to point out what kind of a hypocrite Moonleaf was.  I have looked far and wide for a listing of those posts.  Has anyone seen them yet?  (The only reason I even care is that I am morbidly curious to find out which subjects Lyssia finds more offensive than Sunmina's child molestation/prostitution comments)<br>
<br>
I also find it mildly arrogant for the apologists/enablers of Sunmina to infer that her comments drew outrage only because she was a member of FE.  I think that line of thinking borders on delusional.<br>
<br>
Anyway, let me know if you guys see that post from Lyssia.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
