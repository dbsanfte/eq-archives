Someone said I would make it, so here I am to prove it they were right. I couldn't figure on whether to put this in rants, general, or off-topic, so I let it ride here because this is the forum I feel I am most known for. Let that spell any for any reputation you may think it gives, I care not. Mods, please don't hijack me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I figured I would discuss 1337 things. Things that I feel are 1337. You may feel they are 1337, you may not. This may bore you to tears, but maybe some things discussed will make you laugh to tears, cry to tears, mad as hell, whatever. I hope you enjoy it. No particular order except for God.<br>
<br>
1. God - IMO, and I seriously do not wish to infringe on the beliefs of others out there, but to me, this would not be possible without Him.<br>
2. Everquest - this is one 1337 ass game. Without it, this message board wouldn't be here and I would have never been able to &quot;meet&quot; some of you lovely people. It's sad that I have to grow up and that I have grown bored with the game, or I'd be playing it right now.<br>
3. Azmokar and Fimble - the 2 guys that make/made this possible. Without their dedication to us, none of us would have gotten to know each other as well as we have, and been able to communicate well with each other.<br>
4. All of my friends and family- this includes my real life friends, my EQ/Message Board friends, my family whether they be in town or in my hometown or anywhere, I love you all. I know I don't agree with you all, but if you knew me at all IRL, even with all of the abrasive things I may say because I don't agree, I never truly wish anything bad upon any of you. I get madder than hell sometimes, but I never wish any malcontent unless you cannot drive <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Well, that's it for those 4, here's more, not numbered, that I want to share. Maybe poetic.<br>
<br>
Driving down the road with my windows down<br>
A good, jammin tune on the radio<br>
Pretty ladies<br>
Good jokes<br>
Sarcastic people<br>
Dry humor<br>
The sound of Amazing Grace on Bagpipes (listening now)<br>
Floor Fans<br>
Queen sized beds<br>
My mom, she's the greatest woman alive<br>
My brother, I'd lose my world if he were never around<br>
My step-father, the greatest father I never had<br>
Country breezes<br>
The stars at night in the country sky<br>
Memories......<br>
Hard Rock Cafe<br>
England<br>
History in general<br>
Knowing stuff, GO LEARN, it can be rewarding and fun!<br>
My ancestral history<br>
Icehouse and Newcastle!<br>
Long Island Tea's<br>
Missions from god<br>
I'm a Drunk, not an alcoholic...Alcoholics go to meetings!<br>
Music, love music<br>
My mom's Manicotti and Roast Beef (cooked seperately of course)<br>
Friends, I won't lie and say I never need a crutch or an ear<br>
The guy and his wife one day in Alabama who helped me to a gas station and never asked my name, it eventually helped my friends and i out when we were in a major jam<br>
Driving fast in the wrong land of traffic<br>
Driving fast, period<br>
Outrunning the cops, WOOHOO<br>
Sunflowers or Happy perfumes<br>
Victoria's Secret lotions on the ladies, definitely not on myself<br>
The men and women that work for my country to ensure its safety and that things run the way they should, mostly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
It was a tragic day, but the heroes that took over that plane flight that crashed in PA, I always cry when I think of their bravery, and smile to know they have a good spot with God<br>
The heroes that rose after 9/11, thank God for all firefighters and police officers that put themselves in harm's way for the betterment of lives they'll sometimes never know<br>
People! Without people, what would we all do? What would we talk or complain about?<br>
Don't get me wrong, I love all people, some are just misguided<br>
SEC College Football<br>
UT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO VOLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
Rocky Top!<br>
East Tennessee, the most beautiful place on the planet IMO<br>
Southern Arizona, Southern New Mexico and West Texas for teaching me where I'll never live for any amount of money ever again<br>
You! Seriously, thank you, any of you that read that, thank you, I mean it<br>
Go hug your family members, or call them up<br>
Apologies and mending love (I'm undertaking a big task of this on Friday with my real dad)<br>
If you have family you don't talk to, try again, for me, if that means anything<br>
Technology rocks!<br>
The rolling face, tickles me to death <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
The fact that there are people that I will never get along with, but those tend to be the people I learn the most from, so THANK YOU all of you I'll never like!<br>
Backyard Burgers Lemonade and food, lemonade primarily<br>
Good ole tall glass of freshmade southern sweet tea (there's a difference, trust me your teeth will fall out ya face!)<br>
Redneck jokes<br>
Those days that occur when you walk out the door and you know nothing will go wrong that day, and nothing ever does (rare but they happen)<br>
Someone rubbing my head and telling me everything will be alright<br>
Hugs are so warm<br>
Still feeling a sign of respect when someone shakes my hand, a man's handshake is a contract of things set in stone; the way I was raised, the way it should be<br>
Softball and all the guys that trust in me to coach them another year<br>
Dancing is fun at the club, werd up<br>
Memphis in May, the Musicfest and the BarBCuefest<br>
The Mississippi River<br>
Riverboats are cool<br>
The south! The best and prettiest place on the planet<br>
Exercise! Go stretch now<br>
And one of the best things in the world - new life, can't wait for my best friend and his girl to have their baby<br>
And to mention him, my best friend Nick, he's my friend til one of us dies, and we'll be friends again (yeah maybe I'm too old for this but I'm pretty simple f00)<br>
Hydrogen Peroxide (because rubbing alcohol blows!)<br>
<br>
Well, I think I have run out of stuff. I have some odd advice for you all, but I'm odd so just take it as such.<br>
<br>
Go exercise! Learn to eat right, treat your bodies well. In September, I was diagnosed with high BP. Since then I lost 50-55 pounds (I weigh 170 as of today) and my BP is down. My father had an angioplasty done yesterday and he is 51. 3 balloons and 2 stints, and he's doing well now. Do it for your families if nothing else or your future families, live long, prosper and sieze the day!<br>
<br>
The foot you stomp on could be connected to the butt you kiss tomorrow &lt;--heard this one here, and I have lived a few real life versions of this analogy so far<br>
<br>
NEVER burn your bridges, unless you know for sure that the person or people you're screwing over will never enter your life in any way, shape, or form again<br>
<br>
Hmm, I dunno, I'll add more later I'm sure. Good night and wish you all a wonderful life, seriously. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jasminne>Jasminne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Shoe Freak<BR>
