Pour all your hate out and let us all laugh at anon newbie_01. I'll start it out with some of mine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Firstly, since I'm a cleric, I'll go with some of the better &quot;Rez requests. Hmm, there was the level 21, bound in FV, dead in CB, who wanted me to come rez him, during a hate raid. There was the level 33 warrior who asked me to coem rez him in CC. On the CR I died, and while trying to get my corpse back a cleric from his guild comes and rezzes him, he and the cleric then take off leaving me to go get my corpse back by myself.....<br>
<br>
Who could forget the infamous chanter whos reputation that I single-handedly ruined. The guy who put all of his gear on the 52 wizzy he ebayed, then used the wizzy to port me to Seb, logged over to his gearless chanter, and insisted that the porterless group go take Emporer. Oh, and he also cast WW form on himself so that he could have the str to ML but refused to so much as haste the tanks, and he also insisted on pulling. If you haven't guessed it yet /rude Lorakthor.<br>
<br>
Then there was the idiot druid in CB who insisted that the only way to pull into the TR was by clearing all the mobs up to that point via pulling them to ent. This druid also claimed that he was a far better puller than my twinked warrior because he could heal himself mid pull if he got hit.<br>
<br>
There was the idiot druid who petitioned me for bringing a declared train to the zone because zoning was &quot;exploiting game mechanics&quot; and that &quot;Verant never wanted people to be able to escape from mobs&quot; and also that when you got higher in level you would be blacklisted for training. Not the intentional kind of monk FD training mind you, he was talking about running for the zone, he was convinced it was the most honorless thing you could do.<br>
<br>
I remember the lvl 25 who claimed a wizard had ported him into hate and showed him around. Yeah right buddy.......<br>
<br>
There was the guild leader of some puky newbie guild who threatned to blacklist me to his entire guild for refusing to rez his rude demanding ass.<br>
<br>
Did I mention that Lorakthor is a total waste of sperm?<br>
<br>

K, lemme think of some people, dont remember many names though, dont hold grudges much.<br>
<br>
Lorakthor: Accused me of being ebay, cous I never pulled singles in disco in seb (singles = boring ghay slow xp), he died trying and I had to drag 5 corpses to zone in from disco2.<br>
<br>
Ssvanti: God knows, I just think he is a wanker<br>
<br>
Milrea: Just for some guild ethics probs in Coveit Emptor a long long time ago, but he is a cool guy<br>
<br>
Shaman with a name starting with G (old school guy), a troll. Used to be Razdeline's roommate or something. Complete jerk passed through every guild, now somehow in BaM or some @#%$, give him a month.<br>
<br>
Oboro: phantom knights @#%$ that tried to gank my efreeti camp (I was with a shaman, he had monk/sham/ranger/druid), It eventually leaded to me training every mob in the zone except FG's onto his group, next repop I got the boots and left. <br>
<br>
Oppression: The @#%$ he pulled was not cool, although through RA he was sorta the backbone, but the &quot;what opp sais, goes&quot; attitude got old quick. Fag<br>
<br>
Sohrab: Nothing wrong with the kid, just using the reputation of his bro (neo) to get @#%$/guilded is not cool.<br>
<br>
Mohadeeb: For being so cool :-)  /praise<br>
<br>
Saalron from vazaelle: @#%$ that rejoined guild causing enough disruption for a breakup (www.agonyguild.com)<br>
<br>
Everyone with a name like Conan, maximus, Darth, @#%$ like that, maybe if you add a bunch of x's and z's you'll even be cooler!<br>
<br>
Some 60wiz in BaM or someting I think, really gay name like luuke or Fred or some @#%$. Total fag k thx ~<br>
<br>
Hmm tonnes more just cant think of names. <br>

<br>
(story behind 10 slot tailoring kits)<br>
<br>
Bout 9 months ago when Wu's became live the developers in VI forgot that the Tunics required 9 slots to complete the recipe and at the time all that was sold was 8slot kits.. So VI gets this brilliant idea to make a 10 slot tailoring kit that weighted 1lb and carried Giant items (think you see where I am going with this). They masses united and said YEA no longer shall we pay 50pp per Tailored 10slot bags that weight 2lbs when we can get these for 2pp . The world rejoices.. The tailors /sigh cuz they have lost out on a major PP seller. <br>
<br>
Then 6 days later the guys at VI decide wait.. that is way to good.. I got an idea.. we will make LOOMS and place them in every city.. (and some random dungeons) and that way we can take away the 10slots. <br>
<br>
Hmm... problem most ppl are using them for bank slots.. SO Vi's fix was turn all large sewing kits into Deluxe ones. And reintroduce the large ones at 8 slots and 2lbs. .. btw the Deluxe now weight 4lbs. <br>
<br>
And thus is the story of the Deluxe tailorign kits. <br>
<br>
It is my Opionin that there are prolly bout 100 +/- kits on the server atm. most people dont even know they have them .. So when you see them for sale cheaply buy them (lord knows i do) because they will never be in game again. and for those up and comming tailors who need to make wu's while hunting these things are godsends<br>
<br>
Hope that helps explain that to you Meme. btw /ru<br>

Don't give yourself so much credit.  Lorakthor expertly ruined his own &quot;reputation&quot;, and didn't need any help to do so.  <br>
