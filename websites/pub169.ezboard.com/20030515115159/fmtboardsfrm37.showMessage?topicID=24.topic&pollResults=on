<br>
Why i'm agaisnt the war ?<br>
-because it's a war wanted by liars (to free the iraqi people/war agaisnt terrorism/because we sure he have womd/because i love his beret, but first, to free the oil)<br>
-because for all of the &quot;reasons&quot; presented to the world community, there is still no proofs (and because it's strange to kill the people you are supposed to free)<br>
-because that make more and more people die<br>
-because that give one more reason to the fanatics to hate americans<br>
-because the US government really really don't care about world community/smarts US citizens (i saw one law proposal in a state, that qualify all peace manifestants as terrorist, and california, police fired with &quot;*non letal*&quot; guns on a peace manifestation, making dozens of woundeds peeps)(non letal if you don't fire in the head, tho, wood balls must hurts very much)<br>
-because instead of thinking about why the muslims hate americans and try to solve the problem, your government prefer attack a muslim country, surrounded by other muslims countries (and i i'm correct, syria will be the next, one of your senators stated that &quot;if we don't find womd in iraq, that because they hide them in syria!&quot;) that make a religion war.<br>
<br>
why i don't voted :<br>
-i'm anti-american: because all the americans are not warmongers and try to think by themselves. all the americans don't trust everything they see on tv and make their own opinions.<br>
-i'm a traitor: ahah<br>
-im a co-conspirator with saddam: i hate this guy<br>
-im a coward: no, i have the courage of my opinions and the courage to defend them. (look, it's strange for a &quot;surrender&quot; country to stand in front of the &quot;powerfull USA&quot; and say &quot;NO!&quot;), well, that gimmick make me laungh.<br>
<br>
<br>
i voted the last option because of the friendly fire (there is a joke, in europe, about that: a british soldier disguised into an iraqi soldier to not be shot by americans), of the civilian fire and of the war. This war only proven that saddam hussein don't have a real army, only a milicia equiped with knives, and they can't even think about invade other country when they can't defend their own capital. <p><br>

2) USA did this war without the agreement of UN.<br>
3) UN inspectors didn't have enough time to finish their job.<br>
4) USA don't understand that war is the worst thing ever to solve problems. Sometimes it can be needed but obviously it wasn't here.<br>
5) I think GWB has personnal interest in doing this war (reelection + money)<br>

<br>
I am against this particular war for the reasons that it is being fought. I am in full belief that George W. is having this war only because his father had one. His reasoning is that there is a possibility that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction and that diplomatic means to get him to either give them up or destroy them are not going anywhere.<br>
<br>
AT the same time. North Korea claims to have nuclear weapons, they are presently testing long range ballistic missiles, etc. etc. and so on. YET, George W said that he will handle North Korea only using diplomatic means. <br>
<br>
Now, I am in full support of the Allied Soldiers that are in the middle east and in support of this conflict all over the world. All of them are in my prayers daily. <br>
<br>
Has anyone though ever stopped to wonder how Saddam Hussein got to power in Iraq in the first place? Do you really think that the people of Iraq placed him in power? I may be wrong, but I do believe that i read somewhere that it was the US government or the Russian Government that placed him there years ago. <br>
<br>
Now, Does it seem that I actually like or care about someone who managed to get into the office of President that was NOT voted in by the people? Does anyone even remember all the issues that went on in Florida. George W lost the popular Vote to become president, does that sound like this country is a democracy? <br>
<br>
I am in full belief that this war should never have happened because it was caused by people that were messing in affairs that they should never have been messing with in the first place, but now that it is done, I am hoping that the war is over in a hurry and to get the people out of harms way.<br>
<br>
BTW,  The original name of this war was Operation Iraqi Liberation  (OIL)  but someone decided that would really cause some problems,  that is why it was renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom.  (Oil Is Free??)<br>
<br>
Now,  there still has not been any Weapons of Mass Destruction found.  They have recently captured one of the High Ranking Scientists,  and this guy insists that there are none.<br>
<br>
There are many little nations whose Rulers are worse than Saddam with reguards to how that ruler treats their people,  but since their countries do not have any oil, or other items that are of interest to the US Government,  do you see them pushing to go to war with those nations?<br>
<br>
I do believe that we may have had to eventually gone to war with Iraq, but I also strongly believe that we went a bit early. We really should have allowed the UN people to do their thing before jumping into war. <br>
<br>
I was at the last war with Iraq, I have seen the burned bodies, smelled the stench of decaying, cooked human flesh where people were burned both alive and dead inside their armoured vehicles. I have seen the mass graves. I have heard the cries of wounded Americans and Iraqi soldiers, and I have heard the weeping of those family members that have lost someone. AND MOST OF ALL, I saw a friend of mine do a very stupid thing, and pick up a scatter mine that he thought was a dude and put it in his pocket. The ordinance was not defective.<br>
<br>
THIS is the reasons that I do not care for war, and believe that all diplomacy should be used first before going to war again.<br>
<br>
