Obviously several of you missed my previous posts on actually BEING in some of these other countries and witnessing firsthand how dictatorships ACTUALLY run. I am not going to get into the typical &quot;never been 25 miles form home but know how the world is run cause CNN is always right&quot; crap from people who could tell the difference between a T-80 and an M1. Or propaganda from the truth. Are there differences of opinions on how and what is going on? Sure, and you are free to believe what you want.<br>

(this deserves its OWN topic)</span><hr size=1> that &quot;i've seen it with my own two eyes&quot; is weak. First of all, what you see is of no consequence if you dont understand what you are seeing. And I doubt from &quot;visiting&quot; these places you can glean any more than a superficial understanding of how they work.<br>
<br>
You think seeing a dictatorship is understanding it? Furthermore, do you believe Dictatorship = evil terrorists against USA? Thats just ignorance.<br>
<br>
Even SOLDIERS sitting in the battlefields dont always know what the @#%$ is really going on, do you think I believe you do with that sort of statement?<br>
<br>
Fidel Castro imprisoned my grandfather for over 20 years because he refused to snitch on one of his counter revolutionary friends. I had cousins, uncles, aunts, all executed like animals in a slaughterhouse because they believed differently than the local government. I MYSELF was imprisoned in a Cuban prison.<br>
<br>
Believe me, compared to the way they live in Cuba, Iraq is the @#%$ Ritz Carlton.<br>
<br>
Does spending months in Cuba living in a room with no roof and being in one of their prisons make me an expert? Sorry no, neither does visiting make you an authority.<br>
<br>
Besides, do you truly believe &quot;the truth&quot; as you called it is that? The truth is rarely given, often times one needs to look beneath the surface to find it...<br>
<br>
You have an entire country (most of america is AGAINST attacking iraq) the rest of the world (except for England) AGAINST the attack, you have our own @#%$ Congressmen and Senators GOING to iraq to try and stop it. Only one or two dipshits seem to be for ignoring the rest of the free world and starting a HUGE war.<br>
<br>
Now, lets take some facts... Theyve been talking about Attacking Iraq for TWO MONTHS. The United States doesnt work like that normally, thats a pretty idiotic MO if you ask me. Unless there is a reason behind it... Could it beeeeeee, elections? Give that man a cookie Alex!<br>
<br>
P.S: CNN is full of @#%$, I never listen to them, I base my assertions on that long lost art of thought.  <p><b>Next to the maiden's<BR>Sleeping place<BR>I left<BR>The Sabre, The Sword- <BR>Alas, that Sword...<BR><BR> -Yamato Takeru<BR><BR>

<br>
since i'm versatile letme take the side of war to balance out this discussion. when saddam is removed think how much money will be dumped into iraq to help modernize the country. with that and knowing that iraq could be one of the biggest oil exporting countries it'd would help the people a great deal to loose the govt and become rich. Not to mention a certain embrago will be dropped right away.....<br>

And yes, its a money move, we'll throw a puppet government in there and take control of it all, and I want you to take a guess at how that is going to sit with the international world (Who already believe we are bullies and deserve to be attacked, in some ways i agree with them).<br>

The people wont become rich, we will. @#%$, not even we, you or I wont see a penny of that money my friend.

bullshit, for use of the saudi's bases (this time around) we have to kill saddam, everyone in the middle east is for killing saddam, they just don't voice it. who's the leader in the voice for killing saddam? his daughter! and which allies you talking about here? cause i know tony blair's for it....and israel's for it.....saudi's are for it....iran's for it.....etc.<br>
<br>
not sure what you mean by costly either, but remember i'm not for a war i just took this side to even out the discussion<br>

Money means nothing to me compared to the suffering war would cause, sometimes war is necessary... but we're Liberating profits for oil barons, not human beings...<br>
<br>
I was reading today about how soldiers are going door to door in afganistan now searching for Taliban soldiers, searching people and homes, landing helicopters in streets in the middle of the night. And that got me thinking, did we liberate these people? Or did we just give them someone new to be afraid of?<br>
<br>
But Id also like to address the monetary cost now that Im thinking about it, quick little fun fact, it would cost between 7 and 12 BILLION dollars to deploy our troops and fight a war with Iraq. <p><b>Next to the maiden's<BR>Sleeping place<BR>I left<BR>The Sabre, The Sword- <BR>Alas, that Sword...<BR><BR> -Yamato Takeru<BR><BR>

interesting note, i watched the senate talking to army officials and it was hilarious<br>
<br>
senate: you guys ready incase iraq uses chemical weapons?<br>
army: no<br>
senate: what do you mean, we bought you new suits<br>
army: but you cut our freaking training and chemical weapons budget so we don't know how to use the damn things<br>
<br>
oops, lil mistake there<br>
<br>
but for republicians human lives mean jack @#%$, i quote george carlin:<br>
&quot;from 0-18 they don't wanna hear about you, they don't care, but when you 18, army age, there your new best friend, they wanna try living babies into dead armymen&quot; <br>
couldn't find my cd but that's the gist<br>
<br>
i agree, the only reason afgan. harbored terriorist is there one of the poorest @#%$ countries on this earth! with bin laden came money! stop pestering these people! chrrrriiiiist!<br>
<br>
but ye skipped my point about the rest of the world, the world dosen't want a war with iraq, they want saddam dead<br>

No matter which side of the issue you are on, you have to train yourself to realize when you're hearing actual information or propganda designed to influence mass public opinion.<br>
<br>
For example, when you hear Bush say the reason behind 9-11 is that &quot;they hate our freedom&quot;, you're hearing propaganda, not information.  In their corrupted minds, the terrorists felt they had actual reasons that they felt justified mass murder of innocent civilians, but &quot;hating our freedom&quot; was not one of them.

Bush is a moron, but his cabinets pretty smart. and if anyone wants info on why the terrorists did it send me a email, rather take that one through e-mail, sometimes it's good to be a poly sci major <p><center><a href="http://www.geocities.com/qkasmt/">

All I will say is I was NOT there as a tourist, and HAD to understand the cultural/political climate. Also, I would argue that you spending time in a Cuban prison makes you MORE of an expert than 90% of those living here in the US. So most of the US is against attacking Iraq, so most of the Democrats in Congress are against it. So WHAT? (Hitler was Time's Man of the Year in 1938 and Stalin in 1939. And a LOT of Americans thought they were great men doing great things for their respective countries. Too bad they slaughtered MILLIONS.) The United States is NOT a democracy, so dont even get me started down THAT road.<br>
<br>
Am I FOR a war against Iraq. I think in some form or another it is a necessity. Is it partly of our own doing that Iraq is the country it is today? I would say yes. We historically supported them with weapons (even bio, it appears), money and training. <br>

Qkas i gotta disagree about all the middle east wanting saddam out though. one of the problems we've faced in this endavor is lack of support for the operation in the mid-east. we'd love to fund some pissed off muslim to mount his own attack against Saddam, but we cant find one.(i do realize you were just playing devils advocate though) <p>DESEPCHUN <BR>EXILED PRINCE OF ERUDIN<BR>Forever Exiled Elite</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucannabulon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cannabulon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/graphics/zen.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secret Master of the<BR>Marshmallow Silique</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#628CBC>(10/4/02 9:31:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/graphics/zen.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Al Gore/Dan Quayle</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> WTF does tact and charisma have to do with being able to speak the truth?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Absolutely nothing my friend, except that presidents dont speak the truth. They arent paid to speak the truth, they are paid to keep us calm and make us feel that what is being done is right. By no means does the news speak the truth either mind you.<br>
<br>
Tact serves only that purpose, to effectively calm the people and rally support for the president's (countries) cause. When a president cant do that, he has failed... The president has very little power (and has his hands tied when trying to exert it) but one power he does have, is the attention of the american people. <br>
<br>
Sadly bush doesnt know what to do with that...<br>

We remove the threat.<br>

We go back to our life.<br>
