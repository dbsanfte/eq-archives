<br>
A very good question.<br>
<br>
Things I had in mind:<br>
<br>
1.  Clear audio tapes with transcripts provided in ARABIC and notarized translations from a number of translators... not 30 second, barely audible sound bites with Powerpoint overlays that, frankly, anyone could have produced.  The sound bites were presented as clips, wholly out of context, which goes far to detract from their believability.  Let's look at a quote from Colin Powell's presentation:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;You didn't get it modified. You don't have one of those, do you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have one.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Which? From where?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;From the workshop. From the Al-Kindi Company.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;What?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;From Al-Kindi.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll come to see you in the morning. I'm worried you all have something left.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We evacuated everything. We don't have anything left.&quot;<br>
<br>
Note what he says: &quot;We evacuated everything.&quot; We didn't destroy it. We didn't line it up for inspection. We didn't turn it into the inspectors. We evacuated it to make sure it was not around when the inspectors showed up. &quot;I will come to you tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Al-Kindi Company. This is a company that is well known to have been involved in prohibited weapons systems activity.<br>
<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Can you tell me conclusively that the gentlemen on the tape were not talking about <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.realdoll.com">RealDolls (tm)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  Yes, that is a reductio ad absurdum argument, but seriously, there's no evidence that they're not talking about sex toys...  The &quot;evidence&quot; is at best circumstantial and the clip was chosen by Colin Powell or whoever wrote the presentation to allow for maximum imagination while presenting minimum fact.  The technical term for that is &quot;bullshitting&quot; where I come from.<br>
<br>
2. Satellite photos that show a clear pattern of violations, not a one shot deal that could be a picture of anything taken out of context.  Show me 25 photos of equipment moving around and some detailed analysis.  Don't show me one or two photos with some photoshop text over a circle surrounding a black dot that says &quot;NASTY EVIL WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION&quot; This photo taken from the presentation:   <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/nea/disarm/images/12slide12.jpg">Satellite Photo</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> could have been taken over the United States for all we know.  It's out of context.  If there are weapons there, why did the US not send inspectors there RIGHT AWAY, and show a picture of Mr. Blix holding up a jar of mustard gas to the world?  Again it's a case of maximum imagination and minimum information... <br>
<br>
3. Less reliance on what defectors say.  There is a major credibility gap with anything any defector has to say, and even the US government knows this.  First, a defector is strongly motivated to tell his sanctuary provider whatever they want to hear, true or not, if only to get even with wherever he's defecting from and to curry favour with wherever he's defecting too.  Second, by their very nature, defectors are disloyal - that is after all why they defected.  The words of disloyal people are hard to believe.  I bet if you lined up enough defectors you can find out that Saddam Hussein dresses in women's underwear and has sex three-way sex with goats and camels.  That doesn't mean it actually happens.  Historically, defectors have been noted for spreading copious bullshit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The Job of the inspectors ( as outlined in the UN resolution) is to make sure that Iraq has disarmed, not a hunt or a game of hide and seek.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Incorrect.  The job of the inspectors is exactly a game of hide and seek.  They are engaging in what a mathematician calls a &quot;Zero Knowledge Proof&quot;.  The idea is:  How do I prove to you that I don't have something without revealing to you whether or not I actually do have some?  The answer is to allow you to randomly inspect as often as you see fit.  At some point, you (the inspector) turns up enough blanks that you have to agree that the bounds of reasonability have been met.  Here's an example that's simpler:  I have a coin.  My claim is that it was struck with heads on both sides.  Without taking posession of the coin, how can you prove that my claim is true or false?  well, you can have the coin flipped and the results reported.  If the coin is flipped 20 times and the result is heads 20 times, the chance is about one in a million that the coin has other than 2 heads... the chance is not ZERO, but pretty close.  It is certainly possible that my coin has 1 head and 1 tail, but is it realistic to expect that after 20 heads?  The inspectors in Iraq are involved in the same game.  They get to show up at random sites and look for weapons.  They keep coming up empty handed. How many times do they have to do it to satisfy everyone?<br>
<br>
Logically, it is impossible to prove you DO NOT have something in your posession.  That's a negative proof, and do make that proof requires omniscience.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If Iraq was disarmed or was interested in disarming, they would be laying everything out for the inspectors to see, or show where items have been destroyed. They have done neither.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Let's say, for argument's sake, that 5 years ago they incinerated all the stuff, including records of it.<br>
<br>
What, exactly, would they lay out for inspection today?  How could they demonstrate that incenerator 1234-5 was used to destroy the things years ago?  It's just not possible.  If they kept records, YOU could use the same arguments I'm making here to refute those records.  It's a no-win scenario for Iraq.<br>
<br>
For the record, I'm all for kicking ass and taking names... Hell I was in the military for 9 years... but if you're going to go to war, be sure you've got the moral high ground.  Right now, the US just doesn't have it. <p><center><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/pdcowan/sig.jpg alt="Beware, Plush Cthulhu is watching!"><br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=585673">Magelo</a></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qikkiq>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/17/03 4:41:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ciypher>Ciypher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 267<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/17/03 4:54:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.d.umn.edu/~stof0041/pics/starcraft_terran_ghost.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !</span><hr size=1> Stability: A free democraticaly elected Government, with no Theocratic controls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/17/03 10:35:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=43>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !</span><hr size=1> Why is a democracy necessary for nuclear weapons?

But ok, lets take Fogel's view.  A government that requires multiple branches to make a decision.  This means that Iran is ok with nukes for you?  Multiple branches of government there.  how about Israel?  How about Syria?  Lebanon?  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

Because using Nuclear weapons will almost always end your political carear in a democracy. If your a dictator you don't need to worry about that. If you are an elected representative then you do, you wont just nuke cause you can internationaly get away from it.<br>

Your right, the US Government doesn't agree with me, thats why it's MY opinion. <br>

China definatly shouldn't have nukes, USSR, is in the same boat too. Thier nuclear restrictions are NOTHING like the ones on the US. How many USSR Nukes are missing? Something like 15?  <br>

Brittain is a democracy in all name. The last times the Monarch refused to give assent to a bill was in ~1914.<br>

Religion can destabilize a country or a region. Look at the middle east, it has the most theocratic governments, and is one of the least stable regions. It isn't a US ideal either, unless China, Russia, Japan, Korea, France, Germany, Sweeden, Mexico, and prbably 80% of all countries on earth where annex by the US. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ciypher>Ciypher</A> at: 2/17/03 11:14:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/17/03 11:14:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=45>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Because using Nuclear weapons will almost always end your political carear in a democracy.

There has been only one offensive use of Nuclear weapons in the history of mankind.  It was by an elected official.  Elected in the US I might add.  I'm honestly not sure if he lost his job or not but I dont see how you can support your claim in light of this.  Answer me honestly, if Bush nuked Afgahnistan into a glassy wasteland, do you think he would lose his job?  In fact, I could probably make an argument that democratically elected officials are more likely to use nukes since they are much more vulnerable to mob mentality than dictators.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>China definatly shouldn't have nukes<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why not?  What gives you the right to decide other nation's rights?  On what do you base this conclusion that China is more liable to use nukes?  I would like to remind you again that the US is the only nation to use nuclear weapons.  What makes you think China is more likely to use them?<br>

<br>
actually, up until a few years ago, Britian had hereditery peers in parliment.  Therefore, they were not a completely democratic country.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It isn't a standard, it's a fact. Religion can destabilize a country or a region.

<br>
Politics is a lot more to blame for the situation in the middle east.  Primarily due to world wide politics after world war 2 and the collapse of the british empire.  Interestingly enough, the governments of the middle east are more stable than most African or South American regions.  How do you explain this since these regions are not known for religeon based politics?  By the way, on related note, is Argentina ok to have nukes?  Democratically elected government with no religeous influence.  How about Mexico? <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

Edit - My main point is that we are currently very inconsistent in our application of foriegn policy.  We dont have any sort of rules on who or what constitutes a risk.  We stockpile weapons at the sametimes that we hold other people responsible for trying to build them.  We punish some countries and ignore others for the exact same acts.<br>
<br>
I actually wouldnt mind a policy such as the one you stated although I don't think it's the right one, as long as it was consistently applied to all countries, including ourselves.  What we're doing now is not making the world safer for our kids, it's just causing more resentment against the US.<br>
<br>
further edit - didnt mean to sound insulting by the way, hope you didnt take it that way.  I just disagreed with you. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

The world has become a much different ballgame.<br>
<br>
I also see alot of people bitching about how we should be dealing with north korea instead of Iraq. The only problem with that, is its hard to &quot;deal&quot; so to speak, with a country that has the ability to make Japan, China, or California glow in the dark.<br>
<br>
As for the whole government stability thing, its comming down to an arguement of semantics at this point, but I could assure you if bush used nukes in Afgahnistan, it would draw a large uproar around the world including alot of americans. Not to mention the taliban wasn't even worth dropping a bomb on. There would be no way congress would allow it in the first place anyway.<br>
<br>
And no one said its alright for Russia to have nukes, I also think I pointed that out in an earlier post. If you remember, all of Russia's(and the Us') nukes are a result from being in direct competition with each other. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fogelxanedu>Fogel Xanedu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Karnors</span><br>  Posts: 1126<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/18/03 12:40:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !</span><hr size=1> As for religion, the problem in the middle east is that in most of the religions, death in the service of your country is the ultimate reward, which of course gave birth to the endless supply of suicide bombers that are terrorizing israel and places abroad. <br>
<br>
The problem with this is much akin to the civil rights movement here in the US. Had Malcom X had a larger influence, and african americans started fighting back, it would have just turned the whole situation into a bloody mess that could very well still be going on today. One of the largest reasons for the success of the civil rights movement is that the african americans never fought back, therefore any opponents against african american equality eventually lost all the fuel in their arguements.<br>
<br>
However, with each new terrorist attack, there's always a new reason to continue hostilities against each other. I'd say that politics is also a huge factor. If people actually did some research I'd think they'd be shocked to find out how much the US has dabbled in the middle east, in an effort to get things going their way. Hell, I wonder how many americans still don't know it was the US that helped Saddam gain power in the first place. But eventually, both sides need to draw the line and say enough. Lately I'd say the Us(till sept 11 of course) was starting to back away from its dealings in the Mid east, but now things have been turned around full circle once more.<br>

sorry, but i DONT think the atom bomb was justified. nothing could ever justify it, not even when you measure &quot;justification&quot; on bodycounts. thats just naive.<br>

question: would you still drop the bomb if you had more knowledge about it, and japan had nukes too? im pretty sure you WOULDNT, since you have avoided russia ever since the invention of nukes. so dont try to justify your act of cowardness. cause thats what it was.<br>
<br>
also, you totally ignore the fact that those women are still giving birth to malformed children.<br>

i dont think anything justifies it, cause as you said yourself - the ones to use it are the ones that will get bombed, also the surrounding world WILL have to get involved in that madness. and i DONT think usa would win if they attacked with ground forces in japan. i think they would get slapped bigtime, much like vietnam.<br>

Be careful saying that about birth defects. That's only been shown in cases where the mother was already pregnant and was part of the primary exposure to the weapon. No one, anywhere, ever--including all of Japan, Novaya Zemla, and the Atolls--has ever shown a radiologically induced medical effect passed onto children conceived post-exposure. This mostly due to the fact that the exposure required to cause such damage to reproductive cells is well above the 100% sterilization threshold, and for severe damage that would propagate in that manner the results are almost always permanent sterility, or commonly death with 3 to 6 months.

<br>
Actually, you could easily justify it in terms of casualties.  A ground invasion of Japan would have cost far more lives on both sides.  A nuke is just another weapon.  It was used as the most efficient way of ending the war.  It's not different than the fire bombing of Drezden (sp?) or ther carpet bombing of vietnam.  It's an efficient weapon and was used to defeat an enemy with minimum casualties on the US side.  If that's not justification then you're blind.<br>

Probably wrong, but didnt you just justify the us of nukes?  I mean, if a ground invasion would have been defeated, what did you expect them to do?  Twiddle their thumbs for a while?  Here, you're a US general, you can either go for a ground invasion which will lead to the loss of tens of thousands of your troops, or you can use this new weapon which will end the war with far less US casualties.

If by &quot;we&quot; you mean the scandinivian nations then I hate to inform you that your contribution to the war effort against Germany was minimal.  This is in no way a negative comment on your country.  You had a low population and industrial base which meant your ability to contribute was low.  You fought bravely and for as long as you could, but it's pretty much historical fact that the US, Britian and Russia were the main contributors to the war effort in absolute terms.<br>
<br>
No offense, but you're coming off as a biased anti US fanatic.  While I happen to agree that US foriegn policy is lopsided and biased, I am also objective enough to not view all past US actions as negative, since most of them were quite positive.<br>
<br>
