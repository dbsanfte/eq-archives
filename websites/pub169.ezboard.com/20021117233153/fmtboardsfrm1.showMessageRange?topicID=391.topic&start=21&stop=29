When I got home a year ago, after going to the store, I immediately logged onto the internet to get that song.  I had the CD, but it was not with me at the time.  And I truly needed to hear it.  It was, and is not, by any means a new song.  It was written years ago.  I remember hearing it at a 4th of July celebration in the early 90's.  But that was the song I needed to hear.  <br>
<br>
My son, 5 at the time, heard the song so much over the next few days that he could sing it with me.  And I emailed Lee Greenwood, thanking him for writing a song that, while when he wrote it wouldn't hold a meaning for many that it does today, was still a wonderful song when it was released.  He sent me back an email (which still surprises me), and I still love to hear that song.  <br>
<br>
It's a very meaningful song, moreso after the events of a year ago.  And just remember everyone....They can't take that away...... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/udrackorespyritfyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DrackoreSpyritfyst</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 409<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/11/02 9:44:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Remember...</span><hr size=1> There isn't a lot more I can say that I haven't said before in many different &quot;tones&quot; regarding this subject.<br>
<br>
I was deployed in Saudi Arabia the day this happened, waiting to come home actually.  All flights in and out were cancelled and while I really wanted to get home to my son, I wasn't mad.  How could I be mad after so many people died?<br>
<br>
Then I saw the Saudi nationals.  Fine, upstanding people they were.  Kids and adults of all ages celebrating.  Made me sick to my stomach and made me wonder how the gate guards with the guns maintained enough composure to not blast the crap out of them.  I probably would have.<br>
<br>
I lost friends at the Pentagon and WTC a year ago.  Today is a very solemn day for me.  I find myself drained and just feeling completely &quot;blah&quot;.  I even called my ex-wife today so she could &quot;pick me up&quot;.  It sounds strange I know, but because of where I was and where she was, we did a lot of talking to make sure we were ok and such.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I can't blame anyone for not wanting to watch the ceremonies today and I can respect your reasons.  I myself, though, feel pulled to watch.  Just hearing one friend's name will no doubt stir a lot up, but if I don't watch I probably will regret it.<br>
<br>
Peace and good will to you all.<br>
Pat<br>

Resolve to remember those that searched 3 different sites for signs of life.<br>

In retrospect, my memory is somewhat hazy and things have unfortunately been clarified by people telling me what happened.  <br>
<br>
- I remember hearing what I thought was an explosion, walking to the window and looking out to see the smoke. <br>
- I remember being told not to leave the building as we were safer inside than outside in the debris. <br>
- I remember running outside when the buildings crashed with the thought I would/might die. <br>
- I remember the feeling of being covered in dirt &amp; other debris, and after realizing I understand how people who go through war feel. <br>
- I remember hearing the loud noise of human bodies hitting the ground. (Don't know if I heard them, but I associate the nois of things hitting the ground with bodies after the fact.)<br>
- I remember the chaos of thousand of people fleeing the scene, while EMT, Police, Fireman rushed towards the building.<br>
- I remember spending a week at friends/co-workers houses since I couldn't get my car, and even if I could the bridges were virtually closed. <br>
- I remember the conversations I had while waiting 3 + hours on line to give blood. <br>
- I remember a month of funerals for friends, co-workers etc.<br>
<br>
All in All 9-11-2001 will live with me forever as the single scariest moment in my life. I promised that it would change me. I would help others, appreciate life, be a better person. I didn't change me. I'm still basically the same person I was, and the only difference is I work out of NJ now. (No more city tax = good).<br>
<br>
Ultimately the stories being told are a wonderful thing. It allows many to reflect back on this painful memory and try to recapture some of our dedicaiton to be become better. It allows us to reflect that on a day where most any sane person would have run away from what people thought was sure death, some people ran towards it, in doing so they sacrificed their own lives. Remember that hundreds of thousands of people were withint a few city blocks of that disaster, and only 3000 died, around 400 of those deaths were people trying to help out. To me, death is never a reason to celebrate, but heroism is. 400 people gave their life, so thousands can live. Sept 11, should be a national holiday to honour fireman, police officers everywhere.<br>
<br>
As a side note those same Fireman and Police officers have not received a raise in several years. A 1st year fireman qualifies for food stamps in NYC. <p>Cereberial Cortex<BR>Illusionist<BR>Desperate Measures<BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucereberial.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cereberial</A> at: 9/11/02 4:25:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ugrimmbaldisstormwolfe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimmbaldis Stormwolfe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/14/02 8:56:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Remember...</span><hr size=1> /bump<br>

Strong and passionate, I tend to be misunderstood, sometimes even feared. I don't want to fight, I don't want to cause trouble, all I ask is a little love, a little peace, and hot naked chicks massaging me with oil at my command. I also want FIMBLE to stay away from my shoes because he gets them sticky.

If I had only known I would have saluted you while I had the chance. Personally, I am no where near New York. I am in Chicago. But here in Chicago we also have a pretty tall building (and potential target) in the Sears Tower. Everytime I drive into the city I imagine what it would be like to simply not have it there anymore. And then to imagine the devastation downtown if it were to fall. It makes me tear up. Like everyone else said, my heart goes out to you and the rest of New York City for having to endure this senseless act of murder. I remember being told about it as I came into the office. Someone said &quot;Hey did you hear a couple of planes hit the world trade center?&quot; And Im like &quot;Ok...and? Whats the punchline?&quot; Then I went to the kitchen and saw the live feed of both towers on fire. And I went into a state of shock. I remember saying out loud something really really stupid. I said &quot;Well...I bet this will be bigger than Oklahoma.&quot; I still feel bad for being so insensitive. We were eventually evacuated from downtown and I went home. All I wanted to do was keep the TV on and play EQ all day. For once EQ wasnt able to hide my pain and shock, like it usually does in regular situations. All I know now is I will never be able to, nor want to, ever forget any detail. Certain people need to be brought to justice and I want it to be sooner than later. That is all.<br>
