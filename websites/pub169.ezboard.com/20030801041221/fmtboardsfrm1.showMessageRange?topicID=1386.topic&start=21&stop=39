Though I think if he would pull his head out of his ass and take a look around the world he might realize how good we as Americans (assuming he is indeed American, of course) have it. Whether or not you agree with the reasons our country goes to war, the fact remains that our Active Duty members are always there ready to die for our Country so that we may stay out of harms way. <br>

I have and always will have the utmost respect for any member of ANY armed forces. Carry on soldiers, sailors, airman, and marines. Be it known that your duty to your country will never go unnoticed. <br>

If your an EQ player and you have access to a computer you bet your last dollar many will be checking out the sites which mean the most to them and at the sametime email and communicating with their friends and family.  Your post here Caly does mean alot to those deployed on operations that may have a chance to surf the net.<br>
It doesnt matter much to many military members if ppl are for or against a war what matters the most to them is that ppl understand, respect and appreciate the sacafices that member of the military make to ensure the standards of the world is maintained.  We all have a job to do when we serve in the military and for most it is not up to us to decide what we will back or wont.  We just do the job which is tasked to us hoping that we accomplish our mission and come home safely.  When we see post or receive letters from ppl we dont know but are praying for us and honor our jobs we are filled with a great deal of pride for it means our job is important and so are we.<br>
As a military member Caly I would just like to say thank you for thinking about those deployed and also to the many others who felt the need to post a positive note here too.<br>

Taser, you are a tastless whining idiot.  And same goes fot the other two anon posters.  Cal made a beautiful post just to pray for those, wether they agree or not are over risking their lives for the sake of their country.<br>
<br>
For you to come ina nd ruin the post the post is moronic, at best.  If you don't agree with the war...make a seperate post whining about how we should not be over there.  Don't ruin Cal's post here and interupt a GOOD thing.<br>

Thanks from all those of us who are in the Balkans. While we are not in the &quot;Sand Box&quot; as most call it, we are deployed in the former country of Yugoslovia, and could be called up to move into the Middle East. Your message is recieved and appreciated. <br>
<br>
Those of us deployed under &quot;Operation Joint Forge&quot; and &quot;Enduring Freedom&quot; are fighting on the second front against terrorism.<br>
<br>
Myself and those here with me can't wait to get back home.<br>
<br>
Again, thank you for your thoughts and kind words. Good luck in game.<br>

Well, here's a link that explains it:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://people.howstuffworks.com/smart-bomb.htm" target="top">How guided bombs work.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
When my dad went over to the gulf the first time, I was very proud of him, more than proud, it increased the amount of respect I had for him as well.  Because of an older injury he can actually be in the regular troops, he's a supply officer, but he works hard at it, and he does a good job.  He's to old now to go to Iraq, but if he could I guarantee that he'd do it.  <br>
<br>
If I could go, I would.  In a heartbeat.  My dad taught me to shoot and I'm a damn good shot.  I'd join the marines and become a sniper if I could.  <br>
<br>
In any case, how many more 9/11's do you want to happen?  How 'bout a 9/11 but instead of a plane, they use a nuclear bomb at the super bowl, or in the middle of downtown LA?  The thing about nuclear weapons is that other than the first time we used them, no one who has them <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wants</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to use them.  Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden would use one if they thought the opportunity was good enough.  Not only that, but any bomb they had would probably be an older one, and therefore a 'dirty' bomb, leaving the target location radioactive for the next thousand years.<br>
<br>
So where do you live?  The next time you think about dissing the armed forces in Iraq, imagine your neighborhood being a wasteland for the next eon, or about your muscles ripping themselves apart while your organs melt.....or if you survive, think about having the permanent side effects messing you up for the rest of your life.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if Iraq doesn't have chemical weapons, why are the Armed Forces finding counter agents?<br>

People keep saying &quot;May God be with our soldiers.&quot; Usually the God that they speak of is the Christian God, and any Christian knows that the teachings of the new testament expressly forbid murder and violence towards other humans, regardless of reason.<br>
<br>
The US forces are killing other humans. If you believe the government's twist on it, then it's for freedom. Why is freedom - a word used to describe a conceptual way of living - more important than God's will? If you're a Christian that understands the religion that you follow, then I can't possibly understand by any stretch why you'd say things like this.<br>
<br>
Witnessing such irrational mass religious confusion leads to believe that from the time we're young and have to salute the flag and recite the allegiance every morning in school, we are brainwashed to believe that our government and God go hand in hand.<br>
<br>
I believe the correct thing to say would be &quot;May God forgive our soldiers and those that they kill. May God forgive us all for putting out preferred way of life above the purpose that we were birthed into this world for.&quot; Or something along those lines if you wish to express an appropriate religious sentiment. This &quot;May God be with our soldiers as they massacre the confused 15 to 25 year old males that are being forced to defend their country because they had the misfortune of being born into a nation with a different government with different ideas than ours.&quot; just makes zero sense to me, though.<br>

The God I spoke of in my original post is whatever God, or leader, you choose to believe in.  <br>
<br>
I do not know how I feel right now about men and women and children being hurt and killed in this.  I am at odds with myself over the fact that women will be giving birth to children who will never hear their fathers voices.  To children who, right now, are wondering when mommy and daddy are coming home, and not realizing that they are home, but in a coffin.  I cry at times thinking about this.  But, I can't stop this war.  I didn't start this war.  I can support the troops of the country I'm in (The USA), and pray that they have a safe return...knowing that many won't.  And it breaks my heart.  <br>
<br>
Until yesterday, I supported the troops, but wasn't fully behind the reasoning of the war that we started.  Until the news came up with the information that white powder substance had been found, along with hundreds of vials of anitdote.  Whether that white powder will be found to be a biological terrorism drug that was going to be used on people or not....I think now, we've started this.  We need to finish it.  Many will lose their lives, and there is never an excuse for that.  But, what if, in the end, we end up saving hundreds of thousands.  Is it worth it?  I can't, and won't answer that.  But somewhere, somehow, I would hope it all balances out.<br>
<br>
Whether people support the war or not is their choice, but I do feel you should support the troops...many who signed up did so for college money, or as a career learning choice....not to necessarily fight in a war.<br>

<br>
In polite society it was customary not to speak of religion or politics at the dinner table to avoid offence.  As someone who has strong political views I always thought that was a weak position, one that ignored the importance of both of these subjects, and the need to debate.<br>
<br>
But it now makes a lot of sense.  We are a community. But the thing that we have in common is a game called Everquest, and for some we have a love of roleplaying.  <br>
<br>
Lets not pretend that we have much else in common.  We dont have a shared history, or shared culture. <br>
 <br>
There is a very simple and basic example.  The USA named the terrorist attack 9/11, it made sense to them.  But to most of the world that means 9th November.  We cant even agree how dates should work.  Lets not try and discuss complex political and philosophical issues.  <br>
<br>
Our first poster said that that these people were fighting for our freedom - we might not all agree with that view of what this war is about.  I shall not say why I think we went to war.<br>
<br>
We might all agree with the first posters first sentiment. Let us pray that no one else dies.  Lets hope there are no more deaths of Americans, my fellow Brits or Iraqis.<br>

<br>
<br>
The average age of the military man is 19 years. He is a short haired, <br>
tight-muscled kid who, under normal circumstances is considered by <br>
society as half  man, half boy. Not yet dry behind the ears, not old <br>
enough to buy a beer, but old enough to die for his country.  He never <br>
really cared much for work and he would rather wax his own car than wash <br>
his father's; but he has never collected unemployment either. <br>
<br>
He's a recent High School graduate; he was probably an average student, <br>
pursued some form of sport activities, drives a ten year old jalopy, and <br>
has a steady girlfriend that either broke up with him when he left, or <br>
swears to be waiting when he returns from half a world away. <br>
<br>
He listens to rock and roll or hip-hop or rap or jazz or swing and 155 <br>
mm Howitzers.  He is 10 or 15 pounds lighter now than when he was at <br>
home because he is working or fighting from before dawn to well after <br>
dusk.  He has trouble spelling, thus letter writing is a pain for him, <br>
but he can field strip a rifle in 30 seconds and reassemble it in less <br>
time in the dark. <br>
<br>
He can recite to you the nomenclature of a machine gun or grenade <br>
launcher and use either one effectively if he must.  He digs foxholes <br>
and latrines and  can apply first aid like a professional.  He can march <br>
until he is told to stop or stop until he is told to march.  He obeys <br>
orders instantly and without  hesitation, but he is not without spirit <br>
or individual dignity. <br>
<br>
He is self-sufficient. He has two sets of fatigues: he washes one and <br>
wears the other. He keeps his canteens full and his feet dry.  He <br>
sometimes forgets to brush his teeth, but never to clean his rifle.  He <br>
can cook his own meals, mend his own clothes, and fix his own hurts. If <br>
you're thirsty, he'll share his  water with you; if you are hungry, his <br>
food.  He'll even split his ammunition with you in the midst of battle <br>
when you run low. <br>
<br>
He has learned to use his hands like weapons and weapons like they were <br>
his hands. He can save your life - or take it, because that is his job. <br>
He will often do twice the work of a civilian, draw half the pay and <br>
still find ironic humor in it all. He has seen more suffering and death <br>
then he should have in his short  lifetime. <br>
<br>
He has stood atop mountains of dead bodies, and helped to create them. <br>
He has wept in public and in private, for friends who have fallen in <br>
combat and is  unashamed.  He feels every note of the National Anthem <br>
vibrate through his body while at rigid attention, while tempering the <br>
burning desire to 'square-away' those around him who haven't bothered to <br>
stand, remove their hat, or even stop talking. In an odd twist, day in <br>
and day out, far from home,  he defends their right to be disrespectful. <br>
<br>
Just as did his Father, Grandfather, and Great-grandfather, he is paying <br>
the price for our freedom.  Beardless or not, he is not a boy.  He is <br>
the American Fighting Man that has kept this country free for over 200 <br>
years. He has asked nothing in return, except our friendship and <br>
understanding. Remember him, always, for he has earned our respect and <br>
admiration with his blood. <br>

But it surely ignores the fact that a soldier is a tool to be used for strategic political ends.  If the american people through their political leadership thought to take away the freedom of the press or the freedom to demonstrate I am sure that we would see the soldiers on the street enforcing that will.  <br>
<br>
You may believe that soldiers work for good.  I am sure that Saddams forces think likewise.  And I will leave to the historians a lesson from history, about a particular military corp that felt that they were fighting a desperate battle for the survival of their race.<br>
<br>
Its about perspective.  One country doesnt have the right to invade another without international approval. <br>
<br>
Remember it was the CIA who helped Saddam's old boss get into power.  Without American support he would never had got there.  It was the USA who then made sure he had the weapons to fight the Iranians. You didnt do a very good job then, I cant see you doing any better this time.<br>
<br>
I hope all the soldiers get back safely, but that doesnt mean that we need to support this war.<br>
