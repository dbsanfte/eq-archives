Lots of players have purchased accounts and come to the community asking to be given a chance to be merited on &quot;new ownership&quot; not name or reputation. And for the most part, folks here seem to be willing to be open minded. <br>
<br>
(The exception being Evil Raiders of course)<br>
<br>
IF Flirter left EQ and ebayed and IF a member of Prophecy did buy that account or any other one, so what?<br>
<br>
My question to you, is really what motive do you have for even beginning this? You left the server, but you still can't seem to stay gone. <br>
<br>
I find it funny that just last week you were in the prophecy channel all palsy walsy with folks. Obviously someone gave you the password, so someone affiliated with PoTC trusted you. <br>
<br>
Here is how you repay that trust, by trying to stir up a completely unfounded shitstorm. <br>
<br>
I'd be inclined to look at last weeks little encounter and then this and see the activities of another cellar dweller who got his baby pride hurt and since nobody wants to play with him anymore he's decided to throw stones. <br>
<br>
Did someone say something nasty to you Aelister, did some mean person hurt your little pride?<br>
<br>
Now, is it true...<br>
<br>
You actually left MT because you're such a shitpump that nobody in their right mind would guild or hunt with you? I heard a rumor that you're actually a 15 year old boy with one hand permantly glued to his dick. <br>
<br>
I had no respect for you the day Nynnia brought you into Faveo and I had hoped to leave you behind when I moved on. Since that day, you have done nothing but validate my opinion.<br>
<br>
Knowing the calibre of the folks in PoTC I'm guessing this little attempt to derail them is going to fall rather flat.<br>
<br>
You're a sad strange little man Aelister, and you have my pity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aelistersurcoffici>AelisterSurcoffici</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 597<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/14/03 2:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1340.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ....</span><hr size=1> Im not on MT with my necromancer, he permanently moved.  My shadowknight is still on morell thule.  <br>
<br>
My question comes from a phone conversation I had with a member recently where they told me about a few cases of it going on.  I am against ebaying, in full and I like to know which people to avoid on any character I play.<br>
<br>
To the caliber of PotC people.  I like the vast majority of the guild. Ive also recently told the guild that I think they could do fairly well in time on PoP raids because I know most of the people know their @#%$.  Only a handful that I dont care for.  Im trying to find out who the ebayers are.  As we have argued in the past~I dont hold the actions of an individual against an entire guild where you do. I am however able to feel let down by people when they have expressed a dislike for ebaying and have said they wouldnt be associated with it...only to find that they are.  Ill point it out that there are a handful of ebays there.  If/when I find out who bought who, Ill list that too.<br>
<br>
As for why I left the server with my necromancer, there is a post specifically for that~though I had not played him in months prior to transfering him~and I had not played much in general.  When he left, he wore a guild tag.<br>
<br>
As for validation your opinion~I really dont give 2 shits about your opinion.  This is our first contact since you left Faveo.  Up until that guild, I had never heard of you.  I had never seen you anywhere.  You were just another name on a server with thousands of them.  No impact on my existance whatsoever.<br>
<br>
As for someone else throwing stones~/shrug.  I havent had much time to pop on in the last week or so, so I dunno who is doing what and where.<br>
<br>
Quite the amusing little tirade though Noreya.  Let me guess, when unable to make more than a small handful of points or raise but a breif few questions you feel the need to attack the person behind the keys so it looks like you have more to say than you do? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lefusgar>Lefusgar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.geocities.com/lefusgar/images/8bit_lef.txt" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/14/03 2:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1340.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ....</span><hr size=1> I think it's all fine and dandy that you don't like EBayers.

<br>
And again I think it's fine that you don't wanna associate with any ebayers, that's your choice and again nothing to make anyone upset...<br>
<br>
But to say that you wish to publish a full listing of EBayers  from a guild you aren't a member of, on a server you keep an alt on, and the only reasoning I saw was:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I like to know which people to avoid on any character I play.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
makes absolutely no sense at all.<br>
<br>
If you don't want to associate with EBayers then find a little house in Qeynos and just lock the door behind you cause I would imagine a third of the people (more or less) any of us speak to on a daily basis in this game have some association with buying/selling plat or characters.<br>
<br>
I'd love to see the list of EBayers from every guild but your own on your new server, cause we all know you are from the one guild in all of EQ that has never had an inkling of dealing with EBay from a single character to ever wear the tag over their head right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aelistersurcoffici>AelisterSurcoffici</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 599<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/14/03 4:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1340.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ....</span><hr size=1> guild I am in on other server with my necro has only been around a few months~and dont really see any ebayers around in it.  Now there were a few people to app to my necros guild and I voted against them for being ebayed...and thankfully they proved that people who buy characters arent quite as useful as those who dont and they got denied.<br>
<br>
As for my sk being my alt...its actually my main.  The necro I only play when I feel like doing some raiding.  When Im wanting to grind/adventure or just screw around Im on my SK.<br>
<br>
Now...someone sent me a present that I found amusing within 20 minutes of my post.  Lemme share it in full.   I was also warned to expect all of prophecy to fight me.<br>
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
it's well known in the guild that Aleayna (Guild Leader) is ebayed, and that skadi bought her from someone in Triune, openly admits it too in their private forums. If you search Aleayna on google, you'll find her old listing in that guild. Plus, Skadi began playing in Nov of 2002, no way she could have a 65 enchanter by the time she showed up in Faveo hehe<br>
<br>
Skadi does not have the knowledge of the game to have ever been in Triune back then...LOL....Her 65 wiz is likely also ebayed since she has such a desire to be viewed as uber she would have bragged about Nanya long ago. <br>
<br>
What suxxors is she didnt know how to play the char, let alone her Main druid, or how to charm, etc.. yet she constantly brags about how high and uber her chars are... LOL <br>
<br>
This all from a woman, who when i first raided with her, asked me to use Banishment on a summoned mob that was the raid's target for drops <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  rofl I told her i didn't own the spell, but if she wants the corpse to poof, by all means i will go buy it now *grin*<br>
<br>
The hypocrisy of that guild is why i left, rules they made were broken for her friends, she did not want to hear suggestions from older players if they were in conflict with her pretense of being the all knowing &quot;i have a 65 enchanter and i know what im doing&quot; uberness. Let her fall on her face, it's a guild of her buddies and their alts, i don't need the Drama *wink*<br>
<br>
Another interesting thing is that Jaidin is portrayed on her personal website as if he's one of her own personal characters... wonder who Jaidin really is, considering that character is also admitted as being previously ebayed, even on their general forums welcoming him as raid leader? lol <br>
<br>
So, potc is a ebayed guild full of alts, Flirter (Kudamor's ebayed toy), Finben (was Ludes' toy), Aleayna &amp; Nanya (Skadi's ebayed alts), and who knows how many others?... i found it was a guild lead by some idiot who bought her characters, but had no clue of game mechanics... instead of ripping every other website for strats, buying plat and characters, trying to make a 'name' for themselves as the next uber guild... hehe<br>
<br>
Not everyone in the guild is trash, there's some really nice folks still in it. Honest, decent, kind and wonderful people. Nothing the guild leader does or says can change that. Just ignore it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>

Now I will agree with the bottom paragraph.  There are some really nice folks still in it.

Aelister, the real point of all of this is that you recently got slapped down in PoTC chat where previously you'd been greeted as a friend, and like all little boys that get snubbed now that you can't come back into the club house, you're standing outside trying to call people out.<br>
<br>
You and some other sad little shitpump have sat down and pooled what prattle you both have and tried to pack it into a rant.<br>
<br>
If your own opinion and statement had held any weight at all, you wouldn't have had to rely on quoting someone else in order to try and seem justified. Instead, you barf up some nameless source in an attempt add some credit to this empty shitpot you've been trying to brew.<br>
<br>
I do agree with you on one thing though, PoTC is going to take a side against you. I'm looking forward to seeing ANY names at all that stand on your side.<br>
<br>
As for personal attacks. It seems the bulk of your rant is a personal attack on Aleanya. I'm just answering in kind. You're a single voice in the wind, and like all small breeses you're likely going to fade away without any real impact on anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ianluas>Ianluas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/14/03 9:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1340.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ....</span><hr size=1> /cheers to you Nor, you tell him <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faate>Faate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 420<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/15/03 4:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1340.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   lknkln</span><hr size=1> avoiding ebayers is very immature aelister...<br>
<br>
Some of the best players I know use characters theyve bought and/or have sold theirs in the past...<br>
<br>
Hell, I've bought a (1) char and I enjoy myself and play to my class's fullpotential as far as anyone else is concearned, if I didnt I wouldnt be appreciated in my guild and/or groups...<br>
<br>
Its not ebayers you need to avoid, its bad players, you cant just put a whole group of people in the 'off limits' basket, based on a few bad experiences you read on safehouse 3 years ago because a cleric didnt know a ch chain or some bullshit. <br>
<br>
I think the point of my whle argument is, I feel insulted that you'd willingly avoid me, based on the fact I have bought a character (even knowing I have played since beta and leveled numerous characters to 50, 60, 65 on multiple occasions across multiple servers). Instead of on the basis that if I were an arsehole/bad player/gangsta homosexual rabbit muff-diver...(all of which i am, obviously, ebay scum i must be).<br>
<br>
Its immature and in all honesty quite cognitivly dissonant to state these beleifs and still play a game and associate with these people (and you do, its so wide spread).<br>
<br>

<br>
I won't really confirm anything you have said, but I will say that the player who leveled Jaidin up to 65 is the one that is playing him now. The details are simply none of your business. You can't dispute what I have said here, so don't bother trying... Jaidin is my RL hubby, so I do believe I would know.<br>
<br>
As for the others in Prophecy, I can honestly say I haven't met a single one that I didn't like or that didn't know what they were doing in game. Not a single one that wouldn't bend over backwards to help one another. Jaid and I have become RL friends with a few in the guild, and I find this entire thread done in poor taste. You have no right really airing Skadi's private information that you have here on these boards. Its no one's business except hers.<br>

You can see the bitterness in his description of Aleayna. He/she/it obviously got his/her/its feelings hurt and decided to attempt to try and make Prophecy look bad under his/her/its “Ebay Banner”.<br>
<br>
I’m glad Noreya called this person on it. Kinda funny how the first post says “Hmmm...Guess what I heard...but I could be wrong.” The second post shows the deep down poison that’s trying to hurt someone. I don’t know you from atom myself. But I think we all know the bitter little passive aggressive type with ulterior motives trying to start a chitstorm. Here is a thought, what ever your real issue is get over it and move on and go away. People who read this board are not stupid. And this kind of behavior can get you sent to the most hated board quickly. The more you post the more you show.<br>
<br>
It’s better to be quiet and thought a fool. Then open your mouth and remove all doubt.<br>

I believe then, being as it is a private forum, it's private business and it means you should keep your mouth shut. <br>
<br>
If you don't like a person, don't talk to them or group/guild with them. *shrugs* Seems pretty simple to me. It's not like Skadi is hated serverwide, obviously she would not have EVERY SINGLE person in this thread supporting her if she was. I have talked to Skadi on a few occasions and have found her very nice and helpful, also appreciative of help given her.<br>

Who gives a rats ass if anyone in PotC ebayed. They are nice people and even if they did ebay (which is their business) they seem to play those classes well. I have found Skadi to be a wonderful person who really cares about her guildys including their RL problems. If she buys toons once again its her business. I have grouped with all of her alts just about and have never had any troubles with her &quot;knowing&quot; the class. I also think you have something against her personally and your just using this as an excuse to bash her. Get over yourself and get over what ever has your underoos in a wad and go on with your game and let them play theirs.<br>

I would say actually read the post but I think I didnt make myself clear.  On the post that goes on about named people, I said that something that I found amusing was sent to me.  My post and what was sent to me is seperated by a line of ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.  Everything that was between those lines was sent to me and not my words.  Ive yet to attack anyone specifically.<br>
<br>
As for speculation about being snubbed by em~never tried to join em.  Its not just PoTC thats caught my eye, I know there are others.  I just dont know who yet.<br>
<br>
As for a conflict in a channel~I shared words with one person for about 2 minutes about the strength of a raid mob and what the mob can be done with.  Oooo.  So dramatic.  Nice attempt though Nor.<br>
<br>
Dont worry.  Ebay is my crusade.  I cant stand it.  Im never one who thinks the easy way out is the way to go and thats how I see it.  Im not alone in it either.  My EZbox has gotten a handful of messages of people spilling who is ebayed and who isnt~just havent gone through it all yet.  You dont have to agree with my crusade against Ebay.  Thats fine with me.  It comes down to this~I play on 2 servers.  I have started on Ebayers on each server.  Ive yet to personally attack ANYONE.  I try not to, since I dont know who is behind the keyboards.  To be honest, I think it slightly pathetic when its done~but then thats my opinion and noone has to agree with my opinion.  It is my own.<br>
<br>
~~Think I am going to repost the section that was sent to me so it can be clarified what my words are and what someone elses words were.  Im gonna ask them if I have permission to post their name as well.  The next post on here will be what was sent to me by another person~~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aelistersurcoffici>AelisterSurcoffici</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 602<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/15/03 5:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1340.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   THIS is what was sent to me.  These are anothers words.</span><hr size=1> it's well known in the guild that Aleayna (Guild Leader) is ebayed, and that skadi bought her from someone in Triune, openly admits it too in their private forums. If you search Aleayna on google, you'll find her old listing in that guild. Plus, Skadi began playing in Nov of 2002, no way she could have a 65 enchanter by the time she showed up in Faveo hehe<br>
<br>
Skadi does not have the knowledge of the game to have ever been in Triune back then...LOL....Her 65 wiz is likely also ebayed since she has such a desire to be viewed as uber she would have bragged about Nanya long ago. <br>
<br>
What suxxors is she didnt know how to play the char, let alone her Main druid, or how to charm, etc.. yet she constantly brags about how high and uber her chars are... LOL <br>
<br>
This all from a woman, who when i first raided with her, asked me to use Banishment on a summoned mob that was the raid's target for drops  rofl I told her i didn't own the spell, but if she wants the corpse to poof, by all means i will go buy it now *grin*<br>
<br>
The hypocrisy of that guild is why i left, rules they made were broken for her friends, she did not want to hear suggestions from older players if they were in conflict with her pretense of being the all knowing &quot;i have a 65 enchanter and i know what im doing&quot; uberness. Let her fall on her face, it's a guild of her buddies and their alts, i don't need the Drama *wink*<br>
<br>
Another interesting thing is that Jaidin is portrayed on her personal website as if he's one of her own personal characters... wonder who Jaidin really is, considering that character is also admitted as being previously ebayed, even on their general forums welcoming him as raid leader? lol <br>
<br>
So, potc is a ebayed guild full of alts, Flirter (Kudamor's ebayed toy), Finben (was Ludes' toy), Aleayna &amp; Nanya (Skadi's ebayed alts), and who knows how many others?... i found it was a guild lead by some idiot who bought her characters, but had no clue of game mechanics... instead of ripping every other website for strats, buying plat and characters, trying to make a 'name' for themselves as the next uber guild... hehe<br>
<br>
Not everyone in the guild is trash, there's some really nice folks still in it. Honest, decent, kind and wonderful people. Nothing the guild leader does or says can change that.

Oh please say the post where you asking Laurylle if you could join our guild is still in our officers forum.... ok well I will keep looking but as of now I cant find it, but I do remember having a super long conversation with you about you joining our guild on your SK. I asked you if you planned on telling Nynnia that you were not still out of the game and that you were playing an alt just not you main that was tagged in Faveo. Since, I knew her policy about officers of Faveo being in another guild. You said you didn’t want to tell her and that you were not going to tell anyone but a select few of who you really were. <br>
