<br>
see now that just makes no sense to me!  I can quote hunderds of reverse acts of violence.  The 2 black men who raped an 11 year old girl here in Memphis and had Public Enemy playing in the car they abducted her into.  etc etc  So, now the majority of America is supposed to believe a Public Enemy cd incites hate crimes???   <br>
<br>
3 white guys beat and killed a white college student for being gay, one of the attackers was wearing a silver cross around his neck,  so the holy cross is now a warning sign of hate and racism.  Remove all crosses in the U.S. because they've now become a sign of racism running rampant in our country.  The cross at your church must be taken down because &quot;some&quot; people might commit acts of racism while displaying the cross.<br>
<br>
All of these things sound ridiculous but that's what you're saying about a flag, a symbol, be it good or bad.  As illustrated above any symbol can be misused, that doesn't mean we throw it away.  We throw away the immoral, uneducated, racist people who committ these crimes against others.<br>
<br>
I'm done arguing this point, items and symbols don't make people fill with hatred. They're just hateful people who happen to be associated with that symbol and pointing out racial crimes does nothing to convince me that an item led to that attack, it's simply a secondary factor in a world of racism and hatred of the unknown or misunderstood.<br>
<br>
 You'll find racism and hatecrimes in backwoods Georgia or in upstate New York, the assumptions made in these threads about what shows a person is racist simply convinces me that EVERYONE has some predisposed notions towards certain persons or objects which makes us ALL just a teeny bit racist or biased toward one thing or another.<br>

At some point you started confusing your personal rights with government actions.  You are talking about individual actions.  You most certainly have the right to display the confed flag in whatever manner you choose, just like someone else can wear a Malcolm X hat.  This thread however is about government actions.<br>
<br>
The government of Georgia, a government meant to represent the people of Georgia has chosen as its flag a symbol that is an extremely strong negative image to many of its residents.  That's what this argument is about.  Before some ignorant rodo responds with the usual reply of 'if they don't like it, they can leave' I would like to ask you how you would feel if the government of Georgia adopted the Malcolm X symbol as its flag.  It's their home, just like it is yours.  They have a right to a state flag that they can be proud of, just like you.  <br>
<br>
I can definitely see your side of things but I can also see theirs.  While I really dislike political correctness in general, I would have to go with their side on this one.  Too many idiots, both black and white, associate the confed flag with slavery and racism.  Right or wrong, it should not be the symbol of a government that represents all of its people equally and fairly.<br>
<br>
And just to repeat, I completely see your side of the argument.  I understand you don't see it as a racist symbol, I understand you are proud of your heritage, I agree that you have a right to display and be proud of the stars and bars.  The government however does not have rights, it has duties to its people.  So I dont mean to imply that you're a racist or your heritage is that of racism, my apologies if you misunderstood me.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I'm just happy I'm not the one who has to make this decision, because both sides have some really good points. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

The link you added was a case of blatant overreaction to a situation that should never have been offensive since the term niggardly has nothing to do with any sort of racial bias.  The Confed flag was and is used as a symbol of white supremacy and racism.  The uneducated people are the ones who use it in this manner and I would suggest that they're the ones who proud southerners should be upset at.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, they have a very valid argument that a symbol so strongly associated with racism should not be on a government flag.  I'm not saying you don't, but to call them uneducated is simply unfair.<br>

<br>
Of course slavery was a minor reason of the civil war.  The best reason, imho, but a minor reason.<br>
<br>
The confederate flag seems to be a flag that stands for racial intolerance and innocent ignorance.  Malcolm X seems to be degenerating into the same cesspool.<br>
<br>
I would say that anyone who wants to state their views should be allowed to wear either symbol, but our government should show acceptance and tolerance of all races.  Or at least start to.<br>

Again, it can be used as a symbol of racism, true.  It can also be a completely valid symbol of history and culture.  People being offended by something that, some of the time, is used as a symbol of racism is wrong.  Depriving people of the right to take pride in their history and culture is even more wrong.<br>

So again, a question to you.  Would you object to Germany using the swastika as its flag?  What if they claimed they were only doing it for the symbol's roots as a good luck symbol and ward against evil?<br>

Political correctness is a joke because niggardly really isnt an offensive term.  The confed flag was and IS an accepted symbol for racist groups even if a lot of other people dont see it that way. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

I dont see too many other white power groups using cajun food as a symbol... <br>
<br>
And how you connect NAFTA and affirmative action together is beyond me... <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

I think you hit the nail on the head.  Some would rather sell out and avoid the grief, others would fight for what they think is right. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=anonandproud>Anon and Proud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 281<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/14/03 3:33:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=520.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmm</span><hr size=1> glanced over some of this but just wanted to add something that was discussed midway through.  the nazi symbol was a spiritual symbol used in India long before Christianity came into existence.  That symbol is also found in China, and many areas in South East Asia predominantly in Thailand and Indonesia.  <br>
<br>
Recently many little dolls were removed from the american market because they contained the symbol which many found offensive.  There was no intention to be racially antagonistic and it was an honest mistake.  that symbol continues to adorn buildings in many of the areas i mentioned.  <br>
<br>
the chinese manufacturers pulled the product from european and american markets because of the sensitivity of the situation and probably the fact they would have had a hard time selling it.  however, the point is they symbols can mean different things for different people but one must also be sensitive to others feelings to a degree.  <br>
<br>
its fine to fly the flag in your homes and such ofcourse depending on your reasons for it.  however when it is supposed to represent a larger group, sometimes it is necessary to take the sensitivity of the people who live in the region as a whole.  like someone else said, its just a flag and it means many things.  you asked why people cant see the historical aspect of it.. but there is another historical aspect associated with it regardless of the whole history of it.  just like the swastika had more than a thousand years of history on the symbol, many now see it as a symbol of hate instead of spirituality.  <br>
<br>
out of curiousity, was there a vote in the region?  just curious.<br>
