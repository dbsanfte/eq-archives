<br>
     I find it greatly amusing that you keep saying that Truyth did not train DR on purpose. I guess 5 people hallucinated all together, at the exact time, even when we're in different time zones, especially when one of our group members lives in Australia!! <br>
<br>
     First off, as i have said in my previous posts, i was OMW to DR, when i first noticed ER heading into POJ. I said to my group to watch it because i had read on the rants board that ER trains DR often to take over that camp. I was enroute to DR, with Spirit of eagle, which is a see invis, lev, sow spell, and i see ER members standing in one corner invis. Note to sunmoon-Just because you are invis, you are still there. I had to point that out to you because it might have been too hard for you to comprehend. I really wish i had kept a log of that day, then i would have solid proof of your presense, along with your entire 10 boxed guild. <br>
<br>
     As crystilla stated previously, it was Truyth that trained DR. i was standing in Predr, completely ready to solo or harmony of nature(aggro reduction spell) through the mobs to get to my group who was in DR, when truyth runs past me, hitting all 4 mobs in pre DR and runs into DR. oh no, but he did not stop there. He continued to run past the group, hitting all and aggroing all of the DR mobs, runs back to our group, and intentionally FD's infront of us. I was one of the persons who died, due to your stupidity, and i was enroute back to DR to collect my mangled body, because its faster than waiting for it to pop in GY. I knew i shouldnt have a problem going back down there since crystilla was there to help us out. Druvtal was also there, naked, with crystilla (who was fully dressed ). Lo and behold, in comes another train from Truyth, yet again, which leaves a 2nd cold and mangled body of mine. <br>
<br>
     Not only do you not have the guts to admit your wrong ways, you pretend in your peasized brain that these problems do no exist. You think that what you are doing is correct and everyone else is wrong just because they do not see things the Sunmoon way. I think its funny that you cannot answer my posts. I think its funny that you can only tell Crystilla she's wrong, when she was there at the event, and saw it happening with her own eyes. <br>
<br>
     You ask for the truth, and i have laid the truth out for you to see. Now, if only you can speak truth in return, we'd be getting somewhere. However, i wont be expecting a post back from you because you probably will read only 1 line and tell me that i'm wrong, and that what i said is not true.<br>
<br>
     Please look up truth in the dictionary. Oh wait, you probably wouldnt know how to use one, so let me make it easy for you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>truth</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  :<br>
Conformity to fact or actuality. <br>

<br>
You claim that the members in your guild are not all you (sunmoon). You claim that most of you live close by. If you all know one another, how come no one else has shown up in your defense? If in fact that the only 2 people that are banned will post, Why are they not smart enough to go post on a public computer? (ie. internet cafes, libraries, The Wiz)<br>
<br>
Its too bad SOE wont do a thing about your account(s) cause they probably make a shitload of money from you since you own so many accounts. 10 accounts = $100+ a month = $1200+ a year. Dont you have better things to spend your money on? Unless of course you like living in a lie, telling yourself everyday that you are correct, and everyone else is not. <br>
<br>
     Well, i think you've been watching too much Stuart Smalley from SNL with the &quot;I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and gosh darn it, people like me&quot;.

<br>
So, 5 people posted...Sunmoon and 4 others.  (Naming Sunmoon, as that is an obvious one).  I moved them to a private forum that only I could see, so at most, a handful of other people even saw the posts, and probably had no idea what was going on.<br>
<br>
I ran the IP's using a program that someone suggested to me, Spade, and pasted the results as a reply to each post.  I then asked another person, whom I know to be somewhat knowledgeable on IP's, and tracing and all that stuff, to have a look, and give his honest opinion.  I will state that said person may be biased...I don't know.  He's aware of the rant here.  Anyhow, this is what he had to say, quoted exactly (personal stuff at the end taken out).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I took a look, Cala - however, I'm of the opinion that Sunmoon is using a proxy of some type to mask his posting identity in this way, is using an anonymizer, or is using a combination of the two (chaining web proxies is an interesting topic, if you want to know how to mask your identity I can talk about it). Based on the information you have, their posts did all come from different IP's.<br>
<br>
You'll remember that Sunmoon has admitted that most (if not all) of his 'guild members' live within close proximity to each other - and if that's the case, I'd be surprised to find out that they all have such massively different ISP's; Yes, it's possible - but for highspeed access, there's not THAT many vendors any more in one local area. Plus, their posts don't really prove anything - I can create an ID and make it look like a new user by just posting from work (if you look at my posting history/access as Karthanon you'll see that I primarily post from one of two places; One from home thru Comcast, and the other from my workplace which should resolve to IBM).<br>
<br>
Unless you can get access to the web logs to find out exactly where their page requests came from, it's a bit difficult from that information to see if they're the same person or not.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest getting Sunmoon and all his buddies into ICQ, IRC, AIM, MSN, etc. in a PERSONAL chat (one at a time, perhaps..this could take a little while..just so he's not suspicious) so that you can determine their IP that way (it's a bit sneaky, but it works). There's a few 'grey market' (so to speak) tools that will find the IP address of a remote chatter in ICQ/AIM/MSN chat - or you can get into a personal conversation and just use the 'netstat -a' command in a Windows DOS box to check connections to/from your system, and then do a tracert (known as a traceroute) to trace their IP's back to their location. IRC is a bit different, however, that would work even better - then you could have ALL of them online at the same time, and just be able to do a '/dns nickname' on them...which *should* show the IP they're coming from.<br>
<br>
If they're all behind a single switch/hub on high-speed broadband access, it should show as a single IP (for instance, my wife and my systems (all 4 of them) should show as posting from a single IP as we're using Network Address Translation through a switch) - now, there's ways around NAT to find out which system a post came from, but simply put we couldn't use them because it's technically cracking...and we don't do that. I know I don't. Yup, that's right, uh-huh.<br>
<br>

<br>
Now, I will add, that all 5 people who posted all have global ezboard accounts created within days of each other in 8/2002.  <br>
<br>
<br>
So....you can all take this for what it's worth.  Anyhow, just doing the follow through.  And Sunmoon?  Thank you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And the IP's aren't being given out at all...no matter who asks &lt;G&gt;<br>
