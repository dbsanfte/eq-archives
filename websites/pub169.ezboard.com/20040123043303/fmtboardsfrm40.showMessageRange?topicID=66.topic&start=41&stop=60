<br>
Why come here and say he did it?  You know, if you are accused of doing something bad, human nature is to say you didn't....in hopes that you'll be let off the proverbial hook.  How many times do you see someone say &quot;yeah, I stabbed him 50 times&quot; instead of &quot;I'm innocent!  I don't know what you are talking about!&quot;   I'm guessing the latter is heard way more times.  <br>
<br>
I wasn't there, I don't know what happened other than this rant, but I'm commenting only on your statement.....most people won't admit to something when they think they can get out of it, in my experience anyhow.   Or when it will completely destroy their credibility.<br>

I feel really bad for Triune, you easily wasted 100+ of their manhours. However many times they have taken MM down, you still cant take that encounter lightly, and your dumbass destroyed their evening. <br>
<br>
  It should be apparent to you and the rest of the server now why you wouldnt be accepted into one of the higher end guilds on the server. It's people like you that made TW a piece of sh!t guild. You are either too dumb to listen when people are first asking, then pleading, then screaming for you to get out of the way, or you screwed them on purpose. <br>

I hope I'm reading what you're saying right, but it's late, and i'm tired. Giggit is 100% inconsiderate and selfish. He's also a liar. If you haven't had to deal with him, consider yourself lucky. <br>
<br>
We KNEW he was going to pull crap with us the minute we saw him in the zone. Those of us who knew better petitioned as soon as he didn't leave right away. It wouldn't have mattered if we were nice to him or not. He was still going to do what he was going to do. Why? Read the above paragraph. <br>
<br>
My first run in with him I WAS NICE. I didn't trust him simply because of the guild tag, but I was still nice. Yet he sat there at Begurgle saying he was just going to sit there and wait til we left. Well, he didn't just sit there. He watched the cleric die, he watched me get the camp under control with my chanter while the cleric was running back, then he came right up to me, broke my mez repeatedly with no taunt, until I was at about 10% health and was oom. Then he KS'd right in front of me, and looted bergurgle for his TWINK cleric. Then later he apologizes.<br>
<br>
Now he pulls this crap on a 4 hour raid (thanks, Sony, for the 1.5 hours dealing with raid window bug!). This time he said he just wanted to see what MM looked like or some bullshit. Yet does totally what we expected him to - he @#%$ up the raid. And there's the apology, yet again. Do you really think we have reason to be cordial and polite to him? It won't make one bit of difference how you treat him, he's still going to do what he wants to do. If he feels like training 72 people on raid that he has no business at, he's going to do it. Yes, he's THAT much of an @#%$.<br>

Giggit forget there are toons right now. I know my Druid could never beat up your SK in a duel. I don't care about that. Sitting here *behind the screen* is someone who has been waiting for her MM flag for a long time. Bad toss of the dice for a long time. Once even missing the PP by 20 seconds. <br>
<br>
<br>
From the time I logged on I had guildies sending me tells saying &quot;we're gonna get your flag tonite!!&quot;. I was so happy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Imagine how this person felt during that ENTIRE F*CKING RAID as I had to watch you tag along. Yea you know which one I am. I'm the druid in blue who stood in front of your invis'd face the entire f*cking raid. Every step of the way I knew where you were. I'm the Druid in blue who stood there as you hid behind that pillar in the corner. For hours I had to try to raid there KNOWING that I now had someone following our raid who even if they didn't at that moment think of wiping us, my night was already ruined.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guess what? I'm the Druid who GAVE YOU A GROUP in PoV recently. Because I had always believed to only judge people by personal experiences. And no one would group you. I knew about you ganking Bergugle from a lovely cleric in my guild long long ago. I knew about your reputation. I gave you that spot, and even apologised to you for the loss of the group when that shammy gated on us leaving us to wipe. <br>
<br>
I'm the Druid who helped you camp your Seru shard when I was with my friend Innaictus. And waited while you ran Kralok to the zone. <br>
<br>
You probably don't even remember but I sure so. And now-I'm the one who managed to camp safely. So I saw the entire fecking chaotic clusterf*ck of carnage visited down upon us by that unexpected visit from Lord MM himself.<br>
<br>
You were going to be ranted regardless, pr*ckface. Even if you'd been TL'd out before the end. You had a rant coming the likes of which you'd never seen. I watched my guildmates try to recover from this for HOURS. Very very very few of us need that flag. They did this for the few that did. Staying awake as long as they could. And I had to sit there knowing some little piece of feces managed to make a GAME a horrible place to be for me.<br>
<br>
Even before we walked into MM room you had earned my total hatred. I hate no one in this game. I have had falling outs, huge fights, I have a temper. But I have never hated someone. For what you did to my evening- and to the evening of 70 other people I care about and respect and who WORKED THEIR ASSES OFF LAST NIGHT.<br>
<br>

Oh wait, no, i dont havet to wonder.. cause we were focused and didnt have an ijut training the fvckin camp, or geting in the way, being a nuisance etc etc et all...<br>

As to us &quot;just blaming you  for our misfortunes&quot; ... dude, get a grip, a life, layed, quit sucking the tit and let go of momas skirt ...  and acept you fvcked up for once in your miserable life. <br>
Wont make a damn bit of diferance now, you made the bed and you get to lie in it.  YOU can say what you like, YOU can try to cionvince others you didnt do anything wrong... yer actions tell a diferent story. the one folks will listen to.<br>

Hell if u wanna get techinal for awhile i wasn't to happy with Triune(certain people know why), But they are an outstanding guild and Hell they are 1 of 3 guilds... Yes 1 of 3 on MT who are Elemental plane capable. Did TW even get close to that, UMMMM HELL NO. The reason TW never even got close to the elemental planes is because of A-Holes like u.<br>
<br>
Dood it should have gotten thru your THICK skull they DID not want your azz there when they asked u 100+ times to leave them the fook alone and stop following them. Then to sit in the corner they are gonna use to fight MM..  Also How in the hell did all the mobs get to the zone line and start killing the people in the GY??? In your own words u said u trained some there. even if u FDed.Hmm when i raided with Triune i never once saw the puller use WTF??????.. Unless they started something new(ROFL). Like i said in my 1st post i hope u enjoy soloing because that's about the only thing your gonna be able to do now. O and yeah don't die or even think of asking cleric or chanter for buffs.
