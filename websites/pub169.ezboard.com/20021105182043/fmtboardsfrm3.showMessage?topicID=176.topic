<br>
I have a theory with camps.... has to do with a ton of hypocrites (sp?) a monthly bill and and a piece of cheese.. See everyone these days.. and even in olden days... in Everquest likes to camp things... sometimes arguments break out on this .. sometimes they don't... What bugs me is when the camps in a place basically include every mob in a zone... recent experiences in the Crystal Caverns and High Hold Keep have shown me the depth of the idiocy behind camps...<br>
<br>
Hypocrites (sp?)- Much of the Everquest community at one point or another has picked a side on the giant pvp vs pve debate.. PvPers want pvp everywhere and PvE'rs want it just on their own servers... Usually one of the main ideas on the PvE side is that the PvP crowd shouldn't force a playstyle on the PvE people.... but isn't that what camps are ... a way of forcing a playstyle upon people? because you were sitting in an area longer you assume the right to tell someone to play a certain way.. usually go somewhere else or wait to get in the group.. So basically you are saying its not ok to force people to play pvp (against your playstyle) but it IS ok to force everyone to play how you tell them? ( we are camping these go away)...<br>
<br>
A monthly bill- Do we or do we not all pay a monthly bill (excluding game cards) to play everquest? Yes. Who are we giving this money to? Verant/Sony... We aren't paying random_camper_001... so why does every one seem to listen to random camper (we are camping) and not verant (there is no such thing as camping). The answer? I don't know.<br>
<br>
A piece of cheese- this has nothing to do with anything but I needed to break the monotone of the post<br>
<br>
The logic behind the theory- Assuming there is a such thing as a camp... isn't it based on your ability to kill all the mobs in an area? As far as I know yes... so if there is a mob sitting there and no one has attacked it yet... you cant be camping it or else it would be DEAD.. so why is it if anyone attacks it the &quot;campers&quot; try to KS you and say it was their camp... if it was your camp... it would be dead.... So what is with people claiming an area as camped and then not killing half the mobs but then at the same time saying they are all &quot;yours&quot;???<br>
<br>
As I said in the beginning this doesn't apply to named mobs because those are USUALLY rare and if no one could claim them they would ALWAYS be KS'd.. in those cases camps are there for the general populations good... if say raster wasn't accepted as a camp no monk would ever have his epic... but the majority of camps are just people in an area...<br>
<br>
so rya... flame away... I'm going to  review after I post and take out the spelling errors if I can to minimize the grammar flames.. better times...<br>
<br>
For the record I almost always respect what others consider camps... reason being it is better for the reputation of my guild and the eventual possibility of groups in the future... this is just why I cringe every time I walk away from experience...<br>
<br>
See ya in the game folks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ulinor1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Linor1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/2/02 12:39:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My theroy on camps... break out the flamethrowers everyo</span><hr size=1> brevity is your friend........ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/udarighaz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darighaz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/2/02 3:32:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My theroy on camps... break out the flamethrowers everyo</span><hr size=1> hmm no one flamed...thats odd... wonder why. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lingodm>LingoDM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/2/02 4:06:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   heh</span><hr size=1> Dari i know what u mean. I was in JP other day at the poacher camp. there are 3 tents and a fire pit. Welp, this dr00d(cant remember his name) was at the SE tent. The other 2 tents were full of Mobs. So i pulled ALL of them with my bard for exp. Welp i get this tell from this moron of a dr00d asking me&quot;wtf am i doing?&quot; I said, &quot;uhh getting exp?&quot; He said, &quot;cant u see that the poachers are camped?&quot; My first response was to just cuss this idiot out, but i decided not to. Instead, i explained to him that 1,There was no way he could ALL those mobs by himself, they were exp being wasted.2, no i didint KS him as i pulled Mobs that werent even in his &quot;camp&quot; location AND i never attacked any mobs he was attacking.3, there is no such thing as a camp. His response was, of course, &quot;whatever&quot;. I totally agree with you Dari. Personally i feel that since im paying VI 12.95 a month i should basically get to do whatever i want to do as long as its legal and within theri rules. Nowhere do i see in there rules that u HAVE to abide by a rotation for RF, or Trak, or leave a zone because of the POSSIBILITY of you killing a mob that SOMEONE in a certain &quot;camp&quot; might have the chance to kill.Of course i believe in being courteous, friendly and helpful. But i dont pay 12.95 a month to adhere to someone elses ideals of how THEY think the game should be played.<br>

Rotations.  Clerics on RF that are alts, don't play anymore, plan on quitting EQ all together in the near future, something to add to the dollar value for yer E-bay.  Nah, that's bullcrap.<br>

Camps.  People that no longer can hold the camp for whatever reason get their friends to hold it for them, guilds rotating members in and out of a camp so they can hold it for days, etc.  It used to be &quot;ok the six 1 through 6 of us will take this camp and we'll play it til we can't hold it and then leave&quot;.

If a player is in a room,  everything in that *room* belongs to him.<br>
<br>
If a player is camping a certain spawn at X loc, that spawn is HIS spawn.  Just because you can run up and hit it with a sword in .1 seconds, when the wizard has to wait 5second cast time to make aggro, doesn't mean that it's YOUR mob because d00d, I hit it first...shouldda been faster.<br>
<br>
That's the way it works folks.  Verant doesn't forbid you from doing it.  Well in life, no one Forbid's you from walking around hitting people in the face with a rake, and HEY, you only get one life to live....why not do what you want?<br>
<br>
That's not the way it works.  My advice to you is simple:  play nice, and do unto others.

Things change, and people need to accept that along with the development of the game.

 What you did is take his XP, and run it around in a circle, while he had to wait for a full repop again.  Thus irritating him and not making his day any happier.  What satisfaction do you derive from taking other's fun? <br>
<br>
 I know exactly how bard kiting works.  It takes you many minutes to kill X number of mobs.  <br>
<br>
My geuss, is that if you took a timer from the second mob aggro, to the second the last mob is dead, you could be charged with &quot;wasting&quot; XP.  Only difference is the mobs are chasing you instead of standing there.  Yeah, you aggroed em first, but you certainly arent doing anything about killing them.<br>
<br>
what did you win?  Half a blue of xp?  You just lost a potential friend who could port you to X zone on the worst CR of your life.<br>

No worries that I have gotten set-up in an experience situation and am working my little niche to the best of my ability. It's perfectly cool for you to come in and take any or all mobs that I am not actively fighting.<br>
<br>
I realize that camps are not honored by Verant, and I won't even so much as argue with you about it. If I am camped somewhere and you want to come along and start killing the mobs I was previously killing, I will let you know that I was camping them. If you decide to pull the attitude I am seeing expressed here, you can have them, every last one.<br>
<br>
I don't have time or desire to get into a fight with you or anyone else over a camp. There's tons of stuff I could be doing to occupy my time.<br>
<br>
Do remember this, however: What goes around comes around. If someone essentially rousts me from a camp, or starts giving me a bunch of crap, I will remember them. That certain someone can count on me not so much as ever clicking a spell gem for them again, that's for sure. There will come a time that they have a need of me, or of a friend of mine.<br>
<br>
If you are nice and polite, and treat me with respect, I might tell one or two people how cool you are. But I guarantee, if you are a jack-a ss, I will tell ten people, at least.<br>
<br>
So you go ahead, play the game the way you like to play. I'll continue to play the way I like to play and we'll just see how it goes.<br>

Camps and Rotations are &quot;gentlemen's&quot; agreements that are made between people, not between players - VI - players. VI doesnt care if your random_mob_03 get's killed, but as a communitee we might care. As players, we agreed upon camps because it just saves a lot of times and headaches. Imagine having to petition everyone 3 minutes because someone took your mob, or was cursing at you because you &quot;ganked&quot; something. Velks i can understand, most people believe it is a cespool becuase of many reasons and honestly, dont care (ffa stuff).<br>
<br>
I honestly dont think it would be fun if someone just took all my mobs if i had been there for a longer time. I have waited, and it seems i still probably am? People have said that rotations are there to help the weaker - guilds that maybe dont have Manaburn teams, or can mobilize in seconds. The same goes for camps in my opinion. I think it would be rather poor sight to see if i was lvl 50 again, and just went to seb my first time to have a group of lvl 60 to just waltz in 2 hours later and kill all my frogs. That never happened to me, and i dont intend to do it to someone else.<br>
<br>
Just because you pay 12.95 a month doesnt mean that everyone else doesnt, and most people agree upon camps. You can be with the majority of people that do follow it, or be with the minority of people that dont. You play this game, I play this game - why make it hard on each other if we both enjoy it??<br>

The other 20-30 people fight each other for the  other half.<br>
<br>
   Once the top group has killed all the mobs above them and on their level; they send one or two pullers down below to pull mobs from the lower levels.  The only mobs they do not pull are in the BW room or the LW room. <br>
   This is just pure greed. They shout, insult and then plain out KS anyone who goes near the spawns they &quot;own&quot; .  But all the other spawns are fair game. <br>
Myself and a few others simply do not accept this in-balance where 6 people are getting half the exp and loot in the zone.  I think it is bad manners to pull from the BW room,LW room or Village but as far a I am concerned the rest of the zone is FFA including the pit(since when has one group been able to clear all the mobs in the pit)<br>
    Those of you who go to Velks on a regular basis, who let the top group intimidate you are letting some pretty greedy people take advantage of your play nice good manners. I think if you plan on spending any time in this zone you need to make it clear to the top group that if they pull from below their camp you will pull from those upper two levels.<br>

2 friends and myself were bored a month or two ago, and went to vamp castle in TM.  Group of mid 40's was there camping it already.  We were frustrated at first (cuz of the 10 min run) but after talking with one of the members it was determined they were only pulling 1st floor.<br>
<br>
GREAT!  We decided (without mentioning it to them) we'll move up to 2nd floor and take the other two rares.<br>
<br>
Flame fest ensued.  Them saying castle was CAMPED!  Them not having ANY ability to kill the whole thing.  Tried to compromise with them, gave them the first floor (ALL THEY COULD DO).  They werent having it...  we parked on 2nd floor and left first floor alone.  NOPE..  flames ensued.  Kinda a sh.tty deal.  <br>
<br>
They tried to pull past us and damn near got us killed in the process, we stole back the mobs they tried to pull.  They couldnt compete, they left.  Seems to me the issue would have been much better solved with sense and compromise.  It always cracks me up when people claim camps they cant do.<br>
<br>
As another example, went into CT the other day.  My group and ONE OTHER PERSON THERE.  Yea, rare huh?  Anyway, we called camp check before we realized no one was there.  One person there claims sewers, says &quot;been waiting on group for 20 mins&quot;.  We ask where group is, he says doing PU's.  We laugh.  We move down to sewers, start pulling...  1 full sewer clearing later they got their group there.  They ask where we are, we say sewers.<br>
<br>
FLAME FEST ENSUES!<br>
<br>
I mean seriously folks.  YOU CANT EXPECT TO HOLD CAMPS JUST CUZ YOU CLAIM THEM!  Really...  I mean if you wiped, and are rezing or whatever, NP... people can respect that.  If yer group is in zone and buffing... people can respect that.  IF YOUVE BEEN LOOKING FOR LFG PEEPS FOR 20 MINS YOU CAN'T CLAIM A CAMP!<br>
<br>
Cracks me up.  People are generally respectful of other peeps camp claims.  As long as they are within reason.  The two examples cited above ARE COMPLETE JOKES.  People need to learn what can be called and what cant be.<br>
<br>
It's too easy to camp something from the zone line.<br>

basicly yea what is the difference between a LV 4 newbie shouting that he is camping ALL MOSS SNAKES in W. Freeport zone &amp; some mid 40 monk camping the pit and the whole lower floor of Crystal Caverns?<br>

There is NO way he could have killed all the mobs in that camp with just him PLing his rogue if thats what he was doing. Know the situation before u comment on it.<br>

New school is 6 people holding 5 camps or 1 person holding a camp 6 people used to be needed to hold it.&quot;<br>
<br>
um.. &quot;old school&quot; people were less powerfull.<br>
<br>
the reason one person CAN hold a camp is because CAMPS have become larger.<br>
<br>
a year ago, left side, or right side arena in kael was a full on RAID.  6 months ago, a group of 60's could do left or right side. today, a single enchanter can hold half of arena.<br>
<br>
likewise a year ago, WW dragons were small raid force encounters. now, shamman, mages, and other classes can SOLO nested dragons.<br>
<br>
when kunark was released, SEB was *HARD*. i remember going in there at level 48 with a group of 6 and getting wiped IN THE ENTRANCE.. now i PL my 42 rogue on entrance mobs..  also, people cry about &quot;aoe&quot; groups taking several &quot;camps&quot;. well, if a single group is capable of pulling and keeping clear &quot;upper seb&quot;, then &quot;upper seb&quot; is a camp.<br>
<br>
are camps &quot;enforcable&quot;? nope. not under verants rules... but.. become known as a person/player who doesnt respect other players, and you will fast find your EQ playing days much harder.  likewise, dont bite off more than you can chew. if you can hold a camp and keep it clear, then more power to you.. but im sure as hell not gonna sit there and watch you stare at mobs untill 4 pop so you can quad. if a mob pops and your just staring at it, im gonna kill it. plain and simple. if your that person who claims an 18 mob camp and can only kill 6 or 7 before it repops, well, im gonnna gank you, too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/usycther2002.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sycther2002</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/9/02 11:49:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My theroy on camps... break out the flamethrowers everyo</span><hr size=1> Bah, your posts are too long too read, dont use so many words =) there is not that much to argue over.......&quot;Velks, The Home of the Pulling and Tanking Clerics&quot; My hammer of judgement rules btw.<br>
