After impaling her corpse for all to see, Malaele d'Aeliu was burned then ashes gathered and poured into the sea.<br>
<br>
Kvael huddled in the basement of the Library, staring at the papers strewn on the floor. They were diary pages, some torn, others water washed and faded, but all written in unmistakable Teir’dal.<br>
<br>
For the next few weeks, he worked with little food or sleep, obsessed with putting this puzzle together. He had remembered the orphan child Shai’le. The city guards had found her half-starved and torn up by Kobolds, wandering in Toxxilia Forest. She was the child everyone shunned, who used to hide here in the cellars of the Library pouring over books, while the rest were at play. She spoke of stories she remembered of her abduction and being raised in Nektulos forest by a savior she called Mother. But, he thought the child was delusional and shrugged it off as a wild imagination. <br>
<br>
However, with a great sense of sadness and regret, he pieced together her Mother’s diary and found it all to be true.<br>
<br>
The night had come for the Librarians to gather and give progress of the work they had been doing. Kvael’s hands were cold and sweaty as they gripped the red leather Tome he had crafted to house the Legacy of Malaeliu. His body shook with nervousness, legs tremmoring, bouncing up and down until the assembly floor felt the vibration.<br>
<br>
When his turn was up, he walked into the center of the Library, peering up at the vaulted ceiling, seeing his peers gathered together to listen.<br>
<br>
“ To ensure the safety of these documents,” Kvael started out with a breaking voice. “ I ask that the meeting be closed and private.” The crowd murmured softly as the elders discussed the request briefly.<br>
<br>
Elder Shotala, a clean shaven Erudite with tattoo marking of his family nodded and called out “ Seal the doors please. Go ahead Kvael, we await to hear what you have kept so secretly guarded.”<br>
<br>
Hearing the heavy doors close, he took a deep breath and began. “ A Teir’dal was born into the Priestly House and she was raised in the service of Innoruuk. Her name was… Malaeliu.” <br>
<br>
Instantly the crowd was in an uproar, having heard this name and portions of this story told by the child Shai’le.<br>
<br>
The Librarian raised his voice over the crowd, in defense “ I present this book of diary pages that have been collected all over Norrath, to the commitee. On the backs of these pages are the trade seals from lands of the Barbarians, to the Humans, the Dwarven seal, and the seals of the gypsies.” He passed the Tome carefully to the elders, and watched them carefully examine the seals.<br>
<br>
“ May Kvael continue without more unaccepted interruptions?” Elder Shotala scolded the crowd. “ The authentication committee, I assure you, will clarify the if the pages are forged or altered.”<br>
<br>
With a formal bow to the Elder, Kvael continued. “ Malaeliu, yes a Teir'dal by breed and birth, had one enemy, Vri’dril. Our records show that these children shared the same father, Draxius- a powerful member of the High Council. The facts are not clear, of why there was such a fierce hatred in a family. But, the diary indicates that she grew up in fear of him.”<br>
<br>
“When they were both of age, the time came to choose a High Council member from the House of their Father. Malaeliu was reckoned to win but some incident happened. <br>
<br>
Vri’dril went on a mad spree of slaying the Stone Guardians to the north of Nektulos forest. Malaeliu knew that the Guardians were allies, sworn to protect the Teir’dal, so she intervened, healing the last of them before Vri’dril could land the finishing blow.<br>
<br>
At this moment the elders happened upon them, Vri’dril instantly covering up, saying he was stopping a Guardian revolt but Malaeliu was on the side of the Guardians. One elder stepped forward and asked the dying Guardian who healed him… he pointed to Malaeliu. But, before he could speak in her behalf, the poison of Vri’dril’s dagger took his life. Malaeliu’s story and her half-brother’s did not fit. But, soon it was forgotten.<br>
<br>
Ever suspicious of him now, the cleric started following him. Something was taking him in and out of Neriak at night. Sometimes he would come back into town with presents from all over Norrath. Spoils of war he called them. His power increased and so did his house of followers.<br>
<br>
One evening she saw him slip behind the waterfall in Neriak Commons. Assuming he had fallen in, she looked down to the other side where the pool was, but he never emerged. After several hours, she decided to take the plunge into the waterfall and see where he had gone. <br>
<br>
Behind the falls was a secret entrance, she had never known about. As she emerged from the water, the stench of sickness and filth hit her nose. Her ears were assailed with the cries of … children. <br>
<br>
Hundred and hundred of children of every race, were huddled on the floor, chained together… even Teir’dal children! Malaeliu froze in her tracks and hid her body from view, so as not to startle them. For hours she sat there and watched the little ones cry and comfort each other, some standing proud as if ready to defend the others. <br>
<br>
While she waited, Vri’dril entered with a Human gypsie. She saw money exchanged and listened as Vri’dril made arrangements to sell these children as slaves. <br>
<br>
The cleric’s heart was devoted to Innoruuk, god of Hatred. Her hands reached up to her neck, where she wore the Father’s symbol with pride. But, this was… beyond hate. This was a violation of worst kind. Even Innoruuk has rules and structure. Surely this could not be tolerated. Malaeliu had no love for the children she said, but she had a sense of right and wrong.<br>
<br>
She decided to ignore this. Vri’dril was far too powerful to go up against alone. The disgust she felt in her soul urged her to pray and meditate more on the Hatred of the Father. But as time passed, she found herself sneaking into the hidden cavern, leaving food and water, casting a calming spell and healing when necessary, slipping out before she was discovered.<br>
<br>
Time passes in the diary pages...<br>
<br>
While away in the Northlands, fighting in the Lair of Lady Vox, Malaeliu’s party was completely destroyed, many running off for their lives. Having been left for dead, Malaeliu found herself alone, powerless to heal herself.<br>
<br>
A mixed band of Barbarians, dwarves and a huge Ogre named Kruuk came in and pulled her to safety. She stayed with them while she healed up. <br>
<br>
The leader was a Shamaness named Kate, haggard from lack of sleep. Her husband had been killed and children had been abducted by a band of Teir’dals and gypsies. She pleaded with Malaeliu if she knew anything about the whereabouts of her children. With her husband gone, she would never marry another, never bear anymore children. She moved her hand across the Cleric’s abdomen and sighed. The shamaness told her that she of all people should understand; she had ascertained that the cleric was indeed barren and could not bear children of her own. <br>
<br>
Something inside Malaeliu tore her heart, breaking that wall of hatred that surrounded it. The pages of poetry she wrote... were emotionally charged.<br>
<br>
The plan was set. The band would go back to Neriak and free the children. Malaeliu would show them the way, but could not be a part.<br>
<br>
The librarian paused for a moment, asking for a glass of water...<br>
