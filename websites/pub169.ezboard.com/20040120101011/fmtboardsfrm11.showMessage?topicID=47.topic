<br>
Her hands rose up and combed back her long dark hair, thinking it wasn’t quite fair was it? “No, not quite fair what he’s done to me,” she muttered softly as she moved silently through the shadows. For a woman of her size she accomplished the task with a surprising thoroughness. Her movements made no more sound than the whisk of the wind over her cheeks. <br>
<br>
Forest green eyes that were warmed at the center by an oaken brown scanned the crowd. She could find assistance here, she knew. The trick was finding someone competent and trustworthy. Her shoulders touched back against a wall as she allowed the flow of conversation to wash over her, listening for something interesting. <br>
<br>
Her gaze drifted to the columns that were being tended to by acolytes. The carved marble showed little sign of the time they bore, and were as white as the robes of those that washed them, as white as the snows of her homeland to the North. These buildings spoke to her on some basic level, more so than any of the “elders” that dwelt within them. <br>
<br>
A scent stole her attentions, so sharp it made her breath catch in her throat. Sweet, subtle, and for one used to the crisp barrenness of icy tundra it was like a single rose in bloom where before nothing stood. Compelled, she moved toward its source. In a world barraged by sights, sounds, and aromas, few could distinguish one from another, but she knew the benefit of singling out one thing from another. Nothing assaulted her senses without her allowing it. <br>
<br>
Kloak peered around the corner cautiously, a tingle between her shoulder blades bespoke of some strange event, neither good nor ill, just strange revolving around this place; it sent a shiver down her spine. There was no way the man should have seen her, and yet she froze in her spot as he turned and settled his gaze upon the spot she stood. <br>
<br>
Again, her breath caught in her throat. His eyes were of a blue that she’d never seen before, so stunningly beautiful and piercing… <br>
<br>
Rather than be forced to admit to sulking, she stepped boldly from the wall, “Pardons, good Sir. You seem to be someone of great skill, of amazing strength, stunning agility, blazing reflexes, and excellent taste in fashion.” A tumble of words spilled forth from her lips, somewhere in there she realized she was looking a good deal harder at the breadth of the mans chest, and the tautness of his muscular arms than perhaps she should have been and snapped her gaze back to his face. <br>
<br>
“If you want to smooth talk a man, you should compliment his toys,” his tone was of good humour, the smile that came to his lips only made his face more appealing to her. <br>
<br>
“Well, to get such an amazing set of swords, and a bow of such,” she paused to actually look at the bow and was nearly stunned to silence. It was of a craftsmanship she’d never seen before, and she could not see the full length of it, she felt her left hand twitch with a desire to touch it and had to stuff it into a pocket to keep herself controlled. “Of such fine work, you must possess all those things I have listed, and much more.” The smile she put on her face was a carefully practiced one, hours and hours in front of a polished tin plate and seven brothers had honed it to perfection, it was perfectly angelic. <br>
<br>
His clothing told stories of someone comfortable in a forest and in battle. By the feline grace she saw in every small motion, the ease with which his blades rested at his hips, she was sure this man could assist her in her task. Those eyes of his had to be sharp to have spotted her in the shadows, she thought, that was another bonus, and there was something in his gaze that called her heart to trust. <br>
<br>
Kloak nearly turned and left then and there. “Never trust a woman’s heart. It’s fickle and fain to change,” her brother Kyle had always liked to say. She was never sure he ever quite admitted she was a woman, just a more feminine younger brother, Kloak thought. <br>
<br>
“Did you want something, or did you want to compliment my swords more?” The man laughed. <br>
<br>
Nice laugh, Kloak thought, just before she spoke, “I’m looking for a good blade to assist me. I can give details, of course. Nothing illegal, but to be fair, somewhat dangerous, else I’d do it myself.” That was enough, she thought, the bait was there, he could take it or leave it… <br>
<br>
“You have a name then? If I’m to work with you, I should probably know at least that. I am <br>
<br>
Tristairn,” his gaze leveled on her face and she had to force herself not to blush. <br>
She hadn’t blushed since she was a child and the fact that she felt blood rise to her cheeks beneath the gaze of this man made her slightly uncomfortable, but she would not let this ones help go now that he had offered it. “Kloak, and we should go somewhere a bit less crowded to speak of details.”<br>
<br>
“Kloak?” A bit of a smirk tugged at his lips, and even that managed to look good on him. <br>
<br>
She felt no need to explain that wasn’t her real name, that fact was obvious enough. Few still lived that knew her true name, and whatever force compelled her to draw in a deep breath and memorize the scent of Tristairn certainly didn’t charm her into giving out the name her mother had given her at birth. Her true name was one she hadn’t given to anyone since she’d taken up her new profession years ago. <br>
<br>
Though perhaps given time... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bitten, for sure.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It was a good perch, she thought, high above the portal to the Bastion of Thunder. You could see a steady flow of people searching for a change of luck coming and going, weaving their way across the narrow bridge. There weren’t many people that would cling to the stone where she was at, just to people watch that was for sure, and if she were to be completely honest with herself she was only watching for one person. <br>
<br>
A smile tugged at her lips seeing a drenched barbarian exit from the Bastion, his kilt clinging to him in what looked like a very uncomfortable manner. The smile widened further when she recognized the man, she sank further into the shadows as he passed. Kallaorf was a good man, but she was not in the mood for idle conversation tonight. She did take great pleasure in listening to his mutterings, confirming the comfort level of the soaked kilt. <br>
<br>
Tristairn been gone for days, off to find some exotic beast in a remote corner of the world, or so he said. The man owed her no explanations, and she’d ask for none. Still, she thought idly, it would be nice to know if he was coming back soon. She lay back, stretching out on the grassy hilltop, her hands cradling her head as a pillow. Her legs crossed at the ankles as she stared up at the skies, it was nearing the time full dark and the stars were beginning to appear somewhere. <br>
<br>
“Not here, never here,” she spoke the words quietly aloud as she stared at the ever bright sky above her head. Bored, she pushed up and decided to head to the closest tavern, thinking a moment before her setting her path toward the Plane of Knowledge. An irony she thought that you could kill so many brain cells in such a place, but there were a few places she knew that sold stout ale in the presence of good company. <br>
<br>
It didn’t take long with the use of the damnable books, she hated them, but she had to admit they were useful. She wandered to the closest bar; the sounds assaulted her; laughter, chatting, boisterous and bawdy. Beyond that though something else struck her senses, it was a scent, and without conscious thought she melted into the shadows. <br>
<br>
She scanned the crowd for the source of the scent that had become familiar to her over the past few months. A scent that she had grown accustomed to being close to, longing for and missing when it was gone. She saw him in the corner, sitting close to a beautiful elven woman, her hand was nearly enclosed in his, but Kloak could see the gleam of a wedding band in the pale light. <br>
<br>
Kloak stood mutely, thinking over the past few months. Her mind replaying time spent with Tristairn. Could she have misread his intentions? “I see you with a different last name.” He had spoken those words to her. That seemed fairly obviously at the time, but then again she wasn’t good at things that didn’t involve killing or destruction.  <br>
<br>
Tristairn was staring at the woman with an expression of adoration, and Kloak could feel her fingers tighten on the hilt of her dagger; she hadn’t realized she had clutched it as she stood there silent as a statue. He had lied to her; she could not have misread things so horrifically. So many sweet words, all bitter lies. <br>
<br>
She could see his lips moving as he spoke words to the woman, then he leaned forward and kissed her tenderly. <br>
<br>
The bite of the hilt burned her palm, matching the sting she felt in her heart. He was not worth her time, and the woman was not the object of her ire. Slipping out of the tavern she stalked back to the Plane of Tranquility, the place they had first met… there she would search for something to distract her from her thoughts; there she would search for something to kill. <br>
