<br>
No, what I believe we are trying to say is that these people should be held accountable for everything they do but I don't think the religion should even though they use it as the base excuse for what they are doing.  The problem is the religion is itself one of the last things those people have to strive on.  Running in with power and forcing them down will not lead to a solution but will only lead to martyrism and revolutionaries.  The problem is not with force and neither is it with unconditional kindness.  Its with stricter diplomacy, improved trade, removal of sanctions, and empowerment of people.  Ofcourse all that is extremely hard to instill in a region where religion and state have gone hand in hand for centuries.  Places like Indonesia, parts of the Middle East, and even India are evidence of this being plausible.  Look at India for example.  It is the largest democracy with many religions interacting with each other.  Attrocities do happen though between hindus and muslims.  However, that is a small part of what goes on and what is changing.  Woman have a lot more control and rights than ever before and thngs are changing.  the only reason for this is because the standard of living overall has increased.<br>
<br>
the Fundamentalists use any action against them in any form as a means to whip up their followers into hating the west even more.  now if the west was to retaliate with force, these extremists would only conduct more desperate retaliatory actions and the only solution would be to kill them all.  Yes, you are right in that it is sad there is no one leader coming forward to challenge these fundamentalists at a grass roots level based off of the religion.  But as mentioned before, one could easily base this off of fear.  <br>
<br>
Even in south america you have priests in fear of their lives because they speak out against guerrillas.  It is important to recognize there is a need to understand the sheep rather than the shepherd <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  It's a delicate situation granted but running in with guns blazing will only make those still choosing sides jump to whom they perceive the victims are.  <br>

I certainly don't get my news from CNN exclusively, or any other Western media outlet.  <br>
<br>
I think we did misunderstand each other, because your indignance at what I'm saying is fairly evident, and I wasn't trying to offend.  Islam needs a positive role model, now more than ever.  There are no Anwar Sadats out there now to balance out the Bin Ladens.  The balance of power has shifted frighteningly to the right in many (if not most) Muslim cultures.  With the exception of perhaps Turkey, I can't think of any predominantly Muslim nations who don't openly denounce Western culture *as a matter of foreign policy.*  That's a lot different than scattered bunches of rednecks saying &quot;kill all the damn ragheads!&quot;  That's the members of governments who hold majority power over the populations openly declaring culture war on the West, and the closest historical comparison is either Hitler's genocidal tendencies or Kruschev saying &quot;we will bury you.&quot; <br>
<br>
Now obviously, Turkey has probably overcompensated, but in many ways it's a better country and social structure for it, except for that whole Kurds thing, which is a completely different issue that I don't mean to get into here.  Still, as a nation Turkey has managed to somewhat separate Islamic fundamentalism from the running of a civil government.  Your points about church and state can't really be applied to a place like Iran, because in a country like that there IS no separation of church and state--it's a theocracy.  So was/is Afghanistan.  So is Iraq, though the only deity they acknowledge there has a bushy mustache and a beret.  Turkmenistan.  Belarus.  I could go on and on--these countries are not all Islamic theocracies, but they are all nations ruled by religious fanatics who brook no argument with what they have to say.  <br>
<br>
Say what you will about America, but if there's a particular overriding ideology, it's capitalism.  It's the idea that anyone, from anywhere, can come here and start anew.  It's imperfect, to be sure, but it's as successful and progressive as any other ideology in practice in the world today.  I'm not saying that to wave a flag or stand on a pedestal; I'm just trying to illustrate that every culture needs dissenting opinions, but overall order; not a huge gang of bloodthirsty thugs parading through its cities mowing down everything in its path in the name of Allah, or Jehovah, or Yahweh, or anything else.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sunmina>Sunmina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/25/02 4:06:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=281.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> My apologies then Canna.

<br>
Also, curious as to your last statement about goverment doctrine and religeous law.  Do you believe they are separate or the same?  I happen to think they are related and in some cases identical.  Even in societies which try to separate religeous doctrine as much as possible from legal texts, some aspects still filter through.<br>

<br>
For example, that hippie who wants the words &quot;One nation under god&quot; stricken from the pledge of allegiance. Or christian lobbyists who want prayer in schools again. There certainly are politicians and lobbyists and media darlings who wear their crucifixes on their sleeves. <br>
<br>
However in other parts of the world, such as Cuba, religion was (up until the pope and castro shook hands a couple of years back) completely outlawed. I remember in my many visits there, I never once saw a cross or picture of jesus on the walls, but plenty of drawings of characters such as Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and Camillo Cienfuegos, looking almost messianic. Communism doesnt get along with religion very well.<br>
<br>
Then you have a country like Bhutan, the last buddhist nation on earth, run, inhabited by, and exemplifying the principles of the buddhist faith. There you have a leader who says &quot;I am less interested in the Gross National Product of my country than the Gross National Happiness.&quot;  However buddhism is a faith based on tolerance and acceptance, it doesnt work like that elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I guess it all depends on the place, the religion, and forthrightness of it all... in some places it is one in the same, in others one exists and not the other, and in some they like to pretend they are seperate.<br>
<br>
I do BELIEVE they are different, very different, but my beliefs, sadly, have little to do with the truth and tactics of the world. if that were so, there would be no war on this earth, just a whole heap of tolerance and a whole lot of parties. Oh yeah, no one would have to work either... ahhh the complexities of the Cannaverse.

<br>
I live in the Bay Area of California (San Jose to be exact), which is generally regarded as a liberal area of the country.  Most of the Christians that I have known in this area have absolutely no problem with homosexuality, and see nothing wrong with the practice.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER...  This is the opinion of people in MY area IN GENERAL...  I won't make any claim to know how *most* Christians feel, mainly because talking to MOST Christians would take me a VERY VERY long time...<br>
<br>
And in case it is suggested, I wouldn't rely too heavily on &quot;poll results&quot;.  It has been my experience that the &quot;extremists&quot; (on BOTH sides of an issue) are always the loudest of anybody, whereas what I would *assume* as the majority (who are more towards the center in their beliefs) usually don't like to get involved in big debates because (perhaps they figure, as I happen to believe) that such ill will being constatly thrown back and forth between two groups does a LOT more harm than good.<br>
<br>
I also must agree with what someone said earlier, that those who vote the most in the US seem to be those to the extreme right and extreme left of our society (Californian voters, who are seen as pretty liberal to the rest of the country, DEFTLY swatted down a proposition which would recognize Gay Marriages in the state).<br>
<br>
<br>
A few notes in case anyone is wondering where I'm coming from:<br>
<br>
*As I said, I live in the Bay Area of California, which is generally regarded as being pretty liberal.<br>
<br>
*I was *sorta* raised as a Christian.  My family went to church once in a while (well, the adults went to church, us kids went to Sunday school) and when both myself and my brother lost interest in going to Church, it wasn't a problem in the family.  I'd like to point out that in the Sunday School that I attended, there was NO talk of the parables of Christ, or any serious religious discussions.  It was mostly go sit with the other kids and write don things you like on a piece of paper shaped like the Tablets the Commandments were scribed upon, then go fool around with some Play-Doh.<br>
<br>
*While I do not consider myself a religious man, I would say I think of myself as a spiritual man.  I don't believe in the Christian ideal of God or Heaven, but I do feel there is a greater something out there that defies description.  I have my little fantasies of how an afterlife would work if I had my way...  But I don't think that needs to be discussed.<br>
<br>
*I am VERY put off by those who claim to KNOW what's going on out there (&quot;There IS no God.&quot; is just as bad as &quot;I KNOW God's watching over me, and he'll send all those who question him to Hell.&quot;).  I don't know if God or any other such Infinite Being exists, and while I won't say that One (does this need to be capitalized? I suppose I should do it out of respect for the unknown at least) does exist, I'm certainly not going to say One DOESN'T exist.<br>
<br>
*I am also VERY put off by a certain specific arguement some people like to use a bit...  &quot;If there is no God, how do you explain all this?&quot; (&quot;this&quot; being the entirety of existence, which is punctuated by a waving of the hands).  When I say that I can't explain it, they say THEY can explain it because God, in all his infinite wisdom, decided that Mankind (and no, Mankind does NOT disclude women) would be gifted with imagination, and since Man can imagine a perfect God, then he must exist (which I should point out, is logically unsound;  just because you CAN imagine something doesn't mean it DOES exist in the infinite universe: simply that it COULD exist)...  Well, maybe a young billy goat, floating out in the emptiness of space, ate some bad grass and, in his anger, clamped his mighty hooves upon the nothingness (I have no idea how that would work, by the way) and created existence...  I sure as hell don't belive that.  But in my mind, it's a rather compelling arguement.<br>
<br>
*&quot;Parables of the Peanuts&quot; is a good book for the Spiritual and Religious alike in my opinion.  I whole heartedly agree with the concept that religious texts are important for the &quot;good messages&quot; they have, and that the political heirarchies of today's religions, and the constant squabbling between some people goes against the ideas that these <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>stories</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are trying to get across.  Remember, even if received via Divine Inspiration, stories are written by Man (again, not discluding women) and its silly to think an imperfect being can acurately relate the intentions of the Devine 100% of the time.<br>
<br>

KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A Nigerian Muslim state said Tuesday it had issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; urging a death sentence for the author of a newspaper story on the Miss World pageant that sparked deadly riots in northern Nigeria.<br>
<br>
More than 200 people died in the violence in the northern city of Kaduna.<br>
<br>
Muslims were enraged by the November 16 article which suggested the Prophet Mohammad would probably have married one of the contestants in the pageant, which has been relocated from Nigeria to London because of the bloodshed.<br>
<br>
&quot;What we are saying is that the Holy Koran has clearly stated that whoever insults the Prophet of Islam, Mohammad, should be killed,&quot; Zamfara State Commissioner for Information Umar Dangaladima Magaji told Reuters.<br>
<br>
Asked to clarify the government's pronouncement, Magaji said the state had &quot;passed a fatwa.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a fatwa. It is based on the request of the people,&quot; he said, adding that this did not contradict the authority of Islamic clerics who have the powers to decree death sentences.<br>
<br>
&quot;Being a leader you can pass a fatwa,&quot; Magaji said.<br>
<br>
Magaji said a number of Islamic associations in the state had asked the government to take action. The government had decided a fatwa was appropriate and could defuse anger that might otherwise lead to further bloodshed.<br>
<br>
The Kaduna-based New Nigerian newspaper said the &quot;fatwa&quot; was issued by Zamfara's Deputy Governor Mamuda Aliyu Dallatun Shinkafi, who compared Isioma Daniel with British author Salman Rushdie, sentenced to death by Iranian Muslim clerics.<br>
<br>
&quot;Like Salman Rushdie, the blood of the ThisDay writer can be shed,&quot; the paper quoted its reporter, who attended rally at which the Shinkafi made the pronouncement, as saying. <br>
<br>
NORTHERN NIGERIA TENSIONS<br>
<br>
Zamfara was the first Nigerian state to adopt strict Islamic sharia law, soon after the end of military rule in Nigeria in 1999. Attempts to introduce the sharia code in the neighboring state of Kaduna sparked protests and riots from non-Muslims that killed some 3,000 people in February 2000.<br>
<br>
The Kaduna office of ThisDay, which published the article linking the Miss World beauty queens with the Prophet Mohammad, was razed last week by Muslim youths.<br>
<br>
ThisDay editors told Reuters that Daniel, the paper's style editor, had fled to the United States after tendering her resignation in the wake of the crisis.<br>
<br>
The editor of the Saturday edition of the paper in which the article appeared was arrested for questioning but has since been released, the editors said.<br>
<br>
President Olusegun Obasanjo, speaking from Abuja Monday in an interview with CNN, said &quot;irresponsible journalism&quot; was to blame for Nigeria's latest communal bloodletting.<br>
<br>
Religious leaders have warned the violence could torpedo Nigeria's presidential elections next year, already overshadowed by the country's worst cycle of religious and political violence since independence from Britain in 1960.<br>
<br>
The Miss World pageant was hastily relocated to London, but there pageant organizers came up against more opposition with media and lobby groups accusing them of having blood on their hands.<br>
<br>
Trucks ferried bodies from hospitals in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna for mass burials Monday as calm returned after the violence.<br>
<br>
Troops enforced a curfew six days after Christian-Muslim riots broke out. The Red Cross said Monday the death toll was 215, while civil rights and hospital sources put the figure at 250. <br>

Non Muslims rioting and killing 3000 people.  Perhaps the issue has a little more to do with the general volatility and poverty of the area and a little less with the religeon, eh? <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

<br>
Non-muslims rioting and killing *because* Muslims were trying to institute forced adherence to Islamic law in neighboring regions.  There's a world of difference between violent resistance based on a political stance and rampaging brutality because a reporter suggests that some earthly women are so beautiful that even the Divine would agree.<br>
<br>
I'm sure that poverty and the region's history of volatility don't help matters, but saying that Islam has little to do with the problem is the equivalent of jamming your hands over your ears and saying &quot;LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!&quot;<br>
