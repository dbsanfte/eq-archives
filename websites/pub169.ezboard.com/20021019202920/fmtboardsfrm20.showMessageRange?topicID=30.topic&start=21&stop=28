<br>
The nice thing about it is, all classes have an item that can be obtained, so once you talk your guild into doing it for you, you can go back and get others their item.  There is a kick butt bracer for melee, a decent robe for int casters and this talisman for wis casters.<br>

<br>
I'm one who ended up buying most of my items, about 5 were quested the rest player bought.  My guild couldn't have handled the places or mobs where these items drop.<br>
<br>
It was an investment I was willing to make because for a long time, I was the lead cleric in the guild; overall I think I still have the best combination of stats (whether it's natural resists, mana, focus 3 items, etc), so I tend to be in the primary or secondary role most of the time.  However, now that all three of the lvl 60 clerics have their epics (and one is married to the MA), we'll see what happens when all 3 of us are together <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I got lucky, have 60 mage hubby who knew how to farm mobs and get exp for me at the same time once I hit the high 40's/early 50's so cash wasn't so much a problem.<br>
<br>
I got the donals hands for 2k, and when I started doing Kael raids, I got the donals legs for 20k if I remember right.  They saved me more times than I could recall.  They're the best I have right now (have a pair of hate pants in the bank as CR gear now), but once I get the SS armor that drops in HoT, I'll bump these to my bag - never know when the right click will save a raid again.<br>
<br>
Then, as you might have heard, mage epic pieces were at an all time premium.  Hubby and I farmed enough at one point to have over 120k saved up for his Hate staff, but he was lucky enough to find the mob up before he found a buyer willing to part with it, so we split the cash 60 / 40 (40 me).  I got that much because I was still in need of my lvl 58 59 and 60 spells at the time and he had all but one.  And, most of his gear upgrades are no drop now, where as mine could still be bought.<br>
<br>
:-)<br>

I broke out in hives laying down the 10k for my bone braced buckler LOL.  I pretty much draw the line at 10k tho cuz I rarely manage to hold on to the cash that long without buying something for hubby or our alts.  IF I had the money and knew I could make it back soon (I can usually get about 10k every week or so thanks to my alt GM'ing baking) I'd likely buy the ODS or the donal's legs.  But in the month it took me to make that money I'd be seeing all KINDA other stuff I'd want LOL.  Darn that bazaar! /groan<br>
<br>
When my guild does an &quot;in guild raid&quot;, I'm the main cleric (I'm the only cleric over 50 in our guild *shudder*) but mostly we raid with Natural Sanctions and let their clerics be primary (cuz Misstery kicks BUTT hehe)  I'm still learning and get VERY nervous when more than one group is depending on me.  I got to this level by duoing with my husband or solo'ing (cuz I NEVER have to roll for loot LMAO) so I kinda jumped into the raiding game without any kind of build up.  Which is why I worry about my gear so much, I never had much contact with other clerics so I didn't know how well mine would stand up in the high level game.  I'm immensely relieved to know I didn't screw up *giggle*]<br>
<br>
Oh and as to the SS quest stuff I think I may have to get the folks together for that.  My CoV faction is still indifferent and I'm quite sure the rest aren't maxed out yet either so we'll have all kinda fun raising it, then doing the  quests afterwards.  I smell a Kael arena raid coming on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Thanks for the info!<br>

I rarely roll on loot out of greed, I jest dinna have it in me, although I need ta start. There are many times I ferget ta ask fer peridot replacement coin. At any given time I have less then 2K pp in the bank, most I have ever saved up was the 10K I payed fer BoA.<br>
<br>
I have gimp gear and gimp mana but I gots tons of FIESTY! So I kin hold my own in most situations. As far as main cleric, it's rare that I hold that spot, because as Crystilla stated above, I am the RL wife of the MA, therefore ifin we have connection problems, ye would lose both the MA and the Main Cleric of the raid, prolly not a good thing. He normally makes the groups, and tries his best ta keep us separated fer that reason, not ta mention that Crystilla kin regen mana, and has more mana then I. <br>
<br>
I think ye gots some nice stuff there, and considerin that ta be the best (or what ye want ta believe is the best) ye have ta do a little givin and takin between all yer stats.   When I trade out fer resist gear (HoT raids etc) I will let my wis drop ta 210 with KEI up. Between BAtR, KEI and the occasional feed from my pocket Necro I kin maintain FM fer the most part. <br>
<br>
Good luck ta ye in findin what suits ye best, but by all means there is nothin wrong with what ye gots.<br>

<br>
Doesn't matter how so much about the gear. What matters is the player behind the toon. Both Atha and Crystilla are top-notch healers and have the true cleric mentality. I don't have the stamina to stay focused as long as they do, and in the crunch, that can be a problem. Like they say, &quot;It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog!&quot;<br>

Atha ~ I always thought it was a possible good thing to keep you in a different group than Brut for this reason - he's got two clerics who know his health level.  Even though you have to turn around to see his comp, you can hear him, and you always cel'd him in HoT, to make sure my cheals weren't too late (I start between 70-50health depending on life cycle of mob).  No one else could be the backup for his EQ life as the woman who will die for him in RL. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (Bo, ya can't fight me on that one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )  I never really thought about the connection thing.<br>
<br>
Bo ~ I loved your phrase; hadn't heard that before, but don't sell you guys short.  I'll let you in on a secret.  One reason I went and got some gear was because I wanted to meet up with your standards of healing.  You always seemed to do so much with what you had, and I wanted to emmulate you.<br>
