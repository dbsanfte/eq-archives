<br>
This morning, went to Seb, FE had an AoE group doing the normal disco to Chef rotation. We asked if they would mind our group taking a camp at either end.. they gave up a camp np.. when people take the time to ask, and consider it's easy to get along. <br>
<br>
A bit of courtesy goes along way. <br>

<br>
When I go and solo seb entrance 6 mobs, or 2man NG, would you guys consider it as offensive to have a camp taken by 2 people, as 3 camps taken by 6 people. In that case every AE group is as guilty as every monk that has ever come within 100 feet of a shaman.<br>
<br>
Just a simple question. <br>
<br>
I seem to have no problems in  place like KC when resident level 50 group of tards with wurmslayers wants a camp and im sitting there with a shaman/cleric/druid owning it. For the simple fact that people know I was there first, they dont care that I can clear hmm, lemme count: 4+5+4+4=17 mobs in before a respawn. <br>
<br>
Why should a normal seb group care if 3x the amount of people are killing 3x the amount of mobs. What would you say if you zoned to seb and disco was camped by prien and warlor, NG by me and random shaman_01, jail by some other 2man combo. Would you send us tells asking if you can have our camp, because 6 people should hold 3 camps?<br>

There are always people that will complain if you have mobs and they do not.  Too lazy to go find a place not camped so they scream UNFAIR -INEQUITABLE and then demand justice or take camps.  KSing is always lame but saying I will just take an AoE camp or calling in a gm is lame. Whiner petitions means the person needing help recovering a corpse or gear has to wait that much longer because you are too lazy to find a place to exp that isn't camped.  What a prick. <br>
<br>
GD socialist, treehugging, self righteous pos.  Actually I like the Sierra Club so strike the tree hugger part.  If you want socialism go to Greece but keep your redistribution schemes out of eq.  As a film critic beating up the movie D&amp;D, D&amp;D was about killing kobolds and taking loot not solving world problems.  EQ isn't much different.  <br>
<br>
AoE group is the equivalent of a group with m60 machine guns and most 55ish groups have pistols.  There are a lot of mobs to kill who keep popping back up on a reasonably short timer.<br>
<br>
Honestly, which of the two groups is best apt to get the job done? It isn't about justice, or equity,  its superior firepower earned through levels and aaxp v. someone that hasn't put in the time yet wanting a piece of someone elses pie.  <br>
<br>
I think its great that there are a few zone you can go to and do AoE.  If you are not uber enough (is uber still a word?) to do Seb King, Crypt or Juggs which are rarely camped all at same time go do a zone like Chardok where you can always find loot and good xp and not camp steal casters your are terribly jealous of. <br>
<br>
When asked nicely, it usually not a big deal to give up a camp here and there but I love being in an aoe group and a group storms in and takes a claimed camped without asking.  You perceiving others as greedy is not a good excuse to grab a camp.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/u1utterlyde.showPublicProfile?language=EN>1utterlyde</A> at: 8/6/02 10:50:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uimjonah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>imjonah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/6/02 9:41:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Camps in general</span><hr size=1> Please correct me, if I got this wrong.<br>
<br>
The postion of the GMs and what they will enforce is this<br>
<br>
1. They do not recognize camps or claims of camps. If 2 groups want to kill mobs at the same location then they need to share. <br>
<br>
2. Whoever first aggros a mob has the right to kill it and get the reward.<br>
<br>
3. You should not pull or aggro mobs in such away that they attack other groups.<br>
<br>
    Virtually all the other rules we all play by are informal aggrements and rules of conduct most players have come to accept, an expect acceptance by other players.<br>
       I think we all have a rough idea of what those informal agreements and expectations are but there are a number of situations which are borderline or ambiguous.<br>
<br>
   I am not aware of any generally accepted agreement, to when multiple camps can be claimed.  For example in Velks if a group was to set up by the zone and claim Back Wall, Left wall, right wall and fake wall, I seriously doubt weather any one would respect their claim, even if they could kill all those mobs before they respawn. On the other hand the &quot;top&quot; group routinely claims almost as many spawns and they regularly become irate if any one challenges them.<br>
<br>
    In  the case of Seb and AOE groups. It seems to me that if an AOE group claims most all the zone, and you would are the member of a regular group, the advice given to ask the AOE group if you could have a particular camp is correct.  If the AOE group refuses then it makes sence to either leave or move your group to the location you want  to camp. If there is no one at that spot then you should notify the AOE group where you are located and ask them not to &quot;train&quot; you or overwhelm your group with aggroed mobs. I would snapshot(the thing you do so you can save text and send to GMs) your request and their reply.  <br>
   It is my guess the GM would back you up on two counts. One the general requirement to share and the requirement to not knowingly aggro mobs which will attack another group.<br>

Everything I am about to write is based on conversations I had or guild leaders had and published to date.  There are exceptions to rule or experience so take this as you will as gospel or simply an account of what happens most of the time. <br>
<br>
KS and kiting<br>
With only a few exceptions (dragons are a very good example) first to engage a mob, does damage, and has suffient force to kill it gets the kill. That means if you snare a wyvern (without hurting the mob) and someone else hits it technically they are an ass but they are not ks-ing you.  Sort of like that Slvyester Stalone movie, its all about First Blood. <br>
<br>
Bigger mobs<br>
If you kite (say Lozidal) to buy time for your guild/friends to arrive the mob the mob isn't yours either as you have insufficient force to kill him.  VI doesn't respect silly people using delaying tactics to prevent punctual parties from killing spawns you decide to run all over a zone.   <br>
<br>
Camps<br>
VI does not recognize camping (per se).  Yes that means stupid people that petition their camp was &quot;ganked&quot; will typically find little help from VI.  <br>
<br>
Yes, on a case by case basis, some guides or GMs will assist someone on a quest to ensure that another person(s) does not &quot;intentionally&quot; interfere.  Try killing dorfs during a ring war in GD (if the host of the event doesn't say its ok) and see how fast you get a warning &quot;if&quot; they catch you doing it. <br>
<br>
Most guides/GMs try to stay out of it and leave it to us to work it out.  Quite frankly, once you leave orc camp1 unless you are a raid size force gm's really don't want to deal with petty squabbles and typical suggest you try to work something out or move on.  Guides tend to be more apt to try to make you share mobs but I have seen people go to chat find a real gm and have the guide reprimanded for over stepping or abusing their authority.  You don't see the reprimand but you do get a nice tell from a GM to continue on and the guide goes away.  I respect guides trying to help out but many need a lot of time before they truly grasp their limited power and bounds. <br>
<br>
So you are mad so don't get angry get even...<br>
People tend to get mad, ks or intentional train others, and that (on the other hand) will get a gm involved.  IMO, if you are not stupid you don't tell anyone ever that you are petitioning them.  If you are mad enough to petition why blow a great chance to see them go up in flames?<br>
<br>
People who blatantly ks and train to get rid of you are very easy to deal with.  My favorite is &quot;if you don't do _insert demand, I will train you&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Let me think what to do...oh yah  /report offending line and person name then do a petition asking a gm to observe invis.<br>
<br>
About 50 percent of the time a gm will come in invis to watch your incredible stupidity and amazingly that character goes poof about 50 percent of the time and maybe 10 percent of the time is never see again. <br>
<br>
MT is a play nice server where we are suppose to try to make it a friendly place (with at least some sense of civility) most of the time.  <br>
<br>
VI does not require the respect of camps, nor in most cases to they recognize them (you do seem to get help in disputed epic camps).<br>
<br>
So if the question is can you take a camp if someone is claiming more than one and get away with it...actually the answer is yes. Should you is a totally diferent issue.  Just remember the more people you fight with means the more enemies you have to deal with later on.  <br>
<br>
I have had my share of being an ass in game and have tempered my attitude considerably but just remember the less people you tick off the more likely you get that free rez, port, buff, or one day uber guild invite because you didn't make it to yet another person's (beside the computer) fu forever list. <br>
<br>
Just a thought<br>

<br>
AoE groups will not go away, whining about it just makes you look like a big wet @#%$. You could go to many other zones with just as good xp, most even have better loot tables. My advice would be to move on to another zone.<br>
<br>
When I go to Seb with a regular group, and it's full, I go to AR, HS, or even ME... it's more economical to head to another zone than to cry about it kthxbye.<br>

2. I always ask nicely. I try my best to respect everyone<br>
3. I always do move on when a AoE group does not let me have 1 camp<br>
4. I have never petitioned anyone in EQ over camps Verant does not reconize camps so waste of time.<br>
5. I am home two weeks a month and come to Seb maybe once or twice each of those weeks ; so it gets a little annoying when AoE groups refuse to share.<br>
6.There has been occansions where a AoE group has shared<br>
7. I am not greedy most of the zones i hunt in have low cash outputs i come to Seb once in awhile when the bank account is dry.<br>
8. I try to avoid Seb till 7 happens<br>
9. I'm on computer at work and must get off before i get FIRED =/ lol<br>
<br>
<br>
O and I agree if you can take out 65+ frogs at a time go for it and yes like Imzakhor said i would like to pull for a AoE group but even if i was in one if someone asked nicely for one camp i would vote let them have 1.<br>
<br>
I was a little ticked when i started this rant and stated that i would just take a camp but being really cooled off now. If a AoE group says no i'll just leave. My main goal in EQ is to Hit lvl 60. If i get loot fine if i dont thats fine to as long as i have fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=38.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=38.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showMessageRange?topicID=38.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=38.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showNextMessage?topicID=38.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=38.topic&index=69><img src=http://sevendragons.net/images/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.emailToFriend?topicID=38.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.threadControl?topicID=38.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=38.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=38.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3>Rants</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
