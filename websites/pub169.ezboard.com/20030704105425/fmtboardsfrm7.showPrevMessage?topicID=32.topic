Tonight (sat-sun) the GMs stepped in an forced a 4 person list on the spawn.<br>
<br>
There are between 8 and 15 clerics at this step and that is growing. Will VI fix this? Will the MT community fix this? Will this step depend on luck and your willingness to act in a bad manner?<br>

<br>
I was there for a few hours this past evening and morning in support over some issues of claim with the Ragefire merchant.  <br>
<br>
REWIND - A GM intervened earlier, made the folks roll over a camp dispute.  Top four spawns were assigned by the roll.<br>
<br>
FAST FORWARD - Those 4 as well as many others showed up for the next spawn (NOTE:  all knew about the GM forcing a list on the top 4 spots).  One non-listed person decided to take the spawn and break the GM's forced list.  She turned in, gated and logged within moments.<br>
<br>
During this time, there was issue over the original camp holder and the new camp holder via the GM's random roll.<br>
<br>
This is not the typical camp situation and I see this only getting worse in the nearby future.<br>
<br>
Should there be a list?  There's pro's and con's.  It is only a 24hour spawn.  Prior to the patch this was the type of mob folks came and checked, zoned in and called camp check.  If someone answered, they left; they didn't sit there and stake the next claim.  I think that system might work again now if we let it.<br>
<br>
We've gained so much time off our epics with this new system, I would hate to see those folks who haven't been lucky enough to find that 4th fragment or do that pearl swap yet lose out by VI changing things back.<br>
<br>
I also hated to see the bitterness shown by those who play the nicest class in the game.  Mind you, at the time of the latest spawn, folks there had been up going on 40+ hours (give or take a quick nap).  No one hated each other but tensions were high.<br>
<br>

A wise cleric may just take a step back from his epic at this time, unless they really feel competitive. I for one had a terrible experience there which included getting a warning to my pristine record. I hope an amicable solution to this works itself out. Until then I will be spending my time enjoying the many other wonders of Everquest.<br>

I'll finish my epic some day, much sooner than I would have before the new patch. And I will do it with honor and respect.<br>

I was also first of all four clerics and there camping the spot longer than them... First I will say I very much did NOT agree that the Guide had a right to force us to random... Folks he did force us, he told us it was either the four of us random for order on that spawn or we'd get a perm official warning on our accounts... So I rolled, rolled third out of the four of us, and I didn't think that list should have applied... Yeah this person who ganked it wasn't even there, she was number six on this &quot;list&quot; the Guide forced on us... She was gone from the camp the majority of the day and night... <br>
<br>
Those of us there, all four of us that randomed didn't agree with the GM forcing us to random, and we all requested the petitions to be escalated to a lead or supervisor and never got a response... So we petitioned again, got another guide and not what any of requested, who did nothing... Essentially told us we should all group together and kill FGs, we're all wondering what the heck this has to do with the problem... He briefly said something about talking to an actual GM on our behalf and see about doing something about this spawn, then he kept going LD and last time he never returned... Nothing got resolved, again people petitioned again and for the rest of the day, evening, and through the middle of the night no other response to the situation was given... That means this server, the people here, HAVE to do something... There's going to be sooooo much dispute down there and hatred over silly friggen gankings of it by those that can't respect other clerics there longer than themselves... <br>
<br>
As Dornie said something should be done so it doesn't turn into a melting pot of nastiness down there, and folks I know firsthand that's exactly what is going to happen... <br>
<br>
In closing I was there a day and a half, I was 20 minutes behind Cephas who got the camp before me... I arrived 20 minutes after him to claim for next spawn and everyone was told that... Essentially I'm feeling very much disillusioned at this server's community, and disrespect for a particular cleric... I'm tired, grouchy, and just not a happy person right now... <br>
<br>
Edit: This is something I also come to realize and decided I had an opinion on... Stats, 15 people on the old RF list have swapped pearls... 15 blasted people out of a list of 76... I'd really like to know those within the top 10 or top 20 hadn't already done this... They were lazy, I was in the 60s and knew I was in for over a year wait, this is/was my excuse... Now I severely regret it... I could have my epic right now had I swapped my pearl, and yes at the moment I am bitter... Every SINGLE person towards the bottom/top however you look at it of the list, should have already swapped their pearls... This bottleneck wouldn't be so friggen bad here if you guys had done as you were supposed to... <br>

<br>
At least with RF, you needed a small force to arrive and help you. This step is just a turn in. So evey cleric there is rdy to try the swap at any time.<br>
<br>
It has been treated as an FFA step which means everyone mobs the NPC once a day and hopes for the best?<br>

<br>
This is a bottleneck, but no where near as bad as RF was. I am greatful for the change and I can wait another month or two before I see my epic. I've seen some of my very best friends get their epics this week. It's a wonderful thing. I saw people helping each other in Skyfire, strangers helping others. Clerics that have waited months getting thier epics, it's great!<br>
<br>
I wish people would remain civil at the Sol B camp, but as we can see, that's not going to happen. If we did make a rotation, I don't know if it would serve a purpose for longer than a couple months. Is it worth it? I'm not saying I'm against it, heck it would be better for me if we did, but is it necessary?<br>

<br>
The four parties involved in the GM ruling were all present at the time of the pop, and believe me, NONE of us was snoozing.<br>
<br>
The person who grabbed that spawn knew full well what was happening, and had been stating her attempt to FFA, regardless of what the rest of us told her about the GM ruling. She was on that pop like STINK on SH!T, and gated out immediately. I would venture to say she sat there with the pearl in hand, eyes on the prize the whole time.<br>
<br>
Had I not been already warned and instructed to wait my turn by the gm, I wouldn't have minded so much. But as far as I know, defying the GM can get you banned, or at least suspended. I wasn't about to get into an FFA situation, and risk everything over this. Had the GM stated originally that it was FFA, and not forced us all into a random I would have been okay with that as well.<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, this is a cruddy deal and GM's have responded very poorly, as have some players. Not one of the best days in Norrath, all things considered.<br>
<br>
Guess I wil be medding after rezzes for a while longer. No worries, I'll get that sprinkler someday tho!<br>

I believe I know where you got your information but please know that the information your guild was given by this person was NOT correct!<br>
<br>
The 4 hour snooze was 28+ hours prior to this spawn that &quot;so and so&quot; ganked early this morning. <br>
<br>
Yes there was a contest between two clerics.  Cleric #2 arrived right after Cleric #1 (who had the RF spawn).  He told her taking a nap was ok and I'll hold your spot as long as you're back before he spawns (which she was).  Cleric #3 came in during that nap and didn't respect this claim.<br>
<br>
The Merchant spawned for Cleric #1.  The, 24 hours later, Cleric #2 and Cleric #3 are still there, vying for who's right.  During that time there was GM intervention, and those two clerics, along with two new ones who showed were forced to random for the first 4 spots.  It is THIS spawn that was ganked.<br>
<br>
ALL clerics who were there awaiting this latest RF merchant spawn KNEW the first four spawns were already assigned by the GM with that forced roll.  The cleric who ganked it knew this quite well as she was grouped with one of the two who were still contesting the #1 spot.<br>
<br>
The cleric who ganked the spawn <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  was</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in the wrong and has done her guild tag a huge injustice.  As before, I'm keeping this clean of names/tags, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>but I did have logs on in case any officer associated with this cleric wishes me to email them to him/her</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  The logs will show she was &quot;there&quot; whether casting spells or speaking during much of the conversations that took place in say prior to us taking the conversation to a chat channel so the original camp holder (cleric #1) could join in.<br>
<br>
The logs, however, will not show her speaking on the topic in say.  If any who were grouped with her had logs on, please post here.<br>
<br>
I received my epic on Friday morning but was there to show support for those camping this mob; to hope it didn't turn into bloodbath or worse.  I was there for approximately 4 hours (3 and a half hours before the Merchant popped and half an hour+ afterwards) so have a good amount of conversation recorded.<br>

In your cases the GM did not make a &quot;list&quot;, instead only picked one person who would be rewarded the spawn(if I read correctly).  Ambnesia means that a GM cannot create a list and assign an order for more than one spawn of  an FFA mob.<br>
Hence, FFA.  <br>
In my opinion, because this is an FFA mob, it could not be &quot;ganked&quot;.  Even if a guide created a list, that list could not be valid or used in any way other than to shut up four clerics that were arguing over a bitch of a spawn.<br>

Vyrance - unless you are a cleric that is 50 + on the list knowing you have over a year before you have to turn in your pearl, you have no idea what it feels like.<br>
<br>
To say we were lazy, is unfair.  Tell me knowing what goes on in our own guild,  we don't always have a lot of free time to get even these small quests done.<br>
<br>
I wish I had turned in my pearl, but it didnt have to with laziness, it had to do with being busy and thinking I had time. <p><CENTER>
