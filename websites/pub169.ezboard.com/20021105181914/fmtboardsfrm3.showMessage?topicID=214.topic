<br>
Don't schedule them as much any more and assign them slow shifts where you end up asking the crew &quot;since it's so slow we need a volunteer to go home early&quot;... if this person volunteers to go home early, then cut back even more on their hours to the point where they ask why they don't get as many hours.<br>
<br>
Once they start complaining about lack of hours explain to them that since they:<br>
a. volunteer to leave early<br>
b. make plans based on an &quot;unofficial&quot; schedule <br>
c. don't volunteer come in when someone calls in sick (I'm guessing C applies to them as well)<br>
<br>
that their hours have been reduced so as to not interfere with their life.  They expressed behaviors consistent with someone who wanted more free time and you were happy to accomodate them.  if they wish to exchange some of their free time for cash, then they need to express a positive attitude towards working and behave (meaning show up early, ask what they can do to help when things are slow, etc.).  only after they have changed their behavior will they be given more hours.<br>

Cardinal rule of schedule changes is make anyone who got their schedule changed (temp or perm) initial the change and give them a copy and make one yourself.

Make them initial it and if they don't show up its on their ass now rather than you.  You still may have to cover the shift but odds are you can put a nasty gram in their employee record or another nail in their coffin. <br>

Spare me the political correct chip on your shoulder and if a statement doesnt apply to you then ignore it.  <br>
<br>
Teens inhabit the lower level jobs ; which = fast food, blockbuster etc... and without fail I continue to recieve the worst service as they talk on the phone, scratch their ass, or just outright ignore you --  So I call it like I see it.<br>
<br>
So if you are not one of those slackers, and are one of the few teenagers that can get my order right at Starbucks / BK or blockbuster then this reply obviously doesnt apply to you.  Ignore it.<br>

My reply is not Anti-teen, just a fact and I was not much better when mommie gave me my milk money as well.

Little above minimum wage.  I keep the job because its an easy job that doesn't wear me out or take advantage of me like most of the jobs ive had do.  <br>
<br>
I don't take my job seriously really,  and I don't care,  took me 15 minutes to find a job when I went to look for one.  If I get tired of my job or got fired it will take 15 minutes to find another one.<br>
<br>
You get what you pay for,  want a good employee?  Pay them well.  You want to pay someone next to minimum wage who has more important things in their life than their job,  then thats what you get.<br>
<br>
Your the manager?  You gotta work for someone?  Take responsibility for yourself,  obviously the person doesn't take their job seriously.  Fire them,  maybe the next guy will pretend to care for 2 weeks.  Or maybe you will pay the next guy better and he will care a little bit more.  You get paid more than the other guy for what you do,  deal with it.<br>

<br>
yea, right, way to group everyone together. I work my ass off at my job, and am Damn good at it. Who slacks? the 35-55 year olds, while the kids work thier butts off. <br>
<br>
Can I now say that all 35-55 yr olds are lazy?<br>
<br>
A black person was rude to me once, does that mean I can call all black peopel rude?<br>
