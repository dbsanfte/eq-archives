Since i no longer believed i had the time to invest in a guild, i did the proper thing and told them i was quitting. <br>
<br>
Now, i had a pair of viscid slime gloves on noonie, if you dont know what they are they are very rare ft 4 gloves with excellent stats, they are worth at least 200k. So i was selling them in the bazaar when plethra tells me hes interested in them. Being the person i am, i say &quot;well i was looking for at least 200k <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>but since youre tw</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, i will sell them to you for 150k&quot;. He says &quot;i only have 140&quot; and i let him have it. I figure its good if the gloves stay in the guild.<br>
<br>
Now, fast foward to about 48 hours later. I am having second thoughts about quitting and express this to plethra. I ask plethra, &quot;can you please reverse the trade with me as those gloves were important to my character&quot;, i even offer to add 10k to compensate for the inconvenience. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>he says no</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
!!!<br>
<br>
Now at this point i cant believe what im hearing. Here is a member of my guild, who i considered close to me for many months, treating me very crassly over PHAT LEWTZ. I had sold him my gloves for a rock bottom price <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>because</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the &quot;kinship&quot; i believe existed between us, yet he is not showing me the same kindness in turn. I am feeling a combination of disgust and sadness but mostly disbelief. <br>
<br>
I offer him another 10k, he again says no. So now im getting upset, and im asking him how he could in good conscious do this, and he starts throwing out the &quot;a deal is a deal line&quot;, of course a deal wasnt a deal when <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>he</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pulled the &quot;hey im tw can i get those gloves for 3 cents&quot; just a few hours ago.<br>
<br>
I then send a tell to chopmeat, who is now the leader of tw. He takes plethras side.<br>
<br>
Eventually this ends with plethra pretty much telling me that he<br>
a) wont pay full price for the gloves (200k)<br>
b) nor will he show me the respect a tw deserves by respecing my wishes to return and reclaim my gloves <br>
c) chopmeat, and through extension tw, agrees with plethras actions.<br>
<br>
So, young players of morell thule, i just figured i would post this as both a way to vent my frustration and as a warning. If you were considering joining tw, please run as fast as you can in the other direction. Not only is their leadership inefficient, and you must put up with hours and hours of failure over the most simple mobs, but the whole &quot;family guild&quot; line they spew is 100% COMPLETE AND UTTER BS. There is no family atmosphere in tw, which i have quite obviously proved, and they will no sooner than look at you when it comes to cutting ano ther so called &quot;family members&quot; throat for PHAT LEWTS.<br>
<br>
Rather, tw is now just a shell of a former somewhat efficient &quot;uber guild&quot;. If you want to join a real guild, go to fe or fov. TW has nothing these guilds dont have, except endless failure.<br>
<br>
As for tw: this was the last straw. You have let me so down in doing this, its hard to express in words how much so. I feel lied to and used. I feel sorry for any good hearted person who joins your establishment as they are merely being lied to and used as well.<br>

Aren't they guild property?<br>
<br>
And B) you said you were planning on Ebaying.  Those viscid slime gloves would fetch a heck of a lot more than the 140k plat you recieved from plethra.<br>
<br>
I can understand your frustration; however, you DID sell the gloves.  They are no longer yours. <br>
<br>
Realizing that you made a mistake in no way obligates Plethra to rescind the deal.  If you stub your toe, you don't kick the chair.  <br>
<br>
You made the deal; and regardless of your current feelings, you have to live by it.  Doesn't matter that you gave Plethra a *deal* b/c he was TW.  You made the deal.  Now stick with it.<br>

Yea except you kinda forgot<br>
a) i was thinking about rejoining tw (hahaha not anymore)<br>
b) i had only let the gloves go for a pathetically low price because i wanted them to stay in the guild, and subconsciously i figured if i changed my mind a guild member would be understanding. boy was i wrong.<br>
c) there is a rule that droppables are supposed to be returned to the guild? If so i havent heard of it, and everyone who left tw recently hasnt respected it.<br>
<br>
Face it. You were wrong. I know tw never ever admits when they are wrong, but you are so wrong and you should at least admit it.<br>
<br>
And its not even the gloves im upset over. Its the months i spent caring so much about tw, because i was naive enough to buy the family guild line. I just feel so lied to and used.<br>

A person says they like them but can't afford them, so you dropped it to 150k because you saw they were in your guild (or old guild) that you were quitting.  The deal was done for 140k.

Here's my question....what would have happened if you had sold them to some random player that wasn't in TW?  Would you still expect the gloves to be returned to you because you decided you wanted them back after all?<br>
<br>
Now, what if the person who bought them sold the hand items he had been using, or gave them to someone else.  Because you changed your mind 2 days later, he should give them back?<br>
<br>
I understand the frustration...but you sold them.  If you weren't fully sure, you shouldn't have sold them.  Doesn't matter if they were yours, the guilds, whoevers.  That point is irrelevent.<br>

No one told me to return my gloves. And when prien was selling his monk on pa i specificly remember reading that his monk was equiped with aow pants so /shrug.

HI folks, let me tell you what its like to be a mage in tw!<br>
<br>
TW: hey lets go kill a mob!<br>
(TW then proceeds to attempt mob, and fucks up as usual)<br>
TW: KILL PETS KILL PETS PETS ARE THE REASON WE ARE FAILING, NOT BECAUSE OUR LEADERSHIP SUCKS!!!<br>
ME: Um, why do we need to kill pets, we wiped because of (any given reason, pick one), why cut off about 400+ dps just as a knee jerk reaction?<br>
TW: DAMNIT DO IT! JUST KILL THE FVCKING PETS!<br>
<br>
Look, im not a moron. I know when and where to use my pet. For example, against cursed is a valid reason not to use a pet for some mages with poor resists. But whenever tw fails AT ANY MOB, the first thing we are told is kill the pets even when its quite obvious we need dps and pets were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>helping</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

Oh well, and i hated how the &quot;tw elite&quot; would get together and form little groups leaving the rest of the members to rot trying to form groups for shards/aaexp/65 whatever.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I probably wouldnt have even asked for them back, because i wouldnt expect them to show a stranger any sympathy. But then again, i wouldnt have sold them to a stranger for less than 200k, either. Totally different situation you see.<br>
<br>
See, the reason i am upset is not because i lost the gloves, its mostly because i was used. There is supposedly a &quot;kinship&quot; in tw, a kinship which i had pretty much always respected. I had always given tw members discounts on everything i sold, i always helped tw members whenever i could. Whereas, the moment i need that &quot;kinship&quot; to work in my favor, despite the fact i had displayed it to the very same person <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hours</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ago, i was rejected. BUt thats one person, not the whole guild. What really inspired me to write this rant was the fact the guild leaders <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>support</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said persons descision.  Do you understand why i am forming this rant now?<br>

you rock noonie, im gonna quit now and go cry in the shower. Only King momo will save me! Sharn i need you!!! Ya im upprcrust in TW, i just need my leet exp, exp is SOOOOO fun its the only reason i play this game. To sit in a zone killing the same mob over and over and watch teh little bar go up and get a cool AA point to make me a better person. And for all the people wanting to join TW because we claim we are a family guild, Dont. We are evil and club baby seals everytime we wipe on a mob. Seals are almost extinct now due to how much we wipe. We are the Thunderwipers. We down a mob once then wipe 10 times before we kill him again. Im done here now, if i learned anything from reading these boards, its that Noonie doesnt ever shut up once she gets going. buh bye and enjoy this rant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aaldaridrachenfuer>Aaldari Drachenfuer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(4/19/03 3:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Plethra and TW</span><hr size=1> &lt;steals some of Virest's popcorn and flops down next to him&gt;<br>

There isn't anything you can do about it anymore,  after you hit trade its out of your hands.  Now all you can do is rant and make yourself look bad.<br>

I think you're probaly an ok guy, but in raiding guilds, opinions aren't really that neccesary.

Once you prove what you can do, then you can move up and try your own ideas, and it must be a lot easier to throw your idea up in the air when tensions aren't high and there isn't 50 people trying to tell one person how a raid should go.  Hell, you could plan a raid, and then if it works out, you'd get a good reputation, and you'd be right.  But it's very hard and kind of undermining when it's done during the raid.<br>

This is precisely why im upset. TW prefers to go about with an air of snobbery, as if they are somehow superior to the other raiding guilds since there is a family atmosphere amongst its members. FE is about LOOT but tw, oh in tw there is &quot;something&quot; else there.<br>
<br>
I just figured out that was a lie. If you cant see how thats upsetting, well then /shrug.<br>
<br>
When i first wrote this i was really upset, ive now kinda just accepted the fact ive been screwed out of my gloves and time (with the guild), so eh. Whatever. If i wanted to be in a pure raiding guild i would have just went the fe path in eq. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 4/19/03 4:40:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kelarn>kelarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(4/19/03 4:48 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Plethra and TW</span><hr size=1> - pilot to bombadeer......<br>

First of all im not a guy.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of this post i can only laugh, youve obviously never raided with tw. First let me explain something, tw is very sloppy and disorganized, which is the biggest reason they fail so often.<br>
Sure i can totally understand not letting a new mage not use their pet for awhile. But tw doesnt LET you prove yourself. I have without hitch used my pet on every single mob where i was ordered to kill my pet. I know what to do with my pet, i know its strengths and weaknesses. The bottom line is, tw calls for the death of pets whenever they are frustrated. Its about as logical a descision as me lashing out on the board was. Its about emotional release. The two oldest mages in tw <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> kill their pets when the knee jerk call is made. Both of these mages are definitely competant too. <br>
<br>
But anyway, i didnt come here to complain about the details of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>why</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> this was the last straw, waladce started all of that in some attempt to villify me. I just came here to rant about being screwed by my guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#0E0E0E><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=earlic>Earlic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(4/19/03 5:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Plethra and TW</span><hr size=1> Based on reading this post so far I like Waldace and I have  not been a big pro TW person in the past (on record I believe).
