<br>
    We encountered a group of people from Tolkien's Revenge when entering the Plane of Growth this evening.  We had reserved the zone nearly two weeks ahead of time using the calendar and were surprised to find them fighting in the zone.  When I asked them what they were up to they said &quot;we're just an exp group&quot;  and that they did not count as a raid.  They refused to leave the zone and continued hunting as the night wore on.  Further questioning lead to the response &quot;of petition a GM&quot;.  I did this as was told that Verant will not take a position on on reservations, this is enforced by players.<br>
<br>
    Should you run into members of this guild, please let them know your opinion of their actions.  The reservation system works nicely to as a system to share the older planes.  It's a shame to see that some folks are selfishly working to destroy the system.<br>

I don't know any TR members personally, but that is pretty self centered and rude behavior from ANYone!  I've been EQing for about a year and half, and for as long as I can remember, the old world Planes and dragons have been reserved on these forums and the players have stuck to them quite well out of respect for eachother.  The fact that someone has gone against it and blatantly ignored an age old tradition greatly bothers me.  It's that kind of behavior that deteriorates the game and ruins everyone's gaming experience.  It's too bad that Verant won't get involved, but I can respect their standpoint.  It IS a player matter.  Players started it.  Players uphold it.  It's just a crying shame that there are some players out there out to ruin it.  But what can we do about it?  Nothing, really.  And that just sucks.<br>
However, we CAN take heart in the fact that perhaps one day we'll run into some of these people in-game, and those people will need our help with something, and we can tell them to take a long walk off a short pier!  Hahahahahaha!!<br>

There was no scheduled guild raid last night, and the folks in PoG were there without my knowledge, though I have to admit that if they were just there as an xp group, what harm could they possibly be doing?

Some folks actualy have to set aside RL time, sometimes days in advance, to attend a raid.

<br>
I was with Rhus in POG last night when this occured. IMHO one exp group does not make a huge difference but, when a plane is reserved players should respect the reservation and:<br>
<br>
a. not enter the plane knowing its reserved<br>
or<br>
b. leave once the party that reserved the plane arrives<br>
<br>
We had high hopes of killing a lot of the East side mobs but upon entry to the zone almost all of them had been removed. Thus lowering the reserved parties chances at drops, gems, plat and spells. <br>
<br>
Its all about respect of your fellow players and treating them as you would want to be treated. If this is whats to be expected from TR then the next time they reserve a plane I suppose I will have an EXP group there too. What comes around goes around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fimble>Fimble</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Administrator<BR>Master Cobbler</span><br>  Posts: 512<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/8/02 11:11:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tolkien's Revenge (</span><hr size=1> Yeah, I agree, Quiss and will be talking to some members.

<br>
One group (to them) may not hurt a raid for another guild, but they don't know the intentions of that raid or the targets of that raid - ie is it a cash pharming raid, armor, experience working as a team, etc.<br>
<br>
The reservation system, IMO, benefits those it should - those guilds who still need something from the zone (armor, raid experience, etc.).  <br>
<br>
How many places have an abundance of mobs where a guild can go and kill mobs for hours (with no one else around to bother) to help train its youth on proper raid techniques?  I doubt people would leave BW, DL, ME or another zone so a raid could occur.  In a plane, you get several hours of together time, working together, dying together perhaps.<br>
<br>
Just one thought I had that I've never seen listed before on these posts (at least the ones I've read).<br>

The minute it becomes acceptable to ignore the calendar and XP in PoG, or any other old world plane, is the minute these zones become worthless to the rest of us that still need zones like these.<br>
<br>
There was only one group up there when we came in, no idea how long they had been there, but they had been there long enough to kill enough mobs that we got to kill 3 at our first camp spot, and track was completely clean and we had to move. <br>
<br>
That's a pretty substantial amount of mobs IMHO, and that was only one group.  Mobs that don't come back for 24 hours or longer.  Now just imagine if this was a FFA XP zone, with several groups hunting there at any given time.  <br>
<br>
Yep, that's right, not a damn thing left for anyone that actually needs the place.  <br>
<br>
That is the reason that the calendar cannot be ignored, because when people start thinking that it is OK to break it and just screw the rest of us cause they are uber, that is what will happen.<br>

I NEED the 6k I can pull out of there per hour in cash drops just as much as someone in your guild needs the noctavigant bracer that may drop.  Truth being that most guilds would do as well or better to farm Kael arena vs. the drop rates in PoG -- unless you are after named in PoG, in which case you'd do well to let single groups clear away some of the trash there.   I really think the friendly thing is to a) respect a scheduled raid but also recognize that b) a guild looking for armor drops may be able to propose a decent solution to the problem that a single xp group there may present to their plans.<br>
<br>
If you'd prefer, single groups can post to the calendar to give you a heads-up to their intentions but do you really want to honor my reservation when you see : &quot;Friday, 9pm-2am, Futsau raids gale wolves, plains steeds, and glade stalkers...this raid is closed, and is limited to Futsau, so please plan accordingly&quot;<br>

<br>
  You've just let the people not reserving the area decide what is small, what is not alot of mobs, and what mobs are fair game.  Is a group of lvl 55s ok, and a group of 65s not? <br>
<br>
All I am saying the guild or group of people that reserve the area should be given the benefit of the doubt and have the zone on their own terms not the exp group that could go to the 40 other zones that don't require a reservation.<br>
<br>
Plus I think there is a verant run reservation program coming in the near future.  Its already on Storm Hammer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quisss>Quisss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/9/02 10:23:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tolkien's Revenge (</span><hr size=1> So in some peoples mind, an exp group is allowed to completely disregard a calendar/reservation system that has been a community standard for a vey long time just because they want drops and exp. I can see where they are coming from by saying &quot;hey theres plenty of mobs to share for everyone&quot; but thats not really the point. The point is that the zone was RESERVED for us. The exp group totally disregarded the fact that we had the reservation on the calendar in the appropiate manner that is supposed to be followed by the community. When you decided to zone in and start taking out mobs you lowered the overall amount of mobs that we had a right to via our reservation. <br>
<br>
Sure you say go fight in Kael or other places where drops are more available but maybe you should follow your own logic there and leave a zone when its reserved party arrives. Its the right thing to do if you want people to do the same for you in the future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ciypher>Ciypher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 214<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/9/02 7:56:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tolkien's Revenge (</span><hr size=1> Clearly everyone doesn't think it's the right thing todo, or they would do what you mention. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rhus1>Rhus1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/10/02 8:03:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=374.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tolkien's Revenge (</span><hr size=1> Fimble - Thank you for addressing the issue with your guildmates.  As many people have mentioned, the plane of growth is a good exp zone, but a strong group can take out many of the mobs that a raiding force might be targeting.  This is especially true of the named mobs on the west side of the river.  I think it's just a matter of remembering to check the calendar before bringing up an exp group.  That should avoid such problems in the future.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
