Feeble Minded was born. It was a cool summer evening, one that is very rare in Felwith in that time of year, when Feeble was born to his parents - Exarch Narises the Vicar and Mistress Bually the Sorcerer. Feeble grew up with many of his friends and learned the basic of magic but decided that he would take after his mother's grace of destroying evil with the flick of her wrist. Of course, teaching a child about destructive powers of magic isn't always as easy as it seems. For example that fire in 2401 that almost destroyed the whole... oh wait, we all choose to forget that one hehe!!<br>
<br>
Slowly but surely, Feeble memorized his magic spells, sometimes accidently casting Frost Shock on himself and Minor Shielding on monsters he was trying to kill but all in all, everything seemed to be fine. Every month Narises, Bually and Feeble would go to Tunare, the Mother of All and pray for a happy year and for Feeble to succeed in the arts of Sorcery. Tunare gave her blessing to the three of them and told Feeble that he would change the world one day, that he had the power to end all that was bad in the name of Tunare !<br>
<br>
At the ranking of 4 though, Feeble decided it was time to go. He took some bags and scrolls and set his goal on going to Kelethin, the city of the Elves. He met many bold adventurer's that talked about killing Orcs, bats, moss snakes and even killed the Emperor of the Crushbone Orcs himself ! What an impossible task that would be, Emperor Crush has slain thousands of young elves that have thought he could be conquered. Day in and out, Feeble witness people rant and rave about Emperor Crush and how he was such a &quot;gimp&quot; as they called him. Feeble watched as he saw numerious elves march off into Crushbone and find them back in their bind with no armor and weapons about 20 minutes later.<br>
<br>
Feeble went back to practicing his art of destruction on a few orcs, bats, and even skeletons! Soon, at the rank of 6, Feeble and some other adventurers decided it was time to take back Orc Hill and began to work their way up the trecherous hill. It was not an easy task - much blood was spilled and many death's followed but Feeble and his noble friends where finally on the hill. Waves and waves of orcs soon followed, each wave getting harder and harder! With swords clashing against meat, and some nice firepower (/flex) the hill was defeated! All rejoiced as much &quot;ph4t l3vvt&quot; and experience was gained that day.<br>
<br>
More to come hopefully ....<br>
