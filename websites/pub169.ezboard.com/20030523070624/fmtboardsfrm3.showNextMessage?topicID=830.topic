<br>
I have made my life a living hell on EQ............<br>
<br>
I WILL hope that I can just be left alone and let me have fun... PLEASE dont /ooc or send me tells harassing me. I am done with all these games and BS.<br>
<br>
I will be trying my damdest to work on my reputation.( If Possible) At this point I dont know if I can ever get it back ... But i will try. I am sorry for causing you all any problems and am sorry for lieing to AV. I really loved AV and hope I have not brought them any problems. I AM SORRY!!!<br>
<br>
Yes I am saying I was wrong, yes I am saying I am sorry, yes I am trying to be a better person, and own up to my mistakes. I hope that you all will forgive me...... <br>
<br>
As for my REAL friends on EQ, thanks for sticking with me and just being my friend. I hope I have not hurt you in anyway.<br>
<br>
I will not be doing another name change, I will live with my reputation. I guess I will be guildless for a long time, at this point I dont think ANY guild will give me a chance. But one day I hope to prove to you all here on MT that I really am a good person and meant no harm. I just was VERY hurt and upset at TW, that they would not give me a chance. I made a wrong choice and i dug myself a grave. NOW i am trying to get out... i hope you all wont keep pushing me back in ..........<br>
<br>
Jerrea, Kelmore, Nich and Malaehi, I am personally addressing you all cuase this all started with u four. I am sorry for anything / all I have done to you or said bad about you. You all are very EXP players and i respect you. I hope you all can forgive me and give me a chance.<br>
<br>
Well there it is... I dont expect any of you to forgive me for my actions. I dont expect any of you to trust me. That is something i have to earn. All i ask is for you all to give me a chance.<br>
<br>
Your friend,<br>
<br>
Telena / Fadeaway<br>
<br>
PS... and yes i am a very BAD speller... so please hold that against me as well<br>

I questioned the rantings on Telena because I had never grouped with her and dont know abilities or lack thereof.  All I know about Telena really is that whenever I would see her on I would BS with her and she was always a real sweetheart toward me.<br>

It's just a game, one some of us spend a lot of time on, but in the end, EQ has it's place:  entertainment.

I hate to say it, but folks will never let you live this down no matter how nice/sweet/skilled/perfect you are in the future. I've seen it too many times on these boards, once a reputation is ruined there's no going back. Just start over because two years from now you'll still be getting tells from some spiteful ass telling you what a horrible person you are. And no one can take too much of that, especially if they're genuinely trying to change.<br>
<br>
Start a new character, try a new race and perhaps class. Change your ID on the boards and don't look back. Don't post as Telena or Fadeaway again. If you don't do this, then you probably won't make it. Fadeaway will still be getting tells and someone will push you a little too far and you'll do something or post something that'll only cause you more grief. The same thing happened to Talorb, Pardus and others.<br>
<br>
People can be pretty cruel when they don't have to look you in the eye, so just avoid all that and start over.<br>

<br>
Thanks for the advice, I have already gotten many tells in game that were positive. <br>
<br>
Fimble, thanks for the advice but I will not be hiding or trying to run from my past. I made mistakes and will live with them. If certain people want to bash me and just be mean, then let them... they will just learn a world of /ignore.<br>
<br>
I have many good friends on MT. My real EQ friends know what I am all about. I have helped many on MT and will contuine to help..... I am in sales in RL and I take rejection well so its &quot;OK.&quot;<br>
