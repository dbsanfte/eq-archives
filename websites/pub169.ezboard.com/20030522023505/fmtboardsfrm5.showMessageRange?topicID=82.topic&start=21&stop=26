I don't remember much of the wierd ones.  I remember for like 2 months though when I worked at a Target EVERY DAMN NIGHT I dreamed that I woke up, went to work and worked for 9 hours then went home.  Not a single thing was wierd about it, it was just a dream of a completely normal, mundane day at work.<br>
<br>
But the thing that absolutely sucked about it was that right when I got done with my work-day in the dream I'd wake up and have to go to work for 9 hours for real.  God that pissed me off, it felt like I was working 18 hours a day.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only other corney dream I remember was quite some time ago.  I just remember I was dressed in mostly black &quot;spy&quot; clothes and dodging bad guys in some huge cellar.  I had a sweet machine gun and was shooting their ass but then I ran out of bullets.  And I remember thinking in my dream &quot;Dammit! This is probably a dream, in dreams you can do anything why can't I make some fookin' bullets appear?!?!&quot;.  And then since I couldn't make bullets appear I started getting worried it wasn't a dream after all and that I might die.  So then I turned into a wuss and ran around trying not to run into more bad guys until I woke up.  It was so lame.  /sigh <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=63829>Baron Lexicus Magnavin</a>

<br>
im in a waterpark with a ancient roman theme, collums, white marble, etc. there are a bunch of black children, about six to eight, running around, having fun, splashing. im the only adult, and the only white person i can see. i seem to be floating about ten or fifteen feet off the ground, and nobody notices me. <br>
<br>
i float over to a giftshop like they have at amusment parks, crappy little things for too much money. i go in, land, and walk over to a jewelry case, and look it over. a middle aged man is behind the counter, reading a newspaper. i see two pins, little cherubs in gold, and remember reading that two children had bought pins like this at this waterpark, and died shortly after in an accident at the park.<br>
<br>
i mention this to the guy behind the counter, and notice that the back page of the newspaper has a picture of the two girls and an article about the accident, and say that he should rethink selling those pins. he asks what im talking about, and i try to explain, but hes not getting it.<br>
<br>
then i notice whats behind him: a floor to ceiling tube aquarium with some large fish. all of the sudden the water is flushed out, and i can see a grating in the bottom of the tube. two little girls, the girls in the picture, fall down onto the grating from the ceiling, landing hard. they get up, look around, and start yelling and thumping on the inside of the glass to be let out. i start yelling at the guy to get them out of there, but he wont turn around, just looks at me like im speaking another language.<br>
<br>
then the children are flash-fried by a huge gout of fire that shoots up from under the grating. i can see blood and grease come out of their hands, which are pressed against the inside of the glass. i can hear muffled screams, i can see the pain and fear on their faces, and eventually they fall back into the tube behind the fire, but i can still see their handprints on the inside, boiling off the glass, and im screaming, and the man doesnt understand.<br>
<br>
then i wake up.<br>
<br>
fun, huh. i have chronic nightmares, but this is my most memorable/ least favorite. <p><img src=http://user.netomia.com/blindedhorse/Sosoca_Baphomet2.jpg><Br>

I was back in highschool ( I am 2 years removed now), and I was walking the hallways. Until I come to this one teacher's room, whom I had really liked. Only he wasn't there, and as I was looking around the room, I see a door that wasn't there before. I go through this door, and I walk into this outside area that is fluttering with red flower petals on the breeze.<br>
<br>
There was a stone hendge-looking thing in the middle of the outside area, and it was surrounded by water. In the center of it, was an object of some kind of power. Standing by it was a student I had known, and he was pondering picking it up. Somehow I instinctively knew that he could not handle that power alone. So, right as he touched it, I did as well..<br>
<br>
The world exploded, well mine anyways. I was back in the school, but I was different. I...I had all the power I had ever dreamed, and another thing, i could sense the other kid felt the same thing. <br>
<br>
And with this power I did terrible things, black and red tornadoes screamed through the hallways, destroying all in their path. And with this power, I didn't really care about anything. People, objects, everything fell before me. <br>
<br>
And then I went into this one room, where these 2 girls were. One was crying on the other's shoulder, about how her boyfriend was dead. And this struck to me. I stopped everything I was doing, and realized what I had done. I became sad and remorseful.<br>
<br>
So I walked out onto the hallway ( which were remarkably untouched....I dunno) and I am walking back to the doorway, that leaded to the stone statues, and I look back. I see this girl whom I had loved along time ago...<br>
<br>
When she nears, i see she is with some of her friends. as the pass me by, we lock eyes. So much passed there...in and that eternal moment I saw..the death of me. She shakes her head as she passes by, and when they are gone, i crumple to the ground. All the life that was ever in me is gone...and blue light slowly dawns on my limp form. <br>
<br>
I get up, emotionally dead, and walk to where I sense the other part of me that touched the power. I walk up to it, and say clearly, &quot;I wish to die&quot;. It looks down, and raises it's fist, and punches me in the face. As the fist struck, I woke up... <p><img src ="http://www.imahosting.com/sigs/nazgulsig.jpg

Anyways Im at south padre (parents had a condo there) and Im playing in the sand, but Im the only person there. All the regular structures are still there, but no people. So I eventually go out into the water and I dive under a wave, as I come up....the surface is now glass and I cant get out. This goes on for awhile and as I feel my last breath giving way, I wake up breathing as if I had just come off a soccer field of playing mid-field.<br>

Generally I dont remember dreams or even know I have them, I lay in the dark and next thing i realize is that its morning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showMessageRange?topicID=82.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=82.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=82.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=26><img src=http://www.pwshift.com/tr/images/mt/addreply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=82.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=82.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=82.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=82.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#628CBC>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5>Off Topic</a> <font color=#628CBC> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#628CBC> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
