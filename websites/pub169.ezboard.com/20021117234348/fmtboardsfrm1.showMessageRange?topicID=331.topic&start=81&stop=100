Actually TRYING to do the Rogue Redmption (Burning Rapier quest).<br>

Giving up on damned quest...<br>

Getting SMEARED all over the place by big scary undead mobs in Kithicor the night PoH went live (lil lvl 15 rogue killed by mobs right at zone in, right before Innorruuk showed up and Death Touched the zone)<br>

Playing a rogue to lvl 20 before Evade was added to game.<br>
<br>
Having to have 2 rogues in a group in Oasis (get on either side of a mob, space your backstabs out by 5 seconds each, then keep each other alive by aggroing mob with backstab... we called it PingPong)<br>
<br>
When Verant went and made rogues Invis to UNDEAD when sneak/hiding.<br>
<br>
Defeating a lvl 20 warrior with full banded as a lvl 15 rogue with leather and a Dagger of Dropping (he didnt understand why I kept spinning around him so much.

Necros protesting En Masse when Verant made their pets Suicide when they FDed (necros used to make pets in Paw, fight their way deep in, find a safe camp their pet could solo, then feign death and go to sleep for the night).<br>

<br>
Being level 5 and invited to join Uberguild (to me at least <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) White Star Legion by then Uber level 8-ish Darkdoc.<br>
<br>
My first visit outside of Faydwer to Freeport, seeing some necro killing Lady Shea and thinking &quot;Oh my gawd! That bastard is killing the lady on the box cover!!!&quot; I was mortified.<br>
<br>
Hunting Aquagobs in Dagnors with Darkroc, Evenstar and Xanthias (if memory serves) and being so incumbered with rusty crap, I could not run away when we got swarmed. They were all able to make it to Unrest, I couldnt move to save my life. Laughing the whole time.<br>
<br>
Running from GFay to the boats in BB with Darkdoc and Evenstar, when smart me decides to shoot and arrow at a Agua Gob running past the guards near the dock, and hitting a guard.<br>
<br>
Shouting to GFay for folks not to zone into Crushbone because some high level PK'r with a pet named Retlon Brenclog was killing all the newbies that zoned in.<br>
<br>
Camping the Castle in Crushbone at around level 15 and meeting then newbie Leodinous.<br>
<br>
Sneaking around UGuk for hours looking for LGuk, running out of food and afraid I was going to die of starvation and loose my corpse.<br>
<br>
Sneaking down to the Savant room as the &quot;Iggles&quot; owned the zone, and let me loot my DE mask.<br>
<br>
SNEAKING and HIDING from Freeport to Qeynos (took almost 3 RL hours) scared to death.<br>
<br>
Watching a bard pull the Sarnak Fort in LOIO for our gorup and seeing the entire fort come over the wall at us. Something about AE DD's and a running bard? /shrug Then learning when a bard says &quot;selos!&quot; you should hang onto her and run. I didn't. I ended up running and when I died, my unconsious corpse slid along the groud into another group and I ended up post-mortum training Cinnamon to Druid. Zone was still shouting my name when I made the run back from FV.<br>
<br>
Which in turn was the fisrt time I ever shouted &quot;STFU!&quot; zonewide. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Falling off the Ice Bridge in the newly discovered Thurgadin while showing off to my guildmates my l33t Peggy Flemming immitation. Who knew that the ice had a ledge?<br>
<br>
No one had GD port capability back then, so I spent about an hour singing &quot;Noooobody knows the trouble I seen,,,&quot; down in the pit, until Treelore took pity on me and lev'd down and ported me out. To ICECLAD. /sigh<br>
<br>
On my druid..<br>
<br>
Practicing spells on myself at the Freeport Dock, rooting myself then accidently nockbacking myself into the water where I proceeded to drown while memming gate.<br>
<br>
Fighting a Griff in EC, loosing SoW, resowing myself and forgetting to retarget as I tried to root the Griff thus rooting myself. Gated to Thurg with 40hp left.<br>
<br>
Fighting a Snow Griff in EW, tossed root on him, JUST as he was in my face and JUST as he rooted ME! Nuke-fest ensued. I won but was OOM, Half bub of heath, rooted and standin in the middle of EW with mobs all around.<br>

Getting on lists for camps in High Pass and the basement in High Pass Keep.<br>
<br>
Having a blast with groups at Orc 1 and Orc 2 in EC, Throne Room in Crushbone, goblin camps in Butcherblock.<br>
<br>
Not knowing where in heaven's name you were going and then discovering EQAtlas and EQMaps.<br>
<br>
Running my Level 20 Dwarf Paladin from Freeport to Qeynos for the first time.<br>
<br>
The trains while pulling from Unrest with my Monk or Paladin.<br>
<br>
The thrill of going on your first Hate and Fear raids.  And the hours of waiting afterwards from the total wipeouts.<br>
<br>
Those stupid portal keys in Velious.<br>
<br>
The hours spent riding the boat between Antonica and Faydwer.  Got a couple of characters over 100 fishing skill doing that.<br>
<br>
Casting the first port spell by my druid.<br>
<br>
Riding the Icebreaker to Velious for the first time.<br>
<br>
Running to Seb for the first time, solo.  I had just got my key a day or two earlier and had yet to visit there.  Then I got a tell from one of my friends.  His group had just lost their porter, were at the entrance and needed to get out.  Took me several minutes to locate the entrance, dodging all those undead.<br>
<br>
Getting my epic.  Sweating the turn-ins when the NPC wouldn't respond.  The relief and elation when I finally had it.<br>
