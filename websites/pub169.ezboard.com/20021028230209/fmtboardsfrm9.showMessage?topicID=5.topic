I do carry a 10 slot tailoring kit with me but some items require SPECIAL kits.. ie All veliuous tailoring. It would be more than I can do to carry 4 kits along with all my other stuff. <br>
<br>
As far as charging 500pp per combine. You have to remeber it cost on avrage 500k-800kpp to achieve GM tailoring I am a FULL 250 tailor not 233 +5% tailor. And most of the items I make can and do sell for 1k-30kpp. Now if the item you wanted was say Wu's armor I could be presuaded to do all the combines for 500 ie . full set or somthign I dont know.. but my time is worth PP to me.. Why should I stop what I am doing so you can get your item for free? I dont mean to rant but I hate it when ppl come  here and whine over a 500pp per success rate.. Check out prices on other servers.. min is 1k on 90% I have and always will be 30%+ lower than every other server.. I do this cuz I love MT and as a communittee they have always been ehre for me.<br>

If everyone was happy to just hit the combine button for you, how would you ever make up for all the pp, time and failures, not to mention why would anyone ever want to get to the GM level if someone else would do it for nothing. I have spent lots of time doing tailoring which I suck at, Fletching which has cost a lot of pp and many failures and running here and there for brewing supplies not to mention the time taken to do foraging for brewing.

<br>
As one who is a Tradeskiller and has the goal of 250 Fletching and 200 in any other trade I can do, I completely agree.  Those who want you to combine this and that often come with the idea that you will do it for free.  I have spent a lot of time and money to get to the levels I am, these people choose not too so as a price they pay is cash.  A simple example are the 10 Slot Tailored Backpacks.  I normally sell them for 50pp.  If you bring me the pelt and pattern I could just save you the 20pp that you would have paid for the pelt and charge you 30pp.  Still a steal.  Normally if they ask I will go 15pp to 20pp.<br>
<br>
Now Flix has stuff that is much higher end.  As she said, some of her stuff can sell for oodles of money.  Is it right to expect her to combine for free or even a meager 50pp  on an item you can turn around and sell for 6k?  The hundreds of thousands of Plat she has spent to be able to make an item that isnt trivial even to her and she should do it for free?  500p for the combine is a steal.  When the person is done with the item, are they going to say &quot;Here Mistress Flix, you have worked soo hard.  If you give me the 50/500pp I paid you then you can buy this back and sell it for profit.&quot;  Ummmm.... no.  <br>
<br>
She has nowhere to go from 250, there arent tradeskill AA points.  <br>
<br>
Most commonly when I find people looking for a combine and they ask me how much, I simply tell them to pay me what it is worth to them.  If they press for a price I tell them to pay me what it was worth to them to not spend the hours and money to get to my level.  In most instances they pay me more than I would have charged anyways.  If they try to pay an outrageous price, I give them some of it back.  I will often say as well that I will take trades of things I cant get or dont want to take the time to get.  You are a 4th level Ranger wanting a bow?  Dont have the money?  If you seem trustworthy I might make you a Carved Elm and 10 stacks of arrows in exchange for a stack or 2 of pixie dusts.  You want some cellestial essences done and I know of you and you have a good reputation and are high enough to go to ME or AR?  Get me some Mindworm Meat or Centi Toes/Meat and we will call it even.<br>
<br>
I have spent a lot of time and money doing these trades.  Yes, I love them, but still.  Those who want to complain about prices for combines should quit whining and go work up that skill.<br>
<br>
I am sorry, but I treat those who EXPECT me to do combines for free like with those who want to know &quot;Do you have anything for free, I am a 1 Ranger.&quot;  I tell them that I am completely untwinked and worked very hard to get where I am, I expect others to do the same.

A person spends money getting up to the level they are at.  Some can get money back, others eat the loss.  Me, I&quot;m committed to getting to 250 on baking.  208 and counting.  It's not easy, and yes, parts were cheap, other parts weren't.  And aren't.  <br>
<br>
On pottery, that is just expensive past a certain point.  I was asked by a friend to do a few combines on several things.  No biggie, sure.  That same friend, when asked immediately after if the could do some combines for me for JC, told me it would be 300pp per combine.  /gasp.  Oh, and those things I had just combined for them?  For free?  They were selling them for 1200pp each...and I had done 20 of them.  I was in shock and said no thanks.  Also they made my short list of no combines ever.  or ports or rezzes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Point is.....it's up to ME if I charge you.  Just like it's up to ME if I choose not to.  It's not up to you to decide I'm charging too much.  Go somewhere else then.  I took the time to get to the levels I'm at......why don't you?<br>

Components + 500pp per combine for 250 level Tailoring? That is a steal, and please don't abuse the good offer either and ruin it for everyone else.  I -do- know some of what Flix went through (yeah, just a fractionally small part, but some).  I am just glad I am trying to get to 200 after some of these newer recipes were put into place, can you imagine doing it back when there was no bridge?  Her mule(s) were overflowing with parts.  And more Plat-value than I am likely to see.  Why do you think the 250 Tailor is so rare?<br>

Now with the potc robe it's about 100 times cheaper and easier and I still cry everytime I think about advancing from 171 skill much higher.<br>
<br>
500pp for a successful combine on a 5k item is not only reasonable, but generous.<br>

Since Flix is currently the only 250 tailor who's AROUND much(/cry Aubron), she could pretty much charge what she wanted, but she doesn't. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=227930">Nadime</a>

Flix, you keep your prices and anyone that doesn't like the pay on success can go lick a SG's behind. <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Life dies inside a person when there are no others

<br>
In the near future I will have all the components necessary for 5 tries on a tigerraptor cloak.  Already have 6 drake eggs and more than 2 stacks of velium pieces (must finish velium gathering), along with some coldain temper.  Would have been much easier just to pay the 500pp, but now that I have most of the stuff, was wondering if I could trade it all for one cloak.<br>
<br>
I'm making the possibly incorrect assumption that in 5 tries you'll get 1 cloak and at least 1 x-tra one that you could sell.<br>
<br>
Would you prefer I just bring along the stuff for a couple of tries with my 500pp, and maybe I'll just try to sell the rest? <p>52 Path(To bind point)Finder of MT</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ubouya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bouya</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/29/02 8:51:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Taiiloring By'Flix is now open in bazaar!!!</span><hr size=1> Flix is cool, 500pp for a &quot;successful&quot; combine on high end item is a gift.<br>
If you find it expensive :<br>
1 - bring your tailoring skill high enough to make stuff yourself<br>
2 - buy an already combined item on bazaar at market price <p><table border=0><TR><TD><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=77696>Master Bouya,  Maître des Ténèbres</A>, Arch Mage <BR>
