<br>
You posted Saturday that you would reserve Naggy again Sunday Morning, but you didnt do any Post !!!<br>
<br>
So i reserved Naggy Sunday Morning around 1:50am INSIDE the 2 weeks rule, as i would have done also when same would have happened on calendar.<br>
<br>
BTW, the reservation you mentioned for advance in July was only a posting of the DATE in EUROPEAN Format, which means:<br>
<br>
DD/MM/YY so 06/04/03 means 6th April 2003<br>
<br>
Inside the post there really was a fault, as Sorbus posted:<br>
<br>
Sunday !!! 8th (fault here) April !!!<br>
<br>
Take your to early reservation and your missed RE-Reservation as your fault, and do better next time !!!<br>

<br>
But as the calendar is down at least since 27th March, how can you have a reservation INSIDE 2 weeks rule on it ???<br>
<br>
This post here <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1419.topic" target="top">Web site down</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
states, that AS LONG calendar is down, the SCHEDULE-Forum will act as the calendar and UNDER THE SAME RULES.<br>
<br>
Now, at least it doesnt say that everyone can reserve what he likes in whatever time in advance he wants, which for me means that the Calendar rules for reservations still should be active.<br>
<br>
FIRST possible reservation-time for Naggy on 13th is:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  03/30/03 0:00:01am &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
And here we find the following posts:<br>
<br>
- NerakUG 03/26/03 3:01:52am 13th April 03 UG Closed-Naggy<br>
<br>
- NerakUG 03/29/03 2:59:47pm reply as you got told above reservation may not hold (this reply still before 2 weeks)!!!<br>
<br>
- MADSUM 03/30/03 1:46:50am Naggy-Open 13th April<br>
<br>
- NerakUG 04/01/03 10:27:34am you found out someone else reserved Naggy on 13th<br>
<br>
According to that, THIS (your) post is BEFORE the 2 weeks rule, and ours is THE FIRST inside (if i didnt miss another).<br>
<br>
Enough said !!!<br>
<br>
As long THORADOR doesnt tell us that your reservation is correct we will stay to ours.<br>

We can argue back and forth for ever.  However.  i am willing to compramise.  You are wanting the Warrior Piece.  I am wanting the Paladin Piece.  have your Guild members show up at the Raid that I Have scheduled.  I will reserve the Warrior item for your person,  the Book for me.  All other items are going to be Randomed off anyway.<br>
<br>
If your are amiable to that solution.  it will work for me.<br>

Nothing to argue here.  You are in the wrong; it is not your raid that gets to decide what gets dolled out.  It's bizarre that the calendar went down the day after I warned you that you were 4 days ahead of the 2 week notice (3 and change really), but that's neither here or there.<br>
<br>
As of the 27th, Fimble stated posts here count as valid and the first WITHIN 2 WEEK RULE post is the one to reserve it.  That wasn't you.<br>
<br>
Now, the other guild can say sure, we'll save the pally book for you or they can do what they want with it.  They may very well try and work things out with you to an amicable end.  But as an outsider here, with no relation to either side, the facts are the facts.  On this board (which is where it now counts), you never reposted the raid within the 2 week time so your original post wasn't valid.<br>

Closed Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> Now, as you wanted to do it as a &quot;Closed Raid&quot; you didnt post a starttime here.<br>
<br>
As most of us are on European-Time, our only chance to attend a Vox/Naggy-Kill is when it starts around 2pm EST.<br>
<br>
Its just very hard work and luck for us to get a reservation done, as we most of the time sleep when the schedule timer for Vox/Naggy starts to run. <br>
For that the Guilds on EST-Time normally have the first shots to reserve them, as the reservation timer starts in there best playtime.<br>
<br>
Also we never know if the Dragons are up early enough, or if they are killed the week before that late (without serverdown in following week) that we simply have to cancel our scheduled attempt cause our people have to log.<br>
<br>
So for sure we wont give up a spawn which we got reserved inside the rules since we know the Dragon will spawn too late for us.<br>
<br>
You and your guildies are welcome to attend our Open-Raid at 2pm EST.<br>
<br>
We have a few pallies waiting on the books, also we have a few people (not only my Bard) waiting on the Red Scale.<br>
<br>
As stated in our schedule, we will claim ONE piece, all other will be rolled NBG.<br>
<br>
If you wont or cant attend under that rules, then pray that Naggy will spawn too late so we have to cancel, and/or GOOD LUCK on getting one of the next spawns reserved.<br>

But that doesnt change the fact that you CANNOT have a correct reservation at calendar, and also you dont have a correct reservation inside the 2 weeks rule here at board.<br>
<br>
What happened is just the little difference between working hard to get a reservation, and just posting one to early and pray others wont see it so it would hold (my appologize if it really was a post by mistake).<br>
<br>
As i said somewhere else, while i was sleeping (cause it was 6am CET here, err 7am CET summertime) you just had around 1h 45 minutes just to do what you posted earlier :<br>

Although posts by others indicated in the title the calendar was down (as early as the 27th). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nerakug>NerakUG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/1/03 4:43:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 April 2003,  Utopian Guard.

You wrote this.  I do not normally read other posts unless I am going to go to their raid.  I also don't generally read the other forums. <br>
<br>
You guys failed by not having this on THIS forum if you were going to change the rules.<br>
<br>
You ALL knew that I was wanting to have a naggy raid on the 13th of April,  Yet you are honestly going to sit back and say that this is MY fault because YOU guys fell down on the job?<br>
<br>
If this board is going to have ANY meaning at all,  Then I suggest that YOU take care of this problem and make sure that ANY rule changes are posted in the proper areas so that people that do not search all the boards for the missing information are well informed.<br>
<br>
For if you do not.  I do believe that all the Calandar mobs will soon become a Free For All.<br>

Closed Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> Hey Nerak, as much as it pains me to say this, you really have 2 people to thank for the mix up with Naggy.  Blux and Delusion (or however they spell their names).  They decided it would be funny to hack the MT website and post some childish script, but in doing so, they caused the site to go down, thus removing the calendar that people had been using.  So if you want to be mad, those 2 are the two to start with.<br>
<br>
Now, you've stated you don't read other forums, but, if you skimmed other posts, you would have seen that the calendar was down.<br>
<br>
Also, you state that Madsum is ganking your mob.  If the calendar had been up, then what?  You obviously weren't aware the calendar was down, because you didn't try to schedule the Naggy raid on the calendar.  Had you tried, you'd have seen that it was down, gone, kaput, error 404, whatever.  <br>
<br>
I'm not taking sides here, only pointing out some things.<br>

Although you may be partially correct to say you think you have been misled, you did have the option to make a post stating (within the 2 week mark) on this forum since you couldn't access the calendar you were retrying for Naggy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">You did not, plain and simple.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  No post of any sort indicating you had trouble posting on the calendar.  No request to have it looked into.  Ignorance only goes so far.

You can NOT pin 100% of this on Fimble when you had options and did not either think to question a faulty calendar or chose not to question a faulty calendar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nerakug>NerakUG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/1/03 6:03:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 April 2003,  Utopian Guard.  Closed Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> One is right is saying that the people that hacked the MT forum are mostly to blame for the calandar being down.  However,  I did attempt to go to the calandar on Midnight Saturday, it was down,  But,  I had already posted on thus calandar that I was wanting to hold a Naggy Raid on 13th of April.  I was kind of hoping that the calandar would be up later that day,  and I had kept checking daily for it to be up.  I do not read the General Forum,  So therefore,  I would not know that there was a rule change.  <br>
<br>
I only finally found out about it, after someone else posted that they wanted Naggy on the same day that I had posted,  and then said that their was a rule change,  and that they get the mob.  <br>
<br>
To me,  that sounds like they are trying to Gank Naggy, no matter how you look at it.  There was NO POST of a rule change in this forum,  so therefore,  people that do not read the other forums searching for rule changes would not know about that.<br>
<br>
I DO have a post on the calandar stating that I want Naggy on 13 April.  IF the calandar was up.  I would have placed another post right after mine ON THE CALANDAR stating again that I wanted it reserved.  How was I to know that the calandar was going to be down for a prolonged period of time,  and HOW was I to know that they posted a rule change in a different forum and NOT on this forum where all raids are scheduled.  <br>

<br>
Ok, first off, I have nothing to do with this forum, or the calendar.  <br>
<br>
Now, to answer your question?  As one player to another?  I would guess because, while you made your intention known, you, after seeing the calendar was down (and who knows what time you started trying to post to it, as well), didn't come here to say &quot;hey guys, I can't access the calendar, it's now within the 2 weeks as the rule states, I'm claiming Naggy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just posting here beyond 2 weeks doesn't mean you'll get the mob.  Can I post that I want naggy on April 20th, and May 4th?  And then since I made it clear that I want Naggy on those days, no one else better post that they want it, because I showed I want those days.<br>
<br>
Well, I can't do that, can I?  Because it's not within the 2 week limit.  <br>
<br>
Thoradar I think is the one who makes the decisions regarding calendar conflicts...hopefully he'll chime in soon if you and Madsum can't get it resolved on your own.<br>

Closed Naggy Raid</span><hr size=1> Aye, your original post was invalid (ie beyond the 2 weeks) so it has no relevance here whatsoever.  Doesn't matter that you wanted that date; as you can't hold a date beyond 2 weeks.  No one can gank your reservation because that original post on this forum was illegally posted (for lack of a better way to phrase it).  <br>
<br>
And yes, you do need to have made a post within the 2 week notice saying you wanted it for you to have any claim to it at all.<br>
<br>
Look back on previous pages; it's always been that way.  There have been posts on these boards or the calendar more than 2 weeks out; and when it came down to 2 weeks time; someone else grabbed the date.  Nothing the first person could do; sure they felt jipped cause &quot;others knew they wanted that date&quot; but want doesn't mean have or gets.  Your want isn't any more important than someone else's want; so it's the faster one to post gets it.<br>
<br>
Try looking at this from an objective point for a minute:<br>
<br>
 - you initially post outside the 2 weeks and admit you saw my post claiming that<br>
 - you go to the calendar on the 30th to post (when it's legal to do so) but it's down.<br>
 - rather than come back here (where you knew there was already the discussion on posting) and say, &quot;hey, I can't post on the calendar cause it's down but I want that date&quot;, you did nothing at all<br>
<br>
Whether this was the right place or not (to your knowledge), a smart person would have let others know he tried to claim it following the rules he admitted he knew about, but you did nothing until you saw someone else post for that date.<br>
<br>
Honor has nothing to do with it.  Someone isn't dishonorable for not respecting an invalid reservation.  <br>
<br>
Sure, some have respected it; myself included a few months ago when a non reservable zone (CoM) raid was listed 3 weeks in advance.  I had already had a raid to CoM planned that same day, for 1 and a half weeks prior to that but rearranged the month's raid schedule to work around it.  I also did the same thing a different month when I wanted PoH on a specific day but someone went too far early...same circumstances.  There's even a thread with this information on it and my comments as such.<br>
<br>
We aren't mind readers, and lack of communication is what causes so many camp issues among other things.  This was stoppable before it got this far, and it still is, if you will look at the facts a bit more objectively.<br>
<br>
1)  Yes, Fimble should have posted here, and you would have known what was up.<br>
<br>
2)  Yes, your original post was beyond the 2 weeks timing and therefore holds no &quot;claim&quot; to the mob wanted.<br>
<br>
3)  Normally when someone can't access a board/forum/calendar, they post letting folks know about it so it can get checked out.  You made no such post.  Had a post been made as we've mentioned, it would have served as your reservation (even if you didn't know it at the time you posted).<br>
<br>
4)  Someone else posted within the 2 weeks rule and reserved the mob you wanted.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nerakug>NerakUG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/1/03 7:40:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=291.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 13 April 2003,  Utopian Guard.

<br>
I did NOT know that there were other discussions on this,  I do not spend my time reading all the other posts about raids that I do not intend to go on.  Nor do I spend my time reading the other forums.<br>
<br>
I DID go to the Calandar that is the normal way to schedule a raid.  The Calandar was Down or else I would have posted ON THE CALANDAR again that I wanted to have Naggy,  Right below my initial post which was only what 3 days to early???  So,  The Calandar is down,  I already had a reservation on the calandar  a BRAND NEW RULE is posted in a completely different forum stating that you had to post in THIS FORUM for a reservation.   Come on now.  For someone who does not read these other forums.  HOW was I to know that I needed to make a cursory post stating the obvious that the Calandar forum is down due to the hacking and that I still want to have my Naggy raid that was the ONLY ONE POSTED on the day that it needed to be posted.  <br>
<br>
IF there actually HAD been the post about THIS forum being the one that needs to be posted in for a reservation,  and not a completely different forum,  Then on that Saturday night I would have posted HERE again to reiterate that I do in fact wanted to have the Naggy Raid on 13 April.    But instead  SOMEONE dropped the ball on that,  posted the new rule in a completely different forum.<br>
<br>
IT was VERY obvious that I wanted to have a Naggy Raid on 13 April.  So I ask again,  WHY should I have posted here again.  Ummmm   everyone knows that I want to have a Naggy Raid,.  I just want to say it again incase someone forgot to read that I posted it here.<br>
