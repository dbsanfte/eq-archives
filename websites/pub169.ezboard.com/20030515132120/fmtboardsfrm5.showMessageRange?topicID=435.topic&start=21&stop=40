Wrong.<br>

Possibly- the majority of EQ playing, under 30, liberal Americans are against the war.<br>
<br>
Likely - the liberal press that you read all about America is agiasnt the war.<br>
<br>
Mostly - The Hollywood crowd, from which you seem to base your view of America is against the war.<br>

I'm not American.  I like guns.  I think that goign to war with Iraq right now is stupid, although it may be necessary later - like when the US comes up with actual proof of wrongdoing.<br>
<br>
Hell right now, there are better supported rants on the MT Rant board than the US position on Iraq.  I was very disappointed with Colin Powell's 5 Feb speech.  I expected there'd be irrefutable evidence presented, but all we got were some things that could be created in photoshop and with a $20 tape recorder from Walmart.<br>
<br>
When GERMANY thinks kicking an ass is a bad idea, that really tells you something.  When FRANCE and GERMANY agree, that tells you something too.<br>
<br>
Guns:<br>
<br>
Countries with the strictest gun control (Canada, Australia, Britain) still have mass murders, armed robberies, firearms suicides and other gun crime.<br>
<br>
The problem is crime, not guns.  If you took all the guns off the face of the earth and shot them into the sun today, by tomorrow morning, some jackass would hold up a bank with a pencil sharpener, your neighbour will commit suicide by drinking Drano and the drooling half-wit across town will still kill 19 people by wedgie-ing them to death.  People killed themselves and each other for 20000 years before firearms were invented.<br>
<br>
It is worth noting that the September 11 hijackings - arguably one on the worst crimes EVER committed - were perpetrated with box cutters.  No guns were involved. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qikkiq>Qikkiq</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.si.rr.com/digitalgraveyard/squid.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/17/03 11:01:30 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ripert>Ripert</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/17/03 12:09:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=24>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> I expected there'd be irrefutable evidence presented, but all we got were some things that could be created in photoshop and with a $20 tape recorder from Walmart.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I find it odd that everyone is saying just because Blix hasn't found anything that that is proof that it doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
The Job of the inspectors ( as outlined in the UN resolution) is to make sure that Iraq has disarmed, not a hunt or a game of hide and seek.<br>
<br>
If Iraq was disarmed or was interested in disarming, they would be laying everything out for the inspectors to see, or show where items have been destroyed. They have done neither.<br>
<br>
Iraq submitted themselves that they had a HUGE amount of WMD items, but now they don't know where they are? And we are just suppose to belive that they threw them away? <br>
<br>
Iraq has a larger land mass then California, I guarantee if I wanted to hide something from the couple of hundred inspectors, I could. <br>

Well he is looking for proof that Iraq have destroyed the WOMD. He havent found any proof of that. So your line can be used both ways. But i find it hard that the motive for war is to disarm Iraq.

I agree, N. Korea will have to be dealt with, but its harder to deal with a country that has nuclear warheads and missiles that can reach the Californian shore.<br>
<br>
We should have handled Korea, before they got to this point... Like Iraq.<br>
<br>
Besides, I still belive there is a diplomatic answer to N. Korea. It probably will involve paying them off or applying pressure to China. <br>
<br>
The last 12 years have shown that containment and pandering doesn't work for Iraq. The diplomatic route has been tried and tried agian, and its failed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ripert>Ripert</A> at: 2/17/03 12:43:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=autius>Autius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#628CBC>(2/17/03 12:52:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: !</span><hr size=1> I believe the majority of Americans do not want war.

We don't particularly want to lose our idolic lives, and we will do whatever it takes to ensure that.  Especially if it means we won't have to do anything.  <br>

You won't see our plutocratic leader's children out there, and for sure you won't see them doing anything.<br>

And as i understood it he is pretty much without influence from any side. He said that, no matter how the outcome of the war, Bin Ladin will be the one coming out on top. Sending Hussein to Exhile or killing him will most likely anger alot of muslims, and it will pretty much be only Bin Ladin speaking of retribution. There will be troops in Iraq for atleast 2 years to ensure that the new government gets installed correctly.

Because the US will not have a regime change that shatters the country into about a dozen new countries and loose accountability for some of its nukes AKA Russia<br>

Also, with US' vastly superior conventional military, the chances of us being backed against the wall and being forced to resort to nuclear warfare is far slimmer then countries such as North Korea, who could easily be overrun conventionally by countries like the Us, China, and Russia.<br>

I agree. I'd also like to point out that when Blix was head of the nuclear inspections back in the 80's he <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>failed to find nuclear material in Iraq that was later discovered in the 90's</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Blix is also a pacifist. So here we the chief inspector who not only FAILED to find material violations in the past, but is also against the war in general, leading to bias against any incriminating evidence. When Blix said the Iraqi's have begun to cooperate, all he could be saying was they finally started serving them cappucino's like they had asked instead of coffee.<br>

France: Owed 8 billion dollars by the Iraqi government. Also invested heavily in Iraqi oil fields. Helped Iraq build nuclear reactor in the past. Also has large Oil contracts with Iraq. If Iraq is invaded, France will loose all its money invested as well as their precious oil contracts.<br>

cant honestly think of a comment here, since i dont see why this would be better or worse. all people willing to use a nuclear weapon are crazy imo, no matter their motives. terrorism or politics, or money. it really doesnt matter, since the aftermath is the same. nothing justifies nuclear weapons.<br>

That's debateable.  No one can predict the future.  Who should be the judge of a regime in this case?  Can you put down some criteria for how long a regime / government should be in place and &quot;stable&quot; before it can develop nuclear weapons?  I'm assuming according to your estimates that a country needs to have a stable form of goverment for at least 140 years or so (time since the civil war) in order to develop and own nuclear weapons.  I believe the Hussein family has been in power in this region for quite a long time actually.  The hashemite dynasty ruled over various areas for centuries.  Does this qualify?<br>

Actually, the rise of Nazi Germany had a lot more to do with the internal economic and political situation of Germany after its defeat in world war 1 than with any sort of world politics.  There's an important lesson to be learned here by the way, you can't defeat your enemies in a war and then let them fester.  You either wipe them out or help them rebuild.  The US seems to have learned that lesson after WW 2 but forgotten it recently.<br>

Everyone is in it for the oil.  What's your point?  The fact that France and Germany are being short sighted and looking out for their own interests does not mean the US is not doing the same.  We can write whole books about the idiocy of European politics, it still wont change the stupidity of American foriegn policy. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:xx-small;"><br>

Why haven't there been any world wars since WWII? I'll tell you, mutually assured destruction. Basically, any country that uses a nuclear weapon against another country with nuclear weapons will also be nuked. Basically, both sides lose. Obviously not a smart thing to do.<br>
<br>
When we nuked Japan, what happened? They surrendered. What would happen if we nuked korea tommorrow? They'd nuke us back.<br>
<br>

I'll agree with you whole heartidly with you on this point. The point I was trying to make was, that instead of waiting for the german blitzkreig to be knocking on frances door to take action, Germany should have been dealt with when they invaded the Rhineland. With the Withdraw from the Rhineland, Hitler saw he could take what he wanted in small bites, and before you knew it, He had taken control of austria, the sudatenland, a mix of other small european countries, and was finishing off the cookie jar in poland before france and britain smacked the proverbial hand. But by that time Hitler had already formed his secret alliance with Russia and the collective might of the German army was able to fall upon france before they could secure their flanks around belgium.<br>
