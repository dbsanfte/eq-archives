<br>
Most people got married in June because they took their yearly bath in May and still smelled pretty good by June. However, they were starting to smell, so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor. <br>
<br>
Baths consisted of a big tub filled with hot water. The man of the house had the privilege of the nice clean water, then all the other sons and men, then the women and finally the children--last of all, the babies. By then the water was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it--hence the saying, &quot;Don't throw the baby out with the bath water.&quot; <br>
<br>
Houses had thatched roofs--thick straw, piled high, with no wood underneath. It was the only place for animals to get warm, so all the dogs cats and other small animals, mice, rats, and bugs lived in the roof. When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would slip and fall off the roof--hence the saying &quot;It's raining cats and dogs.&quot; <br>
<br>
There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house. This posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings could really mess up your nice clean bed. A bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top afforded some protection. That's how canopy beds came into existence. <br>
<br>
The floor was dirt. Only the wealthy had something other than dirt, hence the saying &quot;dirt poor.&quot; The wealthy had slate floors that would get slippery in the winter when wet, so they spread thresh on the floor to help keep their footing. As the winter wore on, they kept adding more thresh until when you opened the door it would all start slipping outside. A piece of wood was placed in the entry way--creating a &quot;thresh hold.&quot; <br>
<br>
They cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle that always hung over the fire. Every day they lit the fire and added things to the pot. They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much meat. They would eat the stew for dinner, leaving leftovers in the pot to get cold overnight and then start over the next day. Sometimes the stew had food in it that had been there for quite a while--inspiring the rhyme, &quot;peas porridge hot, peas porridge cold, peas porridge in the pot nine days old.&quot; <br>
<br>
Sometimes they could obtain pork, which made them feel quite special. When visitors came over, they would hang up their bacon to show off. It was a sign of wealth that a man &quot;could bring home the bacon.&quot; They would cut off a little to share with guests and would all sit around and &quot;chew the fat.&quot; <br>
<br>
Those with money had plates made of pewter. Food with a high acid content caused some of the lead to leach onto the food, causing lead poisoning and death. This happened most often with tomatoes, so for the next 400 years or so, tomatoes were considered poisonous. Most people did not have pewter plates, but had trenchers, a piece of wood with the middle scooped out like a bowl. Often trenchers were made from stale paysan bread which was so old and hard that they could use them for quite some time. Trenchers were never washed and worms and mold got into the wood and old bread. After eating off wormy, moldy trenchers, one would get &quot;trench mouth.&quot; Bread was divided according to status. Workers got the burnt bottom of the loaf, the family got the middle, and guests got the top, or &quot;upper crust.&quot; <br>
<br>
Lead cups were used to drink ale or whiskey. The combination would sometimes knock them out for a couple of days. Someone walking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them for burial. They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of days and the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait and see if they would wake up- the custom of holding a &quot;wake.&quot; <br>
<br>
England is old and small and they started running out of places to bury people. So they would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a &quot;bone-house&quot; and reuse the grave. When reopening these coffins, one out of 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the inside and they realized they had been burying people alive. So they thought they would tie a string on the wrist of the corpse, lead it through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell. Someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night (the &quot;graveyard shift&quot;) to listen for the bell. Thus, someone could be &quot;saved by the bell&quot; or was considered a &quot;dead ringer&quot;.  <p><a href ="http://www.geocities.com/nap0leon/ish_avatar.htm">Ishinru</a><BR>

Raining cats and dogs actually comes from an event in France where a tornado scooped up a large number of the animals and deposited them some 10 miles away on a city. This also once happened (again in france) with a few thousand frogs. <p>"For a day I had my dream. And on that day, it was my duty to end that dream."

I do remember a lot of the more (/duck)'upper crust' folk would be buried in different fashions, that would better assure accidental buryings of being salvagable. Pipes, or hollow poles leading down to the coffins, for air and a place to 'yell' out if there was a mistake, were not uncommon...<br>
<br>
       Speaking of undead dead<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Here is a little fact from Necromancer Weekly<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
     Did you know that the whole idea of zombies, and such, was a scam, sort of? Voodoo witch doctors (like wiccians) knew a great deal about herbal lore, and its affects on humans in certain dosages. Basically, what they would do, like any good magician, would be to pre-prepare.<br>
<br>
    Finding a good rich family, (usually) the practicioner would slip a dose of a deadly herb, but just enough to 'almost' kill the victim, slowly. To the family, the victim would seem to fall ill..in which case, the family would run to the witch doctor, begging for a heal. After a lot of chanting, etc, the 'doctor' would say all has been done, that can be done...the victim goes home, and 'dies'.<br>
<br>
    If the dosage was right, then the family would bury the victim, with the witcvh doctor there (of course, as he was like a priest) to make burial arrangements. (all the while, keeping an eye on the time) he would do some more chanting, saying he would do what he could, to maybe bring the victim back, etc etc. the family, grief stricken, goes home and hopes for the best..later on, the poison runs its course, and the victim wakes up....<br>
<br>
   Clawing his way out of the conveniently shallow grave, he then staggers home in an almost dead and drunken stupor (like the 'zombie' in the movies, to a point') covered in dirt, with bloody fingers, usually...he can be quite a sight..but 'alive' and with a grateful and soon to be not as rich family being very thankful to the 'doctor'.<br>
<br>
   Oh, and if the victim died...well, the witch doctor did all he could, but the 'demons' were too strong, and to the family, the victim was already dead anyway, so it wont be much of a shock<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
   Creepy, huh?
