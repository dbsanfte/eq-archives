<br>
Anyone care to explain how the Repubs are going to cut taxes and finance the impending war that they're so bent on starting simultaneously?  And please don't give me the &quot;the war will stimulate the economy!&quot; crap.  This whole approach reeks of George Sr.'s &quot;no new taxes!&quot; campaign from '88...you know, the one right before he jacked our taxes through the roof in the first place?  You remember--he started a war and raised taxes, making the same claims his kid is making now, and then the economy went right into the crapper for a couple years until Slick Willy was elected.  <br>
<br>
The beauty of this is that now the Republicans get to shoulder the burden of *every single problem* this country has for the next couple years, and they won't have anyone to point the finger at if things don't work out the way they say they should.  It's their golden opportunity to right all the wrongs they've been blaming on the Dems.  It'll be interesting to see how they fare; there hasn't been a unipartisan government structure like this since 1902.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, before you start flaming, I'm not a Democrat.  I vote based on individual candidates, not on partisanship.  And I'd like nothing more than to see the GOP turn America into some kind of glorious tax-free economically stimulated utopia, but I'll believe it when I see it.  <br>
<br>
It would also be nice for them to maybe address the glaring fact that several members of the GOP's elite are horribly mired in corporate accounting scandals, instead of playing bait and switch and turning attention to Saddam Hussein.<br>

Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, Marth Stewart, Imclone, the list goes on and on. <br>
<br>
There are a lot of people in this world who work VERY hard and do not, by any strech of the imagination, get &quot;A fair shake&quot; In fact, there is a majority who are screwed by the companies they work for, yes, a majority. Outsourcing, Downsizing, Farming work to third world countries. Where 50 years ago, if an honest man worked hard at his job, whether he was a scientist or a janitor, he could earn his gold watch, a pat on the back, and his pention. Today's world is different, today you have to worry about your millionaire CEO stealing your retirement money because his 9 million a year pension and 970 million dollar bank account arent ENOUGH (Think Im exageratting? Those are the actual numbers the ex-CEO of Tyco had, yet he robbed thousands of his hard working employees blind)<br>
<br>
It is no secret that the republicans are best buddies with Big buisness. I mean look at Bush, &quot;@#%$ it, lets drill for oil in alaska, who cares if it will screw up the environment, its MONEY!&quot; also the same guy who withdrew from the Kyoto treaty saying there is not PROOF the Greenhouse effect even exists. Furthermore, the same guy who wants to take us to war with Saddam for the express purpose of making his buddies in the oil fields a little richer.<br>
<br>
Today's world is much different from the world of the past, the richest men in this country are commiting the biggest heists right underneath our noses. They are so far removed from the world that they think about how a new Systems Engineer from Malaysia will get paid half what the employee who has worked his tail off for 20 years will, so they fire the guy, who is now Jobless even though he put his everything into his job.<br>
<br>
See, a fair shake is hard to come by in these times, companies fire 10-20 thousand employees in a day. and re-hire within a week, its a vicious practice, but hey, &quot;It's only business&quot; right? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How can you have to much? If you work your tail off, why shouldn't you be able to keep what you earn?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's not about what you earn, its about how you earn it. And I'm sorry, but yes, you sure can have too much. The afforementioned billionaire CEO of Tyco had comissioned a HALF MILLION dollar ice sculpture of Michellangelo's David that dispensed premium Vodka out of its penis for his wife's birthday party. Now I'm all for freedom to spend your money how you want, but half a million dollars can feed a lot of people, educate a lot of children, build a lot of low income housing, save a lot of people who cant afford medical insurance and need operations, etc, etc. (People's retirement funds paid for the statue BTW)<br>
<br>
Lots of hardworking people out there, making less than 30,000 a year because they couldnt afford to go to college, a lot of people cant afford to go to college, and now a days you cant do much without a college degree. My grandpa was Vice President of a Federal Savings and Loan and he never got a college diploma, but when his branch closed down in the mid eighties and he went to look for work, he was unable to find any, because by that time there were lots of fresh little graduates looking for management positions.<br>
<br>
My point is, those people do work their butts off, I see it a lot living where I live, there is a high immigrant population in Miami, most of them skilled or semi-skilled workers who came to this country and had to take minimum wage jobs because their piece of paper says University of Cuba, Mexico, or Nicaragua instead of University of Miami. The worse part is, they cant even afford what it takes to prove their proficiency and translate their diploma into one that holds any bearing in the US.<br>
<br>
Those tax cuts help the rich, there is no doubt about it, why the hell shouldnt they pay 96% of the taxes, they make 99% of the money. This wont change for some time I tell you, it will continue the cycle of abuse and parasitism, but if the US doesnt do something about it, there will be a revolution. It's a guarantee, it happens in every country, state, or empire, regardless of its size, pomp, or percieved importance. <br>
<br>
Point is, everyone doesnt get a fair shake, regardless of how much they work. It's easy to think so looking down from above, its hard to see a broken man without seeing his face. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ripert>Ripert</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/7/02 1:06:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Anyone care to explain how the Repubs are going to cut taxes and finance the impending war that they're so bent on starting simultaneously?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Probably the same way we paid for the Gulf war.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>How much did the US pay for the Gulf War above and beyond the yearly cost for supporting its military? The US Department of Defense estimated the incremental cost at $61 billion. This additional cost included deployment, construction and operations in the Gulf. However, $54 billion was offset by contributions of other members in the Coalition. Two-thirds of the $54 billion was provided by the Gulf States ($36 billion) with the remaining one-third mostly provided by Japan and Germany ($16 billion). </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Also, anyone whos making enough money to live well isnt going to cut themselves down to 49k just so they dont pay taxes. Nobody can really live high on the hog (&quot;like they deserve&quot;) on 49k a year.<br>

We could probably just put HUGE import taxes on anything coming into the Unites States to fix that little foriegn labor problem. After all, we can make everything, and our people need jobs.

I dont see how this has anything to do with farming out work, if you own a business and another service comes out that is better, thats fair. But cutting your costs by eliminating hard and loyal american or legal alien workers for people from countries who would find minimum wage a godsend is horrible... sure you make three times as much, but at what cost? You destroy the economy by making domestic unemployment through the roof.<br>

The ANWR only contains a few months worth of oil at the rate which we consume it, and its most certainly not a wasteland, theres a big caribou population, also there are polar bear dens all over that area, and polar bears are really skiddish about humans, they dont like em, so there will definately be reprecussions. Also, the ANWR is the last unspoiled wild life refuge that exists in america, untouched, pristene. <br>
<br>
But more importantly than that, the oil companies have a long and distinguished history of not caring about the environment and poluting it if it will help them make a buck, some things never change. Also, if there was to be some sort of accident up there the result could be catastrophic.<br>

It isnt the Kyoto protocol that would kill our economy, its our refusal to use alternative forms of energy which are just as effective as petroleum that is screwing us. Windmills, Hydroelectric, Solar, all of these bogged down and oppressed by the oil companies. Oil is king here, which is why people feel having to cut our emissions would cripple things. There are environmentally friendly forms of energy in widespread use around the world, but not in the US. I dont see how it would let off the worst polluters in the world though, I'm curious, how so?<br>

Also, you are right, some people do work their way through college, but they usually dont do it supporting a family, I know lots of people who worked their way through college, but all of them did it while they were young and could spend their money on tuition,  books, etc. Once you have kids and a family to support, all your money usually goes to it.<br>

<br>
Because sometimes 30% of someone's salary is the GNP of some small island nations. If a flat tax is fair, then why not flat wages? If we all have to pay the same regardless of what we make, then we should all make the same, wouldnt that be fair as well? Because I know I sure wouldnt spend a half a mill on a vodka dispensing penis or 10,000 dollars on shower curtains! =) <br>
<br>
See, Flat taxes would lead to a lack of money in the city,state,and federal coffers, because suddenly all that money being generated by the ultra rich 1% would be gone, so guess what they would do? They would raise taxes for everyone! So now, your poor and middle class are paying more in taxes and your rich are paying less, doesnt sound fair to me.<br>
<br>
(no, I do not support communism at all, I'm just making a point that flat tax isnt fair)  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bledtodeath>Bled to Death</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/7/02 2:10:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://user.netomia.com/blindedhorse/chibipucca.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> As a note, I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>am</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a Communist <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannabulon>Cannabulon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/graphics/zen.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secret Master of the<BR>Marshmallow Silique</span><br>  Posts: 282<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/7/02 2:15:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So let me get this right, I invent a widget, that revolutionaizes an industry.

No, you have it wrong. You invent a widget that revolutionizes an industry, because of this widget, jobs (low paying ones) are created to manufacture, transport, sell said widget. YOU become wealthy because of the widget, your employees, making what they make regardless of your personal wealth pay their taxes, but by merit of you making more than everyone else you should also have to give back more than everyone else. Why? you may ask, because you HAVE more than everyone else. Also, your taxes do a lot more than pay for welfare, they pay for schools, they pay for police and fire departments, they pay for important things.<br>
<br>
You are misconstruing something I said, I would appreciate it if you didnt do that. I didnt say there was a direct corellation between education and income. It's that little piece of paper with the calligraphy and the connections you make in college that lead to higher income. Education has very little to do with it, the most educated people in this world are sometimes the poorest. Ever seen someone apply for a job with more qualifications and experience and lose it to a 21 year old 2 months out of college? Happens every day.<br>

Of course there are the entrepeneurs who started with 100 dollars in the bank and made a yadda yadda yadda. Those are the huge minority, more businesses fail than marriages every year, and every 1 in 2 of those ends in divorce, so you do the math. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannabulon>Cannabulon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/graphics/zen.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secret Master of the<BR>Marshmallow Silique</span><br>  Posts: 283<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/7/02 2:17:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As a note, I am a Communist  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So, by claiming that economic repercussions are hardly immediate, you must be saying that the slump in the economy after the Gulf War was a result of Reaganomics.  Ok, I'll accept that.  Either way, 12 years of GOP in the white house=economy in the sh!tter.  <br>
<br>
The excuse about rampant corporate corruption and Cheney and The Dubya's direct link to numerous questionable bait-and-switch accounting schemes being a &quot;smear campaign&quot; is ludicrous.  A smear campaign is what the GOP did to Clinton for getting a hum-job.  I'd much rather have a man who gets his knob gobbled by an intern running the show than a guy who steals from the poor to help feed his horses.  <br>
<br>
Anyone who thinks Communism is a legitimate and workable political structure should read &quot;We The Living&quot; by Ayn Rand.  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong--I'd be saying the same things if the Dems controlled every branch of government.  Politicians as a rule are a bloodthirsty, self-promoting bunch who will sell their mother to get ahead, and pretty much every vote I cast is in self-defense for the lesser of two evils.

Actually, Cann this is an old argument based on the false premise that money/currency is finite, which I think we can all agree it is not. I agree taxes pay for more than just welfare, HOWEVER, I believe that other than federal taxes (which in a TRUE Constitutionalist belief would pay for JUST the national defense (Preamble to the Constitution, and lets not discuss what 'General welfare' means unless ppl have read the Federalist Papers) other social services should be handle at the local and state level (Article X of the Constitution)<br>

Oh, that's right...there wasn't any.  <br>

Where's the proof that Iraq has ever perpetrated direct aggression against the United States?  <br>
<br>
Oh, gee, none there either.  <br>

Better watch how you use &quot;there's no proof&quot; in defense of Republican dogma.  There's no proof that Jesus ever rose from the dead either, but you apparently believe that fervently.  <br>
<br>
For the record, I'm all for ousting Hussein, and I'm all for obliterating terrorists.  But there's this silly thing called due process, and when we as a nation violate it, we risk a lot.  When a man who barely won an election by the skin of his teeth (and questionable voting practices in a state which just happened to be run by his brother) starts foaming at the mouth for blood and oil, I get a little nervous.  When that same ignoramus has the backing of a wholly unipartisan governing body, I get really nervous.  Why not just secede from the UN altogether?  He clearly has nothing but disdain for their policies, and now the GOP has successfully eradicated the checks and balances system put in place by the framers.   <br>
<br>
But, as usual, saying the kinds of things I'm saying to someone who will blindly follow whatever dogma is put in front of him first is akin to banging my head against concrete.  Narrow mind=narrow mind.  <p>Ayerish Stormcaller&lt;BR&gt;<br>

Well, I live in the only state in the union without state taxes, so perhaps I am missing something. I just feel angry because people without lots of money, myself included, look at their paychecks (Ok, so im unemployed right now, but I used to!) and say &quot;wow, I made X dollars and I had to pay THAT much to taxes...&quot; Your average american hurts on payday, but the ultra rich, make more in a paycheck than some people make in a year. Whereas I can justify your average joe hurting if he loses 200 out of 600 dollars, I cannot sympathize with someone who has so much money they couldnt spend it in an entire lifetime, their &quot;tax plight&quot; is nothing more than a joke to me, even if you took 99% of a Bill Gates, or a Steve Forbes, they would still possess more money than most folks make in a lifetime. That is mindboggling. If you took away 99% of my paycheck, id have 6 bucks. I'm pretty sure an electrician, a carpenter, a soldier, or a warehouse worker works harder than these guys do. Fact is theyve gotten wealthy off the toil and labor of thousands of people, hey this is capitalism, it's fine by me! But I also believe there should be a price to pay to be so priviledged. And if we eliminated their tax burdens, that money will dissappear, and we know it CANT, we need every dollar, so what they will do is raise taxes for everyone, then average joe really suffers, because now they take even more out of their paychecks.<br>

People say it isnt fair that the rich pay more than the poor, well, just as easily one could assertain that it isnt fair that the rich get paid more than the poor. I believe there should be a balance, the more you make the more you pay for the right to be financially independent if for nothing else. God knows the poor and the middle class have to pay for it every day of our lives, hell, my generation is wondering if WHEN we retire the government will have enough to pay us social security regardless of whether we paid social security tax out of every check.<br>

(Actually Cann, i try NOT to misconstrue anything you say, since you actually have thoughtful arguments.) I actually threw that comment about education in as an after thought. And notice I said EDUCATION, not degrees. Education comes in many forms, as does experience. Several of the wealthiest ppl in the US never completed college. <br>

My appologies then, I interpreted your comments to be a stab at my comment on college folks. And I agree, education and diplomas are very different things, some of the smartest people have gone to college and seen it a waste of their time and money, but the fact remains that little piece of paper will sometimes do you better than a world of knowledge and experience. As a college student, I looked at the people around me, and it disgusted me that such ignorance and idiocy is almost assured a job because they scammed their way through 4 years of school. Yeah, some people work very hard in college, but just as many slack off, buy term papers or use the stores of papers held by their fraternities (lots of fraternities have files of old papers and assignments including tests), athletes have it even easier in lots of schools.<br>

As for Warren Buffet, he even says himself he got lucky, he was in the right place at the right time with 10,000 dollars to invest. As for his evil doing, I dont know, I mean the only thing I know about him is what he has said and what has been said about him. But from what I have read, he is probably one of the most level headed people out there =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qartum>Qartum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/7/02 4:39:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=246.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Cann..are you talking a state income tax, state sales tax or what? Cause I can think of 3 states right off the top of my head with no states income tax, to include Texas, where I live. Course the states sales tax is a pain...<br>
