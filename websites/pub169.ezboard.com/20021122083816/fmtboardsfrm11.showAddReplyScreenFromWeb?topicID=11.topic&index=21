<br>
But the best spells -- I mean like TOTALLY the best spells -- are Clinging Darkness and Fear. Omigod it is like SO cool to cast Clinging Darkness on like a rat or a snake and like watch it die! You can totally watch it get like RILLY weak, and then it just keels over!<br>
<br>
And Fear is like RILLY fun! You can cast it on stuff and like watch its eyes totally bug out as it like screams and runs away from you as fast as it can! It's like this HUGE rush to make something like TOTALLY afraid of me, y'know? When I like finally make my trip back to Qeynos to settle things with those lame-o parents of mine, I think it would be like RILLY cool to like tie them to the bed so where they like couldn't run away, and then like stuff a rag or something in their mouth so they like couldn't scream or anything, and then just cast Fear on 'em like over and over and over... Wouldn't it be like totally cool if they like died from fright? But hopefully like not too soon. Hopefully they'd last for like hours and hours...<br>
<br>
Woo! But like enough daydreaming!<br>
<br>
This was like a bummer Rank for me, becaue like everything in the West Commons was like totally weak except for like Kodiak bears and those stupid Dervish Cutthroats. There's like NO Kodiaks around most of the time, and the Dervs are like either fighting with some other group of people, or they're like all ready to gang up on me. So I spent like a lot of time swimming around in the lake in like the West Commonlands and killing those big fish that swim around. It wasn't very glamorous or anything, and I like TOTALLY got mud in my hair and stuff (which is like SO icky), but they were challenging enough that I could like improve my skills and stuff by fighting them.

So I took like this TOTALLY long, hot bath, and like daydreamed some more about torturing those loser parents of mine, and I like scrubbed all the mud out of my hair and like the fish smell out of my skin. And then I like shined up my armor and like sharpened my sword, then I grabbed some bone chips and like this spare rusty halberd and decided to like go exploring.<br>
<br>
So like I wandered through the Desert of Ro, y'know? And there's like this big oasis like right in the middle? So I looked around to see if there was like anything worth killing, and I found like these orc warriors. They're totally not like the orcs in the Commonlands. They're like MUCH tougher. So I like found a place near the lake and summoned up a pet, and then went out to like introduce myself to some of those big green losers.<br>
<br>
Dude. Some of those guys are like TOTALLY tough. I made like this RILLY big mistake and started a fight with like this Orc Priest, and he totally handed me my head. So I like made a note to myself: Priests are like totally bad news. So I stopped messing with them, except by accident.<br>
<br>
So then I see this orc, and he looks like all the other orcs, so I like cast a spell on him to like get his attention. Only he was like WAY tougher than the rest of the orcs. And I was all like &quot;Dude, where did you come from?&quot; So I let him mix it up with my pet, and I like made myself totally scarce.<br>
<br>
So like once I had *that* all figured out, I was like okay. And lots of orcs like totally bought it by my hand. And it like totally ruled.<br>
<br>
And the best thing was that these RILLY powerful Dark Elf necromancers like set up shop right near where I was doing like all of my fighting. And they were killing SPECTRES! WOW! Those guys are like RILLY tough! But the necros were like totally wasting 'em, and -- this is like the cool part -- they were just like leaving the corpses lying around. They totally didn't need the money! So I was all like &quot;Hiya, dudes! I'm like a faithful follower of Innoruuk, and I totally hate to be like a vulture and stuff, but I also hate to see these corpses like go totally to waste! So if you're like not gonna loot 'em, do you mind if I do?&quot; And they were all like &quot;Sure, go ahead!&quot; So I scored some bronze scythes and even like some regular scythes, and made like 30 plat! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ustarflowersk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starflower SK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/25/02 10:52:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Starflower Valleygirl, Shadowknight of Innoruuk</span><hr size=1> Rank 16: Omigod! I like *finally* feel like a Shadow Knight, y'know? I heard that there were like these wood elf chicks called the Sisters of Erollisi (like gag me), and they live on this island in like the Ocean of Tears? And I heard that they were like *totally* weak! Not all of 'em, though, so I had to like sneak onto the island by swimming from the boat to avoid the tougher ones that like hang out on the docks. And after a little exploring, I found some of like the rookies. These were like the Sisters in training or something. So I like summoned up a skeleton buddy, then I like called upon the strength and hatred of Innoruuk to like help me waste these granola-eating, tree-hugging goody-goody types, and then I went to work.<br>
<br>
I snuck up on one who was like standing under a tree and like communing with nature or something lame like that. My skeleton buddy was like down on the beach, hidden, so that some bimbo wouldn't like discover him on accident. So I cast Clinging Darkness on the wood elf chick. She like TOTALLY didn't approve. Like I care, right? So I ran back to where my skeleton buddy was like strategically hidden, y'know? And the stupid chick followed me all the way. And when she got there, me and my skeleton buddy *completely* taught her what a Shadow Knight of Innoruuk could do to some loser follower of that simp Erollisi.<br>
<br>
But that like wasn't even the best part! The *best* part was near the end of the fight. Me and the pet had her like totally bloody, and she like tried to run away. So I cast Clinging Darkness on her again, and she was so wounded and like so wracked with pain from the spell that she totally couldn't move. And I could have totally killed her with like one whack from my Axe. But I didn't.<br>
<br>
Instead, I just told my skeleton buddy to, y'know, back off. So here she is, like totally desperate trying to run away but she totally can't because of my Clinging Darkness spell. And I could see the spell like working it's magic on her, because her skin was like totally breaking open in spots and oozing blood, and like you could see other parts of her skin turn like all black and yellow and stuff. And then she gives me this look of like total, pure HATRED! She HATED me *SO* *MUCH* right then! I could almost FEEL her Hate! It was so totally awesome I came like *this* close to hugging her! But that would have looked rilly stupid under the circumstances, so I didn't.<br>
<br>
So I cast the spell like a couple more times and just sat there and like made fun of her and asked her where that loser Goddess of hers was and why wasn't She down here protecting her. And I watched her get like closer and closer to death. And finally she like couldn't even stand up anymore and collapsed in like this bleeding, convulsing heap. So I like used my weakest lifetap on her and I slowly drained away the last of her lifeforce. And she twitched and like spasmed a little bit, and then she died. And I felt the last of her life flow into me, and it was SO COOL!<br>
<br>
And then I like whacked off some wood elf meat for later. I think I'll like try to find a smoker. Wood-smoked wood elf! That would like totally rule!<br>
<br>
So I spent a long time on that island. Me and the Sisters of Erollisi became like RILLY close, y'know? And whenever I'd kill one, I'd offer her soul to like Innoruuk. And the coolest part was that I was like spitting on TWO of those light-sucking goody-goody gods for each Sister I killed! Because they were Sisters of Erollisi, so like every one I killed was like a total slap in the face to Erollisi Marr. (Erollisi Marr. Like I am so SURE!) But since they were wood elves, I was also like totally thumbing my nose at Tunare. (And is there any god or goddess that's like a *bigger* total loser than Tunare? As if!)<br>
<br>
And like just when I thought my opinion of those loser Sisters couldn't get like any worse, I was looting one of their corpses and found this like weird chastity belt or purity belt or something. They like totally don't have sex! Like are they total prudes or what? Like omigod!<br>
<br>
But I like totally can't complain, either. Those belts sell for a plat and change to the merchants. And I always came back to Freeport with like a TON of belts! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ustarflowersk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starflower SK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/26/02 11:40:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Starflower Valleygirl, Shadowknight of Innoruuk</span><hr size=1> Rank 17: I am so TOTALLY bummed out.<br>

I was like running around in the West Commonlands, looking for stuff to kill. And like at the 17th Rank, that's pretty much limited to like Kodiaks. So like this guy walks by selling an Axe of the Iron Back. These axes are like totally sweet, and are just as good as like a Langseax of the Wolves that the warriors use. And he's selling it for like a RILLY cheap price! So I like run to the bank in Neriak, since it's just as close, and since I hadn't been to Neriak in a while and wanted to like soak up the essence of the Father of Hate.<br>
<br>
So I get to Neriak and there's like this Dark Elf chick near the entrance. And she's obviously important, 'cause she's trying to like gather a crowd for some secret info or something. So I'm all like &quot;Hi! I'm like Starflower! I know I'm all human and stuff, but I'm a totally faithful follower of like the Father of Hate, and I'd be like RILLY thrilled if I could, y'know, help you with like whatever plan you've got going!&quot; And she like TOTALLY rags on me! Says that she doesn't like talk to paleskins, and that if I like didn't buzz off, she would kill me like right there!<br>
<br>
Well, like I said, I like already had plans and I didn't wanna take the chance that the dude who wanted to sell me the Axe of the Iron Back might find out that he was like selling it totally cheap. So I ran to the bank and got my money and bought the axe.<br>
<br>
But when I was finished, I went back to Neriak. By that time, there was a crowd of Dark Elves around her. And I was all like &quot;Look, I know you said you don't want a human helping you, but I'm like RILLY tired of killing all the same stuff that like the paladins and rangers are killing, 'cause that's like so totally NOT evil, y'know? This is like a chance for me to finally feel like I was doing something important! For like the glory of Innoruuk! So whatever you want me to do to prove my allegiance to the Dark Elves and to Neriak, just let me know!&quot;<br>
<br>
And she like slapped me! And said I was the most impertinent, annoying, unpleasant paleskin she'd ever had to deal with, and there was like totally NO way she was like EVER going to want my help!<br>
<br>
Dude, I was like so *totally* pissed!<br>
<br>
But I was also like totally outnumbered. And my parents may have been like total retards, but I'm not. So I left.<br>
<br>
But before I left, I said &quot;Well. If you hate me, then I guess I'm truly doing the will of Innoruuk.&quot; Then I grinned, gave like this jaunty wave, and ran off. Stupid bitch. As if. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ustarflowersk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Starflower SK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/28/02 11:54:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Starflower Valleygirl, Shadowknight of Innoruuk</span><hr size=1> Rank 18: YES!

My training totally won't allow me to take full advantage of some of the really damaging weapons until I hit the 20th rank. Until then, the Dark Reaver won't do any more damage than the Axe of the Iron Back, and will do it like a lot slower. So I'll be keeping in the bank until I can like train myself in the best way to use it.<br>
<br>
But now that I've got a Dark Reaver, that like totally wraps up my purchases for a while. The next thing on like my shopping list is Darkforge Armor, but that won't be for a while yet.<br>

So that left like the crocs and like the deepwater stuff. But there were like SO many people out hunting crocs like me that it was totally impossible to find stuff to hunt that would still allow me to train myself and reach the next rank.<br>
<br>
So I figured that like maybe it was time to check out the newly re-discovered land of Kunark. So I like hopped onto this RILLY rickety boat that looked like a buncha nearsighted ogres built it on a day they all had like stomach cramps, and when they only had like burnt wood to use for materials. The ride like TOTALLY didn't fill me with girlish delight, y'know?<br>
<br>
But by Innoruuk's grace, I made it to Kunark. There's like this outpost there run by all these evil types, and it's like a good place to rest and bank. I totally don't recommend buying stuff from (or selling stuff to) the merchants there, though, because their prices like RILLY suck.<br>
<br>
Just to the west of the outpost is like this big open plain, and it turns out that there are like a zillion critters out there tough enough to give me a challenge and let me like improve myself.
