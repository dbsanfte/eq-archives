Break in for Brains and Brawn was painless for us today, only a few deaths in first run group, after that we got mages in, started up the COTH macheen and were happily settled in the SS in less than an hour.<br>
<br>
First pull Monk goes out, brings back one, FD, Tagger nails it and instantly half the 1st floor is in camp. I'm not sure what happened and none of my guild was really sure either but they came mostly from opposite direction than puller came from. It was ugly, we camped clerics, held off the baddies as long as we could and FD'ers dropped. Usual CR, not eventful at all so nothing to tell there.<br>
<br>
After that we reset, started pulling and everything seemed relatively normal for awhile other than the occasional mob randomly running intro camp and whailing on the casters..no reason, no one more than a third of the way up the wall, just poof! insta add in camp. We moved into organ room, and almost right off the bat 2nd floor mob aggrod and killed a bard that was a guest with us. NO aoe songs, nothing, just standing near a pillar. Next, same thing to BL..Damage from 2nd floor mob through floor, killed, no trains, no sign of mobs at all. This happened to several people, all near the Pillar.<br>
Hand time, pulled hand, itty bitty hand went normal, killed it in the corner, Large hand popped and MA takes aggro. Tries to get him out of the corner only every time the large hand goes to chase him it instead goes fingers first into the corner and sits there running. This made it one hell of a hard fight. Finally killed him and petitioned about upstairs aggro through the floor.<br>
Guide showed up and seemed a bit reluctant and thought it was maybe something we were doing, then RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM a necro in our raid sat down and POW nearly got killed..GM was like WTF?? no aggro, he didnt die, no trains, just got popped through the floor from upstairs a few times, ran away from pillar and nothing.. Later in the raid A person appears with a RED name, no other tag like keepers of dreams for GM's, jst a red first name. OMG cool looking gear and on an unusual looking horse. According to a couple people it was probably a Dev. But holy @#%$ was this guy bad ass looking!<br>
He hung out and watched our raid for awhile while we killed Maestro and named chanty chick that pops in organ room then poofed just as fast.<br>
<br>
Pathing of mobs was WAY worse than I've ever seen, with mobs in organ room running around and around for a LONG TIME and nearly impossible for MA/SA to hit long enough to get aggro and hold them in one place.<br>
<br>
The whole raid was really bazaar, and if not for Leadership and great skills by Nabukuni, Exmortis, Eldrig as leaders and tanks as well as Calystra and rastle (SP?) who was a guest on mezzes it would have been an unbearable raid and most likely a summon corpses whipe. Kudos to ALL there including guests for making what could have been an 8 hour CR into a VERY fun but nerve wracking raid.<br>
<br>
So word to the wise, as that other guild that I cant rmember the name of talked about awhile ago all is not well in the land of hate, go in prepared for some HORRID @#%$, weird inexplicable trains and worse than previous pathing.<br>

I've seen some weird stuff happen there, though I've only been there about 10 times.  You can aggro the second floor doing all sorts of things -- sitting too high on the wall, any kind of AE dd/stun spell, etc.  <br>
<br>
Red names are people who are tagged as PK -- you know, handing the book to the Priest of Discord when you're a noob.  I've seen a few people in the bazaar with red names, I guess as an attention-getter.  Could have been a Dev or GM of some kind though investigating you though, would imagine they can appear however they like.  <br>
<br>
I'm doubting Verant has changed PoH lately, but who knows, maybe you just got a buggy pop.<br>

We cleared the whole zone basically without incident including all the mini bosses (Inny was not up) but our MP did comment on how screwy the pathing was even for POH and the pulls on the 2nd floor were tricky because the mobs pathing seemed to make them 'stick' where they were at times.<br>
Kudos to our MP Raginfistz for a monumental pulling session.<br>
Seems like it got even worse the next day.<br>
Seems like POH is like this every 2 weeks or so.<br>

<br>
Here are a few of the gotcha's;<br>
<br>
1. On Eastern wall there is a Spite Golem that warps in from North to South and runs full speed up to the ceiling in SE corner and poofs. He can be targetted he can add out of no where.<br>
<br>
2. Do NOT fight near any walls. Mobs will aggro though walls and will take the long way around to get to you.<br>
<br>
3. If a spectre (Liche) grav fluxes anyone, have them check there logs for a not spectre hit from 2nd floor mobs.<br>
<br>
4. Do not push any mob more than half way up the wall, do not let and PC's move more than half way up the wall or you will aggro 2nd floor.<br>
<br>
5.  If your using the SW SS, the tilted pilar can be climbed on and up to the ceiling, but DO NOT DO IT, you will aggro 2nd floor mobs, <br>
<br>
6. If your using the SW SS, and you puller is clearing out the Maestro House, if he pulls out, and runs to West Wall then North behind Maestro to FD for the tag, you stand a good chance of Maestro making a house call. <br>
<br>
What happens is Superboy will aggro the puller through the wall. Unlike the rest of the mobs in that house, Superboy will not loose aggro and go home like the rest of the house. Instead he gets stuck in there bouncing around like a pinball untill he finds the doorway. That could be 5 or 10 minutes. The he paths due South and turns West and comes out near the tilted pilar.<br>
<br>
7. Once in a while Inny will get aggrod out of his house, and he can end up getting stuck any where on 2nd floor. I've had friends who had him camp OVER the SW SS. Not very pretty, makes for a short raid. Anytime someone went on the wall or on the tiled piller, INNY HIMSELF made a house call.<br>
<br>
I won't even get into 2nd floor.<br>

He didn't show up on a /who list and you couldn't target him.  He was also parked half in a wall.  He was a Vah'Shir with GM type armor and equipment.  <br>
<br>
As for the agro of the second floor - no one was up high on the wall.  The agro came after we moved into and had been fighting in the organ room (can't sit on walls in there).  One of our clerics won some armor and on his run over to the corpse he got wacked by 3 second floor mobs. He looted, sat down and camped to clear agro.  We had a guest bard die about 6 times - each time in the same location and each time by second floor mobs.  Agro of the second floor mobs was in one certain area in the organ room - about 10 feet in front of the pillar.  We never had a train and the second floor mobs never moved - they just wacked people who passed through the &quot;sweet spot&quot; as we started calling it.<br>
<br>
Yes, pathing is screwy in Hate but what we experienced yesterday was far from the &quot;normal&quot; pathing for Hate.  On the up-side though we had some very nice drops on epic pieces and armor so it was worth the pain.<br>
<br>
Taffers, <br>
You will probably do fine - the way pathing was you could train and it would be 5 minutes before the mobs get to you. Hopefully, though it will be back to normal when you do your run.<br>

<br>
Soon after first pulls started i would have some mobs come in and path directly into a wall and eventually warp on me.Even if i stood right beside the mob it wouldn't hit me,just path and warp after 5 seconds or so.After awhile it was like i could see the aggro building up everwhere even if i /q'ed out and gave it afew minutes.<br>
<br>
After seeing that i called for a campout after Maestro and the hand just for safety and at least one more time i can remember because i could tell we were going to be in trouble if we didn't.<br>
<br>
Once we made it to the 2nd floor it was even worse.Mobs would sometimes just stand there and let me hit them for up too 5 seconds or so without even noticing me.Then they would eventually follow me but get stuck between pillars or whatever was there no matter how i tried to bring them back but would never warp up there.<br>
<br>
I don't think we had any mobs hitting us at camp through the ceilings or anything but from a pullers perspective something is up.<br>
<br>
We pulled about half of the 2nd floor and all the named and called it a night.We took our time and had no wipes luckily but i agree something was definantly different.I've pulled Hate several times and never have i seen it like that before.<br>

In fact after getting the Mage epic drop we pulled one last draco in hope of getting the hide and the damn thing WOULD NOT follow puller downstairs. He'd run up and whale on it, get a good aggro, start backing off and it woyuld just stay there or path off then back to pop loc. This happened over and over till finally we gave up and charged the whole riad in and killed it LOL. Aggro was strange, and as you said after awhile of pulling it you could see the aggro building in strange ways..<br>
<br>
I think Rhynn is right, you could almost run around in there and not get a train..LOL the dang things will hardly folllow and spend so much time running in circles its almost funny to watch.<br>
<br>
Be careful though, as we learned on our first pull just when you think everything is 100% normal (at least as normal as Hate gets) you get a freak train like ours..inexplicable and just keeps coming and coming LOL.<br>

Total for the day was 2 Cleric BP's..pretty much all the other barney stuff to complete a full set plus some..<br>
<br>
My Iksar warrior scored 4 pieces including BP..3 were in the first 2 or 3 pulls..<br>
<br>
Enchanter drops like MAD..C-1 staff, legs galore, bracers, Arms, along with a ton of other stuff..one of our chanty's loaded up just for CR gear heheheh<br>
<br>
Shaman 3 pieces off ONE mob..plus iksar Shammy boots along with a couple other drops.<br>
<br>
Epic drops were warrior (grats to my warrior Nemisys), Enchanter (grats Calystra) Mage (Grats to Gryph)<br>
A whole slew of other drops also.<br>
An amazing day for B&amp;B drops wise if you could deal with all the other issues.. <p><center>
