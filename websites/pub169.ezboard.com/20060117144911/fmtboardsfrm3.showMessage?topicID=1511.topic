<br>
Now that the liars have posted their lies, it's time to post some facts:<br>
1. Frynnde caused the problems in the Great Divide over the weekend.  Why?  Because my group was moving through there to get to Icewell Keep to kill the Coldain King Dain Frostreaver IV.  We were moving through and some of the coldain lined up for some quest began to fight my group.  My group fought back.  During that fight, we were spammed by the raid there to stop and just move through the zone.  So we did that!  We didn't kill any mobs!  We ran through to Thurgadin.  After a few minutes when all characters were in Thurgadin, I got a tell from Frynnde where he threatened me with a bunch of B.S.  My first thought was: Now I understand why he was kicked out of the Sphere of Legends guild.  <br>
2. The other fact about Frynnde is that he stopped playing Everquest for about a year or two and only a few months ago came back.  So cancelling his account doesn't mean jack about anything.<br>
3. I have purchased all of the accounts for all of the characters that I play on the Morell-Thule server.  I wrote a message to one of the GMs of the server and told them that!  Will I be banned for this?  No!  Why?  Because I am paying them to play the game.  That's why.  It may be against the EULA, but one thing you all are not understanding.  You're not understanding that the EULA doesn't state what will happen to an account if it IS transferred.  It doesn't state the account will be banned.<br>
4. The GMs are NOT stupid and SOE isn't going to do anything to any of the GMs such as move them around simply because ONE person caused all of this (Yes, I'm talking about Frynnde) and SOE knows this.  Why do they know it?  Because they read this message board.  And what is posted here?  Well, you see about 2 or 3 message threads posted about the same issue from the same person (Frynnde) that is completely against the policies of this message board.  Not only that, but this player who threatened me in the game and was reported against for that threat, continues to post to try to gather players together to complain to SOE.  So this is ONE person with ONE issue that has posted multiple times to get other players to complain about the same issue.<br>
5. Kelmore and other Administrators of this message board buys accounts and tries to make money from the Everquest game.  How would I know this?  One reason is that he maintains a daily interest at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.playerauctions.com">www.playerauctions.com</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> and when there is a good deal, he contacts the person to try to get a good price on the character so he can make money from it.  How would I know?  LOL!!!  Because he tried to buy Renalan!  The person I bought Renalan from had told me he had already sent him money for the character and that he was mad about it because I had bought Renalan instead.<br>
6. There are more boxers in the game than most of you realize.  Just about all of you do not like boxers.  Why?  Because you are not able to get the loot they can get.  It's that simple.  Not because they have done anything wrong to you.  For example, read the message board post about Moya in the Most Hated section.  There, you will see no incident that Moya did anything to any other player.  You will see a few accusations, but if you really were there in BoT, you would find that Moya was going after a MOB that the other players were going after.  And knowing Moya, (yes, we went after the same mob also a few times) this player plays fairly.  If Moya gets to the mob before your group does, then Moya is entitled to the mob just as any other player does.  The part of the zone that Moya mostly plays in, no other players usually play there until the BOSS MOB pops.  Well, Moya is usually already there and when the players get there seeing Moya fighting the boss mob, they usually take matters into their own hands.<br>

To say &quot; other adminstrators &quot; is kinda a strech.   To the best of my info, no other admins use pa, and also, i dont think mod's do either.  Its no secret, and never has been that i bought mastere off PA( actually, i didnt buy him from pa, i bought him from the person that bought him off pa the day he bought him on PA). I did contact about renalan, but never sent him money for renalan.  Doesnt matter, he was a bit high priced.  More then i was willing to pay anyway.  But my last PA transaction was long ago... i'll have to go look .<br>
<br>
<br>
ok, went and looked.<br>

Like I said before, this guy feeds on this. Ego ego ego. <br>
<br>
I recall him begging War Criminals for an alliance, telling us how great it would be to be really evil and hated. From that time, he doesn't understand the difference between being evil, which is a game mechanic; and being honorable, which is a game play characteristic.  <br>
<br>
I have one thing to add. <br>
<br>
Buh-bye!<br>

The emails sent covered more then two incidents.  They cover you saying what you will do time and again.  They cover you coming out to kill the turn-in mob on Ring War - not once, but twice (so much for that running through theory since it even respawned).  <br>
<br>
They cover you admitting (as above) that you bought a bunch of players on pa, that you were training the zone of BoT on purpose, that you were going to make SOE do your bidding, and that you were going to &quot;terrorize&quot; the server. <br>
<br>
They cover multiple purposeful training incidents so you could kill off people to get the mob you want.  <br>
<br>
Etc... Etc... <br>
<br>
You have always been a good liar.  Lied for years about not being all 12 (despite the massive evidence), lied about all your training incidents over the years, and now SOE is getting to hear a lot about all your incidents since the GMs weren't taking care of the issue.  <br>
<br>
You can lie here, too, and hope SOE sees it and &quot;forgives you&quot;.  We will continue to send the info and let them see you for who you really are though. <br>

Actually Sunfool, whether Fryy contacted you or not, I don't know.<br>

As I was the one running that raid,<br>
I was the one who contacted you and told you you had been petitioned after you HAD killed some of the Dwarves.<br>

You jsut happened to mess with the wrong people this time Suntool. We're not going to sit back and take it from you any longer.<br>

How is that ban btw? Expect more if we have anything to do with it. And we do.<br>

BTW I have some song lyrics for you. <br>

Maybe you will remember them.<br>

What does that tell all of US?<br>
<br>
1) That training and killstealing is ok.<br>
<br>
2) That abiding by the rules of Sony is only suggestion, and not mandatory.<br>
<br>
I have a STRONG feeling, Mr. Nicky, that if you ever log back onto the MT server that your only welcoming party would be those of us that have decided to grief you 20 fold as you have griefed us.  If Sony lets you back, they are saying it's ok to train you and get you killed CONSTANTLY.<br>

During that fight, we were spammed by the raid there to stop and just move through the zone. So we did that! We didn't kill any mobs! We ran through to Thurgadin.

EGADS! You @#%$ tool. How the @#%$ do you expect ANYONE to believe that you know what a Belt of Dwarf Slaying is and do not know what the 10th ring war is. Hey, guess what fuckstick, when you lose the war because some tard came thru killing turn in mobs, you despawn all of Thurgadin AND all of Icewall Keep AND the dain will not pop for 24 hours. So, by killing the turn in mobs to end the war, you in essence shoved your OWN @#%$ up your OWN ass and rode yourself hard and fast. You despawned your own @#%$ uber loot mob you dumbass.<br>
<br>
@#%$ you Sunmoon. If they ever DO let you back into the game, I will have a reason to unretire my monk, i will then deguild him, then completely dissassociate my monk from my main account and my guild. I will then spend gleeful hours finding your ass in game and training every KoS mob I can find onto your lame little party. I figure with your l337 boxing skillz, you might be able to save 2 or 3 characters from dying. I will eat DEATH after DEATH just so I can screw you eternally. I am sure that almost any cleric around would be more than happy to come rez my dozen or so corpses for free. I am also confident that people will be more than happy to send me tells in game to inform me where you zoned to last. <br>
