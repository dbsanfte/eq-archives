A hot breeze ruffled her robe, and she could feel sweat on her stomach and the backs of her legs. Velvet ants and fiddleheads were tangled in her dirty hair, the taste of gnomish general cleaner and Qeynos whiskey in her mouth.<br>
<br>
&quot;What in the hell happened to me?&quot; she thought, sitting up. Her bags were with her, and all her belongings. The movement spiked pain through her head, and she grabbed at her face, crying into her palms. &quot;Oh Cazic!&quot; she moaned into her hands... she could almost see sadistic black spirals running in her veins, blurring out anything but the unique torture of a brutal hangover.<br>
<br>
After snuffling and whining for a bit, she lowered her stained hands from her face. It was starting to get dark, and she summoned a cold stone to see by. Its bluish, wavery light revealed little about her surroundings, except a few nasty looking pine boughs and the white sand she sat on. It was a beach! The blackish water lapped quietly a few yards away. There were footsteps in the grit, humanoid and animal. She tried to remember what had happened before.<br>
<br>
Fuzzy images swam up from her conscience: a troll who seemed to be selling her something, a tomb that she was fond of and haunted frequently. Black armored men on horseback, yelling at her... A dark elf, young, with blood sprayed on his hands and face. He was talking with her, sobbing, wringing his hands. Something about his wife...<br>
<br>
She murmured a ritual of service, and the ground further up the shore started to squeak and tear. Bones clattered up into the air, forming a shape: a wolf. The beasts skeleton settled, then took a few steps forward. Quickly, it got its footing and trotted up to her, tilting its head to one side, as a dog would do in response to a complicated command or strange sound. &quot;Wood. A fire...&quot; she whispered, running her fingers over its bleary skull. The hound loped off, and she could hear its clumsy body crashing through the underbrush on its simple quest. She sat, listening to the surprised squawks of birds and terrified animals at this new abomination of hers, musing that she could kill and animate a bat or owl to take a survey of the surrounding area. Instead, she wiped the maggots from her hands, and took a Halas pie and some water from a pack.<br>
<br>
&quot;His name was... Yhtil. And what was he upset about? A slaying... his wife. Murdered in the Southern Karanas... I saw her body. How was she killed?...&quot; Sosoca went on like this for awhile, piecing the night together. She interviewed herself for a while, as the dead wolf brought back bundles of dry pine, piling them up beside her. Little beasts with shiny eyes stared at her balefully from the dark, an erudite talking to herself in the woods.<br>
<br>
At last, she thought she had it right. Chewing a bit of polar bear fat thoughtfully, she went over it again.<br>
<br>
&quot;His name was Yhtil something. His wife had been murdered that night, in South Karana... near the river. Her head had been caved in by something blunt. He wanted me to revive her, but I couldnt... All I could do was reanimate her for a short time, and he could maybe take her to a cleric or paladin who would help him with ressurecting her for good...&quot;<br>
<br>
He had been handsome... short, with blackish hair and pretty blue eyes. His young wife was fairer, even in death. The side of her head that wasnt crushed was perfectly formed, with lovely lips and almond shaped eyes. A mane of white hair framed her destroyed face, leading ones vision to her slender neck. Her body was shapely, covered with bits of chain armor and treated silks. It was raining, and Sosoca watched her upturned face gather water in her eye sockets, streaming over the edge like tears. <br>
<br>
&quot;How did it happen? When?&quot; Sosoca asked, squatting down next to the corpse. She opened her pack, pulling a few dusty bone chips out into the wetness. They soon glistened like broken teeth in her hand, drenched by the downpour. <br>
<br>
He had trouble getting anything across over his pitiful wretches and sobs. &quot;I dont know! I dont remember... Please bring her back, I love her so... so much!&quot; Sosoca stared at him over the top of her veil, eyeing him curiously. She shrugged, figuring that the shock of losing ones spouse was enough to scramble anyones memory. She stood up, and brushed the excess water from her oiled robes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well. Stand back.&quot; She took the chips into one hand, and twirled them between her fingers. Speaking in Erudite, she chanted something dark and incomprehensible into the dead woman's body, into the air, the ground, the wet sky. &quot;Cushus senza melik'ah rith-aul boro-gah!...&quot; A thick moan escaped the corpses lips.<br>
<br>
The little elf gasped, and stepped back. Her body was writhing on the ground, sunfishing into the mud. It smooth got to its feet, and stood swaying. There was nothing jerky about her, this zombie was all loops and whirls of movement. Her face went in and out of focus, like a gnome was playing with lenses somewhere. Slow movement of her hand left trails, blurs of color in the air. She spoke in a guttural whipser to them: &quot;Why... What did I do...&quot;<br>
<br>
Sosoca stepped back, unnerved by this weird reanimation. Zombies were all jerks and harsh movement, and never spoke. She was supposed to just get up, and stumble along with her husband to the nearest sympathetic cleric. The corpse in front of her undulated to a current she couldnt see, waving in and out of sight like a will o wisp. There was something wrong.<br>
<br>
Yhtil, meanwhile, had fallen to his knees in front of his dead wife, grasping her legs in a hug. He cried into her chain skirt: &quot;Im sorry! Im so sorry... sorry... please...&quot; The girl looked down at him, her eyes swirling with strange color. &quot;You did this... why?&quot;<br>
<br>
Sosoca decided this was her time to exit. Nothing was going to keep her with a freshly animated corpse and its killer, not this erudite, no way no how... She ran off into the night, trying not to hear. <br>
<br>
&quot;When I found his things in our room, I didnt know what to do! Im sorry!&quot; she heard him cry. He sounded genuinely mournful, but Sosoca didnt think that would hold sway with his wife. He continued to scream his sorrow, but eventually he was just screaming, the sound of his horror and pain becoming hollow and faint with distance. Sosoca kept running, cursing herself for getting involved.<br>
<br>
The wolf had gathered the wood, and Sosoca let him back where he belonged. The skeleton collapsed with a sigh, and the bones sunk back into the ground. She arranged the wood in a pattern, and looked around. Spotting a moth, she whispered 'Ignite... fire in your veins...' and the small creature burst into flame. She grabbed it and swatted the poor animal into the wood, where the heat from the spell caught. Soon, she had a nice fire going. <br>
<br>
Looking out onto the river, she thought aloud: &quot;Never get involved with in a marital spat. Nothing is worth the wrath of a woman killed by jealousy and brought back for love.&quot;<br>
<br>
She poked at the fire with her claw from Charisis. It would be true night soon, and she started planning her trip back home. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://rustem.jeeran.com/images/armssig2.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
