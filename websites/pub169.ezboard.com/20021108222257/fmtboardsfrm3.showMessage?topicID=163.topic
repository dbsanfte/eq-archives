&quot;Kreket - This guy trains a LOT. He does it on purpose to see how players respond then logs out after you petition him. The GM-Admin's know of him and when they catch him, he will be banned from Everquest and we can be happy knowing that one bad apple is gone!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
WTF??<br>
<br>
<br>
i once had the name kreket in-game. i camped that name for a year. then i decided to re-roll and actually start playing him, but once deleted, i couldn't get that name back. now..what are you talking about? is there actually someone running around with MY name? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You replied to the post that said he ninja'd the druid epic piece. He got pissed and picked a few of the names of those that were against him in that thread and claimed they had ebayed their character and made up one bad story about them as well.<br>

But he didn't know your in game name for sure, he just had to go by what's on this board. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/utfosorcimmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TfosorcimMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/29/02 9:51:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   interesting</span><hr size=1> <br>
All of those posts were quite entertaining.  In fact, some of them I was ROFL.<br>

I'm not on this guy's side, but what was the reason he was banned?  What rule did he break?  He posted the same things you have posted against him.  Does this mean that all of you are going to be banned as well?<br>

Club Fu Train Index <br>
<br>
Hello to you all. It's been a long while since I have posted here, but I am currently soliciting input for a little project I've wanted to do for quite some time. I hope you enjoy it, and please let me know any other categories you can think of.<br>
<br>
- Flitterbick<br>
============================<br>
CLUB FU TRAIN INDEX<br>
(compiled by Breathe/Flitterbick, proud member of the Club Fu guild on Bristlebane )<br>
<br>
Trains in EverQuest are an inevitable occurance. Yet despite the frequency of trains, little effort has been expended towards the scientific goal of rating these oft-maligned forces of nature.<br>
<br>
Until now . . .<br>
<br>
NOTE - For your train to be valid for rating under the CFTI, it must be an UNPLANNED train. While any idiot can maliciously cause a train if they set their mind to it, TRUE training comes from the heart. It is the wondrous alignment of lag, carelessness, and sheer dumb luck that coalesces into a living, breathing example of Chaos Theory at it's finest. Spontaneity is your goal, and this is defeated by premeditation or intentional efforts to increase your CFTI once you realize your innocent little pull has mutated into the most feared of all events . . . a train.<br>
<br>
This index would not have been possible without the dedicated, nay FANATIC efforts of the many pullers within Club Fu and the many suggestions from others across all servers. I would thank you individually, but I'm too busy looting my corpse. <br>
