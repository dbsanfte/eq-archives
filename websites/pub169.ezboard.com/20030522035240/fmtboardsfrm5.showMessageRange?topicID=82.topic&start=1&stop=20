<br>
This morning, I woke up at about 6 am to the most disturbing dream I think I have ever had. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
I was at an ex's house eating Twizzlers, watching some midget porn (yes I am really mental) and she comes over to me and starts trying to make out with me. I am thinking, hey, why not! So she's got her tongue down my throat and all of a sudden, she starts whipping it around. It was cool for a second, til she hit my tooth. I threw her off of me and reached in to pull out a filling! No sooner did I pull that filling out, my mouth filled with blood. Not sure why, considering pulling a filling out will not make you bleed, but anyhoo. All of my teeth started hurting after that. I reached in and pulled out a filling from every tooth (mind you, I have 1 filling) and my mouth was just gushing with blood. So while I bleeding all over their white carpet (they actually have blue) I grabbed a Super Sized Cup from McDonald's (I haven't eaten McDonald's for a good month atleast) and began bleeding into it. When it would fill up, I would drink it, cause I was afraid I was gonna bleed to death.....<br>
<br>
I woke up after my 5th glass full.<br>

Now someone tell me that is not fu<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->cked up?? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/urodomatic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rodomatic</A> at: 8/25/02 3:43:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ujobrillsolwynd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JoBrill Solwynd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/25/02 3:55:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What's your weirdest dream?</span><hr size=1> Dunno if I've ever had one as screwy as that, but everyone has !@#$ed up dreams from time to time.

<br>
Through some turn of events, this certain doll came into the possession of my best friend who just happened to be very ill and could not get out of her bed.  And being the devoted best friend that I was, I volunteered to take the doll back to where it belonged.<br>
<br>
This was Part 1.  Part 2 did not come until a few months later.   I mean, I did not dream about the doll again until a few months later.<br>
<br>
The doll caused havoc wherever it was because some dark evil power wanted it for its own.  You see, the doll had something in its head and so this evil power wanted that very much.  Anyhow, the only safe place where the evil one could not touch the doll was on my best friend's bed.<br>
<br>
Part two involved me fighting off these creepy plant things armed with nothing but a sharp wooden stake.<br>
<br>
Part 3 (again, after a few more months) was inside the tomb of the little girl who owned the doll.  After fighting off lots of bad stuff, I was finally at the end of the journey, or so I thought.  The blasted little girl was not at her tomb, so my mission was not yet complete.<br>
<br>
It's been two years now, and I have not dreamed about the french doll. <p><center><img src="http://members.aol.com/eqjassy/images/jassy-southpark.jpg" alt=""><br>

Between this post and the episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; (where he had birds living in his beard) this is the dream I had last night:<br>
<br>
Was hanging out with my parents (both deceased) at some holiday gathering when I had to use the bathroom.  So I go to the bathroom but don't need to &quot;go&quot;..so I am washing up and my stomach is itching like crazy.  I lift my shirt and there are spiders in my belly button.  Totally freaking me out I am trying to pull them out and they keep biting me and dodging me.  My belly button was also the size of a quarter (it's an inny) in this dream.  I was totally freaked.  And they were acting like ants protecting eggs.  I woke up, looked around my room, realized it was a dream, cursed Rodo a few times, went back to sleep.<br>

<br>
      Weird dreams of Laralanla:<br>
<br>
           -Godzilla arising out of a non-navigable river to <br>
            destroy my hometown.  (I have no idea why<br>
            my mind chose this, I've had a few dreams that<br>
            can be traced to television viewing, but I never felt <br>
            the need to watch the Godzilla movies.)  I think the<br>
            point here is that most people thought they could<br>
            be safe by hiding inside buildings.<br>
          -Something generating radioactive saliva which<br>
            originated from some old house, which caused<br>
            people to act in a rabid manner<br>
          -Arguing with a professor over &quot;false prophets&quot;<br>
          -Going down a two lane road in a spaceship<br>
          -Going to church naked<br>
          -A &quot;world divide&quot; on the other side of my hometown,<br>
            where Ghosts lived. <br>
          -A dream that centered around the Spanish word<br>
            &quot;repuesto&quot;.  The dream itself wasn't that weird,<br>
            except I didn't remember ever committing what <br>
            the word &quot;repuesto&quot; meant to memory.  I go into<br>
            work the next day and see it on a pen refill package.<br>
<br>
<br>
   Most of these happened when I was much younger.  The ones that seem tamer are more recent.<br>
<br>
    On the last bit, I think its proof that the subconscious pays attention when you aren't.  I've had other dreams that had a &quot;soundtrack&quot; as it were, of songs that I certainly couldn't remember the words to if I were awake.<br>

<br>
---One of 'em was when I was like 7 or 8... and I went outside in my back yard and saw a razor (kinda like a pocket knife but not a `knife`) and i picked it up and threw it at the tree in my backyard... it hit the tree cutting off part of the top and blood starting pooring out.... i ran inside and couldn't find anyone so I ran into my parent's bathroom and there were like 50 razor blades and chinese throwing stars and chain saws and swords all floating around......<br>
 <br>
       and I ran to my friends house and he was having some party and i turned on the news and it was talking about these razors flying around the world killing everyone and that a helicoptor saw a little boy throw one and started the whole phenomanon(sp?) and my friends Matthew, Heath, James(who isnt my friend anymore), Chris, and this chick I met in kindergarten or D-1 named Chantal.... <br>
<br>
           and they were having this party (i had no clue about the party?_?) and all of a sudden they wanted to go outside, I tried to explain bout the razors and Chantal told me that she wanted to show me her bathing suit so i was like ...... okay...... (lol sheesh i've been a perv since i was a wee little boy &gt;&lt;) and we all went outside and Chantal took off her clothes and had on this pink bathing suit and I was like wow =) and then Matthew invited some girls over and we ended up having like 6 girls and 3-4 guys and they wanted to play spin the rock (like bottle but we didnt have a bottle =P) and so Laura spun first and got James and they kissed.... and then they were out and Heath spun and kissed Sarah and they were out and then I spun and got Chantal and I was like uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....................... *hesitate* and she kissed me and stuck her throat in my mouth.... i was like @$^*$% I can't breathe ! shes choking me!<br>
<br>
                   and a razor came by and cut her head off........ in the middle of the kiss....... and then they continued to slice my friends up peice by peice and I sat there watching..... waiting to be cut or killed myself........ and the razors all flew into the sky...... it was like a tornado of razors and i ran to my house and shut the doors and they were all trying to get into my house and i saw my parents coming home and as soon as they got to the door..... the razors cut them up..... and I started crying so badly.....<br>
<br>
                The razors continued trying to get in and they started to crack the glass door.... so I shut the wood door(front door = one see thru door and one big wooden door) and then i went to the back and saw they had made a little hole already and i ran around the whole house shutting EVERY door and I finally ran into my parents bathroom and since that has the most doors between any door outside and where I was..... and I was hiding in a corner... holding my legs crying.... and I heard the razors getting into the bathroom and then I wasn't myself.... I was watching myself...... and I saw hundreds of razors rush in at once and covered me completely... I saw blood... and woke suddenly &gt;=(<br>
<br>
      I had nightmares for so long after that...... =\ <p><center><i>Teadyn Timberwolf ~ 59 Epic Druid of Morell-Thule</i></center>

<br>
I'm sitting with two guys across from me at ten and two, we're on bar stools and we're talking about math. Not solving problems just sorta talking theory. The guy on my right lets out a small sigh, and looks somewhat nervously from left to right. When he does it I see that he is totally flat, like a piece of paper. So much so that when his head turns his shoulders and chest twist as well. He remarks in passing ; 'Whoa, this is too dimensional for me.'<br>

I swear that's a real dream.

<br>
My dreams are also affected by things that happen to me during the day. One time a friend and his girlfriend stayed over my place and that day he pissed me off. So in the middle of the night I shouted Go F*&amp;K yourself and his name luckly he didnt wake up but his girlfriend and I did. sad thing is Ive doon this more then once. <br>

I just woke up from my worst dream! I was at some party, and I was drinking, when things all of a sudden got kind of rowdy, so I left, because I remembered I had something very important to do. <br>
<br>
So I leave and get to this huge appartment building, and I take out these two small m-80 sized things encased in some sort of heavy duty plastic... I am supposed to toss them so that the covering will break and the little fuse will catch fire... and the most interesting part, the little things are actually potent thermonuclear devices... so I toss the first one, but it slips out of my hands and flies backwards, so i have to run to the grass, and fall to my knees searching for this tiny bomb in the dark.<br>
<br>
As im searching, this old woman is throwing out the trash, and she comes over to ask me what im doing, I find the bomb and am able to cover up what im doing with the old contact lens excuse, finally I toss the thing up into the building, but the covering doesnt crack so the fuse doesnt light.<br>
<br>
So I rush up the elevator, with these two other old people who were in it, finally on one of the top floors, I find it on the ground, pick it up, and get back into the elevator, holding the bomb in my hand on the way back down, i began to feel warmth, and terror as I find out the tiny fuse is lit... so i stuff the fuse in my mouth, trying to extinguish it, the only thought in my mind was that im in a tiny elevator with a nuclear weapon about to explode, this is gonna suck...<br>
<br>
the fuse keeps burning in spite of the saliva, and just as the fuse runs out and I tighten my eyes in preperation to be vaporized I wake up screaming!<br>
<br>
AHHHHH that sucked so hard... im gonna go smoke a bowl<br>
