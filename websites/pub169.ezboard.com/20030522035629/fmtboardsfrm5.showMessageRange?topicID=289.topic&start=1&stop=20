<br>
me? i got hundreds, but will pick a couple.<br>
<br>
Cutter and Starwise from Elfquest. Great Characters both. Best Friends and inseperable. always wanted a friend like that when i was younger.<br>
<br>
Captain America. Worshipped the guy. especially when he realized the hypocrisy of using his &quot;super soldier&quot; body to fight things like drugs and such, so he tried to purge it from his system to be pure again. Truth, Liberty, and BASHING THE BAD GUY, whats not to love?<br>
<br>
Archangel, aka Angel, aka Warren Warrington III. born with the wings of an angel, perverted at the hands of Apocalypse. constantly struggling between his noble heart and the dark will of his wings of razors.<br>
<br>
Wolverine. no list of comic greats would be complete without his name at the top of the list. from his mysterious past (have they ever revealed exactly how old he is, cause i know he predates his weapon-x days in WW2, personally i think hes immortal and not a mutant at all,perhaps alien)to his blades of vengance, this is one cat you dont want to wake up in the morning. just ask Rouge from Xmen the movie(was anyone else annoyed they put her character in place of Jubilee? course if they hadnt Jubilee would be a corpse).<br>

Mark Millar's Ultimate Captain America is much better than the mainstream Marvel Universe Captain though. I mean anyone who would kick the Hulk in the balls, well...<br>
<br>
Wolverine..pfft. Overrated and overexposed.<br>
<br>
Jessica Jones, the main character in Marvel's Alias. One of their MAX books from ages 17+. Love her, anyone who can use &quot;F&quot; word in single sentance 6 times is awesome.<br>
<br>
Emma Frost. I remember being like 13 and picking up an issue of the X-Men and she was in her all white victorian s &amp; m outfit and being like &quot;whoa&quot;.<br>
<br>
Wildstorm comics which is owned by DC published a title called The Authority that was really good. It poked fun at a large portion of classic comic book heroes, such as having a gay version of Batman and Superman, a Captain America who was a serial rapist, a Dr. Strange like guy who was a heroin junkie and a million other little inside jokes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yuliann>yuliann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/27/02 7:06:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Comic/Toon Characters</span><hr size=1> Lobo...<br>

     I think the only other 'graphic novels' I've read are the Incarnations of Immortality series...after the books, a 'comic book rendition' was started, only to be cut short before it was finished, because of the artists untimely death..but the books were beautiful--seemed to be illustrated as either airbrush or something, but was very realistic....<br>

      And some book, called 'The Watchmen' which was ok, but a little long at times<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The Ultimates--(Marvel) Basically taking the concept of the Avengers and making it contemporary and realistic. For instance Giant Man pops prozac and beats his wife, Thor is a mentally unstable male nurse with a messiah complex, and The Hulk is a homicidal maniac who runs around screaming things like &quot;Betty make Hulk horny!&quot;<br>
<br>
Sandman-- (Vertigo) Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Maus-- A version of the holocaust, told as if the the characters were animals. This is gripping.<br>
<br>
Y The Last Man (Vertigo)-- Something happens, causing every single male mammal on the planet to suddenly die. Except for one man, and his pet monkey.<br>
<br>
Alias (Marvel MAX)-- Takes place in the Marvel universe and is about a failed superhero named Jessica Jones who has her own detective agency.You know its a good book when the heroine has anal sex with Power Man in the very first issue.<br>
<br>
The Watchman (DC)-- Another take on the whole &quot;realistic super heroes&quot;.<br>
<br>
Kingdom Come (DC)-- This book is entirely painted by Alex Ross and takes place in the future of the DC universe.<br>
<br>
Preacher (Vertigo)-- Not a book for the easily offended.<br>
<br>
30 Days of Night (IDW)-- Barrow, Alaska is a small town, that once a year has a month without sunlight. Barrow gets some visitors, and lets put it this way, they don't like sunlight, and are on a liquid diet. The art in this book actually some of the creepiest I have ever seen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cannabulon>Cannabulon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/graphics/zen.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Secret Master of the<BR>Marshmallow Silique</span><br>  Posts: 389<br> <font color=#628CBC>(11/28/02 1:29:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://japanese.about.com/library/weekly/graphics/zen.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Comic/Toon Characters</span><hr size=1> Ahh the death miniseries, I remember counting down the days till that came out and buying all four issues =)<br>

Dream was almost like a father to Delirium sometimes, what a wonderfull combo they made. The rest of them are great too, Destiny being blind, the odd hermaphrodite nature of desire, they are like the osbournes of eternity!<br>
