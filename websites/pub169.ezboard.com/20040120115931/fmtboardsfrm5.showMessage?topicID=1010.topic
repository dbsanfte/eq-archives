<br>
(Dec. 23) -- Fighting to shed a few pounds and control that waistline? For the soaring number of Americans who are becoming dangerously overweight, states and cities across the country want to help.<br>
<br>
With the U.S. Surgeon General calling obesity an epidemic, legislators nationwide are offering measures to encourage healthy food choices and ban the worst temptations.<br>
<br>
Skeptics say government should stay away from trying to legislate something as personal as what we eat. But supporters say they can't ignore a growing public health problem or how it drives the ever-rising cost of health care.<br>
<br>
Few ideas have become law yet. But states have considered scores of bills this year that would, among other things: get kids exercising; warn restaurant eaters about fat, sugar and cholesterol on the menu; and, ban sugary sodas and fattening chips from school vending machines.<br>
<br>

   <br>
In a Louisiana experiment, the state will pay for a few government employees' gastric bypass surgery - or stomach stapling - to see if it reduces health care costs.<br>
<br>
&quot;As a country, we have to wake up. We are in an epidemic,&quot; said Nevada state Sen. Valerie Wiener, who has had her own battles with weight but now is a champion weightlifter.<br>
<br>
She heads a state committee gathering data on obesity, and how the legislature, food companies, the health care system and schools can act. &quot;We're all paying the price,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Under the laws that have passed, states will:<br>
<br>
Test the BMI - body-mass index, a ratio of height to weight - of students in six Arkansas schools, and send results home. Pediatricians say regular tests like this should be performed nationwide to track children at risk of becoming obese.<br>
<br>
   <br>
 &quot;As a country, we have to wake up. We are in an epidemic.&quot;<br>
-Nevada state Sen. Valerie Wiener   <br>
   <br>
Ban junk food from vending machines in California. New York City, in an administrative decision, banned hard candy, doughnuts, soda and salty chips from its vending machines.<br>
<br>
Require physical education programs in Louisiana schools, and encourage it in Arkansas and Mississippi. Though once a staple, such daily classes are now only required by state law in Illinois; other states let local officials decide or require exercise less often.<br>
<br>
Public campaigns aimed at getting people to change their eating habits also remain popular. Billboards across West Virginia, featuring photos of bulging stomachs and couch potatoes, exhort people to &quot;Put Down Chips &amp; Trim Those Hips.&quot; Houston, Philadelphia and San Antonio, Texas have started &quot;get fit&quot; drives.<br>
<br>
The statistics show the need for such efforts. The number of obese adults has doubled in 20 years, and is now up to nearly 59 million people, or almost a third of all American adults.<br>
<br>
Childhood obesity has tripled, with one child in six considered obese.<br>
<br>
As the pounds add up, so do the health care costs, because obesity is linked to diabetes, heart disease, and deaths from cancer - among other ailments.<br>
<br>
West Virginia found that, for state employees, costs for obesity have more than doubled since 1995, rising from $37 million to $78 million, now nearly a fifth of the employees' $400 million health plan.<br>
<br>
Still, some are critical both of the statistics and the proposals.<br>

   <br>
&quot;There's a lot of fear and hysteria,&quot; said Mike Burita at the Center for Consumer Freedom, an advocacy group for the restaurant and food industry. &quot;We're allowing government and these public health groups to dictate our food choices to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Among his top targets is the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group that produces a steady flow of warnings about unhealthy food, from movie popcorn to Chinese takeout.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's OK to have a cheeseburger and fries, but it shouldn't be a mainstay of your diet,&quot; Burita said. Exercise and education are the solutions, he said. &quot;Kids went from playing dodge ball to playing computer games.&quot;<br>
<br>
The skeptics are being heard. A Texas proposal to limit school children's access to snack and soda vending machines died after the state soft drink association complained. Most of the 80 or so obesity-related bills around the country also failed to pass.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's difficult to want to tackle something like this, something as huge as this,&quot; said Weiner, the Nevada lawmaker. She plans to bring together people from the food industry and the public health community to work with lawmakers.<br>
<br>
The federal government is acting, too. The Bush administration urged insurance companies to offer premium discounts to people with healthier lifestyles. It has started giving grants to cities to target unhealthy habits.<br>
<br>
More immediate changes are brewing on the state and local level.<br>
<br>
In West Virginia, the state agency that insures public employees has started offering exercise benefits and diet counseling, in addition to the state's advertising campaign.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we don't get a handle on this, this generation of kids coming up will have a shorter life span than their parents,&quot; said Nidia Henderson, wellness manager at West Virginia's Public Employees Insurance Agency. &quot;That's scandalous.&quot;<br>

Good job. The rest of the world thinks we're a bunch of fat pigs, and they're right.<br>
<br>
I know alot of you aren't, but we are the fattest country on this planet. I was overweight, it gave me problems. I lost the weight, no more problems.<br>
<br>
Same goes for you. I encourage all of you to do about 30 minutes of consistent exercise, that's all. Go walk around the 'hood for awhile, you might meet some neighbors or your future boyfriend/girlfriend.<br>
<br>
All things healthy, keep it in mind. You'll live longer if you're fat now. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">New Legacy<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Reactivated Bitch-Ass Wizard, Level 65<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE MAIL START--><a href="mailto:Maxximuus@earthlink.net"> Maxximuus@earthlink.net</a><!--EZCODE MAIL END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#1F0000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=menmoch>Menmoch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#AAAAAA>(12/24/03 11:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTF YO</span><hr size=1> Have to agree with ET there..  in high school i was quite a fat bish but between weight training and the Army i have been able to keep my weight down and i feel tons better.<br>

I don't however agree with the tax idea.. i knew damn well what i was eating wasn't good for me so i had to make a decision and stick with it..  all about willpower.<br>

I mean has taxing smokes really done much?  How about making pot illegal or even the drinking age. <br>

Guess all i'm saying is its gonna take education and the willingness of these people to make a change in their lives to do the trick, not taxing a candy bar or a quarter pounder <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=290779">Menmoch<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->57 Myrmidon of Innoruuk <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> Reapers of Sorrow</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

I wish I was kidding, his book roxxors, makes ya take responsibility for your weight, and the food book helps in portion control, and how much to actually eat in a day.  I've lost 8 pounds in about a week and a half between that and getting back to working out.  I'm hoping to lose the other 15 before April.<br>
<br>
Just gotta really want to be healthy, and need the right information, and motivation.<br>
<br>
Also, I believe in raising healthy kids.  My kids eat fruit and veggies and yogurt for snacks.  We rarely eat fast food, and most of our food is grilled, baked or steamed, never fried.  I also don't make them &quot;clean their plate&quot;.  I don't want them to lose track of that trigger that tells them that they're full.  It's so unfair to guilt them into eating just because they didn't guess properly on the portion.  So, I have a very petite 7 year old, and a slim 9 year old.  They even lift weights with Shandelmac and I, I think they have better muscles than I do. hehe, we make it a family thing, all of us w/ different sized dumbells or weight resistant band thingies.  The kids keep Shandel and I motivated cause they love working out as a family.<br>
<br>
Child obesity, along with many other problems could be solved  if more parents would take responsibility for teaching their kids, and for being involved and proactive in their kids lives.  As for the grown ups....dunno what the answer is.<br>
<br>
I think the government interfering thing is such a bad idea...but then again, I'm just an average schmuck, I couldn't possibly know what's best for me or my kids...<br>

I once had a personal trainer and the only thing he demanded I gave up while working out was cokes (which I didn't at the time) and now I'm starting to see the trend.<br>
<br>
My cousin, for example, was always kinda chunky but way short of obese. Since he graduated from High School, he's started carrying around this gallon mug that he fills up with coffee in the morning followed by 2-4 Dr. Peppers per day. In the past 8 months or so he's gained over 40lbs. <br>
<br>
I'm beginning to think what the cokes do is mess with your metabolism. I don't eat specifically healthy foods, but I don't eat pure junk 24/7 either. I'm out of shape aerobically, but no one could tell it just by looking at me. <br>
<br>
Anywho, try it out guys. I still drink beer on weekands and sometimes weeknights, I put salt good portions of my food, but I now drink water or juice as substitutes to coke. I'd say give it two months and see if your body has changed for the better.<br>
<br>
As for the government thing, I could care less. I think students in government schools should have mandatory excercise unless they have some physical ailment that could be detrimental to their health under intense excercise. Restraunts should have their nutritional information on deck for requests, but not mandatory on their menus. Also I think part of PE in elementary and then again during health class in High School should focus more on understanding nutrional information. I look at grams of fat, % of vitamins, and all that other information on the sides of boxes and just see numbers. Perhaps had they gone further than just forcing me to memorize the food pyramid, I might have a grip on understanding nutrition.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://yeishinu.mysitespace.com/valsig.jpg "/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
Italians enjoy 2hrs a day for a lunch break and eat late with their family and or friends just about daily. Even with such a a great importance put into food they are much more thin than Americans as a whole. The main reasons for this has to do with what they eat and how much they eat. For the most part portions are noticeably smaller. The first week or so me and my friends were ordering extra portions because what we ordered was just not enough for it to be satisfying. And no Im not overweight (about 155 at 5'-9&quot;) Eventually I got used to the portions and slowly ate less over the course of the few months I was there. Interestingly enough I somehow gained weight. Only reason I can think of is the food was fatty, lots of cheeses and oils are used in cooking food. I also ate a lot of Gelato,, damn that stuff is good; I love Ice Cream.<br>
<br>
As far as fast food goes there was a McDonalds and some Italian variety of fast food that was really nothing more than a pizza hut or something. Italians look at McD's as more of a treat though, not something they would eat on a daily basis. Besides theres plenty of places to grab a quick bite to eat from places that sell more healthier and better tasting food. Portions in McDs are also smaller than those in the US the large soda is not a 30 ounce bucket of coke but more like a medium sized 16 ounce or something.<br>
<br>
Anyway, just something to think about. Sizes of portions get bigger and bigger so we tend to eat or drink more and more because it seems ok to do relative to the size youre given. Im not sure why this is the case but Im sure it has something to do with the power of the dollar and large corporations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=1010.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showNextMessage?topicID=1010.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1010.topic&index=15><img src=http://www.tdtccomputers.com/morellthulebbs/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.emailToFriend?topicID=1010.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.threadControl?topicID=1010.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/techops.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1010.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1010.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub169.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="mtboardsfrm48">Announcements & Suggestion<option value="mtboardsfrm1">General<option value="mtboardsfrm2">Market<option value="mtboardsfrm39">Spells Market<option value="mtboardsfrm3">Rants<option value="mtboardsfrm40">MT's Most Hated<option value="mtboardsfrm4">Raves and Accomplishments<option value="mtboardsfrm43">Retirement Center<option value="mtboardsfrm49">The Legendary Threads<option value="mtboardsfrm5">Off Topic<option value="mtboardsfrm50">The Non-EQ MMORG Forum<option value="mtboardsfrm6">Funnies<option value="mtboardsfrm35">Help<option value="mtboardsfrm8">Schedule<option value="mtboardsfrm10">Guilds<option value="mtboardsfrm36">Guild Leaders (Private)<option value="mtboardsfrm9">Trade Skills<option value="mtboardsfrm11">Roleplay<option value="mtboardsfrm7">Rotations<option value="mtboardsfrm37">Polls<option value="mtboardsfrm12">Test<option value="mtboardsfrm13">French<option value="mtboardsfrm14">German<option value="mtboardsfrm15">Spanish<option value="mtboardsfrm16">Japanese<option value="mtboardsfrm17">Korean<option value="mtboardsfrm18">Bard<option value="mtboardsfrm19">Beastlord<option value="mtboardsfrm20">Cleric<option value="mtboardsfrm21">Druid<option value="mtboardsfrm22">Enchanter<option value="mtboardsfrm23">Magician<option value="mtboardsfrm24">Monk<option value="mtboardsfrm25">Necromancer<option value="mtboardsfrm26">Paladin<option value="mtboardsfrm27">Ranger<option value="mtboardsfrm28">Rogue<option value="mtboardsfrm29">Shadow Knight<option value="mtboardsfrm30">Shaman<option value="mtboardsfrm31">Warrior<option value="mtboardsfrm32">Wizard<option value="mtboardsfrm33">Staff<option value="mtboardsfrm34">Backup</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#AAAAAA>- </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards>Morell-Thule Forums</a><font color=#AAAAAA> - </font><a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm5>Off Topic</a> <font color=#AAAAAA> - </font><a href="http://sevendragons.net">Morell-Thule Community Website</a><font color=#AAAAAA> - </font><br><br> <center><form name=f>Select Message Board:<br>
