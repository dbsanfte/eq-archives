Bopsy <br>
By Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen <br>
The 26-year-old mother stared down at her son who was dying of terminal leukemia. Although her heart was filled with sadness, she also had a strong feeling of determination. Like any parent she wanted her son to grow up and fulfill all his dreams. Now that was no longer possible. The leukemia would see to that. But she still wanted her son's dreams to come true. <br>
<br>
She took her son's hand and asked, &quot;Bopsy, did you ever think about what you wanted to be when you grew up? Did you ever dream and wish about what you would do with your life?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Mommy, I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mom smiled back and said, &quot;Let's see if we can make your wish come true.&quot; Later that day she went to her local fire department in Phoenix, Arizona, where she met Fireman Bob, who had a heart as big as Phoenix. She explained her son's final wish and asked if it might be possible to give her six-year-old son a ride around the block on a fire engine.<br>
<br>
Fireman Bob said, &quot;Look, we can do better than that. If you'll have your son ready at seven o'clock Wednesday morning, we'll make him an honorary fireman for the whole day. He can come down to the fire station, eat with us, go out on all the fire calls, the whole nine yards! And, if you'll give us his sizes, we'll get a real fire uniform made for him, with a real fire hat - not a toy one - with the emblem of the Phoenix fire Department on it, a yellow slicker like we wear and rubber boots. They're all manufactured right here in Phoenix, so we can get them fast.&quot;<br>
<br>
Three days later Fireman Bob picked up Bopsy, dressed him in his fire uniform and escorted him from his hospital bed to the waiting hook and ladder truck. Bopsy got to sit up on the back of the truck and help steer it back to the fire station. He was in heaven.<br>
<br>
There were three fire calls in Phoenix that day and Bopsy got to go out on all three calls. He rode in the different fire engines, the paramedics' van and even the fire chief's car. He was also videotaped for the local news program.<br>
<br>
Having his dream come true, with all the love and attention that was lavished upon him, so deeply touched Bopsy that he lived three months longer than any doctor thought possible.<br>
<br>
One night all of his vital signs began to drop dramatically and the head nurse, who believed in the Hospice concept that no one should die alone, began to call the family members to the hospital. Then she remembered the day Bopsy had spent as a fireman, so she called the fire chief and asked if it would be possible to send a fireman in uniform to the hospital to be with Bopsy as he made his transition. The chief replied, &quot;We can do better than that. We'll be there in five minutes. Will you please do me a favor? When you hear the sirens screaming and see the lights flashing, will you announce over the PA system that there is not a fire? It's just the fire department coming to see one of its finest members one more time. And will you open the window to his room? Thanks.&quot;<br>
<br>
About five minutes later, a hook and ladder truck arrived at the hospital, extended its ladder up to Bopsy's third floor open window and 14 firemen and two firewomen climbed up the ladder into Bopsy's room. With his mother's permission, they hugged him and held him and told him how much they loved him.<br>
<br>
With his dying breath, Bopsy looked up at the fire chief and said, &quot;Chief, am I really a fireman now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Bopsy, you are,&quot; the chief said.<br>
<br>
With those words, Bopsy smiled and closed his eyes for the last time.<br>

<br>
would it really happend in society today? what would happend if there was a fire during that nice act on the hospital? would we see a different view of the situation and feel anger instead (taken that people died in fires when the fire department was out &quot;fooling around&quot;)?<br>
<br>
i dunno.. its a very nice story tho, and i wish more people cared like that. including myself. <p><HTML>

Two weeks ago I held a huge b-day party for my three sons... Who all turned 6, 7, and 8 within a few weeks of the party date... Had a huge spiderman cake, my mom decorated the house with spiderwebs and stuff all over... My 18 year old brother dressed up as Spiderman and had his friends enact a scene with the birthday boys... Pinata filled with over a hundred dollars worth of toys instead of candy... Plus every kid there won a big toy and a ton of smaller prizes... I didn't pay for all of this on my own, but we ended up spending like $400 for stuff including their presents, while my mom spent even more... Needless to say they had a VERY popular b-day party... <br>
<br>
As for the presents thing, I'm always the one that can't ever wait for the kids to open up their presents so I can see them get excited and I'm always the one that gets to play with them first... Usual excuse is I need to know how it works in case I need to fix it or show you guys... Hehehe...<br>

<br>
I took him to daycare even though I took the day off so I could decorate the house, get the cake, buy MORE gifts, set up the cam corder/web cam/digicam/regular film cam.  Once it was all set, I went to day care wearing I spiderman birthday hat (you know the cardboard cone deals with the elastic band that digs into your skin).  They all sang happy birthday to him, he got embarrased. =)  We came home and he was all bright eyed and full of spirit!  It was awesome.  He opened presents and I did the one part I hate the most:  ASSEMBLY REQUIRED!!!! ARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!<br>
<br>
After that it was play time, then cake, then more play time.<br>

Tomorrow is playtime for me though....Oktoberfest!! <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">

Oktoberfest is now.  Muchen was the place.  Terry had a better time then I did.  We went into the Paulaner beer tent so I could have a beer and we could eat.  As the lady brought our food Terry said &quot;This is my birthday party&quot;.  So she tells the folk band and they make Terry get on the table as everyone sung Happy Birthday (in German but still).  It was a riot.  I didn't drink as much as I would have liked (obvious that my kid was with me).  We hit almost every ride he could go on, spent another fortune on games trying win him prizes (ended up buying them! lol).  Couldn't make out with the Bolvarian chick I was talking to (again, kid there).  But I ate til near explosion and my kid ran me from one end to the other.  <br>
<br>
BEST....TIME....EVER!!!!<br>
<br>
Next year, I strongly suggest you all get passports and get to Oktoberfest in Muchen.  It's a magical experience.  (like watching passed out drunks get carried to the IV tents to rehydrate so they can spend more money! ROFL) <p><a href="http://www.yoursighost.com/members/Drackore" target="_blank">
