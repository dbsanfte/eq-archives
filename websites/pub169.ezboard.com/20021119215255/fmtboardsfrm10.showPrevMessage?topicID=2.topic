<br>
We are different... Probably different than every other guild formed in EQ, and certainly unique on Morell-Thule. When you raid with us, you roll. For everything. No points, no lists, no decisions about loot are made by me (the guild leader) or anyone. If you are present, you can ROLL. If you are serious about playing, you can gear up even if you play only 1-2 nights a week. Daily players do just as well... Since they make more raids/EXP hunts. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Same with EXP groups... Nothing is predetermined, before the hunt. Roll to win any gear that drops... To sell, to use, or to twink... It is your choice, whatever that may be, and is encouraged by the guild.<br>
<br>
We are there to help everyone in the guild have fun, in whatever way you like to use EQ for that purpose, and become more powerful. For us, selling gear we win is a part of that. Daddy needs a new Death Mask of the Elysians! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

It seems our recruitment policy was getting in the way of getting good peeps into the guild. Red Tape at it's finest. I talked to one guy who wanted to app, but didn't because he didn't want to wait a full week (only to find out he might not get in.)<br>
<br>
So, this is our new policy:<br>

Not NBG based.</span><hr size=1> Wow, that loot policy is the most blatently inneffective thing I have read in a very long time.<br>
<br>
Your guild will self-destruct in no time with a loot policy like that. Are you trying to be fair? Do you realize that randomness and fairness are NOT the same? I'd say that random rolls are the furthest thing from fair, as it has no intelligence to it.<br>
<br>
In a guild that is obviously totally devoted to obtaining items, you have a loot policy that makes it almost impossible to improve the over-all power of your guild. Your members need gear to become more effective. Your policy basically forces all your members to compete with each-other for needed gear, thereby slowing the entire proccess of equipping your guild.<br>
<br>
I mean, think about it for a second. Why would you sell the MQ of Thurg armor? What droppable items can you really find for the selling price, that are superior to the nodrop thurg armor? There may be some, but I promise you it will not be so, once you reach ToV, or higher.<br>
<br>
I do not mean to offend you, sir, but I think you should carefully re-evaluate your loot system. Perhaps a nice raid-point system for buying loot based on attendance could be developed? As it stands, your guild will no doubt develop an &quot;every-man-for-himself&quot; mentality, which will serve to tear apart your members' cooperation and morale.<br>
<br>
Also, if you're going to /random for loot, you have to use a number higher than 100. If all your level 60's randomed 60-100, you're gonna have to deal with tons of re-rolls, and that gets confusing quickly. Not to mention the logistics involved with recording your entire raid-force's rolls EVERY TIME an item drops...<br>
<br>
I suggest you take a look at the loot policies of Fury's Edge, or some other large, raid-oriented guild. You may be better served with that kind of approach.<br>
<br>
I hope this will help you, and good luck with your guild! <p><center>Argond Valiantfist<br>Grandmaster Geezer of Morell-Thule<br><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133460>Magelo Profile</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/ucarlothecurious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carlo the Curious</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blackburrow Trainee</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/2/02 4:40:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://mysite.freeserve.com/moscacr/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New guild, named Imperium, forming.

If you win the roll, you win the item... It's that simple. When you say things like &quot;overall power of your guild&quot; I read the implication of &quot;gear up your clerics and warriors or die.&quot; Frankly, that's not what we are about. We will gear up everyone, fairly. Nobody is going to be snubbed just because they decided to play a non-cleric, non-warrior, non-wizard.

If I were to win a thurg armor piece, I would definitely trade it for a Thurg MQ of a piece I COULD use. Others might do the same, or sell.

Other guildmates can do what they want.<br>

100 is the best number right now, as it skews toward higher levels the amount that I think is right. (Using a higher number does not reward the higher level members enough, I don't think.) Tons of rerolls? Nay, nay... I'm not worried about rerolls tearing at the fabric of the guild. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Why do i need to record dice rolls??

BTW, we aren't tagged yet, and we are already putting this loot policy into practice. It is working great. Nobody is overlooked. So, we work together, 'tis true.<br>

Also... While we will raid, we are not a 'raid oriented' guild.

I think the point was that 100 gives you a fairly low number of possibilities, so the chances of two equal winning rolls are much higher than if you rolled 1000 (although still fairly small), and that looking through 20 or 30 rolls for every drop to make sure (a) they were the correct /random, and (b) working out which the highest was might be a little tedious after a while <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
