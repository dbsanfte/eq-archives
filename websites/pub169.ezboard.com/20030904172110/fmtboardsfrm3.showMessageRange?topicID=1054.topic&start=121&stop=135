While i have no love for the guy, i do think he is right on his thinking.<br>
<br>
Yes, you did kill mobs in PoV, but killing mobs, and XPing are 2 different things.  Faate is right in saying that most ppl would have wanted to leave that group the moment they joined.<br>
<br>
Of course, as u said, it was a guild group, so little things like that are overlooked.  The problem tho, is u used your group as hard evidence that using a relatively low level tank is totally perfect for PoV.  I disagree.<br>
<br>
I am a powergamer of the sorts.  Being a powergamer tho, has nothing to do w/ wanting to kill mobs at a regular pace.  3 minutes a mob is a bit too slow to me~ = =;;  Im aware ppl play this game to chat and have fun.  Of course you can do that AND kill mobs at a good rate for xp.  Not all of us that want XP are friendless powergamers.<br>
<br>
As such, i stand by and say NO to people in zones they are not ready for.  Now, normally i would just sit on the sides, and not post.  Too many times tho, ive joined a group with someone not contributing anything.  I call this PLing.  And it detracts from my fun knowing that someone is essentially using me.  <br>
<br>
It doesn't help either that, at the same time im xping i see &quot;Anyone need a 53 pally in their group?&quot; over and over in the zone im in. &gt;*note* This is only my opinion.  If its fun for you to go to a zone 10 levels above u, more power to you.  I'm just trying to state why i dont like it, and why others dont either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yalwensomeyallosesome>YalwenSomeyallosesome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Giant Squishies in Rathe</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/7/03 3:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   uhm</span><hr size=1> maybe i am confused here..<br>
<br>
where is the difference?<br>
<br>
i am 53, in a zone that provides fast experience, yet because i am there, i am chastised for being to low and looking for a &quot;powerlevel&quot;..<br>
<br>
yet self-proclaimed &quot;power-gamers&quot; who want fast experience, are chastising those who kill at their own pace and are fine with that?<br>
<br>
do i belong in BoT? prolly not. guild was backflagging, and pieces were going to rot, and my paladin was along on the raid to help out and get the raid exp, to at least move the bar a little. raid ended, i needed one piece only. another guild was nice enough to let me help them at the forest giants, and loot the piece i needed AFTER all their members did.<br>
<br>
on PoS raid. did i die? no.<br>
helping the guild in PoS, did i die? no<br>
PoJ trials? no<br>
PoV, 2 groups, did i die? no.<br>
<br>
other questions. was i detrimental to the groups/raids. no, i don't feel i was. as stated before when grouping with someone who was one of the first to get on this thread and say i don't belong..i was grouped with him, and we had a very hairy situation. did i die? no. did he? no, did i cause a wipe? no.<br>
<br>
the simple fact is, too many people base assumptions on level about a person. too many people in this game are arrogant, and rude and basically take the game far too seriously.<br>
<br>
i dunno about anyone else, but i play it to have fun. having people make snide comments in a zone in /ooc when i simply say &quot;53 paladin LFG&quot; is not my idea of fun. i don't EXPECT a group, and i wish people understood that. i'd LIKE a group, but i don't EXPECT it..<br>
<br>
and to &lt;crap, i forgot your name, the post above mine..the powergamer&gt;..i do NOT spam the zone &quot;anyone need a 53 paladin?&quot; i say it maybe 3 times, max, like i said..when i do a /w and see new people in the zone (maybe it's a group forming, and they might take a chance)...also, i DON'T say &quot;need&quot;..i say &quot;want&quot;...no one NEEDS a 53 paladin in PoV/BoT.<br>

Just yesterday I had some 55 warrior repeatedly begging/whining for me to tank for a PoV group he was putting together.  The guy was obviously looking to milk xp &amp; couldn't tank there himself.  I finally gave in only to find that his cleric was Twistedtreat.  I left the group &amp; told him why.  Minutes later he tells me she gated &amp; left the group dead.  Too many people have had those kinds of bad experiences with crappy and/or low level players.

Ok so the speed at which you gain experience does matter?  Well then, fill that extra spot with a DPS class that is high enough level to actually add DPS.<br>

You will add *much* less to the group than a level 65 paladin would.  And since you can only provide DPS, that is not even a fair comparison.  You should actually compare your DPS to that of a ranger, monk, rogue, or other DPS class.  You bring almost nothing to the group except a place for some experience and loot to go.<br>
<br>
You cannot offtank.  You cannot pull.  You cannot heal.  You cannot slow.  You almost certainly cannot buff.  Your DPS stinks.<br>

What do you bring to the group?  <br>

The group I was in was an average level of 57.7. We were killing yellows and light reds. Why the HELL would you leave a group that was pulling yellows and light reds as fast as you could kill??? It's not like anyone was slowing anyone down!!! EVERYONE WAS LEVEL 57.7 (or so <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
I defy any of you, ANY, to say that in a group like the one i was in, with your character being 56-58, that you would leave that group. If you say you would, due to slow EXP reasons, then you are a FOOL. Because, quite simply, full group modifier + PoV exp modifier + killing yellows and reds = best EXP a level 56-58 can ever see.<br>
<br>
This was simply the fastest EXP any of them had gotten. One going so far as to say &quot;WOW, this is the fastest my bar has moved since Paludal.&quot;<br>
<br>
Please tell me who was being taken advantage of in this situation! And just because it was a guild group, doesnt mean we weren't taking our jobs seriously. Once we had a full group, we were getting a kill, consistently, IN LESS THAN EVERY THREE MINUTES. We had 14 kills in exactly 40 minutes, which works out to 21 kills an hour. That includes pulls, mezzing adds, /ooc crap. And, don't forget, nobody died. Nobody.<br>
<br>
Of course the killing was slower... Lower level, DUH! But that doesnt mean the EXP bars for each player was moving slower. Nope.<br>
<br>
And sorry about the non-grouping thing, Yalwen. Everytime I've seen you, I've either had a full group, or the full group member was OTW. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=beal101>Beal101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/8/03 2:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: powerleveling?</span><hr size=1> When you wrote that you were tanking in PoV, I doubt I'm the only one who thought you meant the regular camps there...Golems and razorfiends.

He won't last the 10secs it take to cast CH.<br>
I had virtue and 1200AC and shaman buffs leaving me at 4401hps.<br>

When MA died. I could not tank in LC. I was gettin hit three times for about 900pts of damage every sec.   Each hit was between 250 to 521pts of damage.<br>
<br>
BTW.  Despite all the arguments against Yalwen...Grats on getting those flags.<br>
<br>
My only problems with a 53 pally is (nothing personal bud) is it's hard for people to find groups as it is.  You can xp in POV Yalwen but It won't be worthwile for me to gain xp in POJ exit group.  See what I'm saying.  Your basically in competition for a spot in a group with others who have leveled their characters through those other zones.  Hey you pay for EQ..you got flagged, and your got the skills but still.  It just doesn't seem fair to me if you got a group there but a 60th level character didn't (of course I'm a ranger so I could be a bit biased after sitting LFG in POV for 2 hours today).  That's all I'm saying.<br>
<br>
But you sure have tenacity and the willpower keep trying.  I admire that.<br>

And I really do think groups in POJ really need a good tank as yourself or other POP zones. Pallys hold agro well and you are much needed there.<br>

<br>
You say &quot;if we were 56-58 would we leave that group?&quot;.  Well, imma say prolly not...if i was 56-58...<br>
<br>
This whole point is not about an entire group of 56-58.  Its about 1 lowbie that is bringing down a group of 61+.<br>
<br>
In a group of 61+, kills that slow are unacceptable.  The average 58 tank does not have good enough AC/HP.  The healer will go oom.  Heck, ive seen some 65 tanks not have enough AC/HP for constant pulls.<br>
<br>
I think its cool your group was getting uber xp in PoV, but that is not the point at all.  Maybe that 58 tank was good for you...but that 58 tank is not good for me, and apparently most of the ppl arguing this topic.<br>
<br>
And just to add to Yalwen.  Yeah, u might not be a direct detriment to the group, but since u aren't helping that could be considered a detriment on its own.  If u can't help, why even join?  Maybe its cuz you want to prove to the EQ world that a 53 is just fine for BoT?  Maybe u get some ego trip thinking u are proving ppl wrong by not getting killed in the group?  Maybe u just want free PL?  I dunno~<br>
<br>
BTW, this is only my opinion.  I just had to add more since i recently joined a group that had someone not ready for the zone, and the group did indeed suffer because of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=milendavilen@mtboards>milendavilen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Qeynos Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/9/03 1:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=133>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   wuss</span><hr size=1> how old are you that you cant take critisism from another person that you have to rant about it over and over i understand maybe one time posting a rant then reading up on it and maybe posting another two times but your every other post what is your problem you must be very naive is all i can say <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wilerian>Wilerian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Looting Highpass</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#628CBC>(8/9/03 7:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1054.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: wuss</span><hr size=1> I think Yalwen is actually quite smart.<br>
