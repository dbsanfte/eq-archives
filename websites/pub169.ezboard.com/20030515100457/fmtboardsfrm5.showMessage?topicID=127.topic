People who do not treat my stuff right. It's my stuff, not yours. Show some @#%$ respect. Once this girl borrowed a pen of mine and she proceeds to stick it in her mouth while sucking on it. She then tries to give me back my spit-laden pen. Gah! I wanted to shove it up her nose. <br>
<br>
And oh, and in case you borrow a pencil from me, DO NOT use the eraser. I don't like looking at used erasers on pencils.<br>
<br>
People who are shocked when I say I don't listen to music much, and when I do, it's more of the smushy love song variety. WTH man! Music just is not my thing. Leave me be.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2. What irritating habits do you have?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I'm anal. And I expect others to be just as anal about my things as I am.<br>

I talk too much, and I interrupt people when they are talking.<br>

I talk too much, I thik that may be irritating to some people. I am trying not to talk so much.<br>
<br>
I don't tell people when they do something that irritates me/pisses me off.  I just think bad thoughtd in my head.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4. What grosses you out more than anything else? Why?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
People who are messy eaters. Food is supposed to go in your mouth, not your lips. Can't you feel it?!?! You have food the size of Texas hanging from your lips and you cannot feel it??!  That's what napkins are for.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 5. What one thing can you never see yourself doing that other people do?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Walking around barefoot on concrete.  That's just dirty.  Put some shoes on!<br>

What is your biggest pet peeve? Why?<br>
<br>
People that at first act surprised when they discover I am a single dad of a 4 yr old boy.  Then the question that always follows &quot;What did his mom do wrong?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dumbass, she did nothing wrong.  It was orginally agreed upon by myself and his mother that he would be better off with me.  Nuff said.<br>
<br>
2. What irritating habits do you have?<br>
<br>
I crack my knuckles, my elbows, my neck, my back, my knees, my ankles, and my toes.  It feels good.  I also chew sunflower seeds like there is no tomorrow.  When outside, I spit the shells where I damn well feel like.  They are bio-degradable.  It isn't pollution.  I weigh 160 lbs, I can eat like a horse and not gain a pound and guess what, I will eat like a horse in front of fat women eating their salads and drinking their Diet Sprite.<br>
<br>
I also &quot;adjust&quot; myself when it slips and I feel uncomfortable.  I do my best to be discrete about it but ya know what?  If yer offended by it, ya shouldn't have been looking at my crotch anyways.<br>
<br>
3. Have you tried to change the irritating habits or just let them be?<br>
<br>
I know someone that talks too much and interupts people all the time.  If they interupt me I say &quot;Hey, I'm talking.  Shut up and wait for me to finish&quot;.<br>
<br>
Otherwise I don't care what annoying habits ya have.  If I can block it out I will.  It's not my job to change you.  After you got potty trained, it no longer was yer parent's job either.<br>
<br>
4. What grosses you out more than anything else? Why?<br>
<br>
Yer a woman.  Great.  I LOVE women.  MMM MMMM MMMMMMM.  Women are awesome.  HOWEVER, I could care less, to the point where I am very thankful for you to NOT even mention, your &quot;womanly&quot; problems.  25 days a month is pure heaven.  5 other days of the month, I DONT WANNA KNOW!  Don't tell me what it's like, how it feels, your perceptions and philosophies on it.  Don't explain to me the mechanics of the cotton penis with the rip cord.  Puke.  Oh yea, and if you even TRY to discuss these things over a speghetti dinner, I'm leaving YOU to pay the check and find yer own damn way home.  I'll be barfing in the street after I drive about 100 mph away from you.<br>
<br>
5. What one thing can you never see yourself doing that other people do?<br>
<br>
Christ.  Picking my nose would be this one.  Ever sit at a light and look into the cars around you?  Never fails that someone has their finger up there digging for a pot'o'gold.  <br>

Pet Peeve:  <br>
Cell phones.  I hate them if use during a non-emergency. If you break down on the side of the road, I hope you have one.  If you feel the need to talk while driving through that red light, I hope you wreck. <br>
<br>
2. Habits: <br>
Long list here but just one? Irrating to me-  I bite my nails.  It's a nasty habit.  I don't eat the nails.. I just bit them off and discard them in an ashtray or trash can.   <br>
Irrating to others- probably my bad timing of humor.  I tend to inject humor if I get uncomfortable and it comes off as being uncaring.   <br>
<br>
3. Tried to Change: <br>
I will go days without biting my nails, but one bad day.. and off they go. <br>
The humor thing, I always try. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

4. Grosses me out:  <br>
Not many things gross me out.   Cat puke does.   <br>

Anything to do with heights.  No skydiving, parasailing, etc.  <br>

Drackore, you are totally cool.  Every answer I have, assume I copied Drackores too, in addition to mine.  Except for the 160 pound thing.  I am a hunk of man.  Though, I'm not fat yet....<br>
<br>
<br>
1. What is your biggest pet peeve? Why?<br>
    Political Correctness.  Stereotypes aren't based in fact, but they are based in strong possibilty.  There's a reason everyone thinks a group or dynamic are one way, isn't there?  How else did it get there.  Which isn't saying people can't be different, of course, but if it look's like a duck...<br>
<br>
<br>
2. What irritating habits do you have?<br>
<br>
I tend to joke in a negative manner with people, which a tendnecy towards putting the person down.  It can be very annoying and hurtful, but on the other hand, I take as good as I get.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Have you tried to change the irritating habits or just let them be?<br>
  Only with my fiance.  She was going to leave me if I didn't, and sometimes I still do.  Mostly unintentionally, though.  Everyone else is fair game.<br>
<br>
I don't tell people when they do something that irritates me/pisses me off. I just think bad thoughtd in my head.  I do this too Jasminne.<br>
<br>
4. What grosses you out more than anything else? Why?<br>
Maggots.  Why? Have you seen the things?<br>
<br>
<br>
5. What one thing can you never see yourself doing that other people do?<br>
<br>
Marrying someone in EQ land.  Beastialty.

Watching someone give a speech, that they didn't even write no less (/coughpolitician/cough), and have them READ (it) to me (off their notecard, paper, tele-prompter, whatever).  GOD I hate that.  What makes it even worse is when they talk all slow like I'm a block of granite.<br>

What is your biggest pet peeve? Why?<br>
<br>
People who can't drive. Jesus christ does this piss me off(I drive alot) IT IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE PEOPLE. Here's a clue, if you're going to make a left turn, YOU STAY IN THE LEFT LANE. Don't try and cut me off just before your turn because you're a god damn moron.(I can make a million of these examples up)<br>
<br>
2. What irritating habits do you have?<br>
<br>
I'm very very sarcastic, and when you're as sarcastic as me, you annoy people. I procrastinate alot to, now that lex mentions it.<br>
<br>
3. Have you tried to change the irritating habits or just let them be?<br>
<br>
Haha, I don't forsee changing anytime soon.<br>
<br>
4. What grosses you out more than anything else? Why?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  MAYO! </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Damn I wish whoever created this stuff is suffering in hell as we speak. I can't even LOOK at it. I could eat my lunch with a festering decapitated corpse sprawled across the table, but if they put mayo on my BLT you better believe I'll be puking.(As a side note, I love eggs in many forms, and eat breakfast alot for lunch/dinner)<br>
