And no, I won't get my license until I'm 17 or 18, my family cannot afford two teenagers on life insurance or whatever it was my mother mentioned.  I'm cool with that, I'd rather not drive than be poor. . .<br>

If I'm driving a car, I won't be playing around with my friends.  I have loved ones, cousins, brother, and others, who have had major wrecks, and have lived.   I've seen it happen, I know how it happens, I don't think I'll be playing `race` on the high way, and then spin out across 4 lanes of traffic at 70mph. (true story, my cousins)  Both lived, but totaled both cars, I believe.<br>
<br>
I may be some immature person on this stupid ass excuse for a message board, but in game I'm a better person, I always help my friends, and I've even left groups just to port someone.  Of course I always have a replacement ready or on the way. *shrug*  I'm also not some immature person in real life, because I believe in real life, It's not a buncha white text on a blue back ground with a buncha stuck-up bitches who think they are better than everyone. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uteadynthedruid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teadyn the Druid</A> at: 9/11/02 8:21:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uanonandproud.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anon and Proud</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>QHills and Clueless</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/11/02 5:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=168.topic&index=163>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  why bother?</span><hr size=1> Teadyn, <br>

don't take this as a flame but look at it as another viewpoint.  you tell us personal things about yourself and the importance of real life to you.  you claim you play eq to just get away from the everyday mundane events and that you are not immature but are a very nice individual who always seeks to help others.<br>
<br>
the problem is you are always on the defensive and it seems you are always trying to &quot;prove&quot; yourself to others.  people refute your claims which invokes some serious hatred in you, noted by your constant use of profanities and immature insults.  <br>
<br>
when people such as shiang and boraf (people i think are level headed and considerate in their posts) seek to belittle you, you then know you probably have pissed off the majority.<br>
<br>
you are probably in the same boat savanti was back in the day.  the best thing probably would be for you to scale back on the posts and probably just post on topics you have something of substance.  you have stated you are a down to earth good kid who strives to work hard and act mature; so prove it and don't take the bait everytime you see a flame about you.  who really cares what the other person you will never meet thinks about you anyways?...<br>
<br>
in regards to the teadyn&gt;phara or vice versa, it honestly does appear to be more along the lines of teadyn=phara... (sorry phara but trying to incessantly annoy a 15 year old just goes to undermine your own credibility..).  <br>

Here is my deduction of Daark's attitude. He loves a fight. He loves them with so much passion that he HAS to start an argument that is absolutely senseless. Me and a few people I knew decided to go to Scarlet Desert to hunt a bit, for fun mostly. <br>
          We got wiped, except for Necro, so I'm like, well...that didn't go to well, heh, so, pally gets there again, dies again. I go up there again with pally, he dies, I manage to stay alive, barely. Then I go back, loot my corpse, get a rezz from a friendly cleric nearby, and then go try to help the pally's corpse. However, nothing against him, but he announces that he will invite Daark to the group to help with CR. Now at this point there was no need for this, as the cleric would have helped. <br>
       So I stayed silent, I knew Daark hated me for doing simple math on this board, so I tried to tone it down, I helped invis him, invis people, etc. And we get the corpses, and then it seemed like, ok, we got out without a argument, and suddenly Daark decides that he would like to start an argument! I'm like....oookay there, but he decides to go on.        <br>
       Suddenly he starts saying how I am a useless piece of junk, and that he was doing this to help the pally, how he was noble, and helped everyone! He was also saying about how I was a disgrace of being a druid. I was like Wtf, as if he needed your help, when I had arranged how to get the corpses already, (Locate corpse, the necro spell) the corpses already, and he continues to attempt to push the argument further. Evidentally he says I am too &quot;Idiotic and should delete my character&quot;, boots from the group.<br>
      Therefore, I am glad to say, Daark, you should not open your mouth, as it will bite back at you. What you think is being smart is in effect being stupid. So maybe next time maybe you should decide not to be such a fool.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Daark is stripping his char, I wonder why? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/uteadynthedruid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teadyn the Druid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Riding the Planes</span><br>  Posts: 844<br> <font color=#628CBC>(9/11/02 7:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=168.topic&index=169>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: why bother?</span><hr size=1> He's either starting a shaman, or really quitting.

Dude, you are only providing more proof for those against you; those who talk about your maturity level and other demeaning aspects about yourself.  Just stop for once and read what you write before hitting the Add Reply button...<br>
<br>
And honestly, I doubt you could &quot;kick&quot; hiss ass or such.  Playing the internet psychologist I'd even go so far as to state you probably have low confidence or something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  You always want others to agree with you, accept you, etc.  As mentioned before, your 10 or so posts on the RL pics page about how you thought others would laugh at you if you posted just proves it.

I'm not the one that goes around and posts, &quot; DING!&quot; on every guild's msg boards. /shrug, doesn't really bother me, but i think you need to take a look at yourself first.

I'd venture to say that the rules of the message board do not say anything of the sort.<br>
<br>
I'd also venture to say that the mods here loathe you to such an extent they would actually LOVE to ban you.<br>
<br>
I'd venture to say that 90 percent of the people who read this message board are so tired of reading your drivel that they would LOVE to see you banned.<br>

As Brytar said above, the rules don't say anything about excluding real life threats in Rants.  While this entire Teadyn series since the inception of this new message board (and its precursor on the old) started out as mildly entertaining, it has rapidly become idiotic and immature in so many ways, to the point of being disturbing.  The quoted text crosses a line, a very large one.  To threaten to blow up anyone's house is bad, at risk of sounding melodramatic, to make that threat today of all days is horrible.<br>
<br>
I would hope Teadyn take a step away from these boards and the others, enjoy the game he claims to and stop worrying about what goes on here.   Teadyn baiting can be fun sport to play and observe, but is it still a sport?<br>

Ya know, without me, these boards would be so lame, and noone would have someone to hate.  *shrug*  All these gimp ass trolls and other gimps think I'm `immature` or whatever.  Have a cookie, I don't give a damn.  As for all my other friends who laugh at you idiots and help me in game, They enjoy my help, my free PLing, my free ports, my free buffs, my free items and cash I give them, they enjoy being my friend.  As for the rest of ya fu<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->cktards, I laugh at you.  You take this game like its real, I find it funny.<br>
<br>
Oh no, he sexually harassed me by calling me babe or hun or whatever!  Time to spread rumors!<br>
<br>
Oh no, he's an immature little kid!  Let's all make fun of him.<br>
<br>
Oh no, I'm arguing with a 15 year old who doesn't give a damn about anything, and wonders why all you idiots say `read your posts before you hit Add Reply` why? I don't care what you think about me, I really don't.<br>
