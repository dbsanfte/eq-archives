Had all the @#%$ zarn got with TW like helm of crawler, trident of DS, primal 1hb, rocksmasher, krezien's flame, etc. No other bard war on MT had same gear.<br>

<br>
And if people wonder how he got his name to Trier without paying, my bro had a buy, that wanted him on legends, so he moved him there then found out the Check bounced to buy the account, so Z was stuck on legends with the name Zarnokx, so my bro changed it to Rehsilomed (Demolisher backwords lol) ... and told me that the check bounced, so I played on legends for 2 weeks, saw Jonn when he went to legends by accident, played a little with him heh.. then said, I wana go back to MT.. I miss TW.. well, I moved back, and I forgot my bro had an Account with a char named Rehsilomed.. so it was Rehsilomedx.. and somehow I got really bored of waiting to get Xfered back to MT (to move to legends, takes like an hour, to move back, like a week, sigh) and told my bro to resell, and, the buyer, got to change his name from Rehsilomedx to.. Trier<br>
<br>
Left EQ with a little cash, and bought some stuff I needed (like bowling gear !)... but then My friend got me back to EQ, I tryed to rebuy Z, no go, so I made a rogue, and kept asking to buy Z and the guy wouldn't let me, woulda been cool with to have my name Trier Warbeast, dam, oh well, just a game, I'll probably play EQ2.... by the way, Shadowbane is Gay, click move sucks so much.<br>

He started on this server as Gossec (a different warrior), Gossec was leveled to 60 with a few AA's when his RL friend quit playing eq (Trier).. so Gossec took over Trier's account since Trier had more AA than Gossec.. Hence Trier's surname.<br>
<br>
i've known the guy for a LONG time, just about the entire time i've played eq and he's a good guy, he wouldn't &quot;gank&quot; anything, if you feel he &quot;ganked&quot; something, try talking to him in a nice calm manner, i'm sure the results would be alot more productive than bringing this BS to the boards<br>

I don't know who brought this to the boards as this poster is anonymous, it wasn't a guild decision.<br>
<br>
People play this game for whatever reasons they want. I think Trier as I knew him in LoV was a likable fellow and a very skilled warrior until he ganked the BoC. <br>
<br>
He GR:ed after some argument when I was away, and then my officer team tried to contact him in a nice manner, like we always do the few times people GR. We weren't after the BoC straight away, we were trying repeatedly to get an explanation for his behaviour. Reinviting him was never out of the question, people can make mistakes when they are upset and everyone deserves another chance. But at least the officers would want some explanation to his behaviour don't you think? But no answers at all, very unlike the Trier I used to know. <br>
<br>
So trying to talk to him in a nice and calm manner hasn't been very productive at all. I don't know if any LoVers have ranted him in tells after that, but the first contacts were made by officers in a polite manner.<br>
<br>
He is someone else now, wish he could have just shown some decency and returned the BoC to us. But hey, I guess his character was worth some more money with a BoC on it. Just a bit surprised about this since the Trier I knew was such a nice guy.<br>
<br>
And btw, AoW down once more today, so we got another BoC <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I hate it when a guild tries to claim an item as &quot;theirs&quot;...<br>
<br>
Unless it was lent to a person, from being in vault, it isnt the property of the guild. Just the guild helped said member get the item.<br>
<br>
<br>
Honestly think FE gives two shits about a barb mask? whoop dee @#%$ doo. . .35ac/100hp and bash skill for bard. Can you see the excitement? really, can you see the excitement in my eye? wow, so pwn~<br>
<br>
And as for the SoD, im sure your thinking of sharnhorst. Who, by the way lead the raid and looted the SoD, you know. . . after tanking the mob that dropped it. <br>
<br>
Its his as much as any other item that gets looted by a player in eq. He didnt steal it from tw, he earnt it with his time, and im sure he payed the guild back with his improved tanking ability.<br>
<br>
If trier was at the raid, and helped with the kill and was awarded the boc, then be dammed if he should give it back.<br>

<br>
He didn't pay anything for it, only earned the right to burrow it.<br>
<br>
And seen as it is a rule that dropables stay inside the guild, one on which he agreed upon when joining the guild. Thus he stole the BoC. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tilluinmt>Tilluin mt</A> at: 4/16/03 7:42:39 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bwahthebard>Bwah the Bard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lonely in Kera Ridge</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/16/03 7:52:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: kb.lnk</span><hr size=1> Not worth it~~ <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bwahthebard>Bwah the Bard</A> at: 4/16/03 7:54:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#102960><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub169.ezboard.com/bmtboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faate>Faate</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Egging EW</span><br>  Posts: 285<br> <font color=#628CBC>(4/17/03 3:28:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub169.ezboard.com/fmtboardsfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=811.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  lkn;oi</span><hr size=1> /shrug<br>

LoV's system is phucked up and greedy as a whole then.<br>
<br>
Being rewarded for your actions is the main driving force in life.<br>
<br>
Having your rewards stripped after your actions earnt them is fuct. <br>
<br>
An item should never be the sole property of a guild, unless noone at a raid claimed it and it went to vault, or it was a purchase on behalf of the guild, with vault money.<br>
<br>
Just weird, mebbe I have diff opinions to LoV, but hell every dictatorship guild i have been in, you didnt need to give @#%$ back. Thats the beauty of not having fuctarded recruitment officers...you dont invite the fuctards and they dont make a runner with items 5mins after they loot em /shrug.<br>
<br>
Want to blame someone? Blame the dick that invited Trier to the guild. <br>

<br>
Not really, as BoC's are a extreme upgrade in aggro weapons to something like Kreizens flame, unresistable..higher placing on the aggro list etc. So It's understandable that the first 1/2 is kept within the guild.<br>
<br>
And an item can be the sole property of any guild who's leader core decides so, and noone had a problem with it. Infact everyone was enthusiastic that it would goto a person who needed it most then passed on to a lower tank. Shows a good community, perhaps even family spirit.<br>
<br>
Trier did not purchase it in any way, he was simply online at a good time and got first rights to use it, when he got an upgrade or left LoV/the game it would go to another Tank who needed it as a sufficient upgrade.<br>
<br>
You can't really blame anyone for inviting trier into the guild. Trier all through his application stage and life in LoV that I knew him was an enthusiastic and good player. Allways thinking up new strats or things we could go for/kill. And he got the BoC like 2 months back. Not 5mins.<br>
<br>
But now I know why Trier started crying when Bliza took the BoC for a raid.<br>

Its a pretty simple system that most guild use, be it DKP or otherwise, the BOC was &quot;lent&quot; to Trier at no points cost, ie, the item was not awarded to Trier but he was allowed to use it as MA it makes sense for the guild.<br>
<br>
If the BOC at the end of the raid went up for an open auction and Trier &quot;purchased&quot; the item with his raid points then no one would mind him taking it with him when he left. The simple fact is that Trier benefitted with other items that he fairly earnt and retained and no one minds this but to Ebay a char with an important item that belongs to your old guild is not an honourable way to carry on.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps to clarify the issue, as Leeo has said its a shame the whole thing happened and for me it was a big surprise for the Trier that I knew to do this. Unfortunatly it seems Trier has been passed around more times than a parcel at a kids party and its hard to tell who the hell he is now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Btw that BoC issue that happened is total BS. Trier, own up and hand it back. You can buy one don't lose what honor you may have over loot.
