<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Buying stacks of items">Buying stacks of items</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/18/00 13:47 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>For one, I would love to see this implemented.  However, I would imagine that it would take quite a bit of work.  There is currently no mechanism in EQ to enter a number to trade.  Since the vendor has an infinite amount of an item (unless it was sold that item by a player), the slider won't work well.  How does one create a slider from 1 to infinity?</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
This subject has been brought up many times, yet i've never seen any feedback from verant on it, so i decided to post it here. When you purchase items from vendors, you can only do so one at a time. When you sell, you have a slider bar that lets you select how many to sell. Now some items, such as food, water, bandages, etc, are normally baught in large quantaties. Is it possible for the same sliding bar to come up when buying items? The default would be one, and the max would be 20 (a full stack). Not only would this make things easier for players, who have to sit there hitting the mouse button 40 times for food, 40 times for water, and 40 times for bandages (sometimes more), but it would probably reduce lag. A large amount of information is sent back and forth, i would assume, when purchasing items. If you could do that all at once, instead of 120 times, it would presumably reduce lag, at least a little bit. Someone from verant please respond. Thank you.

This subject has come up several times in the past few weeks. As I mentioned before, this is something that we would like to do at some point in the future, but it's not something that we can assign a high priority to right now. It's certainly a good idea and a possibility for the future.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Bow's themselves cannot proc (randomly cast a spell on a successful hit). This item was probably supposed to be setup as a charged item. I've asked the Live team to check it out.

It will be nice when another dungeon is opened up.  More dungeons are always good.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think the people that did not purchase Kurnak deserve this zone to be finished asap. It was promised way before expansion release, and here we are already several nerfs into the expansion and no new dungeon? What's up with that?<BR>
</font>
We're probably looking at sometime late June for a release of the Hole. There have been a few setbacks in its development, including the zone designer having a couple weeks of jury duty, followed by some meetings that the people working on it were involved in. <BR>
<BR>
The zone geometry is done, and now it is being textured. After that we have objects, lighting, sounds, NPC pathing info, population, and itemization. <BR>
