<BR>
*Patch Day*<BR>
<BR>
Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<BR>
<BR>
*General*<BR>
<BR>
- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark spell vendors.<BR>
- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.<BR>
- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.<BR>
- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.<BR>
- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.  They should be more plentiful now. <BR>
- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.<BR>
<BR>
*Items*<BR>
<BR>
- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.  Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.<BR>
- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.<BR>
- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.<BR>
- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<BR>
<BR>
*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*<BR>
<BR>
Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable.  <BR>
<BR>
Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.  <BR>
<BR>
*Risk and Reward*<BR>
<BR>
The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.  Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments. <BR>
<BR>
In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest.  <BR>
<BR>
However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk.  <BR>
<BR>
Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<BR>
<BR>
*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*<BR>
<BR>
As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.  Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window.  There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<BR>
<BR>
Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved. <BR>
<BR>
Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.<BR>

It's an issue that has existed since the game has opened.  It especially vulnerable to the fact that someone can cast revive on someone without asking, and ruining their chance to get experiance back.</font></p>

In a recent thread on this subject, Abashi responded:<BR>
"I believe I mentioned before that this isn't a bug. Player characters get one chance to accept a resurrection. If they refuse, they can still be transported to the site with a resurrection, but won't get experience."<BR>
<BR>
That is completely accurate, but does not precisely capture the entire issue. If a player does not accept the Resurrection (or Resuscitate) for ANY reason they have completely lost the opportunity to receive a restoration of experience. Those reasons can include:<BR>
<BR>
-&gt; Being AFK and the cleric not bothering to check until the player is ready.<BR>
-&gt; Going LD while the Res is being cast.<BR>
-&gt; Zoning while the Res is being cast.<BR>
-&gt; Saying no because you have no idea what spell was cast or upon which corpse (nobody contacted you ahead of time).<BR>
-&gt; Being unfortunate enough to have someone open a trade with you (interferes with the dialog box).<BR>
-&gt; The zone repops while waiting for the Res (all information gone).<BR>
-&gt; My favorite of all, some well -or not so well- intentioned cleric casting Revive upon your fresh corpse. That's right, you can absolutely remove the possibility of a player receiving an experience res by tossing a good old Revive upon them. There is NOTHING the recipient can do to protect themselves against this. Nothing.<BR>
<BR>
The list above is intentionally left short; I'm sure the more imaginative among us can come up with many more examples.<BR>
<BR>
In discussions about this issue on the EQ-Cleric site some clerics pointed out that nobody was absolutely entitled to an experience ressurection. I agree and disagree with that statement. In my opinion it would be more accurate to state that:<BR>
<BR>
"Nobody is entitled to having a level 39+ cleric Rescusitate or Ressurect them, but if a player were fortunate enough to have one willing to do it, then they are absolutely entitled to being able to receive it successfully with regard to the game mechanics." In other words, if I have a cleric willing to Res me then I absolutely expect to get the experience restoration even if I miss the dialog box through being afk, crashing, zoning to avoid another death, or any other of the numerous possibilities. And as a cleric who provides many ressurections every night, I expect my recipients to always receive the experience I am willing to restore for them, even if I forgot to warn them I am casting (it's happened), they miss clicked (it's happened), they've gone link dead (it's happened), someone opened a trade window with them (it's happened), they went AFK after confirming with me (it's happened), the zone repops (it's happened), or any other conceivable reason.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
We've reopened this issue and are looking into the requested design change. Initially, some possible UI changes suggested looked optimistic, however we need to investigate the issue further before committing to a solution.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We've posted a brand new issue of <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a> today on our Everlore website. This week Milo talks about the well endowed character models in EQ, revenue the game generates on a monthly basis, Pirates and Metallica, and of course the usually barrage of ramblings and submitted questions. Head on over to the page to get the full hook up, here's a snip from a question.
<blockquote>
Hey I have a quick question for you. I'll give you a little background since I have started playing this game I chose a Paladin hoping to get awsome armor sword etc. Well I am satisfied with the human armor visuals except one thing, the helmet that whole tin man bucket head thing just doesn't work for me and I wanted to know if you had anything to do with that design because its horrible. I wonder why you just didnt make the Human helmets similar or exact to the militia ones those are nice. I'll give you props on those, your guard models are great but one more thing. The butts on the models??? why are they so screwed up are you just not good at modeling butts? because you handled the chest area very nicely. But the rear is a different story. I hope you can answer my questions and possibly fix those in the near future. If at all possible well thanks for giving me the time of day and keep up the good work.
