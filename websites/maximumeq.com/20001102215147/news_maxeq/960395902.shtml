<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Hate list of mobs explained">Hate list of mobs explained</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/29/00 12:08 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Abashi explained how the hate list for mobs works in a little more detail.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Though I don't want to get too deep into the mechanics, everything taunts the same amount according to damage with the exception of spells which can have specific amounts of "taunt" set on a per-spell basis.<BR>
In other words, if a ranger and a warrior both hit for 200 damage in a 10-second period, they both have taunted the same amount. What is important is the amount of damage (taunt/hate/etc) done over a period of time. Creatures generally perceive those who have done a lot of damage recently over those who have done more damage total. <BR>
<BR>
Rangers, rogues, and monks, who typically dual wield 1H weapons usually catch the most heat here because the speed of 1H weapons usually has them hitting closer to the average damage of their weapons over a given time period. In other words, due to the speed of their weapons they have a better chance to make their average. In other words, over 20 seconds, a warrior might do 1000 damage, and a ranger 900, but at the 10 second mark the ranger might have been outdamaging the warrior. <BR>
<BR>
All things being equal, creatures that have freedom of movement will go after the character that they hate the most, whereas creatures that are somehow encumbered (rooted, snared, etc.) will go after the character that is the closest. Try it out sometime.<BR>

Abashi explained a little why.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The spell effects on those armor items aren't unbalancing. To my knowledge, there isn't a spell effect greater than level 16 on any of the activatable (right-click to activate) items. All of them should require that the piece be worn to activate the effect, and all should have casting times double to quadruple that of the actual spell.<BR>

<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Would it be possible to allow the naming of a pet<BR>
</font>
We've ruled out allowing this due to the excessive customer-service impact of opening up another name assignment that would have to go through an approval process. We have two situations like this at present (first and last name), which is as difficult as we want to make it at present.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Trading with a full inventory">Trading with a full inventory</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/26/00 13:59 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Always check your inventory before trading something, especially if you are receiving a bag of sorts in the trade.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm wondering if Abashi or someone else at Verant can confirm this policy of no returns for items that hit the ground AND if I'm the only one that thinks a game inface that lets items fall to the ground after a trade rather than cancel the trade or at least put the item on the cursor (like disarm) isn't an oversite.<BR>
</font>
Though I don't care to make any statements that might encourge the dishonest behavior of the person who refused to return the bag, items dropping to the ground when there is no room for them in inventory *is* the way that the interface works. <BR>
<BR>
EQ provides consequences for making mistakes, in order to provide an advantage for not making mistakes, giving the people who learn all of the ins and outs of various aspects of the game an advantage. I understand that no one likes to be penalized, but we also don't want to "pad", and therefore eliminate the consequences of, the mistakes that people can make.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>May 25th, 8:00am<BR>
--------------------<BR>
<BR>
*Patch Day*<BR>
<BR>
Greetings all!  The following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<BR>
<BR>
*Spells/Songs*<BR>
<BR>
- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold.  It now appropriately saves versus magic.<BR>
- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it.  This has been corrected.<BR>
<BR>
*Items*<BR>
<BR>
The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<BR>
<BR>
The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only.  The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors.  This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory.  Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary.  We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<BR>
<BR>
A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected.  Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<BR>
<BR>
The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced.  In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect.  The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)<BR>
<BR>
The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<BR>
<BR>
*General Changes*<BR>
<BR>
- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.  They have been adjusted.<BR>
- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep.  NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.<BR>
- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.<BR>
- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected.  All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.<BR>
- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.<BR>
- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.<BR>
- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.<BR>
- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis.  They were never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.<BR>
- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<BR>
<BR>
We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work.  There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones.  <BR>
<BR>
The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized.  Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk.  Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<BR>
<BR>
Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons).  The affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these zones.<BR>
