<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;It would remove lots of guesswork on a pet's level. It would be most helpful when you're facing a 'high risk' creature such that a good quality pet will give you a definite edge and there is no 'greenie' creature for you to determine the quality of the pet.<BR>
</font>
There's supposed to be some guess work involved. That's why the summoned pets have a level range that they can be. If we wanted everyone to be able to determine with certainty what level their pet is, we could just double the mana requirement and have it summon the best pet every time. <BR>

The casting skills (abjuration, alteration, etc) do not go up after 50, however, the difficult to cast a level 51+ spell does.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi Abashi or whomever at Verant can find the time to help me out with a question.<BR>
I am a level 52 cleric with every single skill maxed out. But all of the new spells fizzle much more than it seems they should. Remedy is finally fizzling less after I hit level 52, but it still fizzles more than seems appropriate.<BR>
The spells aren't fizzling any more than the level 49 spells did on the level you got them. On the level that you get any particular spell, your chance to fizzle the spell is pretty high. That chance decreases dramatically, but never goes away entirely, as you level.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok the real point of this topic. If at level 12 a magic user could scribe a bind scroll he could sell it to warriors so they could bind themself in town only. And could only carry one because of it being lore. This would still promote the interaction with charecters, but one take some of the hassle out of getting a bind.<BR>
Spell scrolls don't work this way. What you are basically describing is how a potion works, and potions can only be made via the Alchemy skill. Though it may not contain all of the potions that people wish for, it's the only way expendable spell-casting items can be created.<BR>
<BR>
Since we don't allow anyone to create anything of value without some effort, opening some way for magic users to create expendable spell-casting items would basically have it working in the same fashion as alchemy, a skill that we want to keep as a benefit only for Shaman.<BR>

Abashi also mentions that they might remove the guild masters and bankers.  I really hope they don't.  Having at least bankers there isn't far fetched.  I could go into real life history... but real life doesn't have half spider/half person monsters, and dragons and such.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The original thread is at:<BR>
http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/039204.html<BR>
<BR>
if anyone would like to review it.<BR>
<BR>
We've discussed the issue again internally and the VenrilSathir faction in some of the Kunark dungeons and the evil outpost are there to stay. The factions as they are set up are important to the storyline in Kunark.<BR>
<BR>
We did make a mistake however in putting guildmasters and bankers in the outpost, as it gave a lot of people the impression that Kunark was their new home and was a place that they would never have to leave. We probably won't remove the guildmasters and bankers, but won't rule that out completely just yet. <BR>
<BR>
We are considering putting the aggressive stuff on a lesser associated faction so it won't hurt as much when people have to kill them from time to time. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Newbie guards get buffed">Newbie guards get buffed</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/09/00 13:58 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Black wolves and Orc pawns don't stand a chance now.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>As we are sure many people are aware, there are guards that exist specifically for the purpose of giving new characters a place to run in order to be saved from a certain death. However, as many people have mentioned, these guards are frequently either dead, or engaged by players choosing to hunt them. This makes things very frustrating for newer players, and with the large influx of new players due to the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, we've decided to make a change.<BR>
Though we do not have a problem with players choosing to hunt guards, the newbie guards themselves, specifically the ones at the gates of cities and in the vicinity of newbie zones, need to remain alive under most circumstances. To that end, tomorrow morning we will be buffing up these newbie-protecting guards, making them immune to magic, and giving them some pretty good healing properties in order to make them less attractive to people hunting them.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, though we will leave the guards inside cities as-is from the perspective of power, we've also found a problem with the respawn rate. Currently they are typically on six-minute timers, making them spawn much faster than an equivalent NPC would in a dungeon. We will be normalizing the respawn time of guards inside cities to bring them in line with dungeon NPCs. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;A while back i heard of a Paladin only spell available at 49. Is this quest broken?<BR>
No, not broken, it just isn't in yet. I don't have an ETA, but June is looking good.<BR>

I *think* what Abashi was trying to say is that the higher level spell is resisted less.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;To put it simply Votaic Draught does the EXACT same thing as the lvl 51 spell Draught of Fire. Same damage, same mana, same casting time. I am assuming this is broken because what would be the point of going through 3 major hell levels for no spell progression? <BR>
This isn't a bug. The intent was to provide wizards with some fast-casting medium damage spells versus all of the saves. Please keep in mind that the levels from 50-60 do not so much represent an increase in power for casters, but them becoming more well-rounded. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="No linked groups and communication">No linked groups and communication</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/09/00 13:40 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Abashi put the nix on linking up groups to share experiance and communications.  Below are his reasons.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>There seem to be a couple of issues here in the thread, the first being linking groups for shared experience, and the second being linking groups for enhanced communication. In both of these cases, we've weighed the various pros and cons of each situation and decided against them.<BR>
Linking groups for shared experience isn't feasible from a technical standpoint. The code that determines how experience is split up, and the group tracking mechanisms in game are part of the central core of EverQuest, something that we would rather leave intact and instead focus our time on adding new content to the game. <BR>
<BR>
Shared communication has been ruled out both for that reason (though communication would probably be easier), and to increase the challenge of encounters that require multiple groups. One thing that is difficult about these encounters is that communication is difficult, where it should be. You have 30 people in a room all going after the same critter, and it takes real skill to keep everything sorted out, even with everything filtered out via the chat filters. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>    Milo D. Cooper has recently joined Everlore to continue his immensely popular column <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a>. Milo is the 3D Character Artist at Verant interactive and takes time out of his busy schedule to answer the many questions he receives, about 3D Modeling, art and even day to day issue's not EQ related.<P> 
 
  Milo's the sarcastic and witty guy at Verant, so it was a no brainer that we had to give him his own column to express his thoughts and take out his aggressions on those not too well skilled with the use of proper grammar. =) Anyway, stop by and check out the column, it's always an entertaining and insightful read. Here's a snip nit from the page.<P>
 
<Blockquote>
How do you sleep at night? How do you sleep knowing that out on the internet there are thousands of hopelessly addicted EverQuest junkies who spend hour after hour feeding their craving? <P> 

Don't you sometimes feel like a crack dealer selling junkies and whores their daily fix? Does this make you think you have a positive effect on society? <P> 

And don't give me any of that crap about "It's their problem not mine", or "I just work here." Someone paid for that hot car you drive, and you know damn well it was paid for with the blood of a million orcs, and the bleary eyes of a thousand EQ addicts who need "just one more kill."<P>
