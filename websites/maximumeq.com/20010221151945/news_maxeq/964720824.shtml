*Karana Secondary Split*<BR>
<BR>
Hello all,<BR>
<BR>
In light of our plans to further balance prime-time population on the servers, we're going to allow another group of players from Karana to split off to Terris-Thule.  <BR>
<BR>
This Friday we will again open /movelog registration on Karana sometime around 7pm PDT (GMT-8).  The GMs will broadcast when registration is open, and we will continue taking /movelog requests for 24 hours. Players wishing to have their characters moved to the new split server will need to run the command "/movelog yes" after registration is opened.  As we have identified a minor problem with the hundreds of simultaneous uses of the /movelog command, it is recommended that you wait a few minutes after registration is opened using it.<BR>
<BR>
Notes:<BR>
<BR>
- /movelog only needs to be run from ONE character, and will count for all characters on that server on that account.  <BR>
- Players who have requested a move should make sure all of their corpses are looted by the time the server is brought down the following Tuesday morning.  Corpses will not be duplicated in the new world, and anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone who moves will be lost.<BR>
- We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this action, based upon the number of total requests that we receive. <BR>
- The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not you have been selected until after the move is actually completed.<BR>
- Karana and Terris-Thule will be down for several additional hours on Tuesday, the day of the next patch.  Updates will be given at that time.</font></p>

I don't agree with Abashi at all on this (when do I? :) ), but I will offer up a suggestion to Rangers.  Try casting it right after the mob hits you.  That way you have a lesser chance of having to channel through 2 rounds of melee.  Of course, if there are several mobs on you, this doesn't work so well.</font></p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Jolt...no real improvement <BR>
</font>
It was a 1 second improvement, or roughly a 30% improvement in casting time. I'd call that "real". Perhaps the misunderstanding is the typical one on this board, that an enhancement is "useless" unless it unbalances the class. Of course since we try not to make changes that do that, we're in a bit of a catch-22.<BR>
<BR>
We are considering upping damage output for rangers though.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
There's been a bit of misconceptions lately about the function of our Quality Assurance department. One of our QA Reps, affectionatly known as Ester the Tester, asked me to post this for her.<BR>
<BR>
-Gordon<BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Hello!<BR>
<BR>
Let me introduce myself. I am ‘Ester the Tester’ (yes it rhymes) and I have asked Abashi to post a letter from the testing department to all of our players. I attended the EQGathering this weekend and spent quite a bit of time listening to players concerns. I felt that having Abashi put up a post detailing what the testing department is and is not may help the communication process between us and you the players.<BR>
<BR>
What we do:<BR>
1. We read each and every email sent to eqtesting@verant.com<BR>
2. We read the bug reports as often as we can<BR>
3. We attempt to the best of our abilities to reproduce the bugs the players send us<BR>
4. We assign bugs to the Development Team.<BR>
<BR>
What we do not do:<BR>
1. We do not have creative control over anything in game<BR>
2. We do not continue reading emails if they are abusive or flames<BR>
3. We do not do reimbursals<BR>
4. We do not respond to any emails, if we did this nothing else would get done<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I would like to list a few things that if included in the emails and bug reports that would make it much easier for us to reproduce the situations.<BR>
1. Zone name<BR>
2. Location -- /loc <BR>
3. Full names of NPC’s<BR>
4. Full names of items – not abbreviations, I don’t know all of them!!<BR>
5. Location<BR>
6. Any mitigating circumstances even if they seem trivial (you’d be surprised)<BR>
7. Location<BR>
8. Server – even on bug reports, some times they get shuffled<BR>
9. Location<BR>
10. Did I mention Location???<BR>
11. Server name<BR>
12. Location<BR>
<BR>
If you are reporting a broken quest PLEASE include the starting NPC’s full name, the zone it is in, the NPC’s loc, and the phrase used to trigger the quest. This will save us SO much time when reproducing these bugs.<BR>
<BR>
Something else that is useful is the threads that talk about broken quests, or bugs in the game. It is a little difficult to sort out the wish lists, flames, complaints, but we have pulled bugs out of those threads and some of them are already fixed.<BR>
<BR>
I am a firm believer in communication. I as also a firm believer in EverQuest, and the team of testers I work with. There are some things we just don’t catch. We haven’t played every class race combination to 60, so we desperately need your input. Please remember that the testing department can not change anything fundamental in the game, so the rants and flames are a waste of your and my time. To be honest, when I get an email that is offensive I stop reading right there. It is the same with posts.<BR>
I do lurk on these boards, and I communicate frequently with Abashi. Sometimes he will ask for more information and clarification. This is usually me asking him to find me some more information so we can reproduce whatever bug you are talking about. <BR>
<BR>
Thank you for playing EverQuest and caring so much about this game. I do promise to lurk and read. I’ll never post, but if Abashi says Ester the Tester said… well that was me.<BR>
