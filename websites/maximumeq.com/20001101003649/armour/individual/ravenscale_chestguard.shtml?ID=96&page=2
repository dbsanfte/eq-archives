<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I have camped the green bubble through about 125 to 150 times across assorted different trips to the fabulous Cazic Thule...In that time I would estimate the AoF to spawn an average of one in eight to one in ten.   I have seen him spawn three times in a row and not once in over twenty spawns so he has lots of variety.  Once a group of guildmates saw him spawn eight out of twelve spawns.  To the best of my knowlege I have killed the AoF fifteen times and he dropped the ravenscale chestguard once.  There was no rogue in our party,  but my guildmate won the lotto and later sold it at a very reasonable price to a delighted rogue we both knew.  Best of luck all,  this is one of the best fights in the game in my experience so keep on camping.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>The AoF is one hell of a pain camp. The spawn is like this. 20 min spawn for the PHer (champion judicator justicator)and 22 mins for the AoF. I have camped this spawn a ridiculous amount of times. Sometimes he will spawn several times within a 3-4 hour period sometimes he won't spawn once. It all depends on that damn spawn machine *kicks the damn thing several times for good measure*. But seriously this is a highly sought after camp making it hard to get into a group. On our server (Quellious) this chestguard goes for 2500+pp value, yes you heard it right. I myself had to shell out 3k in items just to convince the person to sell it to me and not the other 10 people begging to buy it from her. It's a very nice piece of equipment which is rare and the AoF room is VERY tough to camp. When you account for breaking the room dealing with healers in the upper pool (that will bite you in the ass if you are lucky enough to be fighting an Avatar)the fact that runners are a death/evac wish you start to get the point of why this is a hard room. But when done correctly this is as someone else said one of the best fights in the game. When you see his ugly hairy ass just chilling in that big green bubble you definitely feel the adrenaline pumping. He's very magic resistant and deals out a great amount of damage. So be ready for a fight. Also one thing i forgot to mention is that part of the problem with the aof is that if he gets trained to zone he gets stuck inside of the zone requiring a gm to come and kill him... yep you guessed right no one gets his loot. :( just a sidenote if you notice that the aof hasn't spawned in some time this could be the case but usually when this occurs no phers spawn.

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Having camped various rooms in Cazic in the last few weeks, including the Avatar room, I thought it might be good to post a few things I learned about the avatar and his nasty little hench-lizards =)<BR>
<BR>
The avvy himself and his placeholder spawn on a 20 minute cycle on the dot; the pool surrounding the bubble spawns four more lizards, and then the Cenobyte / placeholder spawns around the centre of the bubble. You also get wandering spawns down from the planks, and occasional room spawns, usually judicators / justicars. Each spawn cycles in 20minutes, so if you note down when they pop you can easily predict / avoid / delay spawns to split the room up nicelyl this makes it FAR easier to hold the room.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike some people seem to think, you don't need a full group of 35+ players to hold it. A good diverse group of no lower than 29 and no higher than 36 can hold it easily. There are only a few requirements: A cleric is a must, for the HP and AC buffs and heals; a tank, or someone with a ton of HP, and a chanter or bard to mez and charm multiple spawns.<BR>
<BR>
The reason why you need a tank or high HP character is because of the nasty little thing the Avatar does when you tick him off. I discovered he doesn't like being backstabbed for 115 when he turned around and laid a 500pt harm touch on me. He only has one, but he certainly does use it. If I hadn't been at full health, my corpse would still be on the floor down there =)<BR>
<BR>
The most important thing about camping the avatar room is never to panic. Getting upset / worried about when things pop is bad, because that is one tough room to get out of in a hurry. If the pool spawns aren't clear you have to swim out through them, up through the bubble, or make it through the hellish maze of fanatics, zealots and gators that inhabit the planks. Having a druid for buffs / evac / sow is always a good idea just in case things go sour.<BR>
<BR>
My group (a cleric, a necro, a warrior, a paladin, a shaman and myself, a 30 rogue) camped the Avatar room the other day for nearly 5 hours; we killed the avatar 5 times for 1 Raven CG and 4 claws. Unfortunately for me, My group decided to roll for the CG, and I lost... so if you're selling one on Bristlebane at a reasonable price, give me a tell!<BR>

Luckily, while on my Newbie Wizard, a Level 49 Paladin  in EC shouted something about the first Wizard under level 10 would get something nice...<BR>
Well, I was at the tunnel discussing a trade with a Rogue who had a Ravenscale Chestguard, so I poked the Paladin, and gave ma  Lasnik's Staff (2hB, Wiz Mnk, 12/40 +5 Int, +15 Mana, +15 vs Magic, Lore). The Rogue asked me what I got, I told him, and He said he believed the staff was worth around 1.4K (I think the Staff sucks, even if it is rare).  So we traded... I think he got screwed..<BR>
Sorry for the Long post... and it doesn't look like plate, It looks like Black Chain Mail, VERY cool.<BR>
