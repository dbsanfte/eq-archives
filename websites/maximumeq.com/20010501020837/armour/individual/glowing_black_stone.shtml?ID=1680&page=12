<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok, I've been camping pyzgn for about a week now, no stone yet, but I have figured a few things out.  The post about kill scruffy and nechlo and pygn will spawn 2 hours later is bull.  Didn't do a dam thing.  The first day I camped her she spawned about 5 times, killed her 5 times, no stone.  All the other days I've camped her she hasn't spawned once.  I tried killing everything, all the skellys at the ruins, nechlo, scruffy, tovax, all of them, and she didn't spawn.  I tried just killing the skells and tovax, she didn't spawn.  I tried not killing anything, she didn't spawn.  The first night I just sat there killing skells, that hasn't worked since either.  I also tried killing every mangy rat I could find on tracking, that didn't work.  Also, the post about "I know the secret to making her spawn every night but I'm not going to tell anyone,"  you're full of ..it.  Please people, do not make stuff up and post it here to get attention, its annoying.  These are the facts I've found out, hope they help someone.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok, been camping pyzgn for a little while now, she spawned this morning, and I just really wanted to quell a few of these bogus rumors.  Tovax V'mar is NOT a placeholder for pyzgn, he was standing about 40 feet away when she spawned and I killed her.  Neither are the Dread Skells, because one jumped me while I was fighting her.  I followed her slow butt all the way up to the ruins, let her walk up and stand around there for a minute, then toasted her, she still didn't drop the stone.  So, to recap, Tovax and Dread skells Not placeholders, and letting her walk to the ruins doesn't make her drop the stone.  Please stop posting ignorant rumors.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok folks here is my 2cp for this issue.  It will not clear up the argument about pyzjn's spawn time or reveal any 'secrets'; its just what i have heard and learned about the spawn.  First of all, i heard about the gbs and thought it would be a nice item for my caster.  Next, i visited many of the websites looking for clues and/or information concerning pyzjn.  I really, truly feel there is some way to trigger the spawn, mostly though thats just because i refuse to believe that a mob that drops this item can be TRULY random.  I think there may be something to the comment in a previous post concerning the fact that this was one of first zones and first npc's in game, thus the complexity of the spawn.  I think that behind all of it there is even a quest somewhere and somehow concerning pyzjn, tovax, varsoon,....etc.  So last weekend i had a couple days to burn and i hung out in the hills for about 4 days.  During that time i killed her 7 times and saw her pop 8 times. (the comments about the value of track are true, you must get to her first, ksers and item farmers are no problem here, she is weak and if you reach her first you rarely will get ksed)  I saw her pop in three different places with my own eyes.  She usually spawns a little distance from ruins and walks up to them although i witnessed her pop there on one occasion.  As for time, i saw her pop at 8pm two game nights in a row at the exact same spot, she also popped at 10,12,2,and 5am so i dont believe time is an issue(must be night of course).  I WANT TO BELIEVE there is some way to make her spawn and 5 times she popped a friend and i had been leaving the circle of skellys/rats around the ruins alone and only killing the creatures that walked up and stood in middle of ruins.  Tovax was alive sometimes, and sometimes she popped right after he was killed.  I have read the posts about people supposedly knowing the spawn time or the 'secret'.  I wouldnt call them liars outright, though most probably are, but they are selfish and loathsome individuals (matter of fact i killed couple of those in the hills recently )P )  The idea of letting pyzjn reach varsoon seems to have merit although i would ask the one who sent that how they made varsoon spawn as i only saw him once in all that time and she was not up.  Perhaps things would be clearer if we actually let pyzjn, varsoon, tovax alone and watched what they did but hehe with all the desire for the gbs that won't happen (.  I would really like to get to the bottom of this mystery and im doing a lot of quests in the area and attempting to find a connection.  If i ever find out anything concrete i'll post it here.  By the way i did recieve the gbs ) the 4th time i killed her ) and i helped a friend get another one.  I saw 2 drop in the space of a week so the once a month thing is not true, although it may only drop once a game month.  Another theory that i was told in confidence (as the info supposedly came from a verant employee, though i think thats bs) is that she is on a random number generator.  What that means is the computer picks a random number say 1323, then after 1323 creatures are killed in the hills she pops at night.  That may explain why almost everytime i see her conditions seem different and why she pops more often during peak playing times.  One thing i know she is not as rare as people say, you probably dont see her though cause she is killed quickly before she can ever reach ruins most of the time.  Good luck to all you good folks out there trying to get this great item for your characters and to all the item farming, ebayer scum out there, "May you go LD right after you spot her" Peace!</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Well, about her not being that rare, and spawning alot people just don't see it before she's ksed, that's not true.  I camp her in the mornings, when there's only about 4 people in the q hills zone, and I check tracking every few seconds, so the second she spawns I see her.  I've been there for one week now, and only seen her once.  That's 7 days, 8 hours a day.  The time she spawned, yes I let her walk to the ruins, I even let her stand there for a few seconds.  I wanted to see if she would walk away, but I was worried she'd despawn on me.  I killed her, no stone.  As to the item not being worth it, that's not true either in my opinion.  I've camped this thing for 40 hours now, do you know how much exp I could've gotten in that time?  People pay 3pp each for lego pads in gfay so they can get exp, its only natural that they'd pay big money for this in exchange for all the exp they get while not camping it.  If you want this item, you're definately going to have to shell out some bucks for it.</font></td></tr></table>
