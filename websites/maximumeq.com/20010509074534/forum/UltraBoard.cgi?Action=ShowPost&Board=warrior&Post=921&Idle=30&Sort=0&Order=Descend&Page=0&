<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Note: This is all compilation of my time playing a warrior as my primary class.  Some of these points will be *opinions* based on that time, and some will be *facts*.  Whether you disagree with some things (or all) maybe others can learn.<p>

1. Which race do I choose to be the *best* warrior?<p>

Fact is, no race is the *best* warrior hands down.  Some races do offer distinct advantages such as regeneration, an AC bonus, higher base statistics, and the like.  Most of those also come with an experience penalty, or rough faction. (Iksars come to mind, they have regen, an AC bonus, but must deal with being kos everywhere but Cabilis, and have the worst racial experience penalty in the game).  Your Gnome warrior will not have as many hitpoints as an Ogre or Troll would at level 60, but the difference may be as sligh as 2-300 hitpoints.  Will this make a difference in the end game?  Maybe, maybe not.  But if there were 1 race/class combination available that was more powerful than any other, don't you think someone would have found it by now?<p>

2. Where do I put all of my starting points?<p>

I hate to touch this subject.  Everyone has their own opinion on this.  Some say "My woodelf warrior has max agility and gets hit for half as much as any ogre!"  This I doubt.  I really have not ever seen a defining quality in strength, agility, or dexterity.  To answer this, we must look at what these stats reflect in the game, to the best of my knowledge.<p>

Strength:  Through vigorous testing of my own, I have never seen much difference whatsoever in damage output from 113 str up to 255 str.  Using 1 or 2 hand weapons.  What str will offer you however, is a higher ATK value, and the ability to carry more gear/heavier accesories/etc.<p>

Stamina: Sta = hitpoints.  Nothing more.  There is 1 other side affect - if you have over 100 stamina, when your fatigue bar is empty, you will not be hurt by lowered agility or strength.  More stamina does not mean your fatigue bar will last longer.  If you're wielding a wurmslayer and a jade mace, with AQ or some other haste, it's going to run out.  Period.  It's just that I've never noticed any adverse side effects to this other than the ability to jump.<p>

Agility: I don't know about monks and rogues, but as a warrior, I've seen agility only have a minor impact on total AC value.  Also, like stamina, if you have over 100 agility, when you get hurt passed 1 bubble of hp, your run speed will not decrease as dramatically as it would if you had 70 agility.<p>

Dexterity: Dexterity has 3 impacts on you.  First, the rate at which you learn melee skills is dependant on your dex value.  Second, the ratio of critical/crippling blows you have is dependant on dex.  Third, the amount of times your processing weapon "procs" is dependant on dex.  What does this mean?  Through my own tests, I've found slightly increased proc rates and crit rates at 100 dex, 175 dex, and 255 dex. ***NOTICE*** I said *slightly.*  Nothing that would make or break a fight, without extreme luck.<p>

Now, where do we put our points?  If I were to start all over again, I would put all of my points into stamina, and the last remaining 5-7 into agility.  Why?  Strength comes easy with warrior equipment.  I don't find dexterity to be relatively important at all anymore(if you *need* to proc for some reason, shaman dex + boon of the garou will pump you up quite effectively).  <p>

3. What should I do, get str/sta/dex/agility gear or try to get the best AC gear I can?<p>

I don't remember the warrior that said this, but I've always remembered it.  "A warrior has a holy trinity, that's AC, HP, and Resists."  In that order.  I cannot stress enough the importance of AC over anything else, save HP and resists.  Magic Resistence is really the only thing that will help you in the day to day exp grind, but the equipment to deal with the other resists is mandatory for certain high level encounters.  If I need to explain why HP is important, go back to playing your druid.<p>

4. Should I use my 2h or my 1h weapons?<p>

Damage output.  There are hundreds of thousands of threads, discussions, essays, dmg calculators, data logs being ran through parsers, it's endless.  And so, this is of my own accord, through my own parsed logs, my own tests.<p>

Level 1 - 19: Whatever you can get your hands on, if it's a fast 1hs, that'd work best.<p>

Level 20 - 38: The best *ratio* 2hs weapon you can afford.  Langsaxe of the wolves, Exe Axe, Mithril Staff, Nathsars Greatsword, Ornate Runed blade, all decent for this level range.<p>

Level 39 - 60: Dual wield, unless a situation calls for a 2handed weapon(mob has a dmg shield, you're not the main tank and want to reduce your aggro, etc).  I will briefly explain why.  At level 29 you get double attack with your offhand.  At level 39, you reach the skill cap of 200 in dual wield and double attack.  All of this, added to the damage bonus you gain in your primary hand equals dual wielders outdamaging 95% of all 2handed weapons available.  Yes, an Oggok Cleaver(44/60) will in all likely hood out damage 2 SSoY's.  Realize though, that that is not a fair comparison.  A Jade Mace + Cane of the Tranquil will outdamage that same Cleaver without any question.<p>

Finally ***PRACTICE ALL WEAPON SKILLS*** This is important.  Just because certain weapons are more effective in certain level ranges, does NOT mean you don't practice.  1hs is no better than 1hb.  2hs is no better than 2hb.  Practice all your skills, and when you aquire this amazing weapon that is of a skill not usually thought to be a "warrior" skill, you will be able to wield it to your full ability.<p>

5. Why can't I solo with my warrior like a druid?  <p>

Because you are not a soloing class.  That's the bottom line.  There are 3 classes devoted to grouping abilities and nothing else.  They are: Warriors, Clerics, and Enchanters.  This is not to say you can't solo.  If you are a very rich twink, a warrior with proper haste and a fungi tunic could effectively solo to level 50 in the right areas.  If you're not a rich twink, even with sub par equipment you can solo effectively to level 30.  But, when I say solo effectively, I do not mean you will perform like a necro or druid.  You will not.  Ever.  If you wish to solo as your primary form of experience gain, I suggest playing a druid, shaman, necro, mage, or bard.  Fact is, mobs are over powered in melee combat in relation to our own.  These classes have ways to work around that, most specifically root/dotting and kiting.<p>

6. Where do I hunt at X level?<p>

If you do not wish to explore the world on your own, then read on.  I spent level 1-18 in Everfrost, so I'll only look at 20 and beyond.<p>

lvl 20 - 30: Lake of Ill Omen, Solusek Dungeon A, Mistmoore, Highpass Hold are among good places to go. <br>
lvl 30 - 40: Frontier Mountains, Solusek Dungeon B, Lower Guk Live Side, The Overthere<br>
lvl 40 - 50: Solusek Dungeon B, Lower Guk Dead Side, The Dreadlands, Karnor's Castle, Burning Woods<br>
lvl 50 - 60: If OS is overcrowded &lt;gasp&gt; there ARE other places to go.  Karnor's Castle basement, Chardok, Howling Stones, Permafrost(don't laugh, under the pit to Vox is an area 1 group can have enough mobs to hold them in constant exping for hours on end, even without an enchanter if you're high enough to level pull), Velketor's Lab.<p>

7. How do I make money?<p>

Again, since you cannot solo like a druid or necro, you cannot farm items like they can either.  There are places however where it is possible.<p>

At level 40 or so, depending on your equipment, you can do Alchemist, Preacher, Archeologist in Permafrost.  At level 46 you can single pull, and effectively do the King room as well.<p>

"But I want money before level 40."  Then I suggest going to East Commons or Greater Faymart, buying things cheap and selling them high.  That will take a lot of time, but I know of more than a few people who have made unbelievable amounts of money by just trading.  If what you make in day to day exping cannot sustain you, then this is really the only other option you have.<p>

8. How do I taunt effectively?<p>

Fast, 1hand weapons in the main hand help.  They really do.  But, you also have other avenues than your "Taunt" button.  By setting up your hotkeys in a comfortable way for you, you can use beg and disarm as well to build hate.  I say setting up your hotkeys correctly, because you need to turn off autoattack to beg, then turn it back on.  Hopefully with the correct setup, you can do this while only losing 1 round of attacks.<p>

<p>

I've tried to generalize this as much as possible, not getting into specifics.  If there are specific questions you wish answered, post them here and I'd be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.  Also, if you disagree with anything here, that's fine.  I've already stated that this is all based on my own personal experience.  However, please try to keep the flames to a minimum ;)<p>
