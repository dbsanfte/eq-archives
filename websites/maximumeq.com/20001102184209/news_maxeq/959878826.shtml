Although, knowing that it can go up, but it isn't, and knowing that it's maxed, are 2 different things.</font></p>

I agree completely that leveling from 50 to 60 shouldn't be as fast as going from 40 to 50, but I feel very strongly that you have overdone it, and a mass exodus of level 50+ players is going to happen soon, because most of us just don't have what it takes to spend 50+ days of online time to get 10 levels. The next big RPG that comes out may cause a very large percentage of your subscribers to quit for this reason.<BR>

The experience curve from 50 to 60 is pretty steep, and we don't expect that everyone will reach 60. It was made this steep since the majority of the people at level 50 are very experienced players, and would tear through those 10 levels regardless what the curve is. The first person reached 60 in 17 calander days, with a ranger of all things, so it looks like the curve is ok. We really didn't expect anyone to be able to do it for about a month, so the players surprise us yet again <BR>
My recommendation to everyone would be to stop watching their experience bar and concentrate instead on exploring new areas and enjoying yourselves. You'll find that things go a bit quicker this way.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Keyed Dungeons">Keyed Dungeons</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/19/00 01:54 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>A player recently asked why Verant implemented dungeons that require keys to get into them?  The concerns were that the key was on the corpse, which after you die, you obviously don't have, among others.  Abashi had a good response for why.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
The keyed dungeons were thought up as a way to keep people from accidently entering areas of extreme difficulty, instead making it so they must specifically wish to enter the dungeon. It also has the added benefit of having people think twice before they choose to enter an area where the risk of death and possible corpse loss (due to the inability to raise a sufficient party to retrieve your corpse) is higher than most other areas. <BR>
By making it harder to enter a dungeon, players must make a real choice as to whether or not they want to absorb the risk associated with entrance. We also wanted to increase the challenge by getting rid of "zone fighting" in some of the Kunark Dungeons. Overall it's working pretty well.<BR>
