Apparently nobody wants to offer up any information on Gharzak.  I'm gonna camp him this Friday until I find him or fall asleep at the keyboard.  Any info I can offer after its over I'll post here and I ask anyone who posted here requesting info and has gotten it elsewhere to please post it so the others of us can get in on the slaying.<BR>

I have heard rumours of 36 hour spawn times etc., but nothing substantiated so hopefully I can offer something concrete after this weekend.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>It really amazes me how much speculative crap people post when they have no clue what is going on. I have personally killed Grazhak once, and forced him to spawn again 2 days later. Unfortunately the 2nd time I had given up for the night only to have a friend tell me Grazhak showed no more than 15 mins later. He spawns near the Feerot zone and as far as I can tell his placeholders are orcs, lizardmen, bears, skels, fire beetles and such. I have a feeling that its mainly the wandering orcs, either priests or warriors, but everything is of such low level why not kill them all? Concentrate on killing all wandering spawns in the area where the 2 undead camps are to the left coming out of the Feerot zone. Don't bother clearing the orc camp it has nothing to do with his spawn at all. Do however clear all wanderes in the area I mentioned and also check the xroads by the Feerot zone and kill anything that cruises in there, usually a bear, lizard scout or skeletons. When I found Grazhak the first time he was coming from the xroads towards the open area where you will be concentrating on clearing spawns.<BR>
<BR>
I have screenshots to prove what I say and I might camp him again soon as I am more confident in my method after causing his 2nd spawn 2 days later. Also if you're clearing lizardmen, basilisks and drakes you have a chance to get Petrifin, Mortificator and Shardwing to spawn. By the way he had the girth when I killed him which promptly traded for a Mortificator staff :)<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>First of all Grazhak does not turn invisible, more idiotic nonsense. He is a very rare spawn in a place that many people don't hang out. If Grazhak was a rare spawn in a place like Oasis he'd probably show up 3 times a day or more because everything is constantly being killed there. Not many people hang out in that area of Rathe Mountains therefore his placeholders are rarely killed. I guarantee if you just set away a few nights and do nothing but clear placeholders he would eventually spawn.<BR>
<BR>
As far as level he was VERY green at 50. 2 starfires pretty much wiped him out which says he has a little over 1200hp. He didn't have the axe with him so he might be tougher with it, especially if the proc goes off and he gets the shield skin. If anyone wants a screenshot of this guy I can send it to someone or post it somewhere on the net.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>yes as everyone think's by now, this is one of the rarest spawns in the game. on Rallos zek he spawned within 5 hours 3 times, and 2 times he had the axe. he has no where close to 1200hp when i soloed him, and im a level 32 ranger, he took like 3 bars off me when i had 900hp and i didnt even bother blasting him, he spawned on me. The best way to make him spawn is by killing skeletons, i tried to kill orcs, he never spawned within 19 hours, killed skeletons spawned in 25minutes, 1 hour 35 minutes, 3hours 10minutes. This guy aint as rare as ancient cyclops, priest of najena, and his axe is wielded by my warrior (skillet), and 7 others, this works best with warriors. just kill skels whenever you can, have atleast 2 rangers so one can med, unless he/she is not going to med, always be tracking, always have a ranger, always kill skeletons, best advice i think will be given here.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Well i tried both methods that were listed for 2 weeks. Granted i do have a life and didn't camp these areas for more than about 4-5 hrs at a time. Each time there the skele camp was being cleared by other players. The only camp that wasn't being cleared was the one with the 2 named necro in it. I have not seen nor heard of Grazhak spawning in the area. For now i have given up but i am still trying to find out more info on this. Info i have gotten so far is that he is VERY rare like Morty, and they only spawn once a month or something to that effect. I will update with any info that i come across that seem "real".<BR>
