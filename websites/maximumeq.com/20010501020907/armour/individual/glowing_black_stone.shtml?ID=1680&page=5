<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I've hunted her for 5 days, which is about 35 hrs online for me (ok, I play EQ too much).<BR>
<BR>
I've seen her 7 times and killed her 6.  Can't underestimate the value of a ranger willing to track for a piece of the pie.<BR>
<BR>
She's heavily camped, but most people give up after a couple of nights due to the sheer boredom of camping the ruins.  These haven't been my most exciting days in EQ, but it's like winning the lotto if you get a GBS at my level, 22.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the semi-random nature of her spawn, I worry everyday that some newbie is gonna kill her and get the stone and sell it to a vendor while I'm at work or asleep.<BR>
<BR>
There does seem to be a connection between her and the other NPCs in the area...I've seen her too many times, based on the way I hunt her, for there not to be.(that's a hint, by the way)<BR>
<BR>
Since I haven't gotten the stone, I can't say that there's a way to make it drop, but I suspect it is simply a rare random and the only way to get it is to be patient, and I mean the kind of patient that is necessary when you watch grass grow. For the level 40 to 60 campers that want the GBS, I would suggest you buy it...prolly take less time to recoup the money than to camp the spawn.  I currently have an offer for a SMR and 2 FBSS when I get the GBS, so that's a guage for the value, or at least someones desperation.<BR>
<BR>
If you are camping the ruins and someone else shows up, don't act like you have a right to tell them to leave. Someone tried that with me today, because they had been there for 6 hrs...6 hrs on Pyzjn is like going through the drive-thru at McDonalds.  You just gotta hope you see her first.<BR>
<BR>
She has multiple spawn spots...I have confirmed 3, and have heard that there is at least 1 more.<BR>
<BR>
With regard to speculation, I fear that Varsoon may be involved, as the spell Identify shows this to be the black heart of Varsoon.  I have confirmed this identification with someone who owns the stone. Though he didn't kill Varsoon, he wasn't sure if someone had prior to him killing Pyzjn. Maybe he has to spawn and be killed for her to get his heart.  This would also make a bit of sense, since a level 12 necro dropping this kind of item seems a bit odd and Varsoon is a bad dude, especially when he returns as Varsoon the Undying.  I hope this turns out to be wrong, because that means I am wasting my time repeatedly killing Pyzjn.<BR>
<BR>
Once I have the stone, I will return and post ALL the details of my experience hunting Pyzjn. I am taking diligent notes of all things that occur while I am camping, so those who want to depend on the info provided, check back here often and look for a follow-up.<BR>
<BR>
I wish all of you luck in your hunt for this illusive item.  Also, if anyone who has the stone can give any definate info regarding your success, there seems to be a lot of interested people who would be very greatful...myself included.<BR>
<BR>
Just my 2cp...hope you folks don't mind.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Okay here is what I have personally found out. Im sure that all this might have been mentioned throughout all the messages but just wanted to add my two cents. Anyways, today i set out to camp for the GBS because I am in some serious needs of cash. It was earlier in the morning about 8 eq time. I killed everything that wandered near the ruins or spawned in the ruins and even went a little ways away from the ruins to kill as well so i killed everything in a very large radius. As for the mentionings of all the other npc's being placeholders my research shows this as being false. I camped her tonight for 4 eq nights in a row and she spawned every time! All I did was kill kill kill. Of course i wasn't very lucky and she never dropped the Gbd any of the 4 times so i assume the drop has to be ultra rare. A freind of mine said drop ratio is about 1:10. Anyways I hope this helps all of you fellow hunters and goodluck bagging your GBS.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Heres what i have learned after camping her for the longest time.  The first time i saw pyzjn was when i was walking through WK and i gave a tell to a person who was camping her already and he said he was through with her.  But he said if you wanna kill her come back to the ruins at 10:45 earth time.  So i went and checked it out and it to my surprise i saw pyzjn walking down the hill to the ruins from bb it looked like at exactly 10:45.  So i killed her but of course she didn't drop it.  So i gave the guy a tell afterwards and i asked him how he knew it would spawn but he said that was info he could't let me hear.  I understood so i left him alone after some begging but there must me some way of knowing when she'll spawn since this guy got it right on the button.  </font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I finally got the glowing black stone after 3 weeks, off and on. I killed that lil necro more than a dozen times ( completely ruining any chance of setting foot in the necro guild in Qeynos).<BR>
I spent about 50 Hrs total at the ruins.  I went after Tovax in the begining, running over when ever someone spotted him.  But after reading these posts i realized it was more than likely a waste of time.<BR>
I decided to try a new approch and concentrate on the ruins area itself.  I sat in the middle of the ruins and killed everything that moved at night and during the day i went into town to refuel and offload the coppers.<BR>
( From my experinces, I've rarely seen her in the daylight.) This last camp I sat through two full EQ days clearing the ruins and no sign of her.  It was almost morning when i saw here stroling up from the bottem of the hill from the direction of surefall.<BR>
She went down fast with the necro drain spells, beating out a lvl 15 KS'r who happened on her while i was fighting.  I didn't even wait for her to hit the ground before I was looting, and there it was. The black pearl of my dreams, right next to the <BR>
Stupid rusty dagger. hehe  I don't think there is any rhyme or reason to it, just luck and persistance.  Good luck to all who try for it.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok... all of you wanting to know how much to sell it for. BLOW ME! If you have no use for it besides getting rich leave the damn girl alone! Let us casters kill her so we can use it instead of driving prices on it and everything down by farming! Farming consists of killing a unique NPC over and over again for the loot to sell at a profit, sure some profit is always needed but lastnight i was camping her (level 23) and this necro came up and said he had just killed her.... not caring i stayed and she pop'd, I casted and sent my pet in but he was a 50+ necro so his 1 DOT did more dmg than my nuke did, she dropped the damn stone also, i petitioned it and yelled and screamed but they did nothing.... Thank you and STOP FARMING CRAP! YOUR MAKING THE GAME FOR CRAP!</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>This is to the guy that says he got ripped off because of the farming.  First, if you got the first spell off, then you could have a reason to complain, so if you did, then petition.  But, if he got the first spell off, then you have no right to talk.  Also, if he was a necro, he most likely wouldn't sell it, because he is a caster, and i think any caster would want the item, and not sell it.</font></td></tr></table>
