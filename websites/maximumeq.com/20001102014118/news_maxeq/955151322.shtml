<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Has anyone, that is currently on the Everquest development team, played a pure melee or even hybrid class all the way from lvl 1 to lvl 50, without twinking or "buffing"? <BR>
This question keeps coming up and the answer is yes. I know of one person here who has played a troll SK to 50, several who have played rogues, a few more who have played warriors. I'm sure there is a monk or two running around as well.<BR>
<BR>
I think that some people think that "if only a dev team member would play my class, we'd be better". That might be true if it weren't for the ability of our game designers to distance themselves from the typical class-envy traps and overcome bias. If anything, perhaps some of the class-experiences encountered by people here led to the class becoming more difficult overall. For instance, I find it a bit humorous when some necromancers complain about how weak they are, since I *know* that it is not the case. I'm sure similar things happen in regards to the other classes.<BR>

Also, there is changes to the user agreement, you had best read them.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Dear EverQuest Players,<BR>
<BR>
An exciting time is now at hand. Within the next 2 days the Login Servers will be coming down and we will be doing a patch that will add the EverQuest Store into the front end of the game. At that time, the first product we will be offering will be the EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark (RoK) upgrade for existing customers. This will allow existing customers of EverQuest to purchase RoK for $16.95 (Plus S&H). In addition, we will offer various shipping options depending on which country you live in. EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark will be launching on April 24th. We want to insure that this product is in everybody's hands on or before that date. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to this change, we will also be modifying our User Agreement and Software License to add in some additional Terms and Conditions that we will require everyone to agree to before playing EverQuest.<BR>
<BR>
The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest Characters and Items outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay). Here is the text of this change:<BR>
<BR>
"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material."<BR>
<BR>
You may ask why we are doing this. There are many reasons, but first and foremost of them is the amount of trouble this is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there are a lot of people out there who defraud others and we are being put in the middle of it, and we don't have the time or the resources to assist people with these disputes when they arise. The next reason is a more philosophical one and that is that we believe people should have to earn their items and characters in the game rather than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the second point can be argued from other perspectives that we do in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear ours.<BR>
<BR>
The next change to the User Agreement and Software license concerns our efforts to stop people from hacking EverQuest and from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest as an ongoing business concern. We have developed the technology to check for these hacking tools/programs and report that fact back to us. Without getting into the specifics of this technology, I can say that we in no way will search a user's hard drive(aside from the EverQuest directory during the patching process), registry nor will we send back any information other than the fact that a user is in fact running one of these programs (specifically we are NOT sending information about everything the user is running back to our servers). It's disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the hacking community  force us to do this. Many will say "ShowEQ" isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not something we can allow in a game like EverQuest where it affects other people's enjoyment of the game. In addition, although this is the first time we'll be acknowledging this, ShowEQ isn't the worst offender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring down our servers with another malicious program. We were able to quickly identify what was going on and insure this didn't happen again, but nonetheless the potential is there and we need to be able to quickly identify and stop these types of programs. Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send any information back to the Everquest servers other than information regarding programs that we feel interfere with the intended operation of EverQuest. We have had this technology available for some time, but recently we've found it's going to be neccessary to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To those of you concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say that we feel it's neccessary to do this but we want you to be informed that we are going to try these measures to protect both ourselves and the game's players.<BR>
<BR>
Here is the text of this change:<BR>
<BR>
"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files to you.  You also grant us permission to access, extract and upload (i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii) data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion, determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest."<BR>

Both Brad McQuaid and John Smedly posted in response.  Smed's response is below (it gives the best information).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Brad's correct in that we've lost a server exactly 3 times in EverQuest's lifetime. This one particularly bothered me, because it's the 2nd time it happened to EverQuest. This time around I had them completely switch in entirely new hardware for the server because we began to suspect another piece of hardware in the configuration. <BR>
We do apologize for any downtime Nameless players have experienced. We understand completely that you pay us for a service that is expected to run 7/24 and we do our best to live up to that. In certain circumstances like this we need to tread extremely carefully to make sure we don't lose a whole bunch of data. That's why we backup everything (It's actually backed up in multiple ways).<BR>

Again, please accept our apologies and know that we are doing our best to make sure this kind of thing is inredibly rare.<BR>

You called us greedy.  You called us selfish.  You called us any number of profane names which are not used in polite society.  Why?  Simply because we told you that we were unable or unwilling to respond to you when you begged.   It mattered not what you asked for; a clarity, a res, a "sow".  The simple fact of the matter is we were busy with something else, and not in a position to respond to your demand of "XXX me d00d".</font></p>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The bad news is that we need to bring the servers down for about an hour shortly to deal with some stability issues introduced with the last patch. It will be quick, but you know how we hate to bring them down for any reason outside the normal scheduled outage period.<BR>
The good news is that as part of this patch, we've fixed the "warp on flee" bug that plagues many areas of the game. In some zones, NPCs will warp-off somewhere when they turn to flee. They tend to come back at nearly full health, usually leading a nice train behind them. They'll no longer warp when fleeing.<BR>

It turns out that if the cleric tries to rez you while you are doing a variety of things, you can't get xp back.  Read it, and know it!  Make sure if you are expecting a rez that you aren't doing anything!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Unfortunately, this is the way resurrection works, and it's not considered a bug. If the resurrection doesn't go through on the first time for whatever reason (e.g. Zone, cancel, LD, etc.), the experience cannot be restored. <BR>
-Gordon<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I disagree with the behavior not being considered a bug. A res should give the exp, period. No, two reses should NOT give any more exp than one res.<BR>
I understand your opinion, however when making coding decisions, the programmers have to decide how many contingencies they are willing to trap. There are functions that you can perform in the game that account for all different kinds of things that can go wrong, such as everything that can go wrong in a trade. <BR>
<BR>
Resurrection is one of those things where not everything possible is trapped. It makes resurrection fairly black-and-white, but has the side-effect of missing them under certain circumstances. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>To my mind, one of the few benefits of being a necromancer, a troll warrior or an ogre shaman is that you can hunt the guards and other NPCs in a pinch.<BR>
Yet tonight I stood and watched a monk and a Dwarven paladin killing Halfling guards in Misty Thicket. Two days ago a druid was upset (and whining publicly) cause all the Halfling guards were camped.<BR>
<BR>
If the so-called goods can kill Halgling guards yet still retain enough faction to sell at town (and walk by the other guards to go clean the blood of their hands at the bank), where is the benefit to playing one of the evil races?<BR>
<BR>
Stats (except for INT, WIS and CHA) appear to mean very little, so we can pretty much discount that. The dark elves have infravision. Then again, their faction is actually BETTER than that of trolls and ogres. So... what are the pluses of being one of the "hated" races?
<BR><BR>

Gordon:
Well, for a tangible benefit, I've always found the ability to kill indiscriminately with my evil character quite refreshing. Though there are certainly some faction loopholes that allow "good" characters to kill "good" NPCs, they often have to search and find specific NPCs that don't hurt their faction, my character never really had to worry about that.<BR>
As far as intangible benefits go, I just like roleplaying an evil character. <BR>

The netmaster problem is acknowledged, but it's a bit tougher to fix. As a result, we have more netmasters spawning than we normally would, to cover for the suicides. We're still looking into this though.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Well I of course wouldn't be able to comment on any specific items, but I think that it's safe to say that loot will be appropriate to the level it is for. If that would in theory lead to some of it being better than what you have, since what you have is designed for a lower level.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Foulsbane said:<BR>
Abashi, is there a way to have the dragons/gods on a spawn timer, instead of being reset every time the server resets or is patched? On our server the same folks get to kill the same dragons and gods over and over because they are the only ones online during the day. Alot of us work days and NEVER even have a chance to set up a raid because by the time we log on the same guilds have already killed them. On the server I play on, Mith Marr, there is no chance in hell one of the uber guilds will "share" a dragon/god, let alone wait till those of us that work for a living to get on. <BR>
I'm not asking that all dragons/gods pop during primetime, like they do now during the day, but maybe one or two. Or actually have a somewhat set time, like once a week, where they will pop.<BR>
<BR>
Im going to keep bumping this till I get some type of response from verant/abashi. It just isnt right.....<BR>
<BR>
Abashi said:<BR>
Though we really can't do anything at present about the fact that they pop whenever the zone is restarted, they do have the opportunity to spawn at other times in the week, and on a random timer at that. Prior to last week, the servers went nearly a month without being patched, and each server spawned dragons several times during that period. <BR>
<BR>
People who are online most of their natural lives will probably always have an edge in fighting creatures such as that, but I don't think that other people are locked out of the opportunity.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>No one ever said that all items dropped by creature X would be carbon-copies of each other for all classes involved. This is true for Dragon Loot as well for common-drops. The critters in Kithicor drop a pretty nifty cleric item as I recall, and other classes aren't necessarily represented. That's just the way it is. Balanced != Identical<BR>
-Gordon<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;You wanna talk about balance Abashi? How about making Cleric platemail have armor class like like everyone elses platemail, instead of being less than banded classes. You have continually lied to us about it being in the "next patch". Meanwhile, 3 patches since you admitted it was wrong, my AC still sucks.<BR>
Actually I admitted 3 patches ago that it looked wrong and that we'd look into it. 2 patches ago I admited that it was fixed on test and would go live the next time we patched data. We haven't patched data since then.<BR>
<BR>
We should be patching data next week.<BR>

---------------------------<BR>
<BR>
***TODAY'S PATCH***<BR>
<BR>
This morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes to improve performance of the game engine in general.  No items, spawns, spells (with the exceptions below), etc., were changed as a result of this patch.  <BR>
<BR>
- Area Effect "Fear" spells will no longer work in PvP.  This affects a bard song, as well as the Cleric "Wave of Fear" spell.<BR>
- Corrected a bug with some of the Resurrection spells that caused them to return too little experience. <BR>
<BR>
We plan on publishing data and item changes next week if all goes well on the Test server.  We apologize to those who are inconvenienced by having to wait for the expected changes.<BR>

Okay... so I heard about it a while ago.  I hope this gets implemented soon.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Bards rule , i like my class alot and don't have anything wrong with it EXEPT one thing . ya know when you put inventory slots into hotbuttons and theres that gap between them? well you can drop junk down there and it makes switching weapons and instruments for bards a real hazardous thing to do <BR>
We're discussing ways to help remedy this situation, including possibly putting in a toggle that would allow people to have a confirmation box pop up prior to item-drop. It's too soon to comment on anything for certain, other than to say that we are aware of this issues and are working on it.<BR>

Abashi explained why:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Ok I KNOW this has been brought up before a long time ago but I thought I would bring it out agen because nothing seems to have happened. First of all if necromancers are masters of the dead then why do clerics get their ward undead series of spells well before any necromancer dose?<BR>
Because, though necromancers might be the Masters (read: slavedriver) of the undead, clerics are the masters of killing them. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also don't you think that a necromancer who has the power to summon a powerfull *well not so powerfull anymore* skelleton to help him fight from 2 bone chips be able to cast resurection at SOME lvl?<BR>
<BR>
Necro's are about death. Clerics are about life. That's the reason that a necromancer can summon a corpse, yet a cleric is required to resurrect it. Necro's would never get the ability to resurrect a corpse unless it had some really nasty downside.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I woulden't care if it took 10 bone chips for a necro to cast resurect<BR>
<BR>
Heheh, I'm sure you wouldn't :)<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><b>The Spider Room Incident......<b><BR>
<BR>
I stun and burn, watch them fall<BR>
My men all rally to my call<BR>
Spiders, gargoyles, frogs go down<BR>
King of undead, I wear my crown<BR>
Bloody battle aftermath<BR>
I could use a nice warm bath<BR>
Though no time to stop and think<BR>
Once again death is on the brink<BR>
Another pull and mana is low<BR>
Convince the group, take it slow<BR>
We finish up and sit to heal<BR>
We drink our ale and shine our steel<BR>
But look we up, a passer-by<BR>
In out midst he stopped and sighed<BR>
"help" he said with his last breath<BR>
Then he fell consumed by death<BR>
Around the corner came a fury<BR>
Minotaurs and icebones scurried<BR>
One by two they filled the room<BR>
Seemed we were to share this strangers doom<BR>
"Assist", "Assist", "Assist" I say<BR>
Yet at my feet a brother lay<BR>
The wave of enemies proved to much<BR>
Our band can not remain as such<BR>
The druid called the powers that be<BR>
The god of ocean, land, and tree<BR>
Through the flames appears a mystic gate<BR>
We step on through escaping fate<BR>
Across the world we did soar<BR>
Where once stood six, now stand four<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The current plan is to turn on the Expansion a couple of days max before commercial release (April 24th). <BR>
At this point I can't say when people will get their upgrades, but our intent is obviously before the 24th.<BR>

We've already started the downtime to upgrade our servers for the Expansion -- we are taking down approximately 2 servers each business day for a time, upgrading them, and then bringing them back online.<BR>

Here is an answer:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>About as specific as I can get at this point is that the EQ Live team will be revamping existing zones and then building some new ones. We still have the Hole coming, and then some zones after that (there's quite a few areas we can and hopefully will flesh out on Odus, Antonica, and Faydwer -- you can see them if you have any old maps about). <BR>
Beyond that? Lots of other EQ related stuff is coming, but it's too early to say much, unfortunately. Suffice it to say Verant and Sony are VERY committed to the EQ franchise and are in it for the long haul.<BR>
