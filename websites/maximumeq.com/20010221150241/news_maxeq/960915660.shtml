Some of you will recall that we made some changes to the druid root series a month or so ago that was supposed to make them function better. Though there was a bit of a placebo effect at the time where many agreed that they were working better, after a while it turned out that there wasn't a real difference. <BR>
The problem was that the damage being dealt by these spells would cause the spell itself to break. In the text window, the users of these spells would actually see the "wear off" message *before* the spell effect message. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, this is now fixed (really… we mean it this time :). Damaged caused by a damage dealing root spell no longer have a chance to break the root. This includes the entire druid root series, as well as the necromancer undead-only "Hungry Earth" spell. The fix is live on test and should go to the production servers in the next patch.<BR>

>>>Does Verant employ any professional consultants from any area like Psychology, Sociology, Psychiarty, etc to offer opinions on the matter?<BR>
</font>
Not specifically for that purpose. One of our game designers does have a degree in psychology, and most of our people have degrees, of which psychology and sociology classes are often included in the curriculum, but we don't purposely design for addiction, we design for excitement and fun, which are characteristics that some find addicting.<BR>
<BR>

>>>Does Verant plan to limit play time in any way, shape or form?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
No. We provide a persistent world where one can feel free to come and go as they please. It is in the end the responsibility of each player, whether an adult themselves, or whether the account was purchased by a responsible adult, to regulate their own playtime to what works for them.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
>>>Does Verant reccommend a certain play time limit for its players?<BR>
>>>Does Verant believe that there is such a thing as excessive play time?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
There is certainly such a thing as "excessive play time", but it's not a rigid value that we can set, but is more subjective in terms of each individual player. Certainly playtime becomes excessive when gameplay begins to interfere with responsibilities, every day life, and commitments to a job or family.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
>>>Has Verant received any complaints from parents of children that play EverQuest, or from players themselves regarding playtime?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Not to my knowledge, of course it wouldn't make much sense for parents of minor players to hold us responsible for a service that they pay for with their credit card. <BR>
<BR>
Just like television, sports, and computer usage in general, parents are ultimately responsible for the content to which they allow their children access. Though there are companies that specialize, for instance, in selling parental control that limit TV viewing times for children, no one really holds the TV networks at fault for sending out the signal 24/7. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, any activity that provides some form of fun, excitement, or stimulation can be taken to an extreme. "Games" by their nature provide those factors. Though we are certainly proud of the success of EverQuest and amount that people play and enjoy the game, we certainly do not want to see people hurting their families, careers, or other relationships over it. <BR>
<BR>
Please play responsibly.<BR>
