What Gordon has to say about this issue is probably the most inconsiderate and stupidest thing I've ever heard him say.<BR><BR>

Paladins, you have my sympathies.  I have never heard of a dragon raid without at least 1 paladin.  53+ Palys simply will not have access to the books :(</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Well, we haven't done anything to restrict level 53+ paladins from looting the items, so I wouldn't say that it's been placed out of reach. That said, we are going to discuss this issue further in our next tuning meeting.<BR><BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;You never once said we'd be punished for levelling beyond 50th<BR>
</font>
This is a special case. As I stated in the patch message, our goal was to avoid having to raise the bar for existing players. Had we been able to make no changes, and still have the result be that the 40s and low 50s were killing the dragons, we would have done so. However every week I've gotten more and more reports of high-50s folk coming in with a small number of people and besting the dragons. <BR>
<BR>
We still think that the lower level folks deserve a chance.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;After FoH killed Trakanon, we saw that he shared the same loot tables as Vox and Nagafen. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
No, he doesn't. I looked at the items that they got off of Trakanon, and they are certainly different than anything that has been found in game.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;It does not say that characters lvl 53 and over would be BANNED from Vox & Nagafen raids. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
Very true, and I'll let the players figure out exactly how it works. I still think that they'll be able to assist in some fashion or another, but it's not going to be the same old strategy.<BR>
