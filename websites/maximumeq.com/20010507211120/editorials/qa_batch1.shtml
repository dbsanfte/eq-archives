This is part of a series of questions that originated on the Gameplay forum
on the Official EverQuest web site directed at Brad McQuaid on Sunday April
2, 2000.  Brad offered to try and answer as many of them as he
could.<BR><BR>

<font color=white>Is it REALLY true that 2/3 of the quests in the game are
yet unfound, and there are 90 caster robes yet undiscovered?</font><BR>
**No. There are quite a few, but not that many.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Do you have plans to allow a command so pet classes can
be told the level of their pets?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Probably not, no - can't you roughly determine it's level anyway?<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will there ever be a message so we know if a rogue is
trying to pickpocket when he claims he is not?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Interesting idea - we'll toss it around.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why haven't you answered questions based on the many stat
tests players were told to perform by Verant? Specifically, when these test
results were posted why didn't you make an appearance?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I believe Abashi has addressed the stat issue several times.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Do you have an estimate on when or if the main storyline
of EQ will have an even stronger affect on the players as a whole in the
future? (GM Events, new quests introduced etc.)</font><BR>
<BR>
**I think this will happen over time as we do more GM Events and get more
static quests in the game (which often reveal the history of the
world).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Humans in EverQuest. What is the Vision(tm) on them and
what is their place in Norrath.</font><BR>
<BR>
**The intent was that they would be neither great nor poor at any one
thing. They have the most flexibility when it comes to class selection.
Their stats are fairly middle-of-the-road.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Apart from RP, What do the players get from selecting
Humans as their play choice (and getting mediocre stats and being night
blind)?</font><BR>
<BR>
**More class selection and one of races on the lower end of the experience
needed table.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Abashi hinted that there were class equivalent or near
equivalent weapons to the Fiery Avenger in EverQuest. Are there indeed
weapons which we haven't found yet (hard to believe) which involve quests
other than PoS alone (which can't be done until after the
expansion).</font><BR>
<BR>
**There are a few very powerful unfound items, yes. Fiery Avenger status
items, particle effects and all, are still coming for the other classes and
will take us some time.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I know you don't want to answer questions about the
future, but how about some hints on these new melee skills? I'm getting
quite jealous looking through the Kunark spell list in
Castersrealm.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Can't say yet, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What is this 'Vision' I keep hearing of. I have never
heard from your words exactly what the 'Vision' was intended to be. Not a
flame here, just a question.</font><BR>
<BR>
**It would probably take me pages to answer this properly, but in a
nutshell here goes: to recapture and recreate the fun people had grouping
together and going out on quests and adventure playing paper & pencil games
in an online virtual world; to create a successful, fun, and popular
graphical MUD.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can there be more Dynamic GM quests? </font><BR>
<BR>
**Indeed, and we hope to have more in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are JBOOTS, such an incredible item that it vastly
imbalance the game in outdoor areas, still in the game? Shouldn't this item
be made more available to everyone or just dropped?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We felt that after addressing the kiting issue some months ago, making it
not as abusable, that Jboots no longer 'vastly imbalanced' the game. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>In all seriousness.. I don't know how specific this
question is. but are dark elf clerics ever going to get any race and class
specific quests?</font> <BR>
<BR>
**I will ask about that.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why can't we bash with the Unicorn Shield? Any fix in the
near future?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I believe the shield is more of a weapon - 'fixing' it implies it is
broken in the first place, which I don't believe is accurate.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can someone please explain why the tests on stats are
incorrect? Our tests show a negligible impact on melee ability with their
use. Can you please post an example to demonstrate where we are going wrong
in our testing?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Some stats certainly have more of a direct impact on the game than
others. This is by design.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Would it be possible to attach a server designation to
each .opt file on our end so that when we play characters on different
servers, it doesn't use the same global file for hotkey assignments?
Whenever I play on another server, I have to redo my hotkeys every time
because each char name has only one .opt file irregardless of the
server.</font><BR>
<BR>
**It would be possible but would require a bit of programming and I'd
probably prioritize it fairly low, but we'll see what we can do.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>In the expansion, will there be any new classes available
for any of the existing races? i.e. like having Halfling bards or rangers?
(its a long shot I know but I had to try hehe)</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, just the new race.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Server crashes, item and exp loss from hardware failure
at Verant -- why is the burden on the players and not on Verant when this
happens?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. Both players and Verant are burdened when there is data
loss and neither of them are happy about such occurrences.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are more relaxed item and exp reimbursement policies
planned?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Not in general, no. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are monetary compensations like free 1 month playtime for
affected players feasible?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, data loss, albeit rare, is unavoidable at times. Compensation as you
describe would indeed not e feasible.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why would a mob that is obviously far, far tougher than
the con system have you believe actually be low blue. i.e.: why is that
guard that just kicked my ass not yellow or even?</font><BR>
<BR>
**The higher level you get, the more we expect you to be grouping. The
'con' system assumes, over time, that you are grouping more and more - it
does not necessarily assume you are alone. Also, the color is an indication
of the experience you will receive from killing the NPC, while the text is
supposed to indicate difficulty.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are there very few mobs in outdoor zones for people
40+ (aside from the nasty sorts like sea furies, etc...) is this to slow
people down once they get to level 40+?</font><BR>
<BR>
**While we'd like people to group more and more and to enter dungeons and
such at higher levels, we do agree that higher level outdoor areas are
needed and you will see several in Kunark, including a 40+ outdoor
zone.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will shaman ever be able to shrink in outdoor areas? i.e.
to fit in the bank in Kelethin</font><BR>
<BR>
**Unlikely. There are supposed to be size penalties in the game, depending
on the race you've chosen for your character. Over time, we've implemented
more and more ways to overcome the size restriction and I think we've gone
far enough.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What will it take for you to admit there may be need to
change the Vision(tm)?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Whenever something doesn't turn out the way we wanted, or whenever it did
but the desired effect failed to occur, we adjust the Vision™ (if it's
possible to do so). The Vision™ is both pure in its idealistic form and
flexible when it comes to what really works and doesn't work.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>EQ tuning is not by mob rule, I agree; but 99% of your
customer base are up in arms over the melee class bind issues (or lack
thereof). What will it take to break such an inflexible
vision(tm).</font><BR>
<BR>
**I definitely think your 99% number is greatly exaggerated. Changing
binding would change the pace of the game for both melee and caster
classes. It would also lessen the death penalty. We've no intention of
changing the binding rules.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>When is the HOLE going to open?</font><BR>
<BR>
**The Hole will open when we're done with it, which should be sometime in
May, we hope.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I think one of the craziest ideas I have ever had was to
develop some kind of in-zone game you can play that involves a ball or
spell aura that you pass around. Sort of a PvP event but I'm just talking
crazy here..... would be great for guild wars. People need something like
that to break from the norm, guess you could call it a
mini-game.</font><BR>
<BR>
**There are no plans currently to implement those sorts of mini-games.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What new skills will warriors get in the
expansion?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Can't say yet, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will the skill caps be raised with the
expansion?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Some will, yes.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why do the gnome guards in Steamfont punch me for 106hp
but when armed they would only be hitting in the 60's?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Guards are often very nasty, highly trained individuals that excel in
combat far above and beyond the average create in Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I have a question of the vision, well sort of, to
encourage more player interaction, why did you allow 8 slots? Why not limit
it to one slot per server? I think that would have helped a lot of the
issues we hear about now if that had been from the get go.</font><BR>
<BR>
**When designing EQ we had NO idea if we'd even have close to 8 servers.
The fact that we're at 28 now is mind-blowing. So with 12 races and 14
classes, we wanted to make sure players would have a chance to experience
at least most of the race/class combos, so we made it such that a player
can have 8 characters per server.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Also, can you expand a bit on why you don't like archery
or throwing weapons to be a viable class weapon?</font><BR>
<BR>
**EQ was designed to be a melee & magic based game. There is a reason in
real life that humanity switched over to range weapons when the technology
was developed to make them a reality: they're better. It's almost always
better to shoot at somebody from the distance than it is to get up close
and dirty. Knowing this, and knowing we wanted melee combat to be integral
to EQ, we designed archery and other forms of ranged combat to be secondary
in terms of how effective it is.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What are your 5 favorite musical groups?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Fates Warning, Dream Theater, Psychotic Waltz, Enchant, and Yngwie
Malmsteen.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What do melee stats do?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Affect the outcome of melee to varying degrees.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>IF poison is spell code why is the overhaul taking so
long. i.e. just up the dmg on them and give the vials charges, poison
fixed.</font><BR>
<BR>
**We don't want a simple fix, we really want to do it right.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I heard a rumor some time ago about an EQ movie, some
company that was working with final fantasy the movie I think.... but any
truth to this?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I hear the same rumors you do, but am unable to confirm or deny at this
point. It's not something that Verant is involved in.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>The simplest solution is to nerf but is that the right
solution?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Sometimes it is, yes. More complicated solutions, like enhancing every
other class and then upping the difficulty level of the game to compensate,
are very time consuming and prone to error.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why is it in almost all cases of gameplay tuning that you
"nerf" class / race abilities and spells?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question (and we don't).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>The average player impression is that there are way more
nerfs happening than there are class/race enhancements. So much so that we
get very paranoid on very patch and lose all sense humor during April
1.</font><BR>
<BR>
**I don't think that's true, and with all due respect I don't think you
speak for the 'average player'.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>When you created EQ, were you able to include the Entire
Vision, and is this expansion and all *possible* future expansions an
expansion of the vision? Or were you only able to program a very small
portion of the realm you envisioned?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We accomplished a great deal of our Vision for both gameplay and world
creation, but yeah, there's a TON of stuff we'd like to do in the future. I
think the long, long term goals of MMORPGs is to create holodeck
technology, and, well, we have a long way to go J<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What is the Vision as regards removing/replacing/rotating
items in EQ?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We need to do it more often. One of the reasons, I think, that people get
so upset when we alter the status quo is that they're used to things
staying the same. If the treasure in dungeons was removed, rotated, and
replaced more often not only would the game be better in terms of discovery
and exploration but also people wouldn't be so upset when something did
change.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Could you give us an example of a bug fix/feature that
was implemented via suggestions and logs sent in through /feedback and
/bug?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Feature: Messages letting the party know a member went link dead.<BR>
**Bug Fix: Randomly twirling around when using the /follow command.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is there any place we can go to find out what quests are
broken?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Not really, no. The problem there is that it would require listing the
quests, which we don't want to do because we don't want to post
spoilers.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Where you as pissed as I was when you found out you
weren't selected for beta testing Diablo II?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Who said I wasn't already in the Diablo II beta?<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Player disruption seems to be the major factor in GM
quests not working well. Are there any plans to address this issue? If so,
could elaborate on what those plans are I would appreciate it.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, and there are a couple of ways to make it better. First, involve
less people and announce events less. Second, create a storyline in which
players who try to disrupt aren't rewarded (perhaps even penalized). Third,
flat out make it against the rules to try to screw up and disrupt a GM
event and discipline accordingly (this is obviously the most controversial
of the plans, and we're still tossing the idea around).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can we look forward to more higher level class and race
specific quests (sort of like the Paineel ones) being added to existing
cities relatively soon?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, depending on your definition of 'relatively soon'.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will the Expansion CD contain a few fixes to things
considered to be too big to download, say like the barbarian shield
issue?</font><BR>
<BR>
**As a matter of fact, yes. The barbarian shield problem should be fixed
via the Expansion, and other similar problems can hopefully be addressed in
the future thanks to some new coding we've worked on that should allow us
to fix some of those problems sans a huge download.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is the wizard class the way you envisioned it in group
usefulness and effectiveness not in regards to paper stats but in in-game
real-time situations of level 50 players? If the answer is no, will it ever
be?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Roughly, yes. They're not perfect, but then neither is any other class,
nor the game for that matter.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I have read (not sure if it is real) that you requested
GZ to do some tests on the class for in-game time Vs Damage compared to
other classes is this true?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, he's agreed to run some tests after he's finished working on new
spells for the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Stats in EQ and why the stonewall from Verant? Why are
stats details (like how they affect/enhance the character you create)
veiled in such secrecy?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Because we feel revealing the inner working of stats and other core game
mechanics spoil much of the game.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is it that they do not work in any measurable degree and
are broken?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, they are not broken. Yes, some stats have a more measurable and
direct influence on the game than others. This is by design.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is the game manual misleading in its description of char
stats?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Unfortunately, it is inaccurate in some aspects, yes.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Do you believe druids to be currently balanced as a
class, or are they overpowered in your estimation? If not, do you have any
future nerfs for this class under consideration?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We feel they are fairly balanced at this point.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What does the 'MAGIC ITEM' tag really mean? For boots and
gloves and shoulder pieces it means you can kick, punch, and slam
magically, and rogues cant pickpocket it. I always thought it meant the
item had stats, but a few things like the molten cloak have stats but
aren't magic.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Generically, it means that it's special treasure and not mundane. Beyond
that, it can also mean being able to hit 'magic' creatures, as you
described.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why doesn't Dead Man Floating (level 44 necro spell) work
in Kedge Keep? This is the perfect use for it but you can't cast it
inside.</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'm pretty sure that's a bug and on our bug list.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why does a person's health go down when they go link
dead? It seems like it drops to their unbuffed hps and then comes back up
when they come back. Always thought this was strange and just
wondered.</font><BR>
<BR>
**When you become link dead the server takes control of your character and
you are in many ways an NPC and treated as such.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why can't you automatically meditate? Why do you have to
push the button every time for it to work? Is there any chance it could be
changed to default on? Because I don't know anyone who wouldn't want to be
medding if they had the skill.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Good question - we'll think on it.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why isn't run on by default? I don't know anyone who
walks through EverQuest.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Another good question - we'll think on it.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can you fix pronouns in emotes? For example if you type
/drool without anyone targeted it says '<name> drools -- something must
have $#%&^%$ excited!'</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'd like to, yes, but it would be fairly low priority.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can you get faction without getting a faction
message</font><BR>
<BR>
**I don't believe so, no.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why can't I remove one item from a bag in the bank,
instead of having to remove the entire bag?</font><BR>
<BR>
**That's simply a feature we never coded - I'm certainly not against such
functionality, but would probably prioritize it fairly low.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why is it that we (Paladin) are only given slow (but
good, not complaining about QUALITY) weapons? (e.g., why make FA 34/44, but
not 17/22?)</font><BR>
<BR>
**I don't know if that's true across the board, but it's probably true that
our vision of a Paladin is a mighty knight, clad in plate armor, wielding a
really, really big sword.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>If faeries are a good race, why is it that paladin's
killing them seems to be appropriate to Verant (e.g., Ro armor quest, FA
quest, Princess Lenya quest)?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Many Paladin quests are set up to create a moral dilemma for the Paladin
who RP's.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>How would you rate, on a scale of 1 to 10, the variation
in new graphics for the Expansion? You know what I mean, will there be a
multitude of new robes for casters, armor for fighters, etc. or are you
following a similar routine as with the class specific quests: i.e., will
it look like plate mail but basically just have a different color tint to
it.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Most of our effort went into creating new zones to explore, not creating
a ton of new item graphics. We are planning on adding some though.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>One more question off topic Brad -- have you and Hook
raced your cars yet? Who would/did win?</font><BR>
<BR>
**He won't go to a real track with me, and I sure as heck wouldn't drag
race him.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are basic fundamentals of character creation, such as
stats and exp tables, not given clearer information on?</font><BR>
<BR>
**To preserve a sense of mystery and exploration in the game.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why was poison nerfed so HORRIBLY with a 7 second apply
time "in anticipation of an upgrade" almost a month ago, and yet poison is
not slated to get work until after expansion?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We'd hoped to have the Poison upgrade complete by now, but were delayed
by the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why has GZ been allowed to discuss at length what stats
do for casters, but no such information has been given to melee
classes?</font><BR>
<BR>
**In hindsight GZ would probably agree with me that he's revealed too much
over time.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What level is you ranger at, Brad?</font><BR>
<BR>
**In his mid 20s - I just haven't been able to play as much, and when I do
it's usually using test characters on Kunark L<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Do you think having ONLY static encounters with static
mobs as the method of loot distribution may have been a mistake? i.e. 'we
should have had more loot dispersal methods to begin with"</font><BR>
<BR>
**Probably, yes, to a point. We are experimenting with more randomization
of loot in the Expansion and I hope it works out. That said, I remain
against total randomization of loot in that one loses the ability to
provide context for an item (e.g. the Iron Crown of the Fire Giant Warlord
should probably be found on the corpse of the Fire Giant Warlord).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Would it be possible to allow Rangers to target track?
i.e. type /track hill giant and they track nearest HG.</font><BR>
<BR>
**That would be a neat enhancement. We do want to enhance tracking in the
future, but have no short term plans to do so.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What was the original vision for the rogue, and what is
the vision for the rogue now?</font><BR>
<BR>
**The original version included their ability to detect and disarm traps,
but it turned out we couldn't get traps working correctly with our engine
such that they were truly a challenge and hindrance. Also, upon reflection,
we should have had more locked doors and therefore more interdependence
between rogues and other classes when dungeon adventuring. We hope to
address the latter issue in the Expansion, but traps just aren't really
doable. So, in a nutshell, our vision for Rogues has changed somewhat, but
we feel they will continue to improve in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I don't understand Verant's Concept of good and evil in
EQ, and am often baffled by certain quests. What races are good, and what
races are evil? (I mean orc, fairies, fish, etc..not elfs,
humans....)</font><BR>
<BR>
**Morality is supposed to be more relative than absolute in the world of
Norrath, hence the faction system as opposed to a more simplistic alignment
system. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Do you think EQ has evolved into more of a straight
hack-n-slash than an RPG? I personally know many players who feel the game
mechanics themselves actively discourage role-playing.</font><BR>
<BR>
**No. EQ was always supposed to be a more adventure oriented RPG.
Role-playing, in our opinion, is up to the player, and we feel we've
provided many tools to help the player role-play. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there any plans to add quest-able Armour sets for the
monk and druid classes?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Rough, general plans, but nothing specific that I could announce.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>EverQuest gameplay and the need for secrecy. How do we
know if it's a bug and not a feature?</font><BR>
<BR>
**You can't always, but usually it's fairly clear. Typically, anything that
gives a player a significant and unbalancing advantage in terms of
advancement is a bug and not a feature.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Any changes at all to Alchemy planned?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We're pretty happy with Alchemy as of this last upgrade and have no short
term plans to upgrade that particular trade skill.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I would like to hear what the original "vision" of
character stats was, and in what ways the current implementation varies
from the original vision, and *what* the current implementation
is?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I think the original vision was that the stats that currently affect the
game less would do so more. But it didn't turn out that way as we balanced
and as the game evolved during beta, and it would require very unbalancing
and major changes to make them 'matter more'. The current implementation is
that some stats affect the game significantly moreso than others. This is
by design.<BR>
