<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Every change takes work, it's just a question of how much work and whether or not the benefits of the change are worth diverting the manpower from other things that they could be working on, and whether the suggested changes are consistant with the game world.<BR>
<BR>
I think that the suggestion does meet the "consistant with the game world" qualification, but am not sure that it would apply well to the others. Guilds do not currently exist as an entity, but rather as an entry within each character file. In order to implement this, guilds would have to be converted to be an entity all their own. Secondly, restrictions for nodrop and lore items would have to be implemented in ways that would only apply to guild banks.<BR>
<BR>
It's not just work, but a substantial amount of manpower that's probably better served elsewhere at present. We won't rule it out completely though.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Combineable container retraction">Combineable container retraction</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/29/00 12:43 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Gordon reversed his statement about making items in containers with a combine button going poof after logging/LD.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
The original thread on the Partisan pack shifted later to a topic about combinable containers in general. I wanted to separate out the two issues and discuss them individually. I've started a separate thread on the issue concerning the unannounced change of the partisan pack, which is a bag given by an NPC for the purpose of completing a quest. <BR>
<BR>
In this thread I'd like to discuss my comments where I said:<BR>
<BR>
"Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then."<BR>
<BR>
After reviewing this post that I made earlier, I do agree that it appears to be a threat when viewed out-of-context, and understand the general reaction that followed. The point of the post was to respond to multiple posts from people earlier in the thread who had no idea that they shouldn't use combinable containers, particularly free bags given by NPCs to complete quests, for general item storage.<BR>
<BR>
I'd thought that the number of people using the bags for this purpose were the exception rather than the rule, an observation that was apparently mistaken given public response to my post. Given that public response, we won't be taking any steps to "destroy" items in combinable containers upon logout or linkdeath.<BR>
<BR>
I do apologize for the way my response was phrased and hope everyone understands that neither I nor other members of the tuning team actively seek out ways to make the lives of the players more difficult. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
On Wednesday August 30th, we will be conducting maintenance on our Chat and Log-In server from 8 AM to 12 PM PST (11 AM to 3 PM EST). Unfortunately, you will not be able to log into EverQuest during this period, but if you are already logged-in and playing on a server, you will be able to continue playing as long as you do not exit the Character Select Screen. <BR>
