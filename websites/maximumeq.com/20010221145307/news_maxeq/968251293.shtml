The blue resist message makes doing some things very difficult.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Previously, colors for spell resist messages were set by the server. When Rowyl began separating the various classes of messages, the resist messages were added to the "spell messages" class, which is why they now have adopted that color.<BR>
The next version of customizable colors will differentiate between spell resist and other spell messages, so you'll be able to set them individually.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Trolls and Ogres balanced">Trolls and Ogres balanced</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/21/00 12:41 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I didn't realize that Ogre's can't be stunned from the front.  Interesting.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;So what I am proposing is, that Trolls have a larger set of racial abilities and hence Ogres are not in balance. Especially when regen is factored in, which makes soloing more practical.<BR>
As other people have mentioned here, ogres also cannot be stunned from the front. Strength and stamina is also significantly higher than in trolls. Troll stats are more in line with the barbarian in that regard. Finally, it's fairly well known that trolls require more experience to level than ogres. As mentioned in the FAQ, though differing experience requirements can't be traded directly for primary balance components, they do help buffer things such as racial abilities.<BR>
