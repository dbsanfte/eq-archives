<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Please let me know if Iskars not being able to wear plate armor is intended? What is the point of making an Iksar Warrior if I cant wear plate. Maybe they have an inate defense for AC, but most all the stat based armor that would benefit a warrior is plate based. Please shed some light on this.<BR>
</font>
Please keep in mind that thousands of items have been put in along with the expansion. You shouldn't have a problem coming up with eqivalent armor sets for your Iksar.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there a place to read up on Iksar... what they can and cannot wear and why ?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
You can get some information out of the History of Norrath section included in the manual that is available for download on the Kunark website at www.everquest.com/kunark. <BR>
<BR>
As for why they can't wear plate, it chafes their scales <BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am only 30 at alchemy, but have looked thorugh many of the potions. The only thing that I can make to sell so far is a SOW potion. No one wants to buy those stat potions that raise 2 stats 5 and drop one 5 for 10 to 12 plat. I noticed the regen potion will cost about 50pp to make. Don't think too many people will give me 75pp for 1 regen. Seems that alchemy could use a little revamping.<BR>
</font>
We'll be able to start taking a look at these costs after things calm down a bit from the expansion rush. It sounds like some of the stuff is still a bit too expensive.<BR>

Even if you die from a bug, get a corpse stuck in a wall, etc, you can't ask a GM for assistance in this very high level zone.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Just for a bit of clarification, back when the planes were brought online, John Smedley commented that people just don't die in planes, they die hard. Veeshan's Peak makes the planes look easy. There exists a non-negligible chance that not only will you die there, but you might not be able to raise the necessary forces to allow recovery of your corpse. It is *very* dangerous. <BR>
In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety in the zone, as sometimes follows when we've assisted in corpse recoveries in other zones due to claimed bug-deaths, we're not going to risk that for Veeshan's Peak. Veeshan's Peak is incredibly dangerous, and in order to guarantee that everyone is operating under the same set of conditions, we've elected to make the zone "enter at your own risk". <BR>
<BR>
That said, there are no known bugs in the zone that would cause the death of a character, and it was tested extensively in the Ruins of Kunark beta. We will certainly investigate and eliminate any bugs that are reported, but we won't be reimbursing items or experience, nor will we be moving corpses or people within the zone.<BR>
<BR>
-Gordon
<BR><BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Should you not put this in a patch message?<BR>
</font>
Probably not. There are people that purposely avoid the message boards and news sites due to their desire to discover everything on their own. I don't want to put up a patch message that "forces" them to view the info. Also, we usually don't put up patch messages for info that only affects a very small number of players, in this case the top 10% or so. <BR>
<BR>
I expect that the info will spread to those concerned anecdotally prior to anyone entering the zone. There is also sufficient in-character warning in-game about this as well.<BR>
<BR>
I’ll give it some more thought though. <BR>

I guess if Garn becomes a wizard on me, I'll have to watch his hit points a little better :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Up until the level 50+ pet spells, all pets were based off of warriors. We now have the ability to base pets off of other classes, and that's what's been done here. There are now rogue pets, wizard pets, and monk pets, which represent additional abilities for the pet-users above 50th level.<BR>
<BR>
Rogues need not worry that a backstabbing pet somehow reduces the desirability of their class. First, the pet does not have the backstab skill that a rogue of that level would have, so they won't hit as often nor will they do as much damage. Furthermore, they don't have all of the stat bonuses that increase the rogues effectiveness. Certainly they can be buffed up, but they'll never come close to having a real rogue. Finally, rogue pets will never have the ability to double-backstab as rogues do.<BR>
<BR>
Rogue pets won't be picking locks either, and there are quite a few places to do that in Kunark.<BR><BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The city governments have been enacting leash laws lately to try and curb the number of strays running wild through the cities. Wolves that aren't on leashes (e.g. a pet) will be attacked and killed on site by many of the guards. <BR>
That’s an RP reason anyway and I thought some might get a kick out of it <BR>
<BR>
OOC:<BR>
<BR>
Most NPCs were viewing a druid in wolf-form as a BetaNeutral NPC, instead of as a wolf. This was fixed a few weeks ago in many of the cities, and should have been in the patch message.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;All of the new skill caps are still under what is acheivable by a level 50 character. So my question is do you need to buy Kunark in order to have higher skill caps?<BR>
Skill cap changes are associated with level, and only affect the 50+ game. In other words, a warrior who maxes a skill out at 40 won't have a chance to raise it more until level 51. So, yes, you need to buy Kunark (and level above 50) to get an increase in your skill caps.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Melee Discipline Balance">Melee Discipline Balance</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/26/00 09:39 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Some of the new disciplines sound very interesting.  Gordon explains why they were done the way they were.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;1) why are most of the durations 9-18 seconds?<BR>
</font>
Disciplines without a downside have a short duration for balance reasons. Some of the warrior disciplines have upsides and downsides, and thus have a longer duration<BR>
<BR>
Most of the short duration disciplins allow you to do something dramatic that drastically increases your effectiveness. The short period of time is necessary for balance.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;2) since the durations are so short why are the refresh times so long?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Balance again. Some of them are so powerful that we don't want them available constantly. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;3) why are all the disciplines on the same refresh timer?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
See balance  Bascially /discipline is one ability, though there are different types of disciplines available. We basically didn't want a discipline to *always* be available. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;what range is the reduction in refresh time as a player advances in levels? 1%/level 5%/level 10%/level?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Generally 1 minute per level.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm just looking for some general answers. Originally I thought disciplines would be extremely powerful...but if a monk who uses Ashenhand can't use another discipline for 72 minutes...or a warrior who uses Mighty Blow can't use another for 60 minutes...UGH! Just would like to know why. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
Though they aren't equivalent to LoH or Harm Touch, these are two very powerful disciplines that can be used for one encounter. Please remember that warriors, rogues, and monks are considered essentially well-balanced without these disciplines, and as such they are something extra. We have to be careful when giving extra abilities to insure that they don't "overpower" the class.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The skill level associated with taunt interacts with your level to determine how likely the taunt is to be successful. It does not control the level of success. A successful taunt will *always* make the creature shift to you, assuming that it can be taunted (Yes, some creatures are untauntable).<BR>
Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list. In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra. <BR>
<BR>
I hope that clears up how Taunt works.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Warrior HP after 50">Warrior HP after 50</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/26/00 09:31 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>What Gordon says makes sense, but we needed someone to explain it to us.  Nobody has exactly made level 54 yet :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Number of hitpoints gained per level is assigned on the basis of race, class, and a multiplier based upon level. The multiplier increases in steps every X (where X is a value based upon race and class) levels. When someone hits a level where the value of X is increased above that of the previous level, the character will experience a HP "pop" over that that they usually receive. This in essence "makes up" for all the extra hitpoints they would have received if the multiplier was that way all along.<BR>
The Palys, SKs, and Bards all hit a step of that sort at 51, causing some of them to get upwards of 100 HP for the level. This doesn't mean that they are getting 100HP per level, just that for that level the number of hitpoints received "made up" for the hitpoints they would have gotten if the multiplier had always been at that level.<BR>
<BR>
Warriors operate on a different schedule than SKs and Palys, but the curve will always favor them. For instance, warriors should see a fairly substantial hitpoint pop when they hit 54.<BR>
<BR>
It's important to remember that 51 to 60 is not considered a "new" game. What I mean by this is that algorithms that take level into account and improve something every Y levels don't start over at 50+, they continue from where they left off. For instance, if someone has an attribute that improves in effectiveness every 4 levels, and his last improvement was at level 48, he won't see the next one until 52. This might make it appear that someone else who gets an improvement every 10 levels, and got their last improvement at 41, and gets their next one at 51 somehow gets something before the first guy. It's not the case, it's just the way that the math works.<BR>
<BR>
I hope I haven't confused the issue further <BR>

With a high level cleric as my main character, "Attack" isn't exactly on my main panel of hotkeys :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
With the creation of the new buttons on the Combat menu Splitting up Melee Attack into Melee 1 and Melee 2, and moving Range Attack to the next row, my Range Attack has disappeared.<BR>
On my monk, this is my Mend buttons, on my Warrior it is Taunt, and it is Bind Wounds on most other classes. Frankly, because it was the third button, I used it on every character I created, which now means that my characters, none of them, can use a ranged weapon.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
This is an art bug that was apparently introduced in the past day or so under the combat-skills menu. The buttons still function appropriately, its just that the names are being displayed improperly. The fix for this shouldn't take long.<BR>

Don't forget, any new appearance that would be given to level 51+ mages would have to still be visible under the lower system requirements of the base EQ install.</font></p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I like the new abilites, but I am extreemly disapointed with the appearnce. You gave necros, Specter-ish pets, which look cool btw, why couldn't you have upgraded ours? <BR>
</font>
As we've mentioned before, pet models are limited to what can go in a global file. Spectre pets required one model be put in the Global. It was an undead critter that we figured had a high "coolness" factor. Mages on the other hand have 4 pets, which would require a lot more space to do some kind of visual upgrade to them. Furthermore, as mages summon elementals, there really aren't any other elemental models floating around game, and the djinn in the Plane of Sky is a bit of a stretch. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello All,<BR>
<BR>
Due to the unfortunate problems we have had with our order processing system, it doesn't look like every person that ordered Kunark will receive it in a timely fashion. We sincerely apologize for this unanticipated problem. We expect that roughly 90% of the people who ordered will be receiving their orders by today.<BR>
Because of the problems we have had we will be refunding anyone who ordered Ruins of Kunark on or before Wednesday April 19th and does not receive their orders by today for their shipping costs, as well as crediting their accounts for one month of gameplay. This applies to International orders as well. <BR>
<BR>
We'll be taking care of these refunds via email at kunarkrefund@verant.com, and it will be necessary for anyone that wants to take advantage of this refund to send us your Station Name, billing name and address on the account and the date you placed the order. Please also include "Kunark Refund" in the subject line. <BR>
<BR>
We are very sorry for the problems that have come up.<BR>
<BR>
The EverQuest Team</font></p>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Field of Bones problem">Field of Bones problem</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/25/00 11:24 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Apparently there is a problem with one of the new zones in Kunark, named "Field of Bones".  Read below for more info.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font colr="white">
Here is the scenario: When I zone into the Field of Bone from the Iksar town, I cant see myself on the screen, I cant turn, cant change my view. If I taunt a mob or check my inventory, the game crashes to my desktop. Other players say I am crouching... I hit D to uncrouch and still the same problem. If I attack, it says im sitting. So I stand and the problem still persists.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
We've received the reports of this issue. It's being caused by a problem with one of the Field of bone files in your EverQuest directory. For some reason the patch server isn't detecting the problem and repatching it. We're not sure which file it is yet, as all of our systems here are working fine, but when we do find out we'll let you know right away.<BR>
If anyone who's having this problem would care to assist, you can try deleting one of the field of bone files, repatching, then seeing if it works. If it doesn't, delete another and repeat. We don't want to recommend that everyone delete all of the files as they total over 9MB.<BR>
<BR>
As soon as we get it narrowed down, we'll let you know and also fix the patch server.<BR>
<BR>
