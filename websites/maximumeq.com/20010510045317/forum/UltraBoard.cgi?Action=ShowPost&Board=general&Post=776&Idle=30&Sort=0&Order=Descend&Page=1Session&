 Ok. I'm back. I got my pizza on a plate on top of my computer subwoofer, my WINAMP is playing my music list starting with some Creed, I got a glass of soda, and it's time to get to work. I hope you're ready, because we're going in.<p>

1. The Background<br>
 All right. The game Everquest takes place in the world of Norrath, a world several millenia old. I'm not going to bother going into a lot of detail in the history right now, I'll leave that up to the good folks at Verant Entertainment and Sony at   www.everquest.com   because they do it so much better than I do. It is important to know that, while humanity does exsist on Norrath, it's not taken over the entire world like it has in most fantasy. In fact, compared to some races like the Erudites and the Elves, the Humans are reasonably weak. However their versatility is helping them survive and thrive.<p>

 2. The Races<br>
 2.a Humans<br>
 Humanity is as Norrath as it is on the real world, averaging about 5'8" in height and 150-170 lbs weight. Humanity, while it does not have any obvious bonuses, like the demihumans ability to see in low and dark lights, or extreme strength, or incredible dexterity, they do posess a versatility that none of the other races can match, the ability to adapt to strange and difficult surroundings. Thus they are able to become almost any of the player classes except the Shaman.<br>
 Classes: Any but Shaman<br>
 Starting City(s): Freeport, Qeynos<p>

 2.b Wood Elves<br>
 Wood Elves make their home in the high treetop city of Kelethin. They are lithe and agile, and make incredible scouts, rogues, and fast and agile fighters. But they are not very strong, nor impressively hardy. They seem to find a true calling in becoming rangers and druids, and many of the adventuring Wood Elves you will find will be one of these two classes. <br>
 Classes: Bard, Druid, Rogue, Ranger, Warrior<br>
 Starting City: Kelethin<p>

 2.c High Elves<br>
 The High Elves are similar in aspect to their Wood Elf cousins, but are much more intellectual. They lean more towards the Cleric and Enchanter classes than many others I have noted, and to quote a book I am fond of: "Elves are incredibly beautiful creatures who dwell mainly in the Forest of Faydark. Exquisite, lovely, skilled in archery, fleet of foot, stern of mien, steeped in magic, the entire tribe has the collective intelligence of lettuce and the personality of a damp biscuit." (Dear readers who actually play elves, I do not make this assumption simply because you are elves, I make it because of the simple idiocies I've noticed of the elves.... for instance, what elf in their right mind would live so close to a hardened orcish fortess-city like Crushbone? I mean I have watched incredibly skilled archers fire off the highest point in Kelethin and hit a orc center head. And the orc was sleeping in his own camp at the time.)<p>

 2.d Dark Elves (Teir'Dal)<br>
 The Dark Elves live underground, in the city of Neriak, and devote themselves to worship of dark gods and evil powers. Accordingly, while they are physically and mentally quite similar to the other two tribes of Elves, their evil bent allows them to take up the darker classes of Shadow Knights and Necromancers, and they seem to have quite a bit of aptitude as Rogues and Clerics. Indeed, a experienced Dark Elf Necromancer is a frightening thing to watch.<br>
 Classes: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, Wizard<br>
 Starting City: Neriak<p>

 2.e Erudites<br>
 The Erudites are spellcasters first, last, and foremost. They have almost totally foregone physical practice and training to a man for improvement of their admittedly incredible mental skills. They are socialites as well, excelling and delighting in social contact and discourse, as well as believing themselves to be the most highly evloved race on Norrath. However, the Erudites have recently developed a schism in their ranks, due to a group of spellcasters taking up the forbidden art of Necromancy, who were then thrust out of the city. They now make their home a short way to the south of Erudin, in a system of caves and buildings named the city of Paineel.<br>
 Classes: Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Wizard<br>
 Starting City(s): Erudin, Paineel<p>

 2.f Barbarians<br>
 The Barbarians are a proud people, living far to the North in the frozen mountains of Everfrost Peaks. They are generally quite friendly, however, they are also quite warlike. Their entire history is based around usually one war or another, and they pride themselves on always being ready for the next great conflict. A point of pride for the Barbarians, and a point of some small comedy amongst the other good races, is that the Barbarians are the only good races that still uses the Shaman class.<br>
 Classes: Rogue, Warrior, Shaman<br>
 Starting City: Halas<p>

 2.g Half-Elves<br>
 Being a half-breed in Norrath is not as bad nor socially demeaning as it is in other parts of fantasy. In fact, the half-elf plays a vital part in Norrathian society, being able to draw upon their human ancestry for a moderately larger body size than a normal elf and the corresponding strength and stamina, and their elven parentage for a more knowledgeable mind. They combine all of the good things about elves and humans, dilute them a little, and then as the only one downside they have as I see, they are regulated to only a few classes. However, out of those, they seem to excel at the Bardic and Roguish classes best.<br>
 Classes: Bard, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior<br>
 Starting City(s): Kelethin, Freeport, Qeynos<p>

 2.h Gnomes<br>
 The Gnomes of Norrath live on the same continent as the Elves and the Dwarves, in a mecha-magical town named Ak'Anon. The average gnomes is perhaps 3" tall, and has a wide range of skills and abilites open to him.<br>
 My personal experiments and experience with Gnomes leads me to believe that they are neither drawn nor pushed to any of their jobs, indeed, they seem equally adept at any task they face. I have seen Gnomish warriors as deadly as giant Ogre warriors, and seen a Gnomish wizard face down a equally powered Dark Elf wizard... they seem to have a excellent range of skills and abilities without sacrificing anything... except height. ::grins:: The rarest type of Gnome seems to be the Rogue.<br>
 Classes:Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Warrior, Wizard<br>
 Starting City: Ak'Anon<p>

 2.i Dwarves<br>
 Dwarves are short, sturdy, dextrous beings who live underground, in the city of Kaladim. They excel in the few chosen crafts they follow, and are almost totally nonmagical, preferring to work on their faiths instead of their spells. However, ths has served them well, as they have produced some of the finest paladins and clerics in the world.<br>
 Classes: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior<br>
 Starting City: Kaladim<p>

 2.j Halflings<br>
 Halflings are tiny (perhaps 3" tall, perhaps), mobile beings, closely resembling small human children at a distance, except for the simple fact they will not wear shoes nor sandals, because of a large patch of fur-like hair covering their feet. The Halfling is a natural wanderer and scout, and so have made peace with almost every race on Norrath. They have also perfected the art of Roguish behavior to a art form. However do not let their seemingly innocent behavior fool you, the Halflings have in their ranks some extremely powerful and deadly warriors.<br>
 Classes: Rogue, Druid, Cleric, Warrior<br>
 Starting City: Rivervale<p>

 2.k Trolls<br>
 Trolls are huge monstrous beings with a history of eating any meats they get their hands on, including that of the other intelligent races, and worshipping dark gods as well. They are horribly unintelligent, but much more wise than one would naturally give them credit for, much more so than their Ogrish brethren. A Troll Shaman is a frightening sight, hardy, strong, devoted to war, and able to bring the powers of the spirits to aid his friends and harm his enemies.<br>
 Classes: Shaman, ShadowKnight, Warrior<br>
 Starting City: Grobb<p>

 2.l Ogres<br>
 Ogres are dumb as rocks. Their entire life would be happily spent living in the Feerott jungles munching on whatever game and innocent travelers came their way if the assorted evil gods, dark powers, and malign forces arrayed around the world would just leave them alone... but as it stands, the Greenbloods (the Shadowknight guild) and the Crakneks (the Warrior guild) are at odds all the time, usually resulting in inner combat between the two. Thankfully, this has weeded out a lot of the Ogres. Unfortunately, the ones who have survived are, to put it bluntly, lethal. Do Not Get In Their Path.<br>
 Classes: Shaman, ShadowKnight, Warrior<br>
 Starting City: Ogguk<p>

 2.m Iskar<br>
 The Iskar are a tribal race, closely resembling the Mayans or perhaps some of the earlier American Indian tribes, or perhaps the Mongols without the nomadic habits. Highly intelligent, strong, large, and while perhaps not all evil, bent towards conquest and war, the Iskar pose a definite threat to anything that stands between them and their goals. What makes them even more frightening is their religious bent. They are quite holy, to whatever gods they worship, and the gods smile on them for it. But perhaps the most frightening thing about the Iskar is that they are the only other race on the world who have upheld the art of the Monk alongside the Humans. It has been said that a well trained Iskar Monk is one of the most deadly things you can encounter. I am one of them, having encountered only one so far, whom I was luckily able to defeat. However... I was obliged to find a dark corner after the combat and have a nice lie down for about a half a hour to stop the shakes.<br>
 Classes: Shaman, Necromancer, ShadowKnight, Monk, Warrior<br>
 Starting City: New Sebilis<p>

 3: The Classes<p>

 3.a Bard<br>
 A Bard is a musician whose songs inspire magical effects. These can be from shielding and strengthening his friends in combat, to clouding his opponents view so his group may slip past unharmed. He is able to use some weaponry, but his focus is his songs.<br>
 Modifiers: +5 Str, +10 Dex, +10 Cha<p>

 3.b Cleric<br>
 The Cleric is a holy man, blessed by his god with the ability to heal and protect his allies. He is also imbued with the ability to banish undead back to a more peaceful rest through his connection with his god.<br>
 Modifiers: +5 Str, +5 Sta, +10 Wis<p>

 3.c Druid<br>
 A Druid is like a Cleric in that he worships a god for his holy powers, however his powers are more focused towards the powers and abilities of Nature. Plants and animals bend to his requests, helping him defeat much stronger opponents than he normally would. He is also able to teleport his group around after he reaches a certain level.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Sta, +10 Wis<p>

 3.d Enchanter<br>
 A Enchanter enchants things. This might sounds simple in theory, but is quite powerful in effect. They can enchant blades for power, enchant people to move and think faster or slower, and charm beings and creatures totally, turning them to their own ends. They have some basic skill as well at combat spells.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Int, +10 Cha<p>

 3.e Magician<br>
 The Magician is the summoner of the arts. He can summon everything, it seems to most people... food, water, bandages, arrows and stones for ammunition, and when he is threatened, huge, powerful elementals to do his bidding. They are not as offensively strong as a Wizard, they are quite powerful in their own right.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Sta, +10 Int<p>

 3.f Monk<br>
 The Monk is the martial artist, striving to perfect his mind, body, and soul, and thus forge it into the perfect weapon. Those who reach this point are considered some of the most incredible, and deadly, fighters in the world, able to mend their own wounds simply by thinking about them, able to fall from heights that would kill any normal being, and able to bring down monsters much more powerful than she, through a combination of powerful attacks and blessings from the gods.<br>
 Modifiers: +5 Str, +5 Sta, +10 Agi, +10 Dex<p>

 3.g Necromancer<br>
 The Necromancer studies death. Most have turned to dark gods imploring them for knowledge about the act of death, and some have simply stuided it untilt he learned about it... no matter where they gained their information, they are able to raise the dead to fight for them, cast offensive spells against their targets to steal their life away, and eventually study their deaths as well, learning more from the act...<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Dex, +10 Int<p>

 3.h Paladin<br>
 A Paladin is a holy knight, skilled in combat, blessed by a god with some of the Clerical powers of healing and protection, and gifted with the special ability to Lay On Hands upon a wounded target to heal them almost completely.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Str, +10 Cha, +5 Sta, +5 Wis<p>

 3.i Ranger<br>
 A Ranger is a wilderness fighter as at home amongst the trees or the scrublands as in his own home. He studies the way of combat as well as learning some of a Druid's rapport with Nature.<br>
 Modifiers: +5 Str, +10 Sta, +10 Agi, +5 Wis<p>

 3.j Rogue<br>
 Not quite a asassin, not quite just a thief, a Rogue takes all these aspects and more and makes them his own. Picking Pockets, Lock Picking are but two of his fortes, along with the ability to manuever behind his opponent and Backstab him, in some cases slaying instantly.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Dex, +10 Agi<p>

 3.k Shadow Knight<br>
 The Shadow Knight is the antithesis of the Paladin, a warrior dedicated to evil and evil deeds. Nothing brings him mor pleasure than serving his evil gods. He studies the skills of combat, the spells of a Necromancer, and has the ability to Harm Touch, stealing away most if not all of a target's lifeforce and dissipating it, simply with a touch.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Str, +10 Int, +5 Sta, +5 Cha<p>

 3.l Shaman<br>
 The Shaman is similar to a witch doctor in some primitive tribes, except his spells work, much more potently. His most powerful aspect is that he is able to call upon the spirits of the world to heal his friends and curse his opponents.... however, as a example, the first time you see a Shaman tear into his own arm and chew a chunk off to restore his mana or take a huge bite out of a nearby corpse, you will begin to understand why they are not as trusted nor respected as a Cleric or Druid. They are certainly as powerful though.<br>
 Modifiers: +5 Sta, +5 Cha, +10 Wis<p>

 3.m Warrior<br>
 The Warrior is the god of combat, pure and simple. Brilliant tactics, impossible swordplay, and pure and simple impossible feats of combat are a day's work to a Warrior. By nature, they take and dole as much if not more damage than any other class.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Str, +10 Sta, +5 Agi<p>

 3.n Wizard<br>
 A Wizard is a seeker of knowledge. This makes them capable of the most deadly destruction in the game, period. They are the masters of death by magic. Not only, but they have learned the skills of teleportation, sometimes even across continents, the skills to see and bring something from far off, or send it there again, and the ability to shield himself in layers of protective magics.<br>
 Modifiers: +10 Str, +10 Sta, +5 Agi<p>

 4: Ability Scores And What They Mean<br>
 <br>
 This section is lifted straight from the Everquest Instruction Manual. It says it a lot better than I do.<p>

 Physical ability, affects your chance of being hit in combat, how much damage you take per hit, and how fast you learn some skills.<br>
 <br>
 4.b Charisma (Cha)<br>

 5: Gods And Religion<p>

 This section is also taken from the Everquest Instruction Manual. If and when you buy Everquest, take the time to read the manual. It's got a load more hints in it than you would think.<p>

 5.a Agnostic<br>
 A Agnostic does not believe in the existence or non-existence of gods.<p>

 5.b Bertoxxulous <br>
 Lovers of death and disease, dedicated to spreading both.<p>

 5.i Mithaniel Marr<br>

 5.l Rallos Zek<br>

 6: Factions And What They Are<p>

 So what's the big deal about all the religious stuff about? Well, it affects your faction probably more than anything else in the game, except maybe class. And what is a faction you ask? Simple. A faction is the way other people perceive you. When you perform certain groups in the game, you might change the way certain groups of people, or factions, think about you. If I killed your dog, you'd tell your whole family and friends about it, right? And whenever they saw me they'd think 'There goes the guy who killed my friend's/son's/husband's dog. I don't like him.' Of course, in Everquest, if it goes too far, it might instead of being 'I don't like him.' it might just be a snarl and a unsheathing of weaponry and a loud charge at you. It is possible to piss off a group badly enough at you that whenever a member of that group sees you they try to attack you. This is called Kill-On-Sight behavior, or KoS.<p>

 What's the point here? Simple. You don't want the clerics guild where you work and live to get KoS to you. Same goes for the necromancers digout if you work there. Of course, if you work in one, you probably don't give a good crap what the people in the other think of you, and you'd probably do whatever it took to make the people you work for happier with you, even if it meant hurting the opposite faction. There a a lot of these situations in the game, buried all over the place. When ever you see something in the game, right click on it once to find out what it /cons to you. /Con is short for Consider... it tells you what the person you're looking at thinks of you, and how dangerous they are. If they're looking at you and fingering their swords, and they could easily kill you, you'll be better served to find another way around them, or a larger group of people to help you bust your way through. Or maybe go out and do something else that would improve their feelings about you. It's better by far to be friends with both the paladins guild and the shadowknights guild, if you can pull it off, but it's not likely, unless you take a neutral religion, or become a Agnostic. Also, faction in its own way sticks it's paw into your pocketbook... if a merchant doesn't like you, he won't pay you as much for a item. Makes sense then to look for one who likes you, or at least doesn't mind you, eh? In short, watch your factions with people...<p>

  7. Items And Money<br>
 Everything costs in Norrath. Plain and simple. Training, weapons, armor, food, equipment, toys, raw materials, it all costs. And money is rare as hen's teeth and harder to get ahold of. It's not hopeless though. There are simple ways for newbies to earn decent cash. One of these is running certain quests. I'll go into more detail about quests later though.<br>
 But first let me give you a idea of the basic money principle in Norrath.<br>
 1platinum piece (pp) = 10 gold pieces (gp) 1 gold piece = 10 silver pieces (sp) 1 silver piece = 10 copper pieces (cp).<br>
 Obviously, copper's not hardly worth anything in the higher levels, but at the beginning, copper will be what you have. And yes, 1 platinum piece IS worth 1000 copper. Nice way to make some change isn't it?<br>
 The easiest way to make money in any given situation is find out what someone wants, get it first, then sell it to him. Accepted business principle, right? Well, people in EQ are no different. One of the simplest ways to make cash in the game is to go around, just outside most towns killing bats and skeletons, making stacks of 20 of the bone chips and bat wings you get, and then selling those for 2 or 3 platinum pieces apiece. A little later on another easy way to make money is hunt bears, find High Quality Bear Pelts, and sell those for about 25-30pp apiece.... easiest money you'll make, likely. After a while, the loots you will be getting will be equal to a point where you can sell them to merchants to actually have the cash you want to buy something. If you get really lucky, if you find a rare item, you can sell it to another player for a WAD of cash. The best places to find prices on items is  www.eqprices.com  and  www.eqtrades.com  . Both of those sites will have good prices on them for almost every item. Eventually you'll have a suit of equipment, instead of a bunch of cobbled together stuff. The first time I looked at my equipment and saw I had similar equipment on both wrists and ring fingers I cheered. It was great. <p>

  8. The Dangers Of Dying<br>
 It's simple enough, and it happens. That one fire beetle suddenly turned into 4, a decaying skeleton jumped into the mix, and wham bam thank you ma'am 30 seconds later after running towards the guards you are DEAD. It's ok, it happens. To everyone. All the time. Even me, yes, me... of course, I've gotten a lot better at not dying, simply because I follow the example of Terry Pratchet's Rincewind and RUN my butt off whenever I see something nasty heading my way. I've gotten really good at running too recently.<br>
 A few tips about dying:<br>
 Whenever you are near a town, there are always guards around the walls, and a little newbie area filled to bursting with tiny critters, like rats, bats, the odd skeleton or two... minor opponents for you to kill and loot. Stick in these areas for your first few levels. Until everything in the area is /con'ing blue to you, which means only a minor challenge, hang out. You'll make decent money and exp.<br>
 If you get into a bad situation, run to the nearest guard. Guards are pretty prominent, they have names with Guard, or Dragoon, or Bouncer, or the like in front of them. When they see you running towards them, they'll come out, and help you inside by killing whatever was chasing you.<br>
 There are guards in most of the overland areas in the game. Some are in towers, some wander the area, some just stand around. If you find one, consider setting up camp and trying to solo fight some monsters in the area.<br>
 Whenever you die,you lose a set amount of experience. It gets larger, the higher up in levels you are, so someone who dies at level 55 loses a lot more than someone who dies at level 5. Then you are magically teleported to the last point you were Bound at. Bind Affinity is a magical spell that any caster can use, after a point. It sets your bind point to wherever the spell is cast. At the beginning of the game, you're usually bound quite close to a town. Unfortunately, whenever you die, you drop all your items, armor, weapons, equipment, and anything you had in your backpack when you died. Your dead corpse stays at the point where you died as well, waiting for you to come back and get it back. Usually this isn't a problem though. Most of the time, if you know where you're at, you can usually get a nice person to come out and help you get it back. Or if you're in a group, if the rest of the group didn't run, it'll be lying there, waiting for you to come back and get it.... and your group will be sitting on top of it, just DARING any monster to come over and poke at them! There is one problem though here. Your corpse will only stay there for only so long. The time is extended the higher your level is, however, if you die, try to get back to your body as fast as you can. But don't just go back to get killed again. If you weren't carrying anything really important, you might want to skip it. However, if it's easy, go ahead. Also, you can /consent someone to have them drag your body around for you.... this is useful for a higher level character to bring you your body, or to have your group bring it to a safer point, or the like.<br>
 As long as you are under level 5, whenever you die, you will respawn with 5 food and 5 drink... since water and drink under level 5 is so expensive (the average monster at that point gives up about a silver, and the cheapest combination of food and drink you can find is about a silver as well, and for most folks who don't know where to look, more like 4 silvers), it's usually cheaper and faster to attack a guard, let him kill you, and reclaim your body. Don't worry, the guards won't attack you again after you die. They have ridiculously short memories, as long as they don't die themselves. THEN they'll remember you from then on.<br>
  <br>
9. Groups, Grouping Well, and Experience<br>
 Ok, you've been playing for a few hours, you've got a level or two, and you've ACTUALLY bought a piece of cloth armor! You're doing great! But someone just walked up to you and you saw this message:<br>
 Pratz invites you to join a group. To accept the invitation click on the 'FOLLOW' button, and to decline click the 'DECLINE' button.<br>
 You didn't know what to do, so you stood there until you started crying and he walked off. Never fear! I will explain what just happened.<br>
 Groups are a integral part of the game. Most monsters are too tough to take out alone. The Warrior can't do enough damage alone, and he takes too much damage himself.... the Cleric could heal himself and beat up the critter, if it wasn't HITTING him all the time... same goes for the Wizard, except there'd be no healing, just a explosion and a big mess. But what if they were all working together? The Warrior could attack all he wanted, the Cleric would heal him, and the Wizard would be free to shake and bake all he wanted. Sounds great right? But if they do it separately, what ends up happening is one of them gets the kill credit, the other two gets shafted for their time, energy, and pain, and they eventually take off.<br>
 This is where grouping comes in. In a group, experience is shared out equally.... well, kinda equally. A character who is higher level than you are will take a larger share of the overall experience... but it conned lower to him, anyway, so he's not getting quite as much out of it as you are. So why group with someone that high above you anyway? Ask me again after you've watched a Paladin 3 levels higher than you are kill 4 beasties with your help you wouldn't have stood a chance against alone. Sometimes it's a good idea to group with characters who are higher than you are. But too high isn't good. You won't get any exp after a point, and neither will they.... they'll have first shot at all the exp, but it was a weak monster to them, so they don't get any, then it cycles to you, but your partner was too high leveled, so you don't get any either... so you have to be kinda careful about who you group with.<br>
 On The Subject Of Grouping Well<br>
 Stay with your group. Basic point of life, here. If you're in a hostile, dangerous area, stick with the rest of the people who can actually save you when that nasty orc raider jumps out at you.<br>
 Keep a eye on who is where. Sometimes you have to leave the group. There's a dude across the zone, at the docks, who'll give me a great defense spell if I just go to him! Great! But TELL THE GROUP first. They might come with you. Or they might engage some big, tough monster, and someone might die because you weren't there.<br>
 Talk to the group. Too many players, even at my level, Don't talk to their groups. It's sad. Not too long ago, we had a group in The Lair of the Splitpaw, a area around level 30-35, just in the entrance, and one of our main fighters was up front, waiting on our scout to bring back a monster to fight with him. Well, the scout, a Half-Elf Ranger, not totally defenseless, but not that tough, gets back, so does one of the gnolls in the zone, and we begin to wail on him. The Warrior does great, the Ranger does great, the Shadowknight does great, but our Druid isn't healing the Ranger, and he's getting beat up. So the Ranger hits the critical level of HP, and decides to run for the entrance. OOPS. There's another gnoll just outside the door of the room we are in. In short, the Ranger dies, and the Shadowknight, the Warrior, myself, and the lazy Druid are all ported outside the dungeon by one of my spells. Then a minute later, the Druid says "What happened?" I say that the Ranger died because you didn't heal him, you little (CENSORED), why weren't you doing your job? He responds back that he had gone to the bathroom and hadn't told us. We booted him from the group, and got another healer, and went back in after our friend's body.<br>
 Know your job. I haven't gone over this yet, because I wanted to cover the basics. But I'll work on the jobs each class has to carry, and yes, there are certain things each class does in a fight. I'll go into them later.<br>
 Be ready to run. Everyone who pulls, that is, goes out and looks for things to fight, then pulls them back to a safer area where monsters don't spawn, has a bad day. Or maybe the Cleric overdoes it and the lizardmen decide to make a appetizer out of him before turning on the fighters as the main course.Or even the Wizard, the Enchanter, and the Necromancer all run out of mana, and there's nothing left to do for it but run. If you have to run, run. Don't stand around and try to be a hero. Most of the time you'll eb fighting stuff you shouldn't have a chance against alone... if you stop to hold back the flood to give your friends time to get out, all well and good, but expect to spend however long it takes to go back and get your corpse. Not to mention make back the exp you lost dying. If you can get out, get out. Noone will blame you for being a coward, noone will say you were a (CENSORED), and if they do, they've not been playing long enough to have 4 Mountain Giants chasing them across a zone they have NO clue about. And don't forget. Any time you zone out of a area, anything chasing you stays behind. This is important.<p>

 10. Non Player Characters, Quests, And How To Deal With Them<br>
 You've done it. You've collected a CRUSHBONE BELT! You righteously killed that orc and took his pants off, along with his belt! One of your group says that the belt's a quest item, and if you take it to Freeport, you can get money and EXP for it! What a deal! So you troop merrily back to Freeport, and immediately hand it over to the first guard you see. He says thank you, and walks off. You stick around a minute, waiting for your gold.... and the exp.... and the gold... maybe it'll be platinum? Could be! ... So you wait.... and wait... and wait... and then you see the guard again, walking your way! Here he comes... you can count the gold already! You say hi to him.... and he walks right past you. You say Hail Guard Jansen to him, and he stop and say hello back to you. You laboriously type out the question of what happened to your belt..... and he just stares straight past you. You threaten him with your sword.... and 5 guards dogpile you. You wake up a minute later naked, a little exp lighter, and having to go get your body. What a ripoff. But did it ever occur to you, maybe you gave the belt to the wrong guy?<br>
 Quests are a nice little addition to the game. They allow you to have more fun in the game, by giving you a way to get good faction, great cash, good items, and lots of fun, just for doing certain things. The best way to get a quest is to find a NPC and Hail him, mapped out on your keyboard as the H button. Target them by clicking on them, then Hail them. If they have anything to say to you, and you're close enough, they'll talk to you. If they say anything in [brackets] , that's probably a quest.<p>

 You say, "What are brackets Pratz?"<p>

 Pratz says, "Good job. That's the way to do it. You have to ask a interrogative question to the NPC to get them to respond usually, like who, what, why, where, when, how, and so forth. Or you might have to say I will, or I can, like I can take the mail to Freeport..." <p>

 A passing bard gives Pratz a letter. He frowns and stuffs it in his backpack.<p>

 I hate when I do that.<br>
 But anyway. Remember, when you are talking to a NPC, Press Enter First. Whenever you target a NPC, then press the A key, you are auto attacking them. No NPC yet I've seen likes being hit with a rusty sword, especially when they can most of them take the sword away from you and stick it where the sun doesn't shine. I still catch myself in AIM or on ICQ hitting the Enter key before I start typing sometimes.<br>
 If you want more detailed information about a quest, or you have a item you think might be a quest item, go to   everquest.allakhazam.com   ... that's where I've gotten all my quest information so far, and it's %99 percent accurate.<p>

 11. Game Ettiquite and In Game Terms<p>

 You've done it. You're up to level 9, and you are in Greater Faydark, hunting orcs. You've just come back from Orc Hill, it's been a great day, and you're resting right in front of the lift, thinking about your latest group of friends, and the great loot you got today, and suddenly you hear someone shout "TRAIN TO ORC LIFT!" Train? What's a train? I haven't seen any tracks yet? ... Then the guy who yelled runs past you on his way to the Orc Lift. You watch him.... and then get run over by 6 orcs chasing him at top speed. THIS is a train! A buncha baddies chasing someone... YOU!<br>
 You make it to the lift just in time to fall over it and have the guards slaughter the orcs quite happily... then you scream at the guy who yelled earlier. "Why did you SAY you had a bunch of orcs on you?!" He responds, "I said I had a train."<br>
 In certain situations, there are certain shouts and messages you need to give to the rest of the zone, or to your group, that give them needed bits of information. The point of the game is to adventure, and noone likes dying. It is part of adventuring, but walking into a zone and getting hammered isn't any fun.<br>
 If you have to run to zone, shout TRAIN TO ZONE. You should probably set up a hotkey (hit socials, hit the arrow key next to 1, either side, right click on a empty slot, then write in what you want to say.) to shout Train to Zone, or something to the effect... my personal one is GRAB YER SOCKS AND LIFT YER JOCKS I GOT A TRAIN! in honor of my Muse, the beloved and hopefully not long gone Tweety (Tweety we love you!) On the opposite site, if you hear TRAIN TO ZONE, or something like it, even someone making choochoo sounds, if you're near a zone entrance dive out of the way.... and then stand to the site and watch the fireworks. Just remember as soon as they zone, the monsters are going to be looking for fresh meat.......<br>
 If you're a caster, or even a warrior subtype who uses spells, remember to keep your group appraised of the amount of mana you have. The easiest way is to look at you mana bar, divide each bar into 20 percent, and then count up. So if I have two bars full, I have %40 mana, or even faster, just say the number with a M after it, like so: 40M <br>
 Don't beg. It's demeaning. Degrading. And people HATE it. If you walk up to someone and say "Plz can I have some cash?" More likely than not they'll ignore you outright. I personally never ignore people who say this. I always give them 1 cp. ::evil grin:: Work for your money. You'll come out of it better for it.<br>
 Here are some other terms everyone should know by now:<br>
 OOM: Out Of Mana. The caster who says this needs at least 30 seconds medding to becomes useful again.<br>
 LOM: Low On Mana. The caster who says this usually has about %20 left and is in dire need of a time out.<br>

GTM: Green To Me. The MOB cons Green to the player.<br>
 BTM: Blue To Me. The MOB cons Blue to the player.<br>
 WTM: White To Me. The MOB cons White to the player. If you are in the basic view mode, this will be Black to you. But continue using WTM.<br>
 YTM: Yellow To Me. The MOB cons Yellow to the player<br>
 RTM: Red To Me. The MOB cons Red to the player.<br>
 FP: Freeport.<br>
 GFay: Greater Faydark.<br>
 NKa: Northern Karana.<br>
 NRo: Northern Desert of Ro<br>
 CT: The Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule. A nasty dungeon Wizards can teleport into.<br>
 DL: Dreadlands. Another dangerous area a Wizard can teleport into.<br>
 EC: East Commonlands. The main trading spot in the game, due to its ease of acess for anyone who wants to get there. <br>
 WC: West Commonlands. Nearest place a Wizard or Druid can teleport to Freeport.<br>
 Toxx: Toxxulia Forest, near Erudin.<br>
 LoIO: Lake of Ill Omen. Hunting grounds in Kunark for everyone in the game after about level 20.<br>
 FV: Firiona Vie, the stepping off point for most people into Kunark.<br>
 Zone: Run for the zone, the situation here has gone FUBAR.<br>
 SNAFU: Situation Normal, All Fragged Up<br>
 TARFU: Things Are Really Fragged Up<br>
 FUBAR: Fragged Up Beyond All Repair<br>
 BOHICA: Bend Over, Here It Comes Again!<br>
 DE: Dark Elf<br>
 Barbie or Barby: Barbarian<br>
 Brd: Bard<br>

 LFG: Looking For Group. Usually acompanied by a class and a level, and a plea to send tells.<br>
 Root: A simple spell many casters have to prevent a MOB from moving; a paralysis spell.<br>

 <br>
 All right folks, this concludes today's class. I hope you found some of this information useful, and that it helps with your gaming experience. Take care and I'll see you out in the field.<p>
