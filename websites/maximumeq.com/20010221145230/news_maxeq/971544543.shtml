<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Can we get a quest to convert agnostics, please?<BR>
No. Just like race or class, deity selection has advantages and disadvantages associated with it. Players have to live with whatever choices they make in this area.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Had the down-side been KNOWN when the characters were originated, an informed choice balancing the pros and cons of each could have been made.<BR>
Certain things are ment to be experienced after the choice is made. The first people playing the game or entering a new area do not know how their selections will affect what they can do. Not everything is expected to be known in the begining by the people making the decisions.<BR>
