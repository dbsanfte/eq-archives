At the 44th pet necro pets start proc'ing. You reduced the rate at which pets will proc. You reduced the amout of damage our pets will do (and get healed by) with this change. <BR>
Question(s): Was this intended (nerf or bug)? <BR>
Will the rate on this proc be increased (or damage done by it) so that our pets will be back to pre-patch status?<BR>
<BR>
Just want some info on this so I know if I should keep my hopes up that we were not nerfed (by accident or not).<BR>

We only reduced the proc rate for pets using weapons.<BR>
I'm going to have to lock this thread. Look for one of the longer threads for more information and discussion.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Let me summarize, for convenience sake, the changes that we have made to pets over the course of the last few patches.<BR>
Pets wielding weapons will now proc with those weapons just as frequently as a player character with that weapon and the same stats. This has reduced the frequency of weapon procs from pets. To make this change we simply removed an artificial multiplier to pet proc chances, no stats or attributes were changed.<BR>
<BR>
Pets wielding the Sword of Runes will proc with that sword as often as they do with any other procing weapon, but it will only proc against its intended target, summoned creatures.<BR>
<BR>
Magician and necromancer pets (and because they use the same spells, shadowknight pets as well) now have the ability to duel wield without a weapon, if they are powerful enough. This will happen with some regularity with pets cast from 39th level (52nd for shadowknights) spells and above.<BR>
<BR>
No other changes to the duel wielding ability of any other pets was changed. This ability was not given to any other pet because magicians and necromancers are primary pet classes, the others are not.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>RODCET NIFE EVENT - Neriak's Message
<br>Four days ago, the Royal Army of King Tearis Thex advanced upon the Tier'dal city of Neriak. Their goal was the "cleansing" of the Tier'dal "evil race." They arrived in three separate columns. Two of them headed through the heavy forests covering the region; the third, composed of Wood Elves hailing from Kelethin, marched down the paths. Tier'dal scouts detected Thex's army in motion and used a network of fast moving messengers to notify Neriak, which began mounting a defense.
<br>
<br>Shortly after midnight, Tier'dal soldiers brushed with the advance guard of Thex's center column in a clearing. The general battle that followed swayed back and forth over the field for more than three hours. Then, as Thex's lines began to waver in the face of the numerically superior Tier'dal, Wood Elf reinforcements arrived from the path. Hurling them against the Tier'dal right, Thex steadied the wavering High Elf line and gradually forced the Tier'dal to withdraw. Except for this timely arrival and the near exhaustion of the Tier'dal troops, Thex might have been defeated that day. Though he held the immediate field of battle, Thex had been stopped a good distance north of the Tier'dal line and his army was ordered to retreat.
<br>
<br>Shaken by his "victory," Tearis Thex ordered his troops to entrench in Nektulos forest while he awaited the arrival of the Humans from Freeport, who were supposedly already deployed. For three days he waited, with no support arriving. Thex, faced with the dilemma of no reinforcements and dwindling supplies, had a choice. Either retreat fully or make one last attempt at Neriak Proper.
<br>
<br>He ordered a group of some 300 high elf paladins backed by the support of 8 wizards to attack the Tier'dal left. By now, the Tier'dal were aware of Thex's movement and Dying Marduchava, a Tier'dal ShadowKnight, was ordered by Neriak to take control of the battle that followed. The High Elf line was broken, then rallied, and both sides were repeatedly punished by the Tier'dal assault. After an hour of combat, Thex was forced to retreat.
<br>
<br>Neriak has called upon Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres and citizens of Paineel to assist in delivering a "message" to the High Elf city of Felwithe, one that announces clearly that such unprovoked attacks are not going to be tolerated. 
<br>
<br>/ooc
<br>
<br>This Saturday, December 2nd at 2PM Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7), meet at the zone-in to Felwithe, on the Greater Faydark side. You'll need to be invis to get past the newbie buffed guards. Once enough have arrived, we'll zone in to Felwithe and deliver Neriak's message!

------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
*Patch Day*<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues:<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum.  Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate direction.<BR>
<BR>
- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a player character rather than an NPC.  The change last patch reduced them to a rate below player characters.  As part of this patch, target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the intended type.  For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything.  <BR>
<BR>
- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or two every few minutes.  For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this should address the issue.<BR>
<BR>
- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards.  Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.  <BR>
<BR>
- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting to get back in.<BR>
<BR>
- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping is enabled.  Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is adopted.<BR>
<BR>
- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the "NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace".  This means that you can now assign "Backspace" to a function in game.<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances.  There is still a potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the near future.<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.<BR>
<BR>
- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons.  The calculation used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability.  It is possible that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th level pet that will not have this ability. <BR>
<BR>
- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<BR>
<BR>
- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their one-handed blunt skill.<BR>
<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hail and well met, all! Soon, The Triple Entendre will be hosting a dueling tournament for all characters from levels 15 to 30. Here are the specifics:
<br>Dueling Tournament: Sovreign of the Spectrum 
<br>Location: Butcherblock Mountains, right near the Dagnor's zone line (This location is not definite. If anyone else has ideas, tell me). 
<br>Time: Saturday, December 9th at 7:00 P.M. EST 
<br>Participants allowed: Any and all characters between levels 15 and 30 
<br>Rules for the tournament are as follows: 
<br>
<br>1. The participants will be split in to four groups of contestants; those of levels 15-18, levels 19-22, levels 23-26, and those of 27-30. 
<br>2. Each entrant in the tournament is subject to an entry fee, dictated by the character's level;
<br>
<br>Levels 15-18: 10pp
<br>Levels 19-22: 15pp
<br>Levels 23-26: 22pp
<br>Levels 26-30: 30pp
<br>2. Prizes: the champion of each level set will receive 80% of the funds obtained from entrants. Example: If I win the 19-22 set, and there were 32 entrants, I would take home 80% of 480pp, which is 384pp.
<br>3. Core Rules: No one has any buffs on at the start of the fight, period. This includes ANY icons that would appear in the little "effects" window. A contestant may buff himself/herself once the fight has begun. No pets may be summoned prior to the start of the fight. As there are a great number of right-clickable effects out there that will not be allowed, we require that anyone with a right-clickable item gain our approval before they are allowed to use it in the tournament. I hate to say it, but there is no leniency here. There will be limits to where duelists can go while fighting. These will be announced at a later date, as we are unsure of them as of now. Twinking will be allowed, to some degree. Anyone who could even possibly be called a twink should contact me with a list of all the equipment you plan to use in the tournament.
<br>
<br>That's all for now. More rules may be posted at some point. All entrants should post on our forums, in the Events section. There will be a thread entitled "Sovreign of the Spectrum-Dueling Tournament" or something along those lines. Our guild webpage can be found here. A link to the guild forum, as well as a link to the event description can be found there. Thanks for the interest, and good hunting!

<br>
<br>I do still read the boards, just can't reply to everything...
<br>
<br>Anyway, tracking is slated to be enhanced. Many of the enhancements are for Rangers only, but some are global. I'm reluctant to specify the feature set because it's not final, but I will say that it will have scrolling, sorting, and filtering.

<br>Reliquary of Thule - Trade Festival in the Overthere - Rallos Zek
<br>
<br>This Sunday, November the 26th, at 9pm EST the Supplicants of the Frozen Heart of the Malificus Sect will be hosting the second in a series of Bazaars. The first, a great success, was the Black Sunday Bazaar in Neriak's Commons. This one is the Reliquary of Thule. Next months, Mushroom Festival in Hell, will take place in Grobb. All dark souls are welcome to attend, though you may need to be wary of the Outpost guards. Those unable to enter the Outpost are still encouraged to attend, especially the Iksar of Cabalis as they can bank in their own city if a deal strikes them as good.
