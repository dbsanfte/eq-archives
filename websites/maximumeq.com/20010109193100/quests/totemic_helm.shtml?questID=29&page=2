If you learn the path of the lich it is not that bad.  When I zone in I go to the right and work my way around.<BR>
That way I go in the same direction as the lich.  The lich only killed me once and that was when <BR>
I mistook him for an Ice Bone and walked right up to him.  (OUCH!)<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I recently turned 35 shaman and decide to get myself a new headpiece so I prepared myself for a long and boring time of my life. After locating the hole in the ice I dove into the hole and swam into the cave, approached carefully keeping my head up for the lich. After running around for 30 minutes or so I came to the conclusion that it was empty, no lich, no PHs and no bear. Checked my watch and decided to come back couple of hours later, my next try several hours later resulted in 2 dead PHs and a big scare by the lich. Reseted the timer and prepared myself for the 8 hour long wait. After about 8 hours I went back with my hopes high and ran in used sense animal only got stupid snow leopard on target. Proceeded further in and almost ran into the lich again and found one PH, killed and started to cast sense animal again, but before the spell went off, the bear came walking straight for me and my heart almost raced, and my fingers started to tremble, here he was.<BR>
Killed him easy with root and a few dots, was blue to me.<BR>
Can't believe the luck I had :).<BR>
<BR>
For the second part of the quest I went to cazic thule and got into a tae-group and spent 4-5 hours there before finally one lizard page dropped one ogreskin chamois.<BR>

When i log back on 5 hrs later, use sense animal and its on track. following the heading and i found a super HUGE polar bear walking around.  Root it, send pet, and DoT with poison and disease (BTW it is not hitting very hard, DO NOT USE DD, it resists)<BR>
In my opinion, camp your character at the 3 Ice Bones house.  Use sense animal to see if it is there, if not, log off and do other thing, check back every hour or so.  Thats how i got mine, no pain at all hehe.  Just kind of scary when i first get in the cave ehhee.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Sigh,<BR>
Ok guys here is some more info for you to feast on.<BR>
There are several IMPORTANT points not even mentioned in <BR>
the other posts.<BR>
<BR>
NUMBER ONE!  the Glacier bear pelt is EXTRA large. that means it will not fit in most regular bags<BR>
You should loot it with a right click and put it into an open PRIMARY inventory slot, otherwise you will lose the item.<BR>
I was told by one of the main GMs on Bertox (Tinysa) that I was SCREWED.<BR>
20 friggin hours of camping and I had nothing to show for it.<BR>
Anyhow, don't get stuck by this bug, IMHO it should fall back on the body if you do not have a large enough spot for the item or it should be made LARGE instead of extra large<BR>
I tried the mammoth Rib bone and it does the same thing, it goes away if you do not have a tinker's bag or open PRIMARY inventory slot open.<BR>
Not a big deal as the rib bones are a dime a dozen.<BR>
<BR>
NUMBER TWO!  Camp your character either in the ice cave or close to it the night before a patch or other server outage.<BR>
Thats right, you still have a chance for the placeholder but you don't have to wait 6 to 8 hours to find out!<BR>
I got one pelt the night before a patch while moving my character to the cave and one the very next morning ( I had to loot it with my wife's level 20 character LOL)<BR>
upon system startup.<BR>
You will spend your time more productive but it might take you  a month or two to get your helm, but with the lich down there now, you can not just log on down there and leave for a couple hours like you used to to hold the camp.<BR>
<BR>
The page does not always drop the skin, just get into a tae group and you might get you a lizzy mantle or cloak while you wait.<BR>
<BR>
If someone you know gets the Glacier Bear pelt and does not want the helm (IE a cleric that got the icon) you can get all the other items and turn them in together in Lake rathe to still get your helm.<BR>
<BR>
The pelt dropped everytime I killed the bear, but I only saw the icon one time.<BR>
<BR>
Good hunting<BR>
