I wonder what zone(s) it will be attached to.</font></p>

<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1) Can you tell me if Verant has any near-future plans to add a new zone or two to the established world via an optional two hour patch :P that would let us explore the new zone? Kudos on Paineel and recently The Hole. <BR>
</font>
We do have additional free zones planned, with the Warrens being the next one on the list. I'll have to check on Tuesday to see how this is coming along. I think that it will still be a few weeks before we'll see this go live.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2) If you do implement a new zone, could you please just announce "A new zone is available via the optional patch, and that no new information is to be released about this area. Explore!<BR>
</font>
<BR>
I like the sound of that, of course it would only be a secret until it ended up on the Test server <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;There are no new zones for the lower levels. Can you bring this up at the next tuning meeting?? (Please?)<BR>
</font>
<BR>
The issue here is that there is already a vast number of areas for the lower level folks out there. They are not the ones who are running out of content. Furthermore, since they are low level, they progress rather quickly from one set of zones to another, meaning that enjoyment of any new specifically low-level zone would be fleeting. It's the mid and upper levels that are typically most in need of new content.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Gordon, I must admit that I have faith that Verant will (eventually) address this issue. <BR>
</font>
Thanks for bringing the issue back up, and I can let you know that there is forward progress being made on this issue. The biggest problem that we've identified and taken steps to correct is a gap between smithed armor, and Jarsath, that is at around 20 levels wide. <BR>
<BR>
I reviewed the item list for 3 sets of class-specific armor three days ago, and the quests are now being written.<BR>
<BR>
As for planar type equivalents, evalutation of that end of item availability is behind the mid-level stuff in priority. One we get these quests in we'll start looking at the other end of the spectrum.<BR>
<BR>
