You can click on the link below to have your thoughts voiced.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;The problem with this is that patches are normally completed during the same 4 hour period every time, so the Dragons only spawn during this same 4 hour period every time. This makes it impossible for the people that cannot play during that 4 hour block to ever join in a Dragon raid. A possible solution to that problem is to make the Dragons spawn randomly, maybe every 4 to 8 days<BR>
</font>
I'd be willing to argue a random component on initial dragon spawn after a server outage to the tuning team. I'd also be interested in hearing arguments pro and con over the next week.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Utility Spells">Utility Spells</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/19/00 07:48 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>A player recently asked why Wizards don't get enduring breath.  Here is Gordon's response:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>There are more utility spells out there then Enduring Breath and levitate, and though they are indeed utility spells, they aren't of the same line. <BR>
Utility spells are any spells that are not combat related. Examples of this, while including EB and Levitate, also include Shrink, most of the mages non-pet summons (even if the result of the summoned item is an attack/defense spell), and a good portion of the enchanter spells (such as metal enchantments, alliance, etc). There are many others as well, including travel spells which would also fall under this definition.<BR>
<BR>
Off the top of my head, I don't believe that clerics get either of those spells. I might be wrong about that though. <BR>
<BR>
It's not an oversight, it's by design.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="No Bash for Shield of Slain Unicorn">No Bash for Shield of Slain Unicorn</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/19/00 07:41 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>The shield of the slain unicorn really is a unique weapon.  Looks like it won't be getting the ability to bash though.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;However, I think that the Shield of the Slain Unicorn (currently a Piercing weapon, with some AC) would be a perfect candidate for recieving the BASH upgrade. This change would be a tremendous help to small and medium-sized warriors, for whom SLAM is not an option<BR>
</font>
Well you do have a point. However the shield is technically a weapon with some AC that just happens to use a shield model. <BR>
<BR>
We don't have the capability to label an item as a shield AND a weapon, so the ability to bash was never included on this item. Concerning the change made for the Fiery Avenger, that's really a hardcode, and as Brad stated earlier, only FA-style (Epic quest super weapons) would gain an ability of that nature.<BR>

What I think Abashi is refering to in the "statistical anomaly" is that certain 1H slash weapon may be able to do damage between 1 and 8, so if it hits for 1 damage in 3 consecutive, it enjoys the low delay.  However, if the 2 handed weapon does the same, it's taking a lot longer.<BR><BR>

It will be interesting to see how this is changed.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you watch the highly experienced adventures of this land you rarely see anyone choosing this form of combat. Even the holy and the shadow knights how can only equip one smaller weapon choose to use the one handed slashing weapon favor of the bigger twohander.<BR>
</font>
There is a statistical problem with the min-damage calculation used for all weapons. Basically, it made low damage low delay weapons of a given ratio much more preferrable than a high damage-high delay weapon. We're going to look into enhancing the amount of damage done with 2H weapons versus 1H weapons.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;My question. Are there any stpes being taken to give rangers a skill of thier own <BR>
</font>
This question has been around a few times in a couple of different threads, so I thought I'd answer here. We currently have no plans to create a unique ranger-specific ability/skill. We believe that rangers are essentially well-balanced, useful to groups as a lightly armored melee machine with some useful spells thrown in. <BR>
<BR>
Giving you some equivalent to HT/LoH isn't going to swing balance wildly, so it wouldn't alleviate all of the concerns of other rangers that post on this board, so there'd be no reason to do it except for the purpose of "throwing you a bone", which we don't do.<BR>
<BR>
We know that it is not possible for us to make everyone happy with their class, which is why we recommend that people choose a class that they can be happy with. <BR>

Gordon did a very good job of explaining why this won't work.  What I think roleplaying is, is definately not what you will think roleplaying is.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>pagane,<BR>
Though your design has merit, the purpose of my question wasn't to redesign the race/class/deity system in EverQuest, but rather to hear someone define "roleplaying" in a universally accepted and enforceable manner, in response to all of the posts stating that we should put up a "Roleplaying Server". <BR>
<BR>
The first reply to your post states:<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;-A server with the label "Roleplay ONLY"<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;-Make it enforced somehow (if its not enforced or somehow different, then its the same as the others, or will eventually be so)
</font><BR>
<BR>
This pretty well illustrates the biggest problem surrounding the prospects of a "Roleplay Only" server, the suggestion that we enforce it "somehow". Unfortunately "somehow" requires a definition unless people playing on it were willing to be completely subjected to the individual personal and unguided judgement of our customer service staff. Other examples of this same issue are illustrated in the Play Nice Policies.<BR>
<BR>
Take the naming policy as an example. It is clearly posted on this website and covers the majority of situations that can come up. Nonetheless, there is still a component of judgement, and people take offense and post their feelings on the board when that judgement is used. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe not "enforce" it persay, but make it less attractive to a powergamer, KeWl d00D, etc...<BR>
</font>
<BR>
The problem here is that things that are attractive to the powergamer aren't necessarily repugnant to the roleplayer. Furthermore, the "powergamer" isn't necessarily the antithesis of the roleplayer. <BR>
<BR>
One of the frequent suggestions that we see in regards to creating a "Roleplay" server is that we eliminate /shout, /ooc, and /auction. Some go as far as to say that we should also eliminate /tell. How can limiting the number of ways people communicate drive off the powergamer while attracting the roleplayer? Whenever a new server comes up, it is frequently bombarded by players who wish to play "race to 50". I'm not saying that there is necessarily anything wrong with this playstyle, but how would a server with crippled communication keep the stereotypical "solo powergaming druid" from coming to the server?<BR>
<BR>
Another frequent suggestion is that we should limit the amout of time that someone can be logged into the server per week. Though the number varies, the majority of people I've seen suggest this suggest between 10 and 20 hours per week. I received a note from a Paladin the other day who identified himself as a "diehard roleplayer". He commented that he absolutely refuses to go out of character while playing. He hadn't yet reached level-50 (several levels under actually), and had nearly 100 days played on the character. Is this person not a roleplayer because he has so much free time to play? I know a druid who is in the mid-30s with over 70 days played, and I'd have the same question about her.<BR>
<BR>
I've seen other suggestions as well, all with their merits and their flaws. Some people define "roleplay" as unrestricted PvP. Some people suggest that we create servers where the vast majority of items are nodrop, others suggest we create one where nodrop and lore tags are removed.<BR>
<BR>
With all of the suggestions I've seen (and don't get me wrong, I like a number of them in general, even if not for the purpose of creating a roleplay server), the majority appear to point to making the game more difficult. Making the game more difficult does not do anything to scare off the type of people that you would like to be relieved of. It tends to attract them.<BR>
<BR>
I think that it is important for people to remember that the choice to roleplay is a personal one, and everyone makes and implements that choice in their own way. I believe what everyone wants here is not to have to deal with people that they think are "jerks", and that by creating a roleplaying server we can somehow filter out all of the "jerks" from joining. It is a fantastic idea, but really impossible in implementation.<BR>
<BR>
These are all reasons why our stance is that we cannot do a “Dedicated Hardcore Roleplaying Server”. It can neither be satisfactorily defined, and therefore couldn’t be enforced. That said, if someone were to design a roleplaying server, with minimal changes required in code, where everything (including enforcement procedures) was defined , and if you could get 3-5K people to state that they’d play on it, we would take serious note. By all means if someone out there has a fantastic design for such a thing, we’d be very interested in hearing about it.<BR>

Since then, the cleric community has been holding their breath.<BR><BR>

It will not be changed, and will continue to be allowed in the back slot.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Another question: Why can't all shields be utilized in this manner?<BR>
The ability to wear something in more than one character slot is a benefit that could be applied to an item on an item-by-item basis. We probably won't be updating existing items retroactively in this manner.<BR>
<BR>
Also, there are some shields in the game that we *really* wouldn't want people wearing as cloaks. <BR>
