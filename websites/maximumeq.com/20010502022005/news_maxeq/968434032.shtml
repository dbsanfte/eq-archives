<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
About a month ago I mentioned that we were still investigating the issue with some low delay weapons that entered the game recently, among these are the mosscovered twig and the barbed scale whip. <BR>
<BR>
After analyzing combat data concerning use of these weapons, it is apparent that a change must be made to maintain (or restore in this case) balance. While we have no problem with weapons of this delay, they should not have been placed as loot on anything other than deity or dragon level encounters. As it is, these weapons were dropping off of low to mid level encounters, leading to thousands of them in game. <BR>
<BR>
The next time we patch items, the extreme low-delay one-handed weapons (a list of specific items to follow in the near future) will be modified so that they can only be equipped in the off-hand. This will address the balance issue present with these items.<BR>
<BR>
