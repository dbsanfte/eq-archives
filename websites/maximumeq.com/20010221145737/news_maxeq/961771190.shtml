Perhaps Sebelis is the place to be?</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have yet to see a difference in the spell drop rate. Hours of hunting skyfire, chardok, etc. still yield nothing<BR>
Most people who cite problems with spell drops cite hours of hunting in Skyfire and Chardok. Consider for a moment that though spells drop there, those might not be the best places to find spells.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Cursed weapons?">Cursed weapons?</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/17/00 15:14 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>In a thread dealing with the weapon weight issues for monks, Abashi mentioned something about cursed weapons.  This should be interesting...</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;We were told by you Abashi that the Bammbo Bo stick was a mistake and was being lowered in weight. <BR>
</font>
Actually I never said that. I said that some of the monk-only weapons in Kunark were too heavy, and I never meantioned what specific weapons. Anyway, the live team went through the weapons and lowered the weight on some of them. Some of them are remaining rather heavy, and are that way on purpose. <BR>
<BR>
I'll ask the live team to look it over again, but I wouldn't expect a ton of dramatic changes. The fact that a particular character has the ability to use a particular weapon doesn't necessarily mean that they *should* use it, nor that it's the *best* thing that they could be using. <BR>
<BR>
Wait until you see some of the cursed items that will begin turning up soon.<BR>

They also aren't going to allow paladin's to use piercing weapons either.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>It sounds like it might be possible that some of our apprentice game designers might have been unaware that paladins couldn't use piercers. We probably won't give them that ability, but we should address the fact that they cannot use these weapons.<BR>
We're doing a weapons search to see what weapons out there are actually usable by Paladins so that we can correct any discrepancies.<BR>

Personally, in well over a 1000 (probably more) level 45+ mobs that I have helped kill in Kunark, 2 have dropped a spell.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Please try that again where you find a place you know spells SHOULD be dropping and kill 250mobs to see how many scrolls you got just like you did before..... Please! I beg you....<BR>
I did last night, and saw a good number more drops. I probably got some good rolls, but still received several more spells even after accounting for that.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Robe of Living Fungus nerfed">Robe of Living Fungus nerfed</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/17/00 15:03 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>We have the robe listed as having the effect (so, obviously the screenshot we received showed it).  Also, the name implies that the effect would exists.<BR><BR>

However, it appears that the effect of Fungal Regrowth is gone for good.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I've asked around here, spoken to everyone with the ability to make or modify items, and can't find any indication that the robe ever had that effect. The closest thing I can guess is that we might have had a bad item export at some time that went live.<BR><BR>
-Gordon
<br><br>
<font color=white>and</font><br><br>
If I could find anyone here to say "we nerfed it", then I'd tell you that we nerfed it. And yes, if it did have this effect now, we would nerf it, because we wouldn't give this effect to monks. 
As for the screenshots posted on the other boards, I've also seen screenshots of the a breastplate with Gate that doesn't exist either, so it's not entirely conclusive.
<BR><BR>
So, like I said, I can't find anyone here who can attest to it ever having the effect. It either got on there in a bad export, or someone put it, removed it, and forgot about it.
<BR><BR>
-Gordon
<BR><BR>
<font color=white>also</font><br><br>
I'll take your word for it that it was there before. As I said in the two previous posts, it probably had a problem exporting. <BR><BR>
Regardless what happened, that effect isn't supposed to be assigned to that item, and it won't be coming back.
