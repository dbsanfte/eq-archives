                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">After reading your editorial on the subject of
                    &quot;Verant Vs. Players&quot; I'd just like to make a few comments, and I hope they are
                    of the constructive sort.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the issue of lag tendencies within the
                    game:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The other night, as we were enjoying another
                    evening of gameplay, Verant decided that there were some issues that needed to be remedied
                    within the game immediately, so they began to take down servers. As each server (or two,
                    as they began to do later on) was taken down, my husband would go linkdead. Then, he'd
                    have to attempt to log back in.&nbsp; Each time a serer would go down, this would happen.
                    So, he decided to go to the chat and ask if anyone knew that this was occurring. There
                    were at least 15 people in the one chat room complaining of the same problem. Yet, no one
                    would acknowledge it.&nbsp; We wrote Verant, they say... it's not our problem, it's your
                    ISP.&nbsp; I can see that it could be the ISP to a point, but this continued all night, as
                    they took down EACH server...so we left, and went out instead of playing a game that WE
                    pay for.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">[Ed: I cannot understand how
                    either an ISP or Verant could be causing this problem.&nbsp; I suppose an influx of people
                    trying to login to a server that was down could affect the chat/login server, but unless
                    you were zoning I'm not sure how it would affect you.&nbsp; If your husband went linkdead
                    and not you then I tend to believe that it was something on your husbands machine that was
                    causing the problem.&nbsp; Strange indeed.]</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Lag on the server is a rampant issue..it isn't
                    getting better, and as they increase the servers, it is not decreasing either the
                    population on the current servers, or the lag we experience.&nbsp; I play with a cable
                    modem, my husband does not.&nbsp; When I get bad lag... I know it's not my ISP.&nbsp;</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">[Ed: Your logic is a bit
                    faulty here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cable modems are frequently lagged if the node you are on is
                    saturated.&nbsp; This can happen easily.]</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"> What bothers me is that Verant seems to want
                    to decide to lay off all blame on themselves, and say it is the customer, or they just
                    ignore the issue all together.&nbsp; Yes, some zones are far worse than others as far as
                    lag goes, but you can see the server side lag.&nbsp; One solution to this problem is to
                    not put up a slew of new servers, but to create different routers.&nbsp; Right now, as far
                    as I understand, everyone, all 50,000 (or more now) of us is being routed through one
                    server.&nbsp; That's rather pushing it.&nbsp; I can't imagine how bad the lag is for some
                    of the people who play in places as far away as Germany, or Australia or France!&nbsp;
                    Sometimes the lag is so bad for me, I just give up!&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">[Ed: I may misunderstand your
                    point.&nbsp; The Verant world servers are situated on different backbones.&nbsp; To my
                    knowledge there is only one login server.&nbsp; I believe that each time you zone you must
                    connect to that server.&nbsp; If that is the problem you are pointing out I agree it can
                    be annoying to wait to zone.&nbsp; However, most zoning time is machine based and not
                    login server connection based.&nbsp; A fast machine zones much quicker than a slow one for
                    instance.]</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">If they know they have a log-in server
                    problem, why don't they fix it?&nbsp; Many of the problems that we, as customers feel they
                    have, they won't bother to fix because they probably feel that we won't wait for them to
                    fix it, and would complain about there being more down time.&nbsp; If more down time in
                    the short run would be better game play in the long run, I for one would sit and wait.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">On the issue of overcrowding within the
                    game:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">The other night I was in Oasis of Marr,
                    probably one of THE most used zones within all the game.&nbsp; Thankfully, I was just
                    running through, but I decided to see just how many players were in the zone.&nbsp; All
                    said and done... 115 people.&nbsp; I just laughed to myself, and wondered how ANYONE was
                    accomplishing anything. Granted, it can be done, and I hunted there myself when things
                    were around the same level of overcrowding, but I am not even playing on Fennin Ro, or one
                    of the other completely over used servers.&nbsp; The server I do play on usually runs
                    about 1900 per a night.&nbsp; I would like to comment on the number that you posted...
                    1800 per a server. I found it interesting, as in the published information before the game
                    became such a huge success, was 1000-1500 MAX on a server.&nbsp;</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">[Ed: I have never seen those
                    numbers published.&nbsp; Where are they? I'd love to include that reference in my
                    article.]</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3"> I think it's almost funny that now they wish
                    to push the number to 1800.&nbsp; Oh well. I can't stop them from allowing 3000 people on
                    a server, but I would stop playing. You are right on so many points.&nbsp; role-playing,
                    although I am an avid RPer, even in EQ, doesn't happen, and you don't get to advance any
                    faster by RPing. But I would stop playing if the game lost all fun. Right now the camping
                    is so rampant, it's pathetic. People Kill Steal left and right because no one wants to
                    venture to the &quot;hard&quot; zones.&nbsp; To me, the game limit should be at 1500, and
                    I am one of the supporters for a cap in the game.&nbsp; Even though you aren't.... here is
                    why.&nbsp; </font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">I know for a fact that all of my friends that
                    play the game have many characters on many servers.&nbsp; If there was a game cap put into
                    place, I would just go to another server. I don't have characters around for nothing. I
                    have characters around I enjoy playing.&nbsp; Yes, perhaps I wouldn't get to play with
                    John and Chris one night, but I could definitely make other friends.&nbsp; We had to make
                    friends to begin with, you can make some more...and I for one do believe that the game
                    play would be improved with a limit cap in place.&nbsp; But, that's just my opinion.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">[Ed: I have heard many people
                    voice the same argument.&nbsp; Here is why I think it won't work.&nbsp; I may be wrong. =)
                    &nbsp; </font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Though you have characters
                    that you enjoy on many servers, I am guessing that most people do not.&nbsp;&nbsp; EQ is a
                    very time sensitive game.&nbsp; You must really play for 2 or 3 hours to make any
                    noticeable progress.&nbsp; If I was forced to spend an hour finding a good group my play
                    time is reduced too much for my liking.&nbsp;&nbsp; The more compelling scenario however,
                    is this, what happens when all servers reach their cap and you cannot login at all?
                    &nbsp; The average number of players is over 1500 already.&nbsp; Five new servers added
                    yesterday wouldn't even bring numbers down that low.]</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">I for one use the unused zones to hunt in.
                    It's the only way I can get anything accomplished on my server.&nbsp; I would love to be
                    able to sit out in a zone that is open, and easy to use...but I can't.&nbsp; With over 100
                    people in Easter Commons, and 75 in Western Commons daily on our server.. it's just
                    pathetic.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">Verant, in my opinion, could most definitely
                    afford to place other routers up to decrease log in problems, and to decrease lag within
                    the game.&nbsp; Maybe some don't see different routers as a solution, but I do.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">[Ed: I guess I just don't
                    understand what you mean by router.&nbsp; You are not referring to it in the hardware
                    routing packets sense, or at least I don't think you are.&nbsp; I, for one, do not have
                    login problems.&nbsp; I do have server crowding crowding problems though. I apolgize for
                    not grasping your idea.]</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">This may sound pompous, but as far as the
                    class imbalance (and I play an enchanter for my main character... I could go on and on
                    about being &quot;weak&quot; compared to all the other casters... :)&nbsp;)&nbsp; if you
                    are going to complain about it, play another class.&nbsp; We all know there are problems
                    with the classes... but in one way, that is what makes the game so interesting.&nbsp; If
                    you want to power level, everyone knows play a druid (I HATE DRUIDS! stop killing me :P)
                    if you want a challenge, well my friend, I would definitely suggest an Enchanter or a
                    Rogue.&nbsp; There are a lot of classes to chose from, and until Verant fixes itself, play
                    another one if you are that unhappy with your current one.&nbsp; I for one would rather
                    see all the other problems fixed before this one, because to me, this is the least of
                    them.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3">There are&nbsp; many, many more issues to
                    cover, but I've gone on for long enough.&nbsp; In general, I want Verant to KNOW it has
                    problems. To KNOW that the customers are NOT satisfied, and most are really unhappy.&nbsp;
                    Their customer service base is very, VERY lacking... would it kill them to get a 1-800
                    number? I know they are making a ton of money off of us!&nbsp; They don't have emails for
                    complaints in genearl, and whenever you have a problem, not only are you paying for the
                    lack of ability to play, you have to pay for a long distance phone call as well??
                    ugh.&nbsp; They need to get organized. They wanted to be the best out there, they got
                    it...they have the awards for all the &quot;Best ofs...&quot; out there, now it's time to
                    do what you can to KEEP THEM!&nbsp; Start paying attention to the customer, and as the old
                    addage goes.... &quot;the customer is always right!&quot;</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">[Ed: I have to agree that the
                    customer service is lacking. Imagine the idiotic calls they would get to a 1-800 number
                    though.&nbsp; Customer service is a topic I will touch on in another article.&nbsp; Oh,
                    the customer is not always right. Especially when there are 170,000 of them all screaming
                    for something different. =) ]</font></p>
