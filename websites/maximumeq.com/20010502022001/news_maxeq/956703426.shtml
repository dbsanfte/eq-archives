<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Exactly what TIME on the 24th will Kunark be opened? Right on Sunday night at Midnight? The reason i ask is because I am contemplating taking a personal day off to explore Kunark all morning/day/night of Monday the 24th. Most likely, i'll pull an all-nighter from Sunday night straight on through Monday. <BR>
</font>
It's too early to nail down a specific time for certain, however I think we'll probably aim for early in the morning during off-peak hours.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Before this issue gets out of hand I'd like to clear it up. We have no intention of policing station names to the level of character names, because as many people mentioned so few see them. I would however like to refer everyone to the Station community policies that make it clear that the transmission of vulgar content to station servers is against policy and will result in an account being deactivated. <BR>
As for the people who were banned as a result of a vulgar station name, we are working with them now to get them set up on accounts with acceptable names. A few things were done out of order which resulted in the accounts being deactivated prior to other arrangements being set up. We've handled that problem internally. <BR>
<BR>
The reason why this is being enforced is that people do have the ability to post on this board as well as other Station operated boards with the station name that they create, hence we don't want people subjected to vulgar names. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;I have been VERY careful to NOT become KOS to the Fire Goblins in Sol A, simply to make CWG hunting and trips to Sol B that much easier...<BR>
But after last night's patch, I find myself KOS to them automatically.....<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Will this be fixed, or is this the way it will be..?<BR>
</font>
I'm investigating this issue, here's where I am now:<BR>
<BR>
The Faction guy says that the goblins should have been KOS to everyone all along. However, no one made a specific change in regards to that zone or faction. My best guess at the moment is that another bug was fixed someplace else that may have had the effect of clearing up a few faction issues, but I'm still investigating.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Now I am not saying make everything incredibly cheap, but at least lower the prices to a more reasonable level. I would understand if a SOW potion cost 4pp to make, that way they could sell for 5pp, make a profit and everyones happy<BR>
</font>
I'll look into seeing if we can get the costs associated with alchemy looked in to after issues with the expansion are cleared up. I do think that some of the costs are a bit high, but I wouldn't expect them to get so cheap that it replaces the need for a class in your group. <BR>

Those are always fun, until the swaying back and forth starts, and the fish eye vision.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>On Saterday, May 13, there will be a spring carnival organized the Silent Echos guild on the Quellious server.  The events will include a drunk run, tournement, language exchange, corpse hunt, and of course, a newbie event.  We are expecting it to be big so we would like people or guilds to email us if they are coming so we can get an approximate count.  Our email is <a href="mailto:silentechos1@yahoo.com">silentechos1@yahoo.com</a>.<BR>

If you want to see everything about our events, our guild events page is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/silentechos1/events.html">www.geocities.com/silentechos1/events.html</a>.  We hope to see you there!</font></p>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Well some good news. We worked today with our Shipping Company and have them working around the clock to get the orders out to make sure they arrive by the 24th. Any orders placed after today we won't be able to guarantee with the holidays coming up. Any orders placed today or before *should* arrive depending of course on the country (we have a lot less control over the International stuff). We're bumping up the priority of any orders we don't feel would make it in time in any case that we are able.<BR>
Again, I apologize for the problems.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>BetaNeutral is the standard faction that is applied to NPCs that we want to remain available to everyone, regardless what they do. It is generally only applied to merchants that need to like (or at least not hate) everyone, the PoDs, etc. It generally isn't applied to anything that people tend to kill in a normal day on EQ. <BR>
Chances are that the BetaNeutral NPC you found in Befallen was set that way by mistake, which sometimes happens. We have added ways to the game to increase the betaneutral faction to handle these specific cases.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
These two new servers will be coming up later this evening. They will be for new characters, meaning that we are not moving people from other servers to them. <BR>
<BR>
We'll have more information to release on the other two servers, which will be overflow/split servers, later this week.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it possible to make weapons with more than one spell effect procs?<BR>
</font>
No. The way our item database works only allows us to assign one spell to an item. You can however use a weapon that procs in conjunction with a spell that makes you proc (Vampiric Embrace comes to mind). They just can't both go off in the same round.<BR>
