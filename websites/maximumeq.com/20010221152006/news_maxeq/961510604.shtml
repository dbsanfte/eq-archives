<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;GM ressurections constrained by 49 cleric spell...<BR>
</font>
No, they are not. They return 100% of the experience lost. They used to be constrained, not by the 49th cleric rez, but by the XP modifier for the zone. All rez's were constrained by this. <BR>
<BR>
It was corrected a few months ago.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2- The 49th level cleric spell has a 2 hour time limit on xp return. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
All rez's have this two hour limit, not just the 49th cleric rez. We're currently looking into the possibility of having the GM Rez excluded from this time limit, but it's difficult, so I don't have an ETA. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, when you make a petition and log out, that petition is cleared. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
No, it's not. Petitions are held for several hours before they expire.<BR>

If you have one, you had best read.<BR><BR>

Please, don't go and flame Verant on their boards.  They made a mistake and admitted it well in advance of fixing it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello Everyone,<BR>
As many noticed in the last patch message, the Gunthak Harpoon (a 15/31 piercer) was made a rentable (meaning permanent) item. As it turns out, this was a big mistake on our part. Basically, one of the guys on the Team received an email about it being NORENT, figured that this was a bug, and fixed the item.<BR>
<BR>
Even with the item's disadvantages, its stats make it something that should only have been available in the deepest parts of Veeshan's Peak, if at all. <BR>
<BR>
In the next item patch, it will again be made NORENT, meaning that it will disappear like a summoned item the next time you log off. I do apologize to those who obtained the item in the meantime.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Fake Items">Fake Items</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/10/00 12:32 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It seems there is a huge influx of fake items lately (hence, why not many item updates).  One excellent example is the Cobalt BP.  I've had several versions submitted to me.<BR><BR>

I've gone from giving the submitter the benefit of the doubt, to if there is doubt, not posting it.  I'd rather not have an item listed than have a bunch of fake items on the site.</font></p>

The bestiary on MaxEQ is now live for everyone to see!<BR><BR>

Every MOB that we have listed at least shows the zone(s) that it resides in, as well as it's level.  I'm still missing pictures on almost all of them, as well as drops.  I have faction hits for most, I just haven't put them in yet.<BR><BR>

Several changes will be found thought the site in the coming week to integrate the bestiary fully.  Until then, click on the bestiary link, and enjoy!<BR><BR>

For some reason, it reloaded a bunch of old ip tables, and started pointing us back to it.  This is a Bad Thing.<BR><BR>

Several heart attacks later (by me) and a quick e-mail, and it was fixed.<BR><BR>

Thank you to all concerned who sent in an e-mail.</font></p>

Not that it's much help if you are going to purchase one of these runes from a vendor or player mind you.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;We have two runes of Fulguration, both marked the same but for different spells.<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;We have two runes of Attraction - same issue.<BR>
</font>
We should probably mark these runes Azia and Beza and update the research text accordingly. I'll see what I can do.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I seem to recall at one point you saying that Tracking was not working exactly as intended and that you were looking for suggestions to fix it?<BR>
</font>
Actually we said that it works appropriately and that we've no short term plans to enhance it. We'd like to improve it sometime, like other things in the game, they just can't all be on the docket at once. <BR>
<BR>
Our focus now is creating new and enticing content that can keep people busy and entertained for a good deal of time, rather than just making everyone more efficient fighters.<BR>
