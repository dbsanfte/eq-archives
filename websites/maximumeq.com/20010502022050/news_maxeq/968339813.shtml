I don't want to run the risk of readers of MaxEQ somehow being infected by a backdoor or virus.  Nothing personal.<BR><BR></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
Another scam has been found. Someone has put up a web page offering a utility called the "EverQuest Connection Enhancer". This is actually a program that installs a backdoor virus (Norton: Backdoor.SubSeven) that will allow people access to your EverQuest login information as well as other private information on your system. We are going to try to get the site closed down.<BR>
<BR>
As always, we recommend that you do not use any programs from an untrusted source.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Same thing is Happening to Eq now. It only takes a matter of time until someone makes a program that can dupe and copy images. It has been working for i would say atleast a month or 2. It has just now been confirmed due to the numbers of people who aquired this program hack. I dont know what verant is gonna do, or what they can for that matter. <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a version of ShowEq on linux that Verant cant detect, and now this. <BR>
There isn't any third-party program that allows people to dupe. Character data is stored server-side, so only actions taken within game can affect it. ShowEQ is a packet-sniffer, and entirely passive program that just reads data. Sending modified data back to the server would be detected instantly. <BR>
<BR>
That said there have been actions that one could take in game to cause a dupe, but all known instances of this problem have been repaired. Furthermore, with the level of logging that we have, and have had for several months now, we can detect both past and new dupes and take action swiftly. We've banned over 50 accounts since Thursday of last week and are still in the process of analyzing the data. For these reasons, these problems really do not represent a threat to the economic health of EverQuest. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The dragons aren't KOS to everyone.
<BR><BR>
Aside from that, how is having a dragon wandering around an area where level 30 people hang out any different from having Griffins and Hill Giants in areas where low level folk hang out?
