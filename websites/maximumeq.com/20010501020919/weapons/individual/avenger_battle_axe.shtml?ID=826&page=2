<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Allrighty, here's a few basics on the quest for you.  I have done it a couple times, and I can solo the mobs at lvl 22 and get good exp.  Slaythe is in misty thicket, his spawn is triggered by asking Broning Higginsbot "what small favor?"  Faldor is a bit more complicated.  He spawns in the black crows tavern in qeynos, in the back room with the fake wall.  His placeholder is a beggar.  Now, here's where it gets tricky.  You have to kill the beggar, then that will trigger Faldor's spawn Exactly 2 Hours Later.  So, feel free to go do something else, just come back before the 2 hours are up and hope someone else isn't there camping him.  In my opinion, no, you can't tell the person "excuse me, I killed the bandit 2 hours ago, so this spawn belongs to me" since they were there first and you left, but that's just my 2 cents.  This quest is great for someone lvl 22 or so, and you get a cool axe out of it too.<BR>

B4 you start quest be sure that you want to sit in a small room for hours and hours.<BR>
Faldor is really really rare spawn.<BR>
In the same time you can do langseax quest 10 times.<BR>
Other problem is: if Faldor spawns, what do the other NPCs in Crow do they assist, is it good to go down secret tunnel to kill him any hints ?<BR>

I have talked to others who have been camping him and no dice there either.  If anyone HAS seen him please post where he was at the time.

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I have completed this quest yesterday. When you hit level 20, Beno Targnale in Kaladim warrior's guild gives you the 'Eye of the Stormhammer' quest. Ask him "what eye of the stormhammer ?". He will then give you a letter you must bring to the jail clerk in Highkeep. A halfling has stolen the eye and has been imprisonned in Highkeep and Beno wants him to be transfered to Kaladim.<BR>
When you arrive in Kaladim and give the letter to the clerk, she tells you that the halfling has escaped from jail and must have returned to Misty Ticket. She gives you the incomplete eye of stormhammer which she found in his cell. It's a container in which you'll have to store 2 emerald shard to get the eye.<BR>
Next stage : Misty Ticket. From Rivervale head to the gate and go to the second tower left to the gate. The halfling is on top of the tower so you'll have to climb the ladder. To get the quest you must have good faction with Rivervale DeepPockets. If you aren't at least indifferent to them, bring bandages to the halfling standing on the roof of Lil Honeybugger's house (south-east area of Misty). I was dubious to DeepPockets and had to turn him about 140 bandages to get amiably. Then go back to the halfling on the tower and ask him "what small problem ?". He will tell you that a bounty-hunter is on his trail, a froglok named Slaythe spawns when you speak with the halfling. He spawns behind a huge stump between the north-west orc camp and the wall and cons blue or white to a level 21. Once you've killed him, he drops a no drop leg which you turn back to the halfling. He will then give you a key. The first shard is in a chest in Highkeep, you'll have to give the key to the bank clerk there. Ask the halfling "where is the second emerald shard ?", he will tell you that a guild leader in Kelethin has the shard of what wood-elves call the gem of Tunare.<BR>
Next stage : Kelethin. Find the thieves guild and talk to the leader (wood elf female in the first room) and ask her "where is the gem of Tunare ?". She answers you that a thief named Faldor Hendrys has stolen the second shard. If you ask here "where is Faldor Hendrys ?", she answers you that she doesn't know where he is, but that the thieve's brother should know about it. The brother is named Elmion Hendrys and is in Dagnor's Cauldron. He belong to the magnificent four, a group of 4 clerics (a wood elf, a dwarf, a gnome and a high elf). They are in a camp near the zone to Butcherblock. Find him and ask him "where is Faldor ?" He will tell you that his half-brother has moved to Qeynos and that he likes playing and spending his money.<BR>
You have 2 hours and 30 minutes to reach Qeynos.<BR>
Next stage : Qeynos. Find the Crows Tavern in North Qeynos, it's a casino. Sit on the bar and keep an eye to the door that leads to the little room (which is the secret entrance to thievs guild). 2 hours and 30 minutes after having talked to Elmion, a beggar will spawn, he is the place holder for Faldor, so you'll have to kill him. 1 hour after having killed the first beggar, a second one will spawn, kill him too. 1 hour after having killed the second beggar (or 2 hours after the first), Faldor will spawn. He will go out of the room and walk to Qeynos Hills, don't attack him or all the tavern will aggro you. Once Faldor has reached the priest of discord, you can kill him without being disturbed by any NPC. Faldor cons blue to a level 21 and is really easy to kill.<BR>
Now you have the 2 shards, put them in the container and combine them. You'll get the eye of the stormhammer which is a gem that give +5 to saves vs poison, disease and magic. If you turn it back to Beno in Kaladim, you'll get the Avenger Battle Axe.</font></td></tr></table>
