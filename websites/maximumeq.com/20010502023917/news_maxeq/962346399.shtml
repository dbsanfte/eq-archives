It is especially noticable if you have clarity and a bard singing the mana song.  Personally, I've had 2 bubs of mana disappear after casting the level 5 stun (takes 30 mana) and I was level 40 at the time.<BR><BR>

You can get rid of the "phantom mana" by activating a procing item (JBoots, Staff of Temperate Flux, etc) or by casting a spell, but cancelling it by ducking.</font></p>

I play a level 41 bard and my most usual partner is a level 40 druid.<BR>
Between combats, I, of course, play the mana song constant. <BR>
<BR>
The bug is this:<BR>
<BR>
Every tick of the mana song moves her blue bar up a little, but only every other tick affects her mana pool. This is speculation based on information from the internet and actual experience, I dont actually know that only every other tick affects the mana pool. However, as soon as she is full mana she casts group sow or group regen. This being a 120 mana spell and she having about 1500 mana should us less than half a bubble of mana, but it always uses almost two bubbles of mana. This leads me to believe that the opening statement of this paragraph must be accurate.<BR>
<BR>
Please make the Mana Song's effect on the Mana bar coincide with the actual effect on the Mana Pool.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
I took a look at this and couldn't find a problem with it. If you, or anyone else has any more specific information, feel free to forward it to eqtesting@verant.com<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Brad speaks about the test server pwipe">Brad speaks about the test server pwipe</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/21/00 13:09 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It will be interesting to see what happens to the test server population.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Despite the Pwipe, more than 95% of the average population on the test server were playing tonight anyway.<BR>
They were there, starting anew, despite the huge time loss due to the PWipe.<BR>
<BR>
We also received a lot of heartfelt emails (and very few flames).<BR>
<BR>
So, after discussing this issue with 180 or so players on Test tonight, we've decided to seriously consider the following 2 options:<BR>
<BR>
1. Do an item wipe on Test (i.e. restore the characters but without items).<BR>
2. Move on a voluntary basis characters from Test to Live servers. The characters would NOT go across with items.<BR>
<BR>
It is also possible we will do both.<BR>
<BR>
I got a lot of good feedback and passionate opinions and responses tonight, and I really appreciate it. The spirit of the vast majority of the players on Test is truly amazing and I admire you all.<BR>
<BR>
While a total player wipe with select individuals being buffed to test mid and higher level zones might be clinically best for the Test Server, I think it's more fair to the players and testers there to do one or both of the options above.<BR>
<BR>
In closing, if we choose option 2 (or both 1 and 2) I would really encourage those players on Test who are there more for playing and less for testing to seriously consider moving.<BR>
<BR>
Another wipe, player or item, is not necessarily unlikely some time in the future.<BR>
<BR>
Your comments and feedback are welcome,<BR>

Again, just read the quote, it speaks for itself.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We have one server on order at present. It will be a split-server which will probably take accounts from Karana and Bertox. Any other new servers that are planned in the foreseeable future will most-likely be split-servers until we get server population down a bit on some of the more populated servers.

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="A few words on player wipes">A few words on player wipes</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/21/00 01:25 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Hopefully daily backups at least are kept.  When I played on test, rollbacks of 3 or 4 days were not uncommon, and they hurt.  Especially if you found some rare loot during that period.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm just curious as to whether or not we on the 'live' servers would be subject to the same kind of player whipe suffered by by test. <BR>
</font>
I can't imagine us ever doing a player-wipe on the Live servers. The most likely response to any wide-spread character problems would probably be a roll-back to a previous back-up.<BR>
<BR>
<font cololr=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Since we have the same warning about this in our user agreements(none), i'm just wondering what would stop our servers from being whiped if someone found the next turnips or something.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
I should stress that everyone on Test should have been aware of the possibility. Though the "Disclaimer" in the patch message was only put up a few months ago, and only modified to specifically mention P-wipes today, we've commented numerous times that it would always remain a possibility on that server. <BR>
<BR>
The purpose of the Test server is to test changes before they go live. Players there can often get the opportunity to experience new changes and items prior to the general public and have the opportunity to comment and particpate directly in the development process from the players perspective. That said, when the test server ceases to funtion as a test platform, we need to restore it to its original intent.<BR>
<BR>
As I mentioned in the patch message, everyone who built their characters on Test have our sincerest sympathies, but we do need to test on the server.<BR>
