I aquired this staffa t lvl 29 or so.  It was only doable with the help of a lvl 50 Necromancer(IRL Friend).<BR>
The rods are in the following locations<BR>
Lake rathe--under the 3bird island<BR>
HighKeep--under a waterfall<BR>
Neriak Foreign Quarter(NeriakB)--Outside the Blind Fish Bar<BR>
Dagnor's Cauldron--Steraight out and right from the KK ent.<BR>
Unrest--Opposite the Gnomish Spelunker<BR>
EverFrost--Under the river, follow the right wall to a house<BR>
Qeynos Catacombs--In the Shark Room.. wander around<BR>
Oasis of Marr--Underwater tower near Spec. tower<BR>
Lower Guk-- This is an easy one, in the Hand room, the     Lord group kills it, so just ask and they'll let ya grab it<BR>
<BR>
Erud Crossing--This is the big momma, this rod is the one that keeps anyone without a LOT of VERY big friends from getting this staff.  The last rod is guarded by SIX lvl 45 Killer Sharks.  Last time I checked, the Sharks see through all invis.. not sure about invisibility to animal.. but I wouldnt count on it.  The Sharks aggro everything,, including eachother.  I got the rod before there were 6, there used to be 3, and 2 would fight and while they are fighting you swim down.  But,, cant do that now.. You're gonna have to wait unless you're in an Uber Guild =) Sorry all ya baby Wizards hehe<BR>

I've seen someone try using invis animals.... they didn't come back up. Then i saw another druid go down there saying he was doing it for fun he cast invis vs animals and i sat and watched from the surface.

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>STAFF OF THE WHEEL COMPLETE INFORMATION<BR>
=======================================<BR>
<BR>
Erud's Crossing-I'm not sure what the big deal about this rod is. I arrived at Erud's crossing, this being my last piece, pretty excited to obtain the rod. I arrived and went the the appropriate LOC as listed in other posts here. I did the trick where you rest your eyes right on the top of the water to see all the way down. And there they were, several nasty sharks. I tried invis, but they still scowled. I paid a Shaman 100pp to come to Erud's X-ing and give me Invis. to Animals. I went back to the LOC and they were still scowling. I hemmed and hawed around for another 1/2 hour. Not sure what I was going to do. Then I finally got fed up and just dove for it. I dove down to the left of the shark formation (if you are looking top down and out to sea) Then I snuck up along the bottom very slowly till the rod was in view. Then I inched forward until I was able to pick up the rod and then snuck back up to the surface. The sharks never attacked. Victory.<BR>
<BR>
Neriak-Being a human I was unable to get into Neriak without being attacked. Therefore I simply did as the other posts suggest and create a dark elf to get comfortable with the LOC of the rod. Then I did a simple invis. and walked through the gates into the second zone of Neriak. Then I jumped of the bridge into the first spot of water I came to and swam left around the bend to the four windows. Picked up the rod (and the coin there for good measure) and gated out.<BR>
<BR>
Lake Rathe/Oasis-I may have been lucky on these two rods. I invised and swam to the LOC and found the towers. In both cases there were several DW Goblins. Most conned indiferent to my Invis. but some were scowling. I approached the tower from the top, where there were only two or three goblins on top. None of them scowled so I was able to sneak down there and grab the rod off of each tower. I used enduring breath for the Lake Rathe one, because it is pretty far back in there. But in any event I received both rods.<BR>
<BR>
Lower Guk- I enlisted the aid of a high level Shadow Knight who gave me invis to undead. I simply walked through guk to the hand room. He went up and killed the hand and then I came up and picked up the rod and gated. I imagine this would have been very difficult w/o invis. to undead. The room with the hand is some crazy water room that defies the laws of physics. You have to actually swim upwards. Its hard to explaing you'll see what I mean when you get there. I recommend help of a higher level player. The rod was very easy for me to see. Didn't "blend" in with the floor.<BR>
<BR>
Unrest- This is so easy I won't even explain.<BR>
<BR>
Everfrost- I used enduring breath to get to the underwater caves. Hugged the right wall and didn't run into any nasties. Made it to an opening with a small hut in the middle. Killed the ice boned skeletons inside it and picked up the rod. Gated out and Victory!<BR>
<BR>
Highpass- This is very easy too. Just go there and get it.<BR>
<BR>
Qeynos Aqueducts- The sharks in the pond scowled but were very green. They left me alone and I jumped in a grabbed the rod and gated. You must go "down" into the sewers through a secret door. Get a map and look for the two sharks, you'll find it.<BR>
<BR>
Dagnor's Cauldron- This one wasn't too bad. Once you find the loc. It's not right outside of Kedge. You need to swim towards the island and the floor drops down a bit. It's down in a little crater there. Did not need enduring breath here.<BR>
<BR>
Took the rods to Sulgar in Everfrost, found him at exact location. Asked for the box (or whatever) and place the rods in the box and hit combine. Created the staff and the gem (whatever it is). Total time was about 5 hours, I'm a level 33 Wizard on Povar. Any questions, email me at "dan@lastoria.com"<BR>
