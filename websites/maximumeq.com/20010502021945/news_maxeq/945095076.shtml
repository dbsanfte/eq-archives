<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Nerfs VS Improvements">Nerfs VS Improvements</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 12/08/99 09:10 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>From Brad to you... <p>
This is interesting stuff.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>I and the rest of the 'nerfing team' put the following document together listing both enhancements and 'nerfs' we've made to the game since launch. And while we probably forgot some things, both negative and positive (please let us know and I'll update the document), I think it puts in perspective the ratio of positive vs. negative changes to the game we've made. I also feel it heartily invalidates the assertion that we are out to make the game harder or to have players advance slower overall, or that 'all we do is nerf'. 
<p>
The following is broken down by class, and then addresses those changes made that affect the whole game. Changes we feel are positive from just about any perspective are denoted with a '+', and those some players might consider a 'nerf', but that we felt were important for the long term health of the game, are denoted with a '-'. 
<p>
(again, I'm sure we've forgotten some things, both '+' and '-'; please feel free to comment and add items).

Better late than never I suppose.  My apologies to the folks at Sanctuary.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>You are surprised to see a fat greasy looking elf standing in the road before you. He is pacing back and forth and seems to be deep in thought.
<p>

Suddenly he notices you.
<p>

"Oh, great one!" he exclaims. "Please pardon this poor old elf, but we have a terrible problem. Someone has discovered the way to Sanctuary."
<p>

"When we opened the EQ Marketplace, we had no idea that some rube would stumble onto the passageway.  The competition will kill us!"

<p>
You wait for the elf to pause for a moment and then ask, "What is Sanctuary?"
<p>

"What is Sanctuary?  Ha! Why it's only the sleeziest, most run down, evil infested area in the entire world of Norrath! They say you can buy and sell anything in Sanctuary." The elf seems to shiver at the very thought.

<p>
"Of course the evil ones should have a marketplace of their own." he says. "Keeps 'em away from us decent folk."

<p>
"Uh!  What do you mean how do you get there?  Well of course I know the way, not that I've ever been there myself mind you."

<p>
It's located at

<p>
http://www.gamingauctions.com/everquest/markets/eqmarkets.cfm

<p>
The little elf looks up at you with a sly grin.  "But Mighty One, you wouldn't want to go to Sanctuary!  Would you?"

<p>
He bows slightly and then turns and walks away into the teeming mass of people shopping in the Marketplace.

And depending on how much 10% of the money is there will be many people who will split the 10%. 
<p>
The remaining 50% will go twards other events, if we collect enough money this time, then many comodities will be free, and there will be more to offer. Plus it will enhance our Christmas and New Year Bazaar's. Also note: Grand Prize Winners will be given one week to claim there prize, all others will be given 5 days.
<p>
Treasure Hunt: at 12:00 noon EST you will be allowed to enter the hunt. After all enteries have been recieved the hunt will begin.
