<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok, I have been told that this is one of the hardest quests in the game and I have also been told that it is pretty simple. There seem to be rumours around being spread by people that haven't got or ever done the quest.Please can anyone who has got armor of ro post in the whole quest if it isn't too much trouble. I would also like to know whether it is a hard quest to solo at 50. I have a 50 erudite wizzie friend that might help me get some stuff and I want to ask him if he could help me get some ro. Please tell me if he will be able to solo anyone you will encounter and have to kill during the quest. Thank you all for your time.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>So far I have gotten the molds of the greaves and the gauntlets, and I have made the gauntlets.  First off, don't bother with this unless you are a very patient person.  To start the quest you need to get the main component off of a rare spawn, most times the component is no drop, but the greaves component i know is not.  Secondly, take that component(s) to the paladin guild representative in Rathe Mts., I know that you used to have to have high faction to start any of those, but i've heard rumors you don't anymore.  After that you need Soil of underfoot that you get from turning in faery dusts.  (faerys are pretty low level i think, faery guards are about 25-27)  You MUST have high amiable faction to get dusts, i recommend using the bone chips quest. You must also have MistMoore granite, IMO it is very very difficult to obtain, you can only get it off of gargoyles that are higher levels and its NO DROP.  While you are in MM, do the flower quest to get your faction with the temple of solusek up. You'll thank yourself later.  Then head out to Solusek and get some Melatite, off of clockworks or bought from gnomes or what i did and bought from a PC.  Then head into the temple and get the cauldren from Lord Searfire which you must have high amiable to get (this is where you thank yourself).  Tell him you seek the Armor of Ro and follow the clues he gives.  Next find an enchanter and get 2 enchanted platinum bars, i bought them myself for 105 pp each and a guildmate enchanted them for me.  Now you can make Ronium, stick the soil of underfoot, sands of ro (forgot to mention, get from sand giants), melatite, mm granite, and 2 bars (seperate) into the cauldren and combine.  Now find a forge put in the ronium and the mold (ONLY THE MOLD AND RONIUM) combine and with the slightest smithing skill you should get some piece of armor.  It took me around 2 weeks to get my gauntlets (which i love)  and made the money to cover the plat bars from the time of those 2 weeks.  Good luck, good hunt, and may the light of Marr shine upon you.</font></td></tr></table>

One Question:  I dont understand the soil of underfoot componet.  I read above that you can get it through a faery dust quest....where is this and can anyone explain it a little more clearly plz?  If so  i thank you in advance.  Also is this quest something that i and a Friend can do in an afternoon?  Finally are these Greeves worht all the darn trouble or should i just keep trying to get a pair of silver plated Leggings.....I have Shin greeves now and feel that i can do better some how.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I have managed in only getting the greaves so far (even though i have molds for gloves) Its isnt to hard of a quest u just need to be patient..First of all the paladin camp in Rathe mountains is where u turn in the items for the Molds (to myself i thought that was the easy part of the quest). Then here comes the hard part.. getting the ronium. First of all u need to get malatite..usually just buy from other player because it is camped by farmers and i sell for 150-300 plat depending on the farmer who is camping em. second u neeeed the soil of underfoot.. which can be obtained from cleric guild leader in Kaladim for four farie dust(must have warmly faction to get this, and the item is no drop so u have to do it on your own).3rd of all u need 2 bars of enchanted plat(which can be done by any lvl 34 enchanter who has bought the spel and usually they wont charge you for it) and then u need mist more granite from gargoyles in mist moore castle(this is the hard part because the gargoyles that drop it are in the tower..and u need to find some high lvl group to help u or wait until lvl 39 or so (like i did ) and get into a group to get it yourself. Last of all u need to get some sands of ro which drop of sand giants in Oasis and S Ro.. and this item is dropable so u can easily buy it for 20 plat or so of a PC. now go to lord seafire and ask him "what is ronium" and follow through the hint he gives u.. u get a cauldron to combine all these ingrediants ( DO NOT STACCK PLAT BARS!) and boom u have ronium.. Ronium isnt no drop either so if u wish u can usually buy it of a PC for 1kpp (hell but that takes the fun outta it and makes farmers) when u have both ronium and the mo9ld.. just go to a common fordge and put in and hit combine (and since last patch u dont have to have any smithing skill at all for either ronium of the pieces itself) and BOOM u have the armor of ro. Good luck my fellow paladins on this tedious task.. but be patient the piece u raee waiting for is well  worth the wait!<BR>
