<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>Happy Holidays everybody! The Norrathian Chosen Few of the Mithaniel Marr server will be holding a Holiday party for everyone wanting to attend at the tunnel in East Commons on Friday night 12-22-00 at 9:30PM. Although there seems to be no EggNog recipe in the game (Darn!), there will be free food and beer. There will be a contest type scavenger hunt in which the prize will be 100 platinum.
<br>There will be free buffs and our trade skill veterans will be offering their services for FREE! (Although they will gladly be accepting donations). You will have to supply the materials, and we have master tailors, blacksmiths, bakers, brewers, jewelcrafters, potters, and fletchers (Master means the skill is over 100, there is always a chance of failing on attempts, but a much lower chance than if people with lower skills tried making these items of course). It is taking place after our guild's weekly meeting. We will also be taking applicants names for the people interested in joining a very different guild with high standards. Quests for Membership will be offered to those that feel they are up to the challenge and wish to join the guild after the party on this Friday night. This is a good chance to meet some of the members in the guild, so come join us at the party... with enough drinks you may even feel like hunting for reindeer... although you might want to be careful of how they con to you before getting too close. :) See you all there!

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Tallon Zek: The Coming of Chaos">Tallon Zek: The Coming of Chaos</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 12/20/00 13:54 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This looks like it could be a great time!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>On the Saturday of December 23, I ask that everyone waves good bye to their spawns/loot and commit their next week of eq to non stop pvp, if you die in L-fay, loot your corpse and attack Sk and if you are killed in Ec head over to WK! There are enough Light and Dark zones for every level that by the time you have been killed in all of them, its been an hours since you looted from the first one, and don’t worry about your spawns they will still be there when you get back. Guild Leaders, you can use this as a time to improve your guilds pvp tactics and promote guild unity, and to show everyone what you and your guild is capable of doing, I know the Iron Legion will. 
<br>-To make it easier on people, so that its not pure chaos and they have some zones in mind of where they can find non stop action, I have made a list of War Zones and other places you might want to attack
<br>
<br>War Zones: South Karanas, North Karanas, East Karanas, EC, Qeynos Hills, and Lesser Fay. 
<br>
<br>Darkie Raids in order of Level:
<br>15-25: Crushbone (Darks are not Kos) High Hold Pass (lights are low on life due to constant action, watch for guards) 
<br>20-30: Lake of Ill-Omens (Great area) MM (Darkies arn't kos)
<br>30-40: Fronteir Mountains (good cash) 
<br>40+: Don't know add suggestiongs
<br>
<br>Lightie Raids in Order of Level:
<br>15-25: EC and Nec (already War zone but one of best areas) Oasis (Good area mostly 20+) 
<br>25-35: Warslick woods (connected to Lake zone, good Kunark zone) Lake Rathe (darks are cowards good loot) 
<br>30-40: South Karanas (War zone but still worth stopping by to disrupt dark groups) Overthere (Lighties version of FM, should probally be mid 30s low 40s) 40+: Don't know add suggestions
<br>
<br>City Invasions: Invading Cities can always be fun, strike the enemy where they live..
<br>
<br>You now have your targets, War Zones will be the centers of chaos, they have been chosen for their conveinince, size and advantages. The Karanas zones and EC will be able to hold more people, and will be easier to get to, while zones like Qeynos Hills and Lesser fay will provide advantages and challenges for others. Qeynos gives home to Human retribution, giving them their own area. While Lesser fay gives advantages to darks who have dungeons in which they are not kos, in the area and can be protected by Shortie one teamers. Even with War Zones, Raids on Dark/Light Zones will still be needed in order to spread the chaos of war to those who attempt to escape it through leveling. So tell your friends, your guild, and your enemies that come December 23rd none shall be spared…

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>There are also many new creatures that exist on Velious. The continent's three races--the Coldain (dwarves), the Storm Giants, and the Dragons--are each as thoughtfully crafted as the rest of Norrath's races, and add to the completeness of the EverQuest world. Without spoiling the story, we can tell you these three races have a history of conflict, and as a nice touch, you can form an alliance with one of them (making your travels in each area a bit more pleasant or hostile, depending on who your allies are). There are also some nice tiger- and dinosaur-like creatures in these new environments, and some of the monsters are downright freakish and scary.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>"I loved kunark when it came out, it added soo much to the game. and velious has gone above and beyond that! I think before verant makes any more expansions, they should revamp all of Antonica, Faydwer, Odus and use what they've learned while creating Kunark and Velious.
<br>
<br>Random drops: The way that uber items can drop from any mob in the zone is a great idea, eliminates the need for on person or group to camp the same spawn point, this way several groups or people can hunt several areas of the zone an all have the same chance of obtaining an item. Such as items from shadow's/golems/skeletons in city of mist, or random items off giants in Greater Divide."
<br>
<br>
<br>We reserve the right to do just as you've suggested at any time in the future. With the original game we have to stick to our original system specifications. But there is no reason that we can't use some of the new ideas on the old world. And don't be too surprised if we do… :)

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="ActiveX Backdoor Trojan Warning">ActiveX Backdoor Trojan Warning</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 12/19/00 14:31 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Gordon was kind enough to give us information on this virus. It seems that a fake EQ website was set up, and by visiting there, you could get infected.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>
<br>First: DO NOT GO TO THIS WEB PAGE (Malicious URL removed for your safety). If you insist on going to this web page, you'll need to remove the leading and trailing x's, and then the backdoor from your system. It's made up to look like an official EverQuest web page, and contains an ActiveX backdoor Trojan horse. If this infects your system, keystrokes will be sent to an ICQ address.
<br>Now, if you've curiously gone to the address anyway, you should be able to easily deinfect yourself by deleing EA.HTA from your system (just do a search, it can be found in your C:windowsstart menuprogramsstartup directory) as long as you do so BEFORE YOU REBOOT.
<br>
<br>If you've done gone and rebooted anyway, you'll need to go the long route to remove it (see below). In any case, please feel free to send out the alarm.
<br>
<br>**HOW TO TELL IF YOU ARE INFECTED** Go to your start button, press run. Type in msconfig and hit return. Click on the startup tab. Look in the list presented for an instance of ; run= onz.exe If you have this entry, you will need to manually remove it. To remove this back door; 
<br>
<br>1) Uncheck the check mark next to the run= onz.exe line and then click the apply button at the bottom of the window. 
<br>2) Click on the general tab then click on advanced on the bottom of the window. Check the "enable startup menu" check box, click ok. Click ok again, and allow system to reboot. 
<br>3) DO NOT let the system boot normally. You MUST select "Safe command prompt" from the boot menu. 
<br>4) At the DOS prompt, type in "cd windows" (or the path to your window directory), press the enter key. 
<br>5) Type in "del onz.exe" and then press the enter key. 
<br>6) Reboot your system again. 
<br>7) Select "normal" from the boot menu. 
<br>8) If you get a window stating that the system can NOT find onz.exe, click ok. 
<br>a. Click the Windows Start Button and then click Run. 
<br>b. Type in "system.ini". 
<br>c. You will now see a line that's looks like this; shell=Explorer.exe onz.exe. 
<br>d. Remove the instance of onz.exe so it looks like this; shell=Explorer.exe.
<br>e. Save the changes to the file and then reboot once more. You have now removed the trojan from your system.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>December 19th, 3:00am<BR>
------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
*Patch Day*<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content and other additions.  In addition, the following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<BR>
<BR>
- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in several cases had their casting times increased.  <BR>
- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some adjustments.  Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight than "good acts".  For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your faction with "B".<BR>
- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced by a slight attack-speed debuff.<BR>
- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly.  It was previously only working versus other player characters.<BR>
- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an enhancement.  When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease instead of magic.  In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.<BR>
- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially resisted instead of being "all or nothing".  The net result is that the average damage will be higher.<BR>
- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the normal chance of scoring a critical hit.  Each critical hit has a percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.<BR>
- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp out if you are already sitting).  "/camp server" will take you back to the server selection screen.  "/camp desktop" will take you out to the desktop following a successful camp.  Despite popular request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.<BR>
- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.<BR>
- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command.  This command will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
- The EverQuest Team</font></p>

<br>GM Ozzmar – GM Lithgar
<br>
<br>The Dwarf zones into the dusty atmosphere known as the Arena, grumbling over his wet clothes he looks up at the green named coordinators “Where ya want me!?” Water flies off in all directions as he shakes his head wildly, his beard letting loose the soakend water. “That will be 32pp for entry Dwarf!” the coordinator shouts over the bustling conversations in the entryway. With a grinning smile showing a darkened chipped tooth the Dwarf rustles in his packs, he hands over 30 platinum pieces and 20 gold pieces, which the coordinator gladly accepts. “To your left dorf!, follow the wall until you see your kind, ye know, Gnomes, Halflings, all of you kneebiters!” The dwarf gives a deep chuckle and taps his sword while leaning towards the Coordinator “anytime ye fancy a showdown lad, I’ll be there to cut ya!” the dwarf snaps quickly right before he heads off into the dust. 
<br>
<br>Following the wall the stocky dwarf slows his pace, he sees a mass of people along the huge the blood caked pillar. The stout half sized warrior draws his sword and keeps a deadened gaze at the onlookers, as eyes meet in hatred. Locked, intent on foreseeing each other’s moves, the dwarf cautiously passes the crowd. One heckler shouts at him “Dorf! Joo com ere, mez stik yous now, mez saves us da trubl ltr har har!” A troll of unordinary size hearing the ogres’ humor stands up “ yessh wwwee kud see some foooood before the battle!” The troll uncovers an axe, the blade nearly half its size and bounds towards the dwarf. A scaled warrior seeing the ensuing battle springs into action and follows stride along the husky Troll. Upon seeing the danger, the dwarf throws his packs down and braces his stance as he grips both hands on the hilt of his weapon. His veins begin to bulge on his muscles as he raises the sword up into attack position. Unwavering he scowls at the two hideous forms of intelligence charging at him. But suddenly out of no where, a fire of from the heavens crashes between the Troll and the dwarf. An unfortunate Iksar, now just a slab of charred lizard, finds himself making a second attempt in reaching the arena in time. The dwarf nearly falls over in laughter at the turn of events, remembering clearly the warnings of the coordinator, “No PvP combat until the event starts.” The dwarf understood that this would be a troublesome rule especially in the arena, but in light of what could have just happened, he was glad the rule has been set. Picking up his packs and giving a gesture all too familiar to the Troll he bolts off further down the wall, deep wheezing laughter could be heard fading away from the evil, dark mob.
<br>
<br>The next mob of people was more his size and nature, the dwarf sheaths his sword back into his packs. Gnomes were chattering to each out other in their fast paced tongue. Halflings were casually resting along the wall, so calm and collected they were he noticed. Some halflings were causally combing their foot hair like they didn’t’ have a care in the world, as if they impending battle was to never take place. Grimacing, the dwarf never did like the happy folk but in battle there is something to be said about being able to look a comrade in the eyes. Soon though he did find his Kaladim brothers religiously drinking some ale and with an evil grin that would put Bertoxxulus to shame, he joins his brothers in celebration. “Aye good brothers, pass me some of that fine spirit!” Wiping his mouth he glances up at his dwarven brothers, “The purse? How much?” A dwarf with a holy symbol on his chestplate lifts his head with a smile, “5,000 shinies brother, bettered with my coin and yours.” He pauses for just a second before saying “ and I fully intent on getting my coin back and then some.” All the dwarves and even a few halflings drink to that. 
<br>A green named coordinator walks up the short team drawing their attention with her words. “The rules are this!” as she continues with her speech another cooridinator begins to chant a binding spell on every team member, while taking note of the name of the bounded person and wishing them good luck. The other guide continues “ you will be bound to this location outside of the inner circle, if you fall to misfortune inside the arena you will find yourself where you are now, You are to stay here until the end of the match. If ye decide to break this rule and make way into the inner circle you will be promptly killed and pulled back to your bind point, most importantly though…” the coordinator pauses and makes sure everyone is paying attention. She continues, “…Noted. This note will be used against your team and will result in 250pp being withdrawn from your winning purse and one less person left standing in the end will not count as standing. Beware gladiators this match could easily end early even if some of your team still stands if in fact this rule is broken.” The short warriors and casters nod in agreement all peering at each other in hopes that none would break this costly rule. The coordinator continues, “Once word is giving we will make way into the inner circle and you will all follow me to another pillar much like the one you are now taking shade under. At which point you will gather and patiently discuss your strategies for the battle. “ She pauses. “YOU ARE NOT to engage anyone before the battle is to begin. If so you will be removed from the event.” The coordinator then answers a few questions from some not so bright halflings and in time finally beckons the mob to follow her into the deadly inner circle of the arena.
<br>
<br>The short team was not the first to enter the arena, at the far wall one could see a mass of gleaming weapons and all around them magic being casted in astonishing displays of color. The dwarf was not unnerved by this comical show the elves were displaying. He was quite certain that the dwarving clerics would take very good care of him before the match began. The dwarf did respect the numbers the elven brotherhood held though, when he was finally settled in the location the guide had brought them, he stared intently on the elves counting their numbers. He counted 3 or 4 scores of the pointed eared kind from his vantage point. Comparing the force of his army to theirs he knew the elves had a few more blades. This prompted another deep chuckle from the dwarf for he also knew without a doubt that elves were terrible in battle. Feeling confident the dwarf opens his flask of ale and throws back a gulp, undoing his weapon from his pack along with a sharpening stone. The dwarf relaxes in savoring the sound of the stone against the metal and little sparks that it creates. “Warrior magic…” he mumbles letting his thoughts drift over the prizes the purse will buy him.
<br>
<br>The short team and the elf team already stationed inside the arena, next comes in the human team. Their chins held high, they all walk into a chosen spot between the two teams already preparing for battle. Not much is heard from this team as they talk amongst themselves. If looked closely you could see the inner struggles some of the human clans were facing about the two other teams inside the arena. Fortunately, greed has its way of temporally setting aside friendships and the human team starts to enchant each other with spells to improve prowess in battle. The Eurdites form a circle and meditate in unison, while the barbarians much like the dwarfs sit quietly sharpening their weapons carefully inspecting the opposition with wry smiles on their battle worn faces.
<br>
<br>The final team entering the arena creates a terrible display of vulgarity, bringing out the worst in the three other teams. The hated participants make their way to their chosen starting location. All eyes are on them and they know it. Taunting back, the evil team composed of the Trolls, Iksars, Ogres and Dark Elves, answer a barrage of insults with hideous laughter. What was most astonishing about the evil team was the size of the army they brought together. 5 or more scores of the wretched kind were eagerly awaiting a chance to inflict pain and suffering on the other teams. This brought much pride to the evil brethren but on the same token much fear. They all knew that the other teams would likely stop at nothing in bringing them down. The general air of the arena among the other 3 teams seemed to silently reinforce this disheartening thought. 
<br>
<br>A cooridinator raises his voice to the point that everyone in the arena could hear. “All teams are in place, no other participants will be allowed, and no spectators will see this event. The only way to now leave this inner circle is through Victory or Death!!” this prompts battle screams and mottoes from all 4 of the teams. When the cries calm down the coordinator continues, “The purse is counted at 7400 platinum pieces to be divided up amongst the winning team. We will now give you 10 minutes to make final preparations for battle. No PvP will be tolerated before the announcement is to begin.!!” The coordinator heads back to his chosen team and watches for infractions of the rules he stated. 
<br>
<br>For the next ten minutes, the atmosphere of the arena is of a calm before the storm. Casters are hurriedly finishing off final buffings to their teammates. Leaders are planning strategies and organizing teammates into groups. Coordinators are taking their places at both entrances readying their weapons for infractions of the rules. A two minutes warning is giving to the zone to prepare for battle.
<br>
<br>A noble High Elf woman makes her way to the very center of the teams. Equipped with a flaming sword, Lady Daegarmo asks for a moment of silence in the seconds before the battle. Welcome to the Test of Teams citizens of Norrath! I wish you all the best of luck! On my mark…” She pauses for the remaining seconds of the 10 minute warning. 
<br>
<br>At the top of her lungs Lady Daegarmo screams with the power of the Gods, “FIGHT!!!!!”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>This is not a pre-scheduled Event. There will be know prior notification as to when this event takes place. But it will. 
<br>If you see the announcement of this event on your server, we invite you to rally with your races and take part in the excitement.

Have fun!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>This Friday, 12/22, the Sacred Jesters of Quellious are sponsoring a Christmas party. The party will begin in Kelethin at approx. 6pm EST. Refreshments will be available for all who attend.
<br>We will also sponsor a race through Kelethin for levels 1-8 (un-twinked only). Everyone who enters the race will receive a gift, with the top 3 finishers receiving an additional prize. Oh, and it's a drunken race, so those entering should be prepared to fall. :)
<br>
<br>We will then move the party to Freeport for further reverie and a possible scavenger hunt, again for levels 1-8.
<br>
<br>Players of all levels are welcome to attend the party, there will be plenty to drink, and as many cookies as I can come up with.
<br>
<br>On a side note, the Jesters will also be recruiting new members. Anyone with a good sense of humor will be considered.
<br>
<br>Hope to see you all there :)

Well, now is your chance.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>Hail and well met, players of Mithnaniel Marr. For those interested, there will be a player ran dynamic quest on Sunday at eight o’clock eastern standard time (8:00 PM EST) on the Mithaniel Marr server. The quest is directed towards newbies/lowbies ranging from levels five to twelve whom are not twinked (the rewards would be of much better use to those who really need them). Younger heros that are below level five will be accepted, but will do so at their own risk. The quest is roleplay intensive, meaning all questors must remain IC (In character) during the duration of the event. Interested parties should head towards Kelethin, where the quest will begin. I hope to see you all there. :)

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Once again, Verant raises another landmass from out of the oceans of Norrath. The Scars of Velious expansion pack is upon us, and it brings to light the newly discovered island of Velious, which was scarred by the great wurm queen herself, Veeshan, back when the planet was uninhabited. Velious offers players new zones to explore as well as a slew of new items, spells and quests. Verant also increased the polygon count for the new models that inhabit the island, and also increased the level of detail used for the new armor, weapons and textures.
