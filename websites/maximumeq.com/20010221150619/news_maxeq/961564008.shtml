&gt;&gt;&gt;Abashi, Why do undead not get Night vision?<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is this a bug or a feature?<BR>
</font>
Like some other things on the board today, this is just how it is. When creating the illusions we decided what benefits an illusion would have. Night vision wasn't one of them.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Am I correct in that since the release of Kunark, there has been no way for someone who already owns Everquest to buy a copy without re-purchasing the entire game?<BR>
Yes, that's the case. The "Online Store" was taken down shortly after Kunark launched due to some distribution, billing, and shipping issues. We're still working on these.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Please tell me that's not the case and where I can buy the expansion.<BR>
<BR>
If you need it right away, the only option currently available is purchase of the retail box, who's key you can use to upgrade your existing account. I've heard that a few retailers are offering some pretty sizable rebates to existing EQ subscribers, so you should be able to get it near the expansion-upgrade price.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We've posted a new issue of <A href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a> here on Everlore. This week Milo covers a wide variety of topics such as Laissez-faire capitalism, The ethical issues which accompany cloning, and of course The 2nd law of thermodynamics. Oh, he also talks about 3D modeling and EQ stuff too, but you're probably not interested in that... Here's a snip from the page.

    <Blockquote>
    1) When you are about to start on a model, what do you begin with ? The largest part of the body ? Or perhaps the left foremost     finger that have a spot on it ?<P>
 
    2) What is - in your opinion - most important part in modeling a figure that will be animated versus one that will not be animated     (ie. like a human vs. a rock) ?

>>>The drops in Kunark of cash are pathetic, every decent item costs THOUSANDS of plat on Veeshan, and there is NO way to get this kind of money together after nerfing the dwarfs, except by camping rare spawns or HGs, and competeing w lvl 30 characters for kills. I have hunted blue con mobs in almost every outdoor kunark zone and they all drop liek 3sp and a TON of cp drops, WTF is that when you kill 10 lvl 40 mobs and get 11cp a piece?<BR>
</font>
It is true that cash drops in general are getting lower. In addition to the Kunark zones all being set up to drop less cash, other zones are likewise being modified. "Cash Cows", such as the dwarves in Butcherblock that used to drop an average of 27pp every six minutes, are being identified and adjusted.<BR>
<BR>
Good items cost "thousands of plat" because of the amount of excess cash in the world. As the money sinks take their toll, the price of the items will drop to a level of equilibrium with the current cash drops. It shows that money is becoming more valuable.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Summoned bags">Summoned bags</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/13/00 13:14 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>The only thing worse than going link-dead, is going link-dead with a summoned bag or two that are full.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I KNOW this issue has come up a million and one times, but it just really irks me that this awesome item is hindered by the no-rent rules, thus making them risky to use. Can you fix it where the items placed in our summoned bags will transfer to the next available slot in the individual's inventory when we log or go link-dead and cannot make it back in time?<BR>
</font>
Those bags reduce the weight of anything carried within to zero, therefore there must be some downside to them or special bags dropped as loot really lose value.<BR>
<BR>
We have considered putting a warning up in the event that someone tries to camp while they have loot in a summoned bag, but are having trouble coming up with a solution that would fit linkdeath loss. We didn't used to make norent items disappear on linkdeath, but many people then would go linkdead as the preferred method of leaving the game for the purpose of saving the bags. Also, once a character is out of the world, we don't maintain a record of them to allow removal of the bags after, for instance, an hour.<BR>
<BR>
As far as moving the items out of the bags, that would present some major problems in the event that inventory is full. <BR>
<BR>
Given these issues, the chance of losing the items on linkdeath will probably remain one of the risks of using the summoned bags.<BR>

Too bad the mobs have so many HP that it can take a while to kill them :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>As I commented in another thread today, coin loot is indeed lighter for many areas of the game. Skyfire included. <BR>
In other zones, the "big" outdoor critters are an exception to other things in the zone, allowing for more loot to be handed out since there are less of them to go around. However in Skyfire, *everything* is pretty nasty, with those encounters being the rule rather than the exception. Many groups can hunt there nonstop and never run out of things to kill. Given that, they just can't drop the 10-30pp per kill of other encounters.<BR>
<BR>
As for the XP, the mobs in Skyfire give more experience than mobs of a relative level in any other outdoor zone in the world.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Any eta on poison? probably not, you're busy fixin the iksar armor quests, or alchemy, or somethin else. well, thanks anyway.<BR>
</font>
Actually I responded to this question as well as I could last week, so you aren't being ignored <BR>
<BR>
We're still looking good for the end of this month. One of the designers is working on it daily, and sending regular status reports. It looks like it's going to be pretty cool when it's all worked out.<BR>
