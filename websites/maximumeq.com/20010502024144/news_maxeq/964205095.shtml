*Karana, Bertox, and Test Server Split*<BR>
<BR>
Hello all,<BR>
<BR>
At some time between 6pm and 8pm PDT (GMT-8), we will open /movelog registration on Karana, Bertox, and Test, to allow players on those servers to request that their account be moved to the new split-server, Terris-Thule.  Players on the affected servers will be informed via server broadcast when registration is open.  Players wishing to have their characters moved to the new split server will need to run the command "/movelog yes" after registration is opened.<BR>
<BR>
Notes:<BR>
<BR>
- /movelog only needs to be run from ONE character, and will count for all characters on that server on that account.  <BR>
- Players who have requested a move should make sure all of their corpses are looted by the time the server is brought down tomorrow morning (9am PDT).  Corpses will not be duplicated in the new world, and anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone who moves will be lost.<BR>
- We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this action, based upon the number of total requests that we receive. <BR>
- The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not you have been selected until after the move is actually completed.<BR>
- Test Server Players with artificially buffed characters on their account *MUST* delete those characters prior to registering for move.  Having artificially buffed characters moved to the live servers will result in action against the player's account.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Item Changes Pending in Next Patch*<BR>
<BR>
In the next patch, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Howling Stones will all be made NODROP if not currently set with that flag.  This means that people holding more than one key will not be able to hand out their extras after the patch.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that this change is made, we are also implementing a new change that "binds" these items to your character.  Should you die with one of these keys in your possession, it will not be left on your corpse, but will stay with you when you return to your bindpoint.<BR>
<BR>
This change was made in light of the difficulty of the key-quests, in order to eliminate the need to do the quest multiple times prior to entering the dungeon.  <BR>
