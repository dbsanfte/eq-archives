I am a lvl 26 human paladin on the rathe server and Very short of cash, so seeing this quest may change that. Now, the only part I dont understand is all of it. Can someone send in a FULL walkthrough of the quest starting from what faction you have to have with who, who you talk to first, which zones you go to in order, and who you give what to. I mean, hand the shirt to frostie? what shirt? whos frostie? and what lvl u gotta be? <BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>The trick with waiting for Frostbite to return and giving him a second shirt has been nerfed. What happens now is, if Basil is still alive, Frostbite returns to his pen and then immediately takes off again. Thanks to Teirza and friends for trying this out.<BR>
<BR>
Paglan is still appearing, last saw him on Sunday 3/5.<BR>
<BR>
Be aware that Frostbite runs through the HG camp (and Chief Goonda's camp as well) sometimes.<BR>
<BR>
My opinion on the nerf is that it really wasn't necessary, it's hard enough to get Basil to spawn and stay alive. But I generally agree with the attempts to remove exploits from the game.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>  I just got one of these today for a friend. I guess I got lucky on it and only had to do the quest 8 times to get one. The biggest problem with the quest is that the guy that gives you the sword has to con warmly to you or he wont give it. I had to do the lion meat shipment quest untill I got the Wolves of the North to indiffrent and then did the gnoll fang quest to warmly(and tried the quest 3 times during this time, so lost 3 langseaxs so I guess I didnt really get the LoW untill the 11th :) ). The gnoll fang quest is fairly easy, you just kill gnolls in blackburrow to get tons of fangs and bring them back to the Warrior GM in Halas. I gathered 126 total that I handed in. I was still amiable after 105 so went back for anoth 21 and handed them in.  The only hard part of the quest is following that damned dog. Frost bite moves a little slower than a player with SoW on him, so if you arent a druid, shaman or high level Ranger you will need to get a SoW each time you do the quest unless you move real fast. (I got it in twice with one SoW today, but didnt get the SoW till I was at frostbite and was bound in halas so gated back after killing Basil). Basil hits kind of hard for his level, was hitting for over 40 and doesnt like casters. While my pet was killing him he kept coming at me and I didnt even cast on him. The LoW guy, name starts with a P, is real easy to spot because he is in full banded. He was easyer to kill for me than Basil. I cast burnout2 on my pet and the pet beat him down like a red headed step child. He didnt seem to hit as hard as Basil, but he did attack faster.<BR>
   Just as a side note I really have to wonder how people without cable modems do this quest. While I was following frostbite he would run into a tree and on my client he would show up as walking into the tree where he was actually already on the otherside, also when he stops to kill stuff sometimes after the kill he would just appear to be sitting there when he had already left, and then there is the annoying spinning effect. Where instead of moving he sits and spins where the server has him moving and you have no idea where he goes. I had lots of trouble keeping up with him with the pactetloss and lag in WK, how do people on modems do this quest? :)</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I am a ranger on the Tunare server. I do not do quests intentionally most of the time. I was in WK camping the Ghoul Messenger after waiting two months for Verant to fix this quest. I just happened to get Paglan (and that is exactly how you spell his name) on my track. Well if you are ever in the Karanas you will figure out that I kill pretty much everything named that I can. I had no clue what he dropped or what it was for. Someone grouping with me happened to know thankfully and now I am gonnna work on faction while getting BB casks as well. *smiles* After killing the GM and not getting a note after the quest was fixed this is a welcome change.<BR>
