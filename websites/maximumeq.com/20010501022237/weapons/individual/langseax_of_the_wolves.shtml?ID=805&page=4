<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>  Okay, somebody asked for a complete walkthrough, so here it is: <BR>
  Go to Halas. Find McDaniel's Smokes and Spirits, and Renth McLanis is standing next to the table by the staircase in full armor. Consider him. He must con at least 'amiably' for this to work. If he doesn't, you need to raise faction with the 'Wolves of the North'.<BR>
  If he cons indifferent, dubiously, threateningly, or ready to attack, you need to raise your faction. (duh). Go to Blackburrow and kill lots of gnolls. I conned dubiously to Renth and it took me about four stacks of fangs to get my faction up. It won't take long, those gnolls are easy :-)  Turn in the fangs to Lysbeth at the Warrior arena. She is also in full armor.<BR>
  After you have gotten your faction high enough, go to West Karana and head straight South of the Qeynos Hills zone. You will come to a barbarian village on the coast. Down near the coast, in the hut farthest to the East, is Misla McMannus. She is dressed in leather. Target her and say 'I will deliver the lion meat'. She gives you a box of lion meat. <BR>
  Take the lion meat back to Halas. Just after you get off the dock, there is a merchant named Teria O'Dannos. Give the box to her and she will give you some Lion's Delight. DO NOT EAT THE LION'S DELIGHT!!! Put it as far from your normal food as possible.<BR>
  Run out into Everfrost. At loc -2000, -3800 there is a tower. It is called Megan's Tower. Wait here for Tundra Jack and Iceberg, his huge polar bear. Hail Tundra Jack and Iceberg will show up a few seconds later. Target Iceberg, and give him the Lion's Delight. You then get a sweaty shirt. You won't have to wait more than 15 minutes for Tundra Jack.<BR>
  Take the sweaty shirt back to the barbarian fishing village where you got the box from Misla. There is an animal pen next to one of the houses. Frostbite spawns here. He may not be there when you get there, but it doesn't take him long to show up. Target him and give him the sweaty shirt. After a few seconds (sometimes you have to wait a little, but he'll always go) he'll run. Make sure you have a SoW, as he goes at a little slower than SoW speed.<BR>
  Frostbite will attack any monsters that he sees, and you should protect him. He'll lead you up into the mountains at the far side of the zone. Watch out for bandits and the 2 cyclopses. If one of these attacks you, you have a SoW, so keep running in the direction Frostbite is going and you'll hit the zone soon. You'll either find Basil the barbarian, who wears a kilt and is about level 20, but he hits pretty hard. Or, he'll lead you to Paglan, who is in full armor and is about level 25.<BR>
  After you have killed the NPC Barbarian, loot the NO DROP head and take it back to Halas. If you plan to do the quest again, go ahead and get another box from Misla on your way back. Go back to Renth in McDaniel's Smokes and Spirits and hand him the head! Then you can go deliver the box and start again!<BR>
                     Hope this clears a lot of things up<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>The LoW and langseax quest, great exp from 20 till 24-25, my druid has been soloing the quest for quite some time, Basil is a much more common spawn, but Paglan is nowhere near as rare as you all make him out to be, i've done the quest probably 30-35 times gotten myself from 20 to a bub into 22, and ive gotten 6-7 Paglans, would have more but when I was hunting with a friend we got Paglan 3 times in a row, the last one killed me when i went LD, and then after retrieving my corpse was no longer in the zone. The quest is extremely easy to any caster who can get a SoW, but really helps to have a druid to snare. I plan on doing the quest till 25 seeing as Paglans head not only gives me the LoW but also nearly a full bub of exp.<BR>
<BR>
BTW if anyone one on Tallon Zek needs one give me a tell I always seem to have at least one on me.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I am a Shaman and did this quest 6 times already. My first time soloing at 24 I got Paglan. If not for Froon chasing after me I would've killed him on my first try, but fortunately Frostbite continues to cycle until Paglan or Basil is killed. (Remember that part if you lose him or die trying)<BR>
<BR>
The actual frase you use to obtain the Lion meat shipment is "I am here to deliver the lion meat shipment for Halas". Works every time. Paglan is the rare spawn and depending on how many folks are questing it could change whether you get him or not. If it is just you, it is very likely you will get him.<BR>
<BR>
SOW is a must for this quest as well as a few buffs. These two hit hard, but for some reason Basil hits harder than Paglan. The LOW is LORE, so don't try getting it more than once without having sold the one you have first. Also, it is rather large, so have a large bag handy. One more note, You are capable of eating the Lion meat shipment and the Lions Delight, so pack plenty of food and keep the LION anything in the last slot to avoid consumption.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck to all...<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I have learned the trick to make sure you get the correct Barbarian to kill.....Make sure you do the quest with a friend, both doing the quest at the same time,  when you give the dog the thing to sniff and chase him, he will take you to the 1 barbarian that gives you the 1hander, after you kill that guy go straight back to the dog and give him the 2nd thing that the friend you're doing it with will have, because the 1 barbarian is dead cuz you just killed him the dog has no choice buy to track the Big Guy so you can get your head to turn it in for the LoW so the trick is to make sure you do the quest with someone else.</font></td></tr></table>
