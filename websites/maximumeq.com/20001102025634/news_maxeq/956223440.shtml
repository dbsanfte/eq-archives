<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Bash and Slam Explained">Bash and Slam Explained</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/18/00 06:26 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Below, Abashi explains the difference between bash and slam.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>>>>Keeping it short, non magic shields cannot bash magic even if you have magic shoulders. Since magic shoulders allow large races to bash magic with a non-magic weapon in their offhand, shouldn't magic shoulders allow non-magic shields to bash magic as well? I consider this a bug, the 'magic shoulders' rule should apply to all items in the offhand, including nonmagical shields.<BR>
This isn't a bug. The Bash skill requires a magic shield. The Slam skill requires magic shoulders. Hitting a magic creature with the weapon in your off-hand requires a magic weapon. Bash essentially turns your shield into a weapon, which is why it requires a magic shield. You are hitting them with your shield. <BR>
<BR>
Slam, though it looks like you are slapping them with your fist is more akin to checking them, hockey style. When you have a shield equipped, the slam is considered a bash. It's one of the tradeoffs that exists in the game. You cannot have all of the advantages of having a shield and all of the advantages of not having a shield at the same time, unless the shield is magic.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I am proud to announce that the first marriage within the Valiant Crusader Guild is to be between two of its founding members, as our Leader, Lord Severan Truehart is to wed his beloved Lady Fanya.<BR>
<BR>
The blessed event will take place at 4PM Eastern time on May 6th 2000, at the inn closest to Freeport in Northern Ro, where the happy couple first met.<BR>
<BR>
Please join the entire Valiant Crusader guild as we celebrate this event, as we encourage all to attend.  Refreshments and libations will be supplied to excess, and we will be organizing games of luck and skill.  A drunken raid is still in the planning stages.<BR>
<BR>
Also note that we are in need of transportation assistance, so any available teleporting classes who can assist us in bringing revelers closer to the event should contact me in game for details.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your attention and we hope to see you all there!<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;When, if we still can, can clerics heal mage pets? Is there some required level of the Mage Pet for it to accept Heal <BR>
Clerics should have no problems healing a mages pet. There's no level requirement or anything of that nature. I imagine in this case he was just getting beaten on faster than you could mitigate the damage.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Greetings!<BR>
 <BR>
This email is to let you know about the EverQuest Gathering 3 to be held in Las Vegas on July 9, 2000. At EverQuest Gathering 2 in Saint Louis, several guilds showed up together. The Real Life Quest held at this event was a server based team, and these guilds made great teams!<BR>
 <BR>
Also, the event is on a Sunday. Some guilds are planning their own guild events for that Saturday. We just wanted to make sure your guild knew about this and could make plans to attend if you can. We would like to see as many guilds represented there as possible! <BR>
 <BR>
Check out the info at <a href="http://eqgathering.bizland.com/">http://eqgathering.bizland.com/</a><BR>
 <BR>
Hope to see you there!<BR>

It was great when it was finally implemented, but with this latest change, it's all but worthless.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>This spell was changed indirectly by a fix that was made in another area. I have heard people ask for shrink to be done in stages before, but I wouldn't mind hearing everyone's thoughts on this.<BR>
As for the shrink potions, we'll probably make them shrink to gnome-size in a single charge.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The faction thresholds on it are set a bit too high at the moment. It should be fixed on test now and will probably go live in a week or two.<BR>

I just hope that the drops aren't like the Ingot of the Devout for the cleric quests, which still drops only once a week or so (rare drop off a rare spawn).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Please tell me that the new spells are not going to be drops off of mobs. All this time there are problems with camping. If spells are going to become drops from NPCs then you just added a very big issue of camping not to mention...in the plane of sky? Come on, not everyone can be on long enough to do the planes, much less are in a guild that can them. You definately can't go up and camp the thing alone. <BR>
Some level 51+ spells will be buyable, some questable, and some will drop as treasure. As a general rule, spells which are core to the abilities of a class (such as a clerics heal spell) will be purchasable. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;But, you did post that Verant had looked at and approved of Tumpy how it was. Now, I was diappointed by that and hoped you would change it, and you did, but since you made the other comment, for the sake of explanation, can you say WHY the decision was reversed?<BR>
We reevaluated our earlier position upon continued concerns posted by the customers. In addition, we received several testimonials from people who were able to level using it at a rate far (10+ times) exceeding our designed pace for the game. Finally, I myself was sent a few screenshots of over a dozen people standing around the guy handing in tonics.<BR>
<BR>
It was essentially buying levels for money, something that we don't want done in EverQuest. <BR>
<BR>
As a note, the quest will be changed and the experience given by it will probably be increased beyond what it originally was. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Level 60's and Dragons">Level 60's and Dragons</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/14/00 06:53 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It seems to be coming a concern that a group of level 60's could take out a dragon easily, and then twinking new characters with the dragon loot.<BR><BR>

Gordon has this to say:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;My question about the expansion is that, with characters going up to level 60, will the two classic dragons that are out there now simply be camped constantly by 60th levels who want to twink their new characters with dragon droppings? Is there anything special about their locations or zones to prevent this?<BR>
We're still considering these issues. Though we don't want to see level 60 folk bottom feeding on dragons, we don't necessarily want to buff them all up either. We'll come up with something, but everyone will have to wait for the release of the expansion to see what that is <BR>
