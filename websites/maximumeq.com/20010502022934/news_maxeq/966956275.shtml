<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Hybrid manapools">Hybrid manapools</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/06/00 15:15 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Good news for hybrids.  Gordon explained what they are currently changing for hybrid mana pools a little more.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Just to stress, this is in testing and may or may not make the live servers. I thought I'd announce it to give the players some idea of what we are working on. Just to elaborate further on what is in testing:<BR><BR>
1. The mana pool for a hybrid will be the same as the pool for the parent caster, assuming the same amount of int/wis. This is balanced by the fact that there are not nearly as many +int/wis items available for hybrids as pure casters, and that they'd have trouble equallying out in that department. Previously, hybrids had the equivalent of 8 levels less mana than a caster of the same level assuming the same amount of int/wis.<BR><BR>
2. Spells cast by hybrids will still cost more than the same spell cast by the pure caster. The idea here is that since that is the casters specialty, they will always be better at casting then their hybrid brethern.<BR><BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="United Resolve and Heroic Bond">United Resolve and Heroic Bond</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/06/00 15:13 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>For those unaware, for some unknown reason, Verant gave clerics the group version of Heroism 2 levels before Resolution.  Heroism is better than Resolution.<BR><BR>

They are finally fixing it (after 6 months of clerics saying "WTF?").  However, don't hold your breath for this new group buff... it's currently a level 58 spell on Test.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>They were initially correct towards the end of the RoK beta, however at some point they got messed up. You are right that a few are out of order, for instance, with group heroism coming before group resolution. 
<BR><BR>
Rather than just put them in the right order, which would be considered as a nerf by some, we're going to just change a spell or two to something more appropriate for the level. For instance, I believe that we are changing "United Resolve" to a "group symbol" spell that only uses one component.

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Mana regeneration at 51+">Mana regeneration at 51+</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/06/00 15:08 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I'm noticing that mana takes longer to get back at 51 as a cleric.  I can only imagine what it's like at 60.<BR><BR>

Amusing that they would say that they won't add anything new to the game to regen mana faster, yet they recently added Harvest.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The "solution" for what you are mentioning is grouping with classes that have the ability to increase your regen rate. Bards and enchanters can do this for you, and can certainly increase it at a rate beyond what it was at level 50.
<BR><BR>
Putting in other ways to increase mana regeneration would unbalance the game. The methods available to increase the rate of regeneration do so to the greatest extent that we've designed for the game.
