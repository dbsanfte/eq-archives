Getting the keys is a pain in the butt as it is.  To get 2 is just nonsense.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
I thought I'd drop a line and let everyone know about some exciting changes that we are working on:<BR>
<BR>
First, the next EQ client will, unless a problem is discovered in testing, include a slash-command that will allow players to turn off display of corpses. This will be a client-side option that will just repress the rendering of the corpses themselves. This will allow corpse-related actions (like sense-corpse) to be taken even while corpse display is repressed. <BR>
<BR>
The command (/hidecorpses) will have three possible parameters:<BR>
<BR>
None - Shows all corpses<BR>
All - Hides all corpses but that belonging to the player.<BR>
All but group - Hides all corpses but those belonging to the player and group members.<BR>
<BR>
As asking people "Has anyone seen my corpse?" is an issue that we feel builds the feeling of community and encourages people to help each other out, the command will reset to showing all corpses upon zoning. Also, as a note, in its current implementation, any corpses created after the command is run will be shown. <BR>
<BR>
This command should help people who experience framerate problems after zoning in to areas known to cause a large number of corpses. <BR>
<BR>
The second change has to do with quested keys for entrance into the keyed dungeons on Kunark: Sebilis, Charasis, and Veeshan's Peak. It's apparent that the risk of dying in these zones is too great to risk going with only one key. Furthermore, it's become standard practice for people to leave a corpse at the entrance of these dungeons with the spare key.<BR>
<BR>
As we feel that the idea of dueling and getting killed just to leave a corpse for a bank isn't in the best intrest of roleplaying or our vision for the game (e.g. It's cheesy), we've decided to nerf this practice  Our plan is to have keys for these three dungeons stay with the owner when they return to their bind point. This new ability that we are working on also gives us the opportunity to explore "soulbound" items in the future, but no promises just yet on that.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Players from Test and Torvonnilous">Players from Test and Torvonnilous</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 07/01/00 15:39 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This is definately good news for thos eon Torvonnilous.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
Many of you are probably familiar with the situation that resulted in characters from Test being moved to Torvonnilous and other servers. For those who are not, let me do a quick recap:<BR>
<BR>
A few weeks ago we did a character wipe on the Test server in order to cleanse the testing platform. After doing this wipe, it was apparent that many people on the server did not have a reasonable expectation that this was a possibility. As a result, in the interest of providing good customer service, we decided to back out the player-wipe, change it to an item-wipe, and give the players on Test an option to move to one of the production servers.<BR>
<BR>
During this process, some mistakes were made on our part. In these plans, we neglected to place several “exceptions” for valid destinations for Test characters. We moved around 20 characters to Torvonnilous, a “young non-split” server. People often start on new non-split servers because they want a fresh environment. There is often a “race”, so to speak, shortly after the server comes up to be the first character or group to reach high levels, get good equipment, and do the dragons and planes. There are many people who enjoy this fresh environment as it gives them the opportunity to become a well-known and respected person on their server.<BR>
<BR>
It was inappropriate for us to inject established higher-level characters into the young environment on Torvonnilous. Transfers of this type, though not particularly relished by the people on the destination servers in general, should be limited to established and “older” servers, including split-servers, that are not in the midst of establishing their “server community”. A well-established community on older servers can take an injection of new people without a harmful effect upon that community, however the community on the younger servers is fragile and deserves protection.<BR>
<BR>
In a previous message on the subject that I posted earlier today, I commented that it was “too late” to address this issue. However, for the reasons above, we’ve modified our decision in regard to the Test move. We will be removing the characters from Test that were moved to Torvonnilous, and placing them back on Test for the time being. Owners of those characters should be contacted by email in the near future. <BR>
<BR>
We’d like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding in this matter.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you,<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Poison revamp short F.A.Q.">Poison revamp short F.A.Q.</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/30/00 02:50 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Abashi answered a few questions about the rogue poison revamp:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The "system" of poison itself wasn't changed, and I apologize if people out there thought that it would be. What there is is a greater variety of poisons, which are cheaper, and have more plentiful components. I've gotten a number of emails today asking various quesitons:<BR>
Q: Why aren't the poisons themselves stackable.<BR>
A: The item system does not allow items with effects to be stackable. Alcohol doesn't apply, as it's covered with item-specific code. We cannot feasibly add item-specific code for poisons and potions due to technical concerns.<BR>
<BR>
Q: Why don't poisons have multiple charges?<BR>
A: This is a function of the item engine again. They cannot have multiple charges.<BR>
<BR>
Q: Why don't poisons last through zoning?<BR>
A: The game engine doesn't allow it, and spell-code doesn't apply. <BR>
<BR>
Q: Why do poisons take time to apply?<BR>
A: Balance. It's necessary for it to take time so that the effects aren't used multiple times in the same combat encounter without stepping out of combat. Poisons are meant as a pre-combat preparation. Keep in mind that rogues are extremely powerful as it is. <BR>
<BR>
Q: Why can poisons be interrupted? <BR>
A: Game engine again. To be honest, I'd like to see the chances of this reduced significantly. I'll look into seeing what we can do.<BR>
