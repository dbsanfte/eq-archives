<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
Welcome to the new EverQuest forums. As mentioned yesterday, posting to all forums, with exception to the “Customer Service / Technical Help” forum, is restricted to active EverQuest account holders. At this time, we are also implementing strict moderation on all EverQuest forums in accordance with the rules of conduct at http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_conduct.html. <BR>
<BR>
I’d like to begin by telling you about some new features of the boards. In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, under the “Post New Topic” button, you’ll find a link to the new EverQuest Forum FAQ. In addition to containing information regarding the new rules in place on the message boards, this FAQ also contains useful information on some subjects that tend to come up frequently on the boards. On the upper left-hand side of the screen, you’ll notice a link to “EQModerator”. This link will take you to a page that will allow you to email the moderators of the boards in order to report posts that violate the message board rules listed in the FAQ and the Rules of Conduct. The EQModerator email address is *only* to report violations of those rules and to request moderator support in a particular forum. At the top of each page you’ll note a line that reads “Posting to this forum is subject to the EverQuest Rules of Conduct”. We highly suggest that everyone read all of these documents prior to posting on the boards.<BR>
<BR>
We’ve taken great steps to ensure the security of Station information here on the boards. You’ll notice that when posting to the restricted boards, your Chat handle is displayed as the author of the post. You can change your chat handle once per week in the EverQuest Chat Server. Type #help for a list of commands available to you in the Chat server. Please note that posting in the “Customer Service / Technical Help” forum will display your Station Name rather than your Chat Handle, as the forum currently allows posts from the general public regardless of account status. In the near future, we will change that forum to use a chat handle if one exists.<BR>
<BR>
Please note that the new message board rules will be enforced immediately. There is to be no more name-calling, personal attacks, or rampant profanity on these boards. People who post in a prohibited manner will run the risk of losing access to their EverQuest accounts. We regret having to tie the two services together in this manner, however given the option of either doing this to allow the boards to serve their purpose, or shutting them down, we feel that this is a much better solution, as it allows us to serve our customers to the greatest extent possible. <BR>
<BR>
These boards exist as a resource for current EverQuest subscribers. I would like to thank everyone for helping ensure that they fulfill their purpose. We look forward to recommending these boards to our subscribers as a whole in the near future.<BR>

**Patch Day**

Greetings everyone!  

Today's patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will enjoy:

- Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs.  In addition, the range for canned emotes has been increased.
- /who all "guildname" should now work for players who have /roleplay turned on.
- Preferences for the mouselook will be saved in your options file.  Those who turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have to do it once more.
- The "Chat Filter" tab in "Options" now has an option to filter messages caused by damage shields hitting others.

*Fast Drop*

Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to avoid accidentally dropping items on the ground.  The new client allows players to set "Item Dropping" preferences on the "General" options tab.  The three options that can be set are:

- FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation.
- CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed whenever you try to drop an item.
- NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground.  

Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop command.  The arguments are:

- ON: Same as option "Fast Drop" on the General Tab.
- OFF: Same as option "Confirm" on the General Tab.
- NEVER: Same as above.

Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without confirmation.  Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to items being dropped upon the ground.  Handing items to NPCs will still work regardless of your FastDrop setting.

It is highly recommended that you use option "CONFIRM", as GMs will not reimburse any items that are accidentally dropped.

Personally, I've never had a reason for someone to loot the equipment off my corpse.  I like this change.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>About two weeks ago we put in some code to disallow the looting of others corpses. We made this change due to the multiple customer service issues that come up in regards to corpse looting, and the request from players to provide a method of consent that didn't allow looting. <BR>
Providing seperate /consent commands for looting and dragging wasn't an option due to technical reasons. After viewing the new code in action for a while, we've had the opportunity to evaluate the whole issue and have decided that the looting of others corpses presents too many issues regarding customer service to reenable it.<BR>
<BR>
Given the massive reduction in fraud since the change went in, we're pretty sure that the current logic provides the best possible environment for the players.<BR>
