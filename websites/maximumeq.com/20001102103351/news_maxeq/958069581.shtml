<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>In the interest of gameplay, we've decided to take out the faction modifier that makes Dark Elven worshippers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane KOS to NPCs in the Venril Sathir faction. This is on test now and should go live at the next patch. <BR>
Providing that Dark Elven worshippers of these deities haven't done anything to further anger Venril Sathir, they'll be able to use the outpost then.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there any reason why for melees who dual weild, the level damage bonus is only calculated on your primary hand?<BR>
That's just the way that it was set up for balance reasons. The enhanced melee damage is only applied to the primary hand, not the off-hand. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Reduced mana regen rate?">Reduced mana regen rate?</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/02/00 11:04 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Someone posted that they have noticed a reduced mana regen rate now.<BR><BR>

I can't say that I've noticed this in Kunark.  I do notice that I use more mana though :)</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>There has been no intentional change, however due to the number of people reporting it I'm not ready to dismiss it just yet. However, I highly suspect that the observations are due to a number of things, not related to the actual rate. For instance:<BR>
1. Perception: Mana above level 50 continues to increase at a rate much like it was before, however the mana regen rate does not increase on the same curve, giving the perception that it takes longer to med, even though you are still getting the same amount of mana back per tick. This is something that people also notice and claim as they level up or gain +INT/WIS/MANA items. They increase the amount of mana that they have without increasing the regen rate in a linear manner. <BR>
<BR>
2. Watched Pot: The addition of Kunark has caused people to spread out more. The net result of this is that the ratio of people to targets has improved. Where a group used to be at full mana the next time it was their "turn" to kill a particular spawn, they are now staring at their mana bars while a surplus of critters walk by that they could be killing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3. Placebo Effect: The "Placebo effect" also causes the "Watched Pot". Someone, perhaps due to one of the reasons mentioned above, perceives that the mana regen rate has changed, and comments on it. This causes other people to become sensitive to the issue, causing them to pay close attention to their mana bars, giving the impression that it is taking longer to regen.<BR>
<BR>
4. Of course there is always the good old fashioned "bug", which shouldn't take too long for us to figure out as soon as I can corner the programmers  I'm looking into it this afternoon.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Permenant effects and +mana items">Permenant effects and +mana items</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/02/00 11:01 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I'm curious about just how much +mana items are a good thing.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Since learning that +mana items are also subject to the level restriction and have a reduced effect at lower levels<BR>
</font>
Actually that's not entirely accurate. You can only raise your mana with +mana items based upon the total base mana that you have. For instance, if someone has only 50 mana, and they don a +50 mana item, they do not have 100 mana. This isn't a function of the level, but of total mana. We won't let someone double their mana supply with +mana items.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Im wondering if permenant haste items fall under this rule as well. I know that the exe axe doesnt proc haste til level 30 so Im suggesting that permenant haste items like the FBSS and Mith 2H dont work until a certain level or have a reduced effect<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Permanent-haste items do not share the level restrictions of a proc on a weapon.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Guard killing and faction">Guard killing and faction</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/02/00 10:58 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It will be interesting to see what Verant does this time to prevent guard killing.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;It is getting a little tiresome in Butcherblock trying to find a guard being that everyone is camped and murdered the minute they spawn. You can see the bodies of newbies at the guard stations because they were foolish enough to believe that they could get some back up there with a battle gone bad. Why don't you make the killing of a guard a faction hit that so that the individual is automatically KOS in good cities. That would curb this practice immediately.<BR>
The goal was to have each city have a faction associated with it, making it possible for someone to upset one city and remain in good standing with another. In some cases it's apparent that this may not have worked just like we would have liked it to, and we're looking for different ways to respond. We'll probably look at making some of the guards a little less appetizing. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
One thing to remember is that the goal of the faction system is to embrace the idea that no one really believes that they are evil. For instance, the dark elves do not think that they are evil, they are just uncompromising in their application of their morality. They probably feel that the high elves are evil.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="More on Iksar monks">More on Iksar monks</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/02/00 10:54 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Iksar monks are the source of quite a few debates.  Abashi explains some of the advantages and disadvantages of being an Iksar monk.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Previously, with only one class capable of becoming a monk, balancing the monk class on the basis of race was not difficult. However, the inclusion of the Iksar, with many different racial attributes, has made this a bit harder. <BR>
Infravision and regen make life much easier for the young Iksar, which leaves us with a need to validate humans as a monk class. In addition, monks are the only race that get an AC bonus based upon their race. This leaves them already getting one just by virtue of being a monk, and now another because they are also an Iksar. <BR>
<BR>
In this case, we decided that in addition to including the expected XP and faction issues, we've also made it so that Iksar monks will not be as "good" at *being* monks as humans. It's not by a large extreme, but human monks will always be better at doing what monks do: dealing damage.<BR>

Kunark is so huge I doubt that more than a 1/3 of it has been seen so far.  I spent an hour alone last night with SoW just running around the dreadlands non-stop.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Aside from the ones that you can buy from Kunark vendors, where are these new spells? I heard Sky, but I know a lot of people that were there over the weekend, and they saw ZERO spells drop. Has anyone found them? I heard about a L60 mage pet spell dropping in Skyfire, but that is it. Could it be that Verant hasnt added them yet? This is ridiculous.<BR>
50+ spells are either obtained via merchants, quests, or loot drops. They are out there, but you'll probably want to make your way to an area that is a little more ripe with magic. <BR>
