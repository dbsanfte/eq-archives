Wow.<BR><BR>

A truly great change, hopefully it goes live.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
I thought I'd drop by and let you know of a new feature that we are trying out on Test. Last week it was suggested here on the boards that we implement a "Looking for Group" flag that players can set and view in order to help people get together quickly, allowing more time for adventuring. We've decided to try it out and it's on Test now.<BR>
<BR>
The /lfg [on|off] command will set or unset your "LFG" flag. Players can then use all of the "/who" and "/who all" filters to find each others. For instance, "/who all rogue 45 50 lfg" will return all rogues between 45 and 50 who are looking for a group. "/who lfg" will return all players in the current zone who are looking for a group. <BR>
<BR>
Your LFG flag will automatically unset when you enter a group. One final note, though anonymous and roleplaying characters can set their LFG flag, they will not show up in filtered /who lists. In other words, the first example above wouldn't return any anonymous rogues, however "/who all lfg" would return everyone in the game who is LFG (subject to the 20 person limit).<BR>
<BR>
Assuming all goes well in testing, this change will most likely be in the next patch.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Wizards don't need more mana">Wizards don't need more mana</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/10/00 14:46 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Wizards seem to be the class of choice to complain about by players.  Gordon responded to a thread asking for faster mana regen and a bigger mana pool.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;We all know the arguments about why wizards, as the *most* mana dependent class in the game need a bigger mana pool and a faster mana regen. <BR>
Clerics could also say that they are the most mana-dependant class in the game. Neither class is in need of bigger mana pools or faster regen.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Daily, I contact friends who have quit their wizards because the down time for a wizard is longer for any other class, wizards do not fill a needed group role, <BR>
<BR>
Evacers and nukers are often needed roles. I've seen posts from wizards saying that they can't get groups. I've seen the same from druids. Yet I've also seen posts from everyone else who says that an evacer is a must for a group. Wizards are also the only class that can get people to 2 out of 3 planes. They have a lot going for them.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;So, I'm asking abashi and aradune straight up: Will *ANYTHING* convince you that wizards need a revamping which should include a larger mana pool, a faster mana regen rate and more damage output? <BR>
<BR>
No, not at this time. Wizards already have more efficient direct damage spells than other classes, they get more different types of direct damage spells, their spells have better casting and recast times, and their spells are inherently less resistable. Not to mention that you have concussion which will take care of those aggro problems when used properly, and harvest and manaskin, which when used together can easily eliminate 2 "Meds" per hour.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Rogues don't suck">Rogues don't suck</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/10/00 14:43 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Most of my experiance, at least lately, as been with high level rogues.  I have to say, they definately don't suck.  Give them a good tank to taunt, the they dish out an insane amount of damage.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I'm sorry, but rogues just plain don't suck. They don't. They have been more than compensated for their shift in original plans from a "theif" more towards an "assassin". The issues that you quote just minimize the positives of the class. The best suggestion that I can offer is that you visit some rogue-specific class boards. The Safehouse for instance has a bunch of rogues who can give you pointers on how to get the most out of your class.<BR>
The rogue right up there with the necro in "least in need of enhancement".<BR>
<BR>
To address your specific issues:<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1: No quest armor? What the heck? <BR>
<BR>
But there is class-specific armor at the appropriate ranges. You get yours as loot drops rather than questing. This doesnt' contribute to your claim that they suck, as the armor is available one way or the other.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2: The burning rapier quest. <BR>
<BR>
It's a great weapon after many upgrades. Most rogues now swear by it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;3: Hiding. It was my impression that unless a specific creature has "see invisible" cast on it, it should not be able to see a rogue when hiding and sneaking. <BR>
<BR>
Hiding and invisibility is the same from a functionality standpoint. It's necessary for the skills to be balanced. Rogues are, however, the only class capable of being invisible to both undead and living NPCs at the same time. This is quite the boon for them.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;4: I know you hear about the lack of rogue equipment a lot, and i realize that many people complain about this no matter what class they are but uhhh... I was talking to a 51 rogue the other day who was still wearing ravenscale. heh heh heh.<BR>
<BR>
There's no "lack of equipment" for rogues, at least not beyond that of any other melee class. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;5: Poison skills? Man... the components are expensive, and few and far between.... <BR>
<BR>
You might want to look at it again. Poison is quite affordable now, and the components are quite common.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Even the poison vendor in west Freeport is broken, he spawns, then immediately starts walking away from his sell point. "Doh! Looks like I'm goin' to east karana for mah poison supplies today...". <BR>
<BR>
If that's the case, I'll have the team check it out.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;6: The gunthak harpoon. what's up with that? I see a patch saying it's no rent. i see a patch saying it's rentable. people in the game tell me it's no rent. What the heck is it?<BR>
<BR>
The item being made rentable was a mistake. It's far too powerful to be a staple item. It was only rentable for a week.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;7: PvP once more. Rogues can't PvP or Solo to save their lives.... <BR>
<BR>
They can PvP quite well, espicially with some of the poisons out there. You are right however, they aren't designed to solo NPCs. HOWEVER, I have soloed experience giving creatures at 59 with a rogue, that's without using poison. It's just not all too efficient and relies on getting some good rolls on instill doubt.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;8: Hitpoints. You give us hitpoints between a warrior and a caster of our same level. why? we're a melee class for erollisi's sake! We already do less damage, give us a few more hp to make up for it...<BR>
<BR>
You do NOT do less damage than a warrior. In fact, given a good group, and assuming that the rogue is well-played, you will do more damage than any other melee class, and some casters. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;9: the "evade" skill. Beautiful, when it works. But usually doesn't. Not based on lack of skill, just the dreaded "you can't hide while moving!" <BR>
<BR>
Once you learn how to use it, you'll probably have better luck. This is one of the best skills in the game when properly used. To tell you the truth, I can't think of a combat oriented skill that is better. Feign Death comes close, but I'd still take Evade for group situations.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, and another thing, I think hide should be put on our combat menu so we don't have t oswitch to "abilities" when we need it.<BR>
<BR>
You can put skills from the abilities menu in the hotboxes by left-clicking and holding on them. This will create a copy of the button that you can then transfer to the hotbox. It will then be accessible without switching through all of those menus.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;10: When was the last time you heard a group shout for a rogue unless they needed a lock picked? <BR>
<BR>
That's do more to posts of this nature rather than the abilities of the class. Enough people have complained that rogues suck for long enough that people out there who are unfamiliar with the abilities of the class believe it. Sure, there were some issues before, but those have been more than accounted for. It will probably take a while for people to learn what rogues can do. <BR>
