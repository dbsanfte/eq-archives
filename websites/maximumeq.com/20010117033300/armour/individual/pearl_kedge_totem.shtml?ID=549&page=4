<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I have to agree with Cloudburst. I happen to come across Bildge and killed him. Droped the Totem. 15 min later he spawns again and got the belt. Talk about lucky huh? As for level. He was blue to me at 40 and does heal himself pretty quickly if you can't keep up with the dmg. I had to totally unload on him at full mana to take him down and walked away with about 1 bub of mana and 2 bubs of health. He hits for about 50 or so dmg with double attacks and shoots arrows at you.(Depends on your stats too as to how hard he hits you) So I can image it would be hard for a melee class to take him down considering he takes off running at 1/2 health with out root or snare casted on him. Casters or Druid solo at 40ish easy or melee with caster back up no problems. I have no idea about the spawn times because like I said I just stumbled upon him. I do know that his path does cross the island in the middle because this is where I killed him a second time. I would image he spawns in the water somewhere or even on the far ends of the middle island. Who knows. Item worth?? Not sure cause I am certainly not gonna give up this item. The neg 9 str sucks but hey...What are the str buffs for anyways. More the worth the +18 wis. Hope this helps.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Haven't checked back here in a while and I see my name is dragged through the mud!  Just joking, of course.  However, I must comment on Panther's post at the top of the page about the Fab Four attacking Dwigus.  All I can say is that I have come across Big D standing right in the fire of the Fab Four camp, some little level twelve crumbled corpse at his feet, and the four NPCs we just standing there.  When the dead fella comes back, he confirms that the four did nothing to assist him ("much to my dismay" he said, which I thought amusing).<BR>
<BR>
Panther says he saw the four attack Dwigus.  Sure, why not?  Perhaps Dwigus spawns at different levels and he's on the cusp of being ignored by the NPCs (too high level).  I'm just reporting what I saw.  <BR>
<BR>
I certainly, however, think it foolish to spend hours in DC looking for Bilge or Dwigus if you (or party) are not strong enough to take him.  You hope to make it back to the NPC camp (Bilge rooted me once) and hope you get the last lick in when all four NPCs are swinging like mad?  Hmmm, seems to me your best bet is to spend those hours getting experience so that you can go back to DC when you are ready to solo.  I can't imagine the frustration level if you spend all day finding Bilge, only to have him disappear when the NPCs attack.  And I need not even comment on the above option if you don't have SoW.  I've seen Dwigus own a well equiped 41 warrior.  Yaks, FBSS, the works.  Don't even think you can run very far un-SoWed with Dwigus on your fanny.<BR>

Then one day i zone in  no one else is in the zone and hes out i got my reed belt =) i was very happy.(bilge was between fab 4 camp and goblin tents) Later that week right after a plane of sky raid i zoned in and looked i didnt see him so i headed for unrest (i went the wrong way and ended up by the orc camp) then suddenly he was just standing there... and he had a voodoo doll in his hand... i swear i almost wet myself... so i spent 225hrs... nothing  then both times i zoned in with the zone empty he was there so i killed him twice in a 10 hunting period over a weeks time (something like that) anyway... the second time he was to the left of the bb zone. The only way i can desribe it.. is  when you see "Bilge Farfathom" on track its like a hot knife though butter.... thats the best ay to describe it... <BR>
Fyi 2 starfires he fell....<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok, I can only say this much about Bilge. I have killed him once, and he gave me the Reed Belt (oh well). But, I was sitting out on the middle island, and Dwigus Lowater (the new holder of the Ingot of the Constant) comes up on tracking. So I kack him. He hits decently hard, so I go up near Conium Darkblade (the rogue vendor) and med. 2 minutes later, I see "Bilge Farthom begins to cast a spell" and he roots the vendor! They start going at it, and I take what mana I had left and DUMP it on Bilge. Thankfully, I outdamaged the vendor. That is the only information I have, I hope that it helps you Bilge hunters out there.<BR>

Good Luck.<BR>
