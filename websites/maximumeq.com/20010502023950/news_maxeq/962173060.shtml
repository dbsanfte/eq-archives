I'm not even sure that they are *all* dropping.  To my knownledge, nobody has found Heroic Bond (level 52 cleric group AC/HP buff) or Mark of Karn (level 56 cleric spell, unknown effect), and I'm sure there are others for other classes.</font></p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;51+ spells are now UBBER LEWT! Tanks rip casters off for spells now! FIX IT! <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just today some tank comes wandering thru zone auctioning spells I have no idea how he got, a couple of which were for my class so i asked price. He says OFFER! So I offer 1,000pp which i think is way too high.. get a response of "LAF!"<BR>
</font>
Since EverQuest began, casters have participated in rolls for melee items, then sold them to those who could use them. I'm not really seeing a problem with the opposite happening here. Certainly there are those in the group who would never think of rolling on an item that they couldn't use, just as there have been casters who did just that when melee item were found. It seems to me that it all balances out in the long run. <BR>
<BR>
The spells seem to do a good job of spuring on the player-driven economy.<BR>

I wonder what this means for the release of The Hole.  Nobody will be anywhere near the level to test it.<BR><BR>

For those of you who had characters on test, you have my sympathy.  For 3 months or so, test was my home as well.  I had a level 22 necro, and several other characters around level 10 on that server.  I still played my necro every once and a while for a change of pace.</font></p>

*Character Wipe on Test*<BR>
<BR>
Over the past 15 months, the Test Server has been a fantastic platform for testing new and proposed changes to the live EverQuest servers.  However, in the past couple of months, with the release of several new zones, plus the entire Kunark expansion, the characters on the test server, and the equipment they carry, have been further deviating from the norm that is expected on the Live servers.  This has made testing certain aspects of the game more and more difficult as time goes on.  <BR>
<BR>
With great sympathy to those that have built their characters on Test and made the server their home, it is now necessary that we "clean the slate" on the Test server and return it to a state that will allow successful testing to take place.  To that end, as of today, all characters have been deleted from the Test server.  Though no reimbursement of characters, equipment, or levels is planned, strict guidelines have been established to govern future artificial buffing and equipment allocations on the test server in order to insure that the environment remains a clean testbed for enhancements proposed for the Live servers.  <BR>
<BR>
We would like to thank all of the Testers that have been helping on the server since release, and we hope that you will continue to do so.  An email address (testserver@verant.com) has been set up to receive your comments on this issue.  We will make sure that your comments are forwarded to the appropriate people.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your understanding,<BR>
<BR>

It's a shame, but at the same time, they are relatively small (especially linux) market shares, and I don't now what is involved in porting code over.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
>>>I know this is cluching at straws, but any chance of having EQ run on Linux?<BR>
</font>
We've no plans at this time to develop or release additional platform ports of the EverQuest client.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
>>>Also, what system was EQ developed on? If you can reply to that one without revealing too much...<BR>
</font>
<BR>
We use different tools for many different aspects of EQ. Outdoor geometry, indoor geometry, object building, character building, texture art, etc., all take place in different software packages. As for actual programming, it's done primarily in a combination of C and C++. <BR>
<BR>
As for what particular hardware platform is used for each thing, it varies between WinTel stuff, various Unix platforms, and the like.<BR>
