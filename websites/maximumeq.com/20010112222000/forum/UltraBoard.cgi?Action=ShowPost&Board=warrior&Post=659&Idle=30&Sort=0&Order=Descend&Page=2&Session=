<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Mostly, I'm looking for input from those with much experience on PvP (Rallos Zek) but posting here because it is such a warrior-centric question/subject.<p>

For those of you unfamiliar with Rallos Zek-PvP, when a player kills you, the first player to loot you can take "any" item except no-drop items, items held in your hands (including ranged and ammo slots) and things in bags. They also get any money you are carrying.<p>

So, good stat enhancing and high AC itmes are an advertisement to "kill me", although pk'ers(player killers) in newbie areas seem to be ignorant about how much money they are really making by pk'ing newbies with leather (and getting no xp's or skill increases from the fight) compared to just killing mobs.<p>

One more thing to consider. Most pker's are casters, and most of my char's have been killed relatively easily by "green" con'ing casters.<p>

Most of the "wisdom" on other posts regarding warrior races and stats are based on a few assumptions... <br>
1) The mobs you are hunting (or better... that are a threat to you) originate from a known static spawn which players often time. You are not blind-sided, except sometimes by trains.<br>
2) The capabilities and weaknesses of the mobs are usually known and planned for.<br>
3) Most mobs have "dumb" AI. They sometimes "seem" to work together, but really don't have a "purpose" other than to fight what attacks them or comes within their range.<br>
4) You are the hunter, not hunted.<br>
5) In a good, informed and prepared group you have a chance at survival. (I have seen 2 or more casters pop up, all targeting 1 player in a full group... that player dies, most of the time, often before anyone else in the group can do anything... or even "see" where the attackers are).<p>

So, on to the questions of races and stats a warrior on Rallos Zek should consider.<p>

Race question?<br>
It almost seems that the Bash (or is it Slam and I have the 2 backwards?) ability of the large races seems to be a must.  I plan to go to Lguk to get Shin armor (no drop - un-lootable by players), and hopefully a Basalt Carapace, also no drop.  The "test" ogre warrior I made was KOS by froglok tadpoles, so obviously would be more of a pain to get to Lguk.  All of the good race char's I made and have taken to Uguk are not KOS until they are involved with 1 froglok's death.  I have not tried a Barbarian on a trip to Uguk as of yet.  Anyone know if Barbs are KOS by frogloks or not?  <p>

Race cont...<br>
Also, guards are sometimes your only protection when you are low health/mana.  Even if you are an evil race, and "not" KOS, how quickly a guard helps you is affected by your factions... your options are seriously decreased when traveling.  If a guard con's "dubiously" to you but con's "amiably" to the person attacking you, it will take longer for the guard to attack him than you.  If you attack back in defense, it is basically an insta-death for you.  I also want to be able to be with, and help, friends... i.e., taking the boat from Freeport to Butcher is basically suicide for evil races without MAJOR faction work... finding people willing to invis (assuming it holds long enough) can be a real pain. Not to mention problems brought up about banking and buying & selling.<p>

So, race... Barbarian?<p>

Stats question...<br>
Keep in mind I solo... A LOT.<br>
I made a Barb and put all the points into STA thinking I could stay in a fight longer; I am re-thinking this.  At 5th level, I still didn't have any of my melee skills max'd... offense, defense, kick, or 1h blunt (preparing for dual wielding of 2 Scepters of Flame... +5 vs magic, +5 vs fire each).  At 5th level, I also obtained a GZ simply by spotting Karg for someone who only wanted the cloak he dropped!  8-)  By 7th level (exclusively using the GZ), 2h slash is in the low 30's where max would be 40.  Off & Def are max'd, I think, but kick is still in the low 30's... after 7 levels?!?  And I still need to go back to the 6th level skill of Slam (may have this and Bash switched around) along with 1h blunt and/or 1h slash!  I am really really thinking I need to reconsider putting more into DEX, especially if it helps more with weapon proc.s and critical hits.  Also keep in mind that Archery is used a “bit” more on PvP by warriors because arrows can be “fired” at players who are near guards, and yet the archer can stay out of the guards agro range.  More importantly, if you are rooted, you are a sitting duck unless you have a good long range bow and can “see” your attacker in an unobstructed line of sight, or if you are chasing someone who just attacked you and they decided to run, but he has a lead on you.  On PvP, you HAVE to use every skill/advantage you have to it’s fullest.<p>

One last thing to consider… I am in the middle of making a deal with a mid 40’s mage for the GBS my 20th shaman got in Qhills.  All hasn’t been ironed out, but I’m looking the very real possibility of having assistance getting no drop items such as; Shin Gauntlets & Greaves, Basalt Carapace, Opaline Helm, Firewalker Boots, Fiery Vambraces, Carnal Pauldrons, Ring of the Ancients, etc.  In addition, I’m hoping for roughly 5kpp of specific + resistance items.  If I am able to get these items, my unbuffed saves will be: +91 magic, +80 fire, +75 cold, +45 poison, +41 disease.  If I can also get the Gnomish Environmental Suite, I can boost fire, cold and poison to +90, +85 & +55… with the flexibility of swapping some items around for different circumstances, but the added liability of one more “lootable” item I’d be wearing.  I would almost exclusively wear no drop while soloing, some “lootable” items while in a group.  Most of the “lootable” + resist items would be reserved for when someone becomes an annoyance and I was “prepared” for them to come to me, or me go after them.  Pkers often attack when you are very low health after, or during, a fight.  I don’t think all the + resistance’s would save me at that point.<p>

Obviously, if I’m going to make a deal like this, the char I get the no drop items for had better have the best stats for a PvP style of gaming as possible!<p>

Anyway, I would like to hear from any mid to high level warriors who have done a lot of dueling with any other classes and your thoughts on the + resistance I’ve mentioned when going against any casters.  Also, when it comes to warrior vs. warrior duels, if you have done some serious comparisons on race, stats, armor and weapons to determine actual affects of stats on the outcome. <p>

P.S.  Before I get flamed for considering twinking to such a level on PvP… I’m not a Pker… and you should see what twinked Pkers do to untwinked players!<p>

Thanks in advance,<br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Ok, no experience here on PvP servers myself for a couple reasons:<p>

Imo, EQ is NOT set up for a PvP community and with the amount of time it does take to aquire valuable (read lootable) items, I don't feel like getting them ganked by a naked-zone camping-ice commeting wizzie.  <p>

That said, I do have some experience dueling various classes.  As you stated, guards may be your only choice for help sometimes, so Barbarian.  The no shield bash is "slam" btw.  But, if you are willing to give up that faction, I would really consider a troll.  Being able to sit in some untraversed area with regen would seem to be a great advantage over any other race.  Barbarians get a little buff in cold resistence, I'm not sure exactly how troll/ogre resistences are. (a barbarian following the tribunal is not kos to froggies, I doubt one following rallos zek is either)<p>

Another thing to consider.  Dark elf and wood elf warriors have the ability to hide, I don't know what other races do.  While it doesn't seem to work when hiding from NPC's, when you're hidden, you are hidden from PC view.  In my experience.  This could also be another plus during downtime while soloing.<p>

Stats:  This can stray into the PvE area, which is where I've done some testing.  At level 45, using a Mithril Staff (28/45) with base strength of 113 (no buff/no item) my averaged dmg on a Ice Giant was only 6 points lower (on average 6 points per hit) that at 207 strength (items and 51 shm buff).  Stamina, using a wurmslayer (weight 15) and a sarnak skullsplitter (weigh oh, 4.5 I think, don't recall) I notice no difference in how fast my stamina goes down at base 105, from buffed+items at 165+.  What the stat STA does, is creates hitpoints.  The amount of hitpoints depends on level.  Agility, once over 100 agility, 6 agil = 1 AC **on my sheet**.  I notice no difference in my amount of dodges nor parrys with buffed Agility.  Only a slight increase in AC.  Dexterity, with processing weapons, I notice and *extreme* difference between a base of 77dex and anything over 100 dex, but anything past 100 seems to have little or no effect.  <p>

That said, if I could change my stats, I would put (25 beginning points I think...) Put points in agility until 100, and the rest into stamina.  That's PvE, although the only thing I can see helping you stat wise in PvP is the most hitpoints and ac you can scrounge up, so I would recommend the same.<p>

***Keep in mind I have no experience in PvP.  Only in duels, which are much different than a red server.  This is all opinion, of what I would do if starting a warrior on a Zek.  (and I would NOT even think about Rallos, but that's another thread ;)  Good luck.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">
