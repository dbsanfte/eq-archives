<br> The latest episode is now up as well
<br>
<br> Confrontations Part 8
<br>
<br> "She shuddered slightly and stretched her arms out high above her
<br> head. Her
<br> body ached that was for sure, and that dream . . . never had visions that
<br> punctuated her sleep been so lucid. It only served to add to her
<br> worry, the
<br> symbol in her dream was clearly that of Cazic-Thule, a god whose evil was
<br> well documented down the ages. Yet, the dark figure claimed to be her only
<br> hope for help, what kind of a foul contradiction was that.
<br>
<br> The wound on her back stung sharply, as if reacting to the brush with evil
<br> itself. Stretching round to feel the flesh of her naked back tenderly she
<br> noted the wound was raw again, as if torn anew. She looked down at the
<br> bedclothes, at least it did not appear to be bleeding.
<br>
<br> She sighed again slowly, and reached down to the chest as Iste had
<br> indicated. To her surprise her silk robes had been washed and treated, her
<br> mail armour polished and her boots cleaned inside and out.
<br> Placing the heavy
<br> mail carefully to one side for now, she slipped her long silk
<br> robe over head
<br> tentatively, even the soft silk paining her wound upon contact.
<br>
<br> Tying the loose tassels across her bust she slipped her red sash
<br> around her
<br> waist so that the robe fitted comfortably.  Stretching out again
<br> to try and
<br> shake the lethargy from her bones, Safka took a deep breath and let it out
<br> slowly."

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>
<br>I am canceling the Lotto. There is to much hassle with people constantly bombarding me with tells saying that I am a sham. The fact is I have hosted over four lotto's and ask anyone that was in them it was no sham. In fact I gave away over 200pp and spent two hours doing one lotto and I did not keep any of the money. Since people do not appreciate the fact that I was just trying to have some fun in the "game" I will be canceling the lotto. So far I have returned all of the money except for one person. That was over 1kpp so as you can see it was no sham. I will try to run something else in the future that does not involve money so that we could get the Seventh Hammer Server some notice. If you have an ideas email me and maybe collectively we can come up with ideas to make our server more enjoyable.

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Gordon comments on Cleric Nerfing">Gordon comments on Cleric Nerfing</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 11/11/00 15:17 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Not nerfed, he says, just "fixed"...</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Lately, clerics have been the subject of an unending string of nerfs everything from MoK to Donals Arms.
<br>
<br>We'll have new helmet models with Velious. That said, I don't think that the changes to Mark of Karn or Donals arms constitute any real "nerf" to the class. Both issues represented something that created untenable problems in game that had to be addressed.
<br>
<br>You decreased the power on a cleric-only item and a cleric-only spell. I think by most people's definition that's a nerf.
<br>
<br>If something goes in that's undoubtedly overpowered, I don't think that it's a "nerf" to repair it. While I'll accept people calling things that are borderline "nerfs", there are some things that are just common sense. If we put in a new wizard spell that's supposed to do 1600 damage, and someone accidently makes it do 16000, is it a nerf to fix it?

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Arg. I just sold my staff of the observers, my most prized possession, to a vendor, instead of the cracked staff that I had intended. (That's what happens when you put down your staff to pick up your crude stein)... Ummm... could we get a confirmation box to help prevent this type of obviously WRONG sale? 
<br>
<br>I don't think we need another confirmation box.
<br>
<br>The one you get for dropping things was added to prevent people (bards) from dropping things during a hectic combat. I really see no need for a confirmation box when selling. If you wish, just right click everything before you sell it, sort of like a personally generated confirmation box.
