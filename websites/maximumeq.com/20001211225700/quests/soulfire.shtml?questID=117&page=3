**Submitted by Chris B.**<BR>

"The quest for the Soulfire is VERY long, and involved. To begin the quest you must speak to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth (In North Freeport). She'll give you a note which you need to deliver to Guard Alayle (Or something close), a spy in the freeport militia building. Go in and<BR>
deliver the note, only to receive an illegible peice of paper in return (And get to see the guard get killed). Take the note back to Kalatrina, and she'll tell you to talk to Rashinda Elore in the Freeport Office of the People (NOTE : Once you give the note to Kalatrina, you'll have to wait six<BR>
hours to get another one.) Ask Rashinda "Have you heard of Zimel's Blades?', then ask her about Ariska Zimel ('Who was Ariska Zimel?'), and finally about Groflah Steadirt ('Who is Groflah Steadirt?'). Head back to Kalatrina and<BR>
tell her that Zimel's Blades was condemned. After this, it's time to visit Groflah Steadirt. Go to Groflah's forge in North Freeport, and give him the note. He will give it back, and tell you to meet him in the seafarers roost<BR>
at night. Don't bet on seeing him. I have stayed in that building for nearly two straight days, without seeing him once. Instead, wait for a beggar named 'Tykar Renlon' (Or something close, he's the only beggar who appears) to<BR>
spawn and immediately set about giving him five Drom's Champagnes. He disappears quickly, so you must hurry. Once you've given him all five, he'll give you a blanket. Go make yourself some bog juice and edible goo (Two easy<BR>
baking and brewing recipes), then give one goo to the beggar in jail. Once he asks for 'Bog'n goo! Blanket too!', give him 1 bog juice, 1 edible goo, and the blanket, to get a key (H.K. 102). Take the key to the banker in high<BR>
keep to get a note. Give this note to Brother Hayle (The Cleric imprisoned in Splitpaw - Be careful you don't lock yourself in his cell!), and he'll give it back to you, as well as the intructions of what else to get to gain<BR>
the Soulfire. He will tell you to get the Glowing Hilt, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, and your Testimony. The Glowing Hilt is found on Xicotl, the troll shadowknight in Mistmoore Castle. To get the Brilliant sword of faith, kill<BR>
Sir Lucan D'lere and his skeletal remains, gain his testimony, then give that testimony to Valeron. To get your Testimony, first speak to Merko in the hall of truth. He'll give you a note to give to  Altunic Jartin in EC.<BR>
Wait in Altunic's house for him to appear (It's near the last inn before WC), and give him the note. Walk outside, and fight Squire Narl. He packs a good punch, and his Harm Touch can be painful on a lower-level character,<BR>
but he's not too hard. After killing him and getting his head, go buy a cloth shirt from one of the merchants in the commons (I beleive the inn between orc camps sells the shirt). Give the head to Altunic, then give him<BR>
the shirt, to get a Token of Generosity. Buy (Or fight for one) a Spider Venom Sack, and return to Merko. Tell him you've earned the Token of Generosity, and he'll ask you for the sack. Give it to him, and get the Token of Bravery. Then hand in both tokens to get your final task : Run into<BR>
the sewers and kill the Militia spy there, and return her token to Merko to get your Testimony. Once you have all these items, hand the returned note from bother hayle, the hilt, the sword, and the testimony to Brother Hayle<BR>
(NOTE : You must have AT LEAST Kindly faction with him, or you'll have to start all over again!) to receive the Soulfire.<BR>
<BR>
<p><BR>
The Soulfire is the coolest looking sword in the game, with flames running<BR>
up the length. It's only attainable by a good group of level 40+ players, as<BR>
killing Lucan is a very hard thing to do."</div>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>For those of you having trouble with the Lucan fight, I am <BR>
pleased to announce there is a very simple way to kill him.<BR>
<BR>
I have seen groups of 30 or more train him to the east commons<BR>
zone border, out in West Freeport newbie area, and fail to<BR>
take him down. I have seen groups of 30 or more litter the<BR>
newbie area with atleast half or more of their large party<BR>
dead.<BR>
<BR>
Well, the other night, a Lucan mission was aranged on my<BR>
behalf. We threw the mission together within 15 minutes, <BR>
and were impatient, so we decided to make a go of it with<BR>
only 13 people. We killed Lucan, and I now carry Soulfire.<BR>
<BR>
This is how we did it.<BR>
<BR>
We had 1 puller. She was a level 41 Barbarian Shaman. In her <BR>
group were 3 other people. All 3 in the low teen range of levels.<BR>
<BR>
Our puller went into Lucans room in the guard house. The 3<BR>
lower level members of her group were stationed, 1 at each<BR>
door in the guard house leading out.<BR>
<BR>
Meenwhile, we had 1 detainer stationed at the north freeport zone.<BR>
The zone to noth freeport that is by the gallows poles. (the<BR>
hangmans nooses hanging in the courtyard by the broken wall).<BR>
<BR>
Meenwhile, the remaining 8 people (Myself and 7 others all of<BR>
us level 40 and above, 2 were level 50) we stayed way off to <BR>
the side in that courtyard so as to be out of agro range of<BR>
any guard pulled through there.<BR>
<BR>
While our puller stood in the guard house next to lucan, and<BR>
the 3 doormen stood at each of their doors, and our detainer<BR>
waited by the north freeport zone, our 8 member (2 groups<BR>
of 4 people each) meticulously trained and killed 1 guard at<BR>
a time to clear away all inner city guards. Ignoring any guard<BR>
inside the militia house. We also made sure to kill the guard<BR>
that is stationed by the N. FP zone.<BR>
<BR>
Once all the guards were cleared, we did a should for our<BR>
puller to start her run. When she announced the run was on,<BR>
all 3 doormen opend the doors of the militia house, allowing<BR>
her a clean run out of the building, without her having to <BR>
stop and open any doors for herself. This allowed her to exit<BR>
the guard house without taking unnecessary hits in the process<BR>
of pulling.<BR>
<BR>
She trained lucan and the 2 guards that stay by him in his room<BR>
along with 2 hall gurds all the way to that far north FP zone.<BR>
Once there, our detainer targeted Lucan, and began hailing him<BR>
over and over. Eventually, the other guards returned to the<BR>
guard house leaving lucan there alone.<BR>
<BR>
Just as we were about to advance on Lucan, 2 of the guard house<BR>
guards returned to lucans side. This was because someone in<BR>
freeport wanted to role play being a militia supporter and<BR>
trained them back to stop us from killing Lucan. This was a<BR>
bit upsetting, and quite rude on their part, but the joke was<BR>
on them, as they had to zon, and once they did, the 2 guards <BR>
again returned to their posts.<BR>
<BR>
Once the guards made their way back to the guard house a second<BR>
time, we began to move on Lucan again. By this time though, the<BR>
guard by the zone respawned.<BR>
<BR>
This was a minor inconvienience. One of the 8 people in the<BR>
combat group was a druid, so he snared the zone guard, and took<BR>
him on a tour of the city, taking a beating the whole time, but<BR>
he gave us the oppertunity we needed. This left only 7 of us<BR>
to kill Lucan. <BR>
<BR>
Well, we figured it was "no guts, no glory" time, so we attacked.<BR>
The detainer 9who was only level 30 or so) joined in with us<BR>
and we fought hard. It took a while, but Lucan finally fell. And<BR>
suprisingly, Lucan made no attempt to run away. After Lucan<BR>
fell, his skelleton immediately spawned. We turned and started<BR>
pounding on Lucans Undead form. The skelleton went down quite<BR>
a bit easier than Lucan's living form. But sadly, in the process, <BR>
our level 30 detainer who bravely joined in did not survive.<BR>
<BR>
But, I am pleased to announce, this fact did not bother him in the<BR>
least, and he actually enjoyed the experience. And I am even<BR>
happier to announce, that out of our rag-tag combat group of<BR>
only 8 people, he was the only fatality.<BR>
<BR>
I looted the Skelleton, and recovered Lucans testimony. And once<BR>
I got it, all 12 of us immediately zoned.<BR>
<BR>
Ahhhhhhhh But there was 13 members in this mission you say?<BR>
<BR>
Yes, our fearless druid who went on a sightseeing tour of<BR>
the city and newbie are with many guards hot on his heals...<BR>
<BR>
Well, I am pleased to announce, that he managed to keep ahead<BR>
of the guards, and he made his way to the other north FP zone<BR>
and came through with 2 bubbles of health left!  :-)<BR>
<BR>
So, out of 13 people to do the Lucan portion of the Soulfire<BR>
quest, 12 survived, and the mission was a success on the first<BR>
attempt.<BR>
<BR>
A couple nights after, we decided the "spur of the moment" idea<BR>
seemed to work well for us, so we did another spur of the <BR>
moment set up to raid Mistmoor to attempt to recover the hilt<BR>
from Xicotl in the castle.<BR>
<BR>
We had 2 groups (neither full) approximately the same number<BR>
of people, and we barged our way into the castle. We lucked<BR>
out and no one was camping the spawn, and we got even luckier<BR>
when Xicotl spawned a meer 15 minutes after we arrived in the<BR>
room. <BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, I looted the hilt, and we suffered no deaths<BR>
in that raid. As a matter of fact, a couple lower level Pali's<BR>
who came with us, managed to walk out with a nice little<BR>
ammount of coin, and a couple pieces of mistmoor granite which<BR>
they needed for some of their ro-armor quests.<BR>
<BR>
I want to personally thank the guilds that form multi guild<BR>
alliance "The Circle Of Karana" on the Karana server. The<BR>
guild I belong to ( "Wyrmlore Council" ) is just one of the<BR>
guilds in this alliance. But all the guilds share the same<BR>
morals and ideals, and without them, I would not be carrying<BR>
Soulfire today. I owe each and every one of them more than I<BR>
can ever hope to repay. And they all have my endless thanks<BR>
and gratituide. This is a large collection of incredibly<BR>
friendly and supportive people, and there is not a single one<BR>
of them that will ever hear the word "no" from me when they<BR>
are in need of anything.<BR>
<BR>
If any of you reading the message boar here are on the Karana<BR>
server, or are thinking of starting up a character on a server<BR>
other than the one you are on, take my advice. Make a character<BR>
on Karana, and seek out "The Circle Of Karana". If you are of<BR>
a like hearted soul, you couldn't possibly do anything more<BR>
intelligent than to seek membership within one of these<BR>
guilds. If you are fortunate enough to become a member of a<BR>
circle guild, you will find a home, filled with people who<BR>
will stand by you every step of the way in everything you<BR>
do.<BR>

The item is a lore item which means you can't hold more than one. This also means that you have to constantly buy and give to pass over 5 bottles. In the time limit allowed before the beggar disappears the best I have managed is to have the 4th bottle in my hand. It seems like there is nowhere enough time to do this.<BR>
Am I doing something wrong? Or is there a knack to getting it done in the time limit?<BR>
Any help my fellow Paladins can offer would be much appreciated.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I feel your pain and I know you're frustration. And quite<BR>
often, the answer is so simple that it is seemingly<BR>
impossible to discover. Yes, this can be done. I have done<BR>
it myself on a few occasions, but you have to be VERY quick<BR>
and your system has to be almost entirely lag free.<BR>
<BR>
In a perfect worl, we would all have jedi reflexes and <BR>
pentium 900's with 10,000 gigabytes of ram, and a voodoo 6<BR>
with VR glasses and Micro Thought ESP input. But, like<BR>
most of you, I am lucky to afford the overgrown calculator<BR>
I got now... so pipe dreams aside...<BR>
<BR>
Allow me to paraphrase Mr. John Lennon:<BR>
<BR>
I get by with a little help from my friends, I get high<BR>
with a little help from my friends, gonna give a begger <BR>
some Drom's with a little hel from my friends...<BR>
<BR>
You get the idea...<BR>
<BR>
Have a friend with you. Your friend can target the beggar<BR>
and continuously hail him, while you buy the chanpagne. <BR>
This will only affor you a couple extra secondsm but it may<BR>
be just enough for your needs.<BR>
<BR>
You may also want to try buying the first droms before the<BR>
beggar even shows, and have it as your cursor for a "pre-<BR>
emptive strike".<BR>
<BR>
Also, you notice you cannot stand on the side of the bar<BR>
the beggar spawns on and purchase droms from there. You have<BR>
to purchase the drinks from the front side where "Cliff and<BR>
Norm" (the regulars - sorry for the obscrure "Cheers" <BR>
reference) stand. But you may want to give this a try...<BR>
<BR>
Try standing by the corner, and get positioned in a place <BR>
where you can see the spot the beggar spawns in, and still <BR>
be able to simply turn and activate the bartender to buy <BR>
another bottle. This way, you dont have to walk to the <BR>
beggar, it's merely a "Buy, Spin, Hand, Spin, Buy" matter.<BR>
<BR>
And remember, make good use of the escape key. After you<BR>
buy one bottle, escape out of the merchant screen, spin, <BR>
and hit your "I" key to open inventory to get the bottle<BR>
you just bought.<BR>
<BR>
One last trik<BR>
<BR>
I do not remember if Droms is "No Drop". I do know it's lore<BR>
but if it is not "NO DROP" You may want to have 4 of your<BR>
friends buy a bottle. So all 5 of you have one, and all<BR>
5 of you have the bottle set as your cursor. Hand him yours,<BR>
and as long as you have it worked out with your friends<BR>
as to who will hand YOU the droms first, second, third, etc..<BR>
you should do well that way.<BR>
<BR>
But if you use THIS method, make sure that your friends <BR>
hand the droms to YOU. If they hand it to the beggar, he<BR>
will condsider it the first bottle of 5 to come from that<BR>
person. The one getting the blanket MUST HAND ALL 5.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps...<BR>

I know you're supposed to wait for the beggar instead of Steadirt, but the beggar won spawn for me! Where exactly in Seafarer's does he spawn? Any tips on this would be greatly appreciated. Also, if any high level guild on the SOL RO sever would help me w/ Lucan/Xicotyl, I would donate something for that. Thanks...</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>About having to have atleast 'Kindly' faction w/ Brother Hayle, how do I do that? Most of the clerics in NFP look indifferently to me, does that mean he will too? All my other NFP factions are maxxed out... does that mean anything to him or what?) And about waiting for Groflah... do I have to give him ANOTHER note after giving him the one in the forge? Or do I just hail him? Or should I just forget Groflah and wait for the beggar? (Although I cant seem to get either one of them to spawn) And I have already given my note to Groflah and didnt catch his or the beggar's spawn... must I start over? And one more thing about the Hayle faction... should I get my cleric faction up more before I start the quest over if needed? And sorry, I must ask one more thing... is it possibe to get "Your" testimony early out of the quest w/o messing up the quest sequence when you do the whole thing? Any help on the questions would be GREATLY appreciated... sorry for any annoyances I may be)  </font></td></tr></table>
