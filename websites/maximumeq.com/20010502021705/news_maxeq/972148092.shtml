*New Servers*<BR>
<BR>
We're pleased to announce that we are bringing up two new servers in the near future. <BR>
<BR>
Tholuxe Paells will be a server for new characters only (no moves) and will be brought up following the patch this Wednesday.  Drinal will be a split server, initially accepting characters from Mithaniel Marr and Tunare.  We may open /movelog registrations for other servers in the future as system-load allows.<BR>
<BR>
Registration for the move (via "/movelog yes") will take place on Friday, September 29th between 6PM PDT (GMT-7) and 12AM. You must be in game and run the command if you wish to be moved.  As a reminder, no special arrangements are made to keep guilds or groups together in the transition. If too many people execute the command to take them all, it is possible that some might get left behind. Also, any corpses left in the world at the time the actual split takes place will not follow you to the new server. The time of the split will be publicized on the "Scheduled Downtime" page at www.everquest.com.<BR>
<BR>
One final note: There is a potential problem with the /movelog command when issued by hundreds of people at one time.  We highly recommend that you wait at least 15 minutes after registration opens prior to using the command. If you have any concerns that your command may not have gone through, you can zone and repeat the command if you wish.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Actually only 2H weapons with a delay under 28 had their damage bonus reduced. Weapons 28 to 39 stayed the same, with those above 40 getting an increase. <BR>
As for your problem, this is the first I've heard of a problem along these lines. I'll ask the programmer to take a look tomorrow and see that everything is ok.<BR>
