<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Gordon Answers More Complainers">Gordon Answers More Complainers</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 12/17/99 08:34 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>What a job Gordon has, answering the cornucopia of whining players that infest this fine game.   Here is what he had to say about non-caster binding and other beaten to death topics.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Forum Poster:<br>
If Verant were to let casters bind anyone, anywhere, the gameplay of EQ would be greatly enhanced. For one, casters would not have to wait for their tanks to return to the dungeon, creating much less downtime and adding to the enjoyment of the game. In addition, melee classes would no longer run the very high risk of being killed while returning to the action, and being forced to suffer an even higher XP loss than the caster. <p>
Gordon:<br>
This is a very old argument. I could talk about the fact that death is supposed to be inconveniencing. It’s supposed to be something that you really don’t want to happen. I could talk about how this design is just as inconveniencing for the casters as it is the melee types. I could talk about value added to druids, wizards, clerics, and necromancers who all provide post-death services to characters. I could talk about balance issues in regards to having it so anyone can die and be right back in combat 30 seconds after it happens. I could talk about a lot of things. 
<p>
When it comes down to it, some classes can do things that other classes can’t. That is the simplest explanation I can give without going into how a change in bind would cause a dramatic shift to many dynamics in the game. Some people don’t play melee-types just due to this disadvantage. Other people don’t play casters just because of the fact that a caster can’t take a hit. It’s all a matter of personal preference. Is a given disadvantage too large for you to play the class? It’s up to you to choose. 
<p>
Forum Poster:<br>
Second, why can't Verant stick to their deadlines? John Smedley reported that a new server would be up in early November. Of course, after we make demands when the deadline has come and gone 
<p>
Gordon:<br>
We have had a tendency to be overconfident with our estimations, and that is not intentional. Believe me, with the amount of flack we catch when we miss a deadline, it would be much easier to get it right the first time. Sometimes though, schedules must be adjusted, and there is no way around that. I should mention that John Smedley said that a new server would be coming up “soon”, not “in early November”. In addition to getting a rein on our overconfidence, we need to be a little less free with the term “soon”. We are working on this and you should see some definite improvement. 
<p>
Forum Poster:<br>
What makes it even worse is that Verant never bothers to inform us why they have missed the deadline. . It is a known fact among players that Verant consistently lies about their deadlines 
<p>
Gordon:<br>
As far as the new server goes, I told you that we missed it, and I told you why we missed it: Someone that needs to be here cannot. What else would you like to know? Yes, we missed the deadline. I first said it would be up by the end of this week, and had to move it off to early next week. But as to the suggestion that we somehow had some malicious intent in missing the deadline by a day or two at most, that’s just silly. 
<p>
I hope this clears things up. "

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"Hello there, I don't have any specific comments right now, but I did want to let you know that there are some very good thoughts here. Yes, I think we did underestimate greed's effect on gameplay. We *hoped* that people would prefer to "do" a dungeon, meaning fight their way through it, not just run in to get ItemX. 
Many of the changes we are making now are to try and shape the game back into what we (and the majority of the players) wanted it to be at release, removing the influence of greed. Despite some of the short term pain, I think we're making progress for the long term. "

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>I shall attempt to clarify: <p>
1. The Fiery Avenger is currently NOT obtainable -- GZ and I are working the new FA quest and we will announce when it's active (sorry, no ETA). 
<p>
2. Aradune is neither a GM (at least, in the customer service sense), nor a character I play. He is more a dynamic event/RP character, representing the avatar of the god Karana. 
<p>
3. I do play a real character, a half-elf ranger, who is in his mid-20s. No I won't tell you which server :)
<p>
4. The Fiery Avenger is a Paladin-only weapon. The Fiery Avenger Aradune wields was altered by Karana such that Aradune could wield it (meaning it is an exception and is unique).

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"Greetings folks, 
We've put together a website geared toward the server coming online next week. Having a Server website from the get-go will hopefully get everyone in the same place and off to a good start. The message boards are up and running, and there is a guild feature that lets you view potential guilds that are looking for members even before the server opens!! A section called "looking for group!" is geared to help folks find regular hunting groups. Also, a common desire we've been hearing alot, Player Run Quests, will be added to the site. For anyone who wants to take a more active role in the dynamics of a server society, check it out!

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1><b>Newsgroup Poster:</b><br> "Your group walks the road less taken, Brad. Solusek A is generally fairly empty, even when the server is overly full. You make a good point in that there ARE dungeons for the 20-40 crowd that are underutilized (permafrost, paw , sola, mistmoore)... but what you forget is that there are REASONS why they're that way." <p>
<b>Brad:</b><br>
"Actually, that was exactly the point I was trying to make (I wasn't trying to imply there aren't crowding issues -- there are, and we're launching a new server soon, as well as exploring whether we could combine Talon and Valon, thus freeing up another). "<p>
Newsgroup Poster:<br>

"Solusek A, for example, is a huge maze. It trains fairly easily, there are a fair number of casters, everything runs, and it has lava. Even with a map, the only time I would go into SolA is invisible, to run straight to an item spawn spot and start camping. On the other hand, SolA *is* reasonably itemized, unlike Paw2. :) "<p>
<b>Brad:</b><br>

"From my perspective, the jury is still out on Paw2 -- if it needs item upgrades, it will get them -- I just think it's too early to condemn the zone like some people are so quickly willing to. 
<p>
As for the difficulty of Sol A, I find it a moderately difficult zone, and both a challenging and fun one. Same for Permafrost (Mistmoore even more difficult). I also find it a great place for exp (which is primarily why we were there the other night). I don't think every zone should have the same difficulty rating (in fact, even if I did think that, there's no practical way to insure they would have a similar difficulty rating -- too many variables). I think the general solution for more difficult zones is to add incentives in terms of treasure in order to entice players to go there. But even then, many players simply prefer the path of least resistance, and are willing to put up with crowding rather than confront the extra challenge. 
<p>
Also, to answer another post in a similar thread, the reason I wasn't in Paw is quite simple: I wanted to avoid the crowds. With the zone changed, there were a ton of people there (expected), and I (and my guild) tend to hang out in the less crowded, more difficult zones. 
<p>
I do look forward to heading to Paw soon, though. "<p>

Sound familiar?  It is direct from the newsgroups or from one of the various message boards dedicated to EQ.<p>

Today's whine revolves around EBay.  Gordon Wrinn, Verant's PR Guru, had this to say in response to one individuals blathering:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"Let me see if I get this straight: You are saying that EQ isn’t suited to roleplayers because you can’t get some loot that someone else has? Frankly, I’m afraid I don’t agree. In fact, I can’t see how one has anything to do with the other. I’ve always had a hard time explaining realism of an infinite numbers of items. 
<p>
I don't think I'll be commenting further on the items removed thus far. There's only so much I can say to explain it, and that's pretty well exhausted. "

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"I certainly understand where you are coming from. There are many dynamics involved in moving characters, with or without equipment, and we've discussed both. If we allow them to move with equipment, we run the risk of messing up the economy of the destination server. If we allow them to move without equipment, we run the risk of messing up the economy of the old server (as they give away all their gear). 
<p>
In addition, there is also the subject of unique names. 
<p>
These are not necessarily insurmountable problems, and it's possible that it might be tackled in the future. However we'll have to see how our resources look after the expansion. "
