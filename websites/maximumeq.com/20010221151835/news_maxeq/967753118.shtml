<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="More Monks vs. Warriors">More Monks vs. Warriors</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/12/00 15:48 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Abashi explained more about why he ran the test the way he did.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>For the past several weeks, the complaints by monks here on the board (most of the complaints anyway) have been that they no longer outdamage warriors. The tests that I did were only to confirm that that wasn't true. Yes, I conceed that monks cannot takes hits as well as warriors, but that's never been where the disagreement has been. When people said, "Monks no longer outdamage warriors", I had to disagree, which is why I ended up testing it out. However, when people now say, "We can't take hits like a warrior", I agree with that.<BR>
Dealing out more damage than the warrior doesn't mean that you'll beat the warrior in a duel, nor that the ratio of damage dealing to damage taking capability is constant. The benefit of extra damage has more weight than the disadvantage of being defensively inferior. <BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that some would say, "If a warrior can solo creature X in two minutes and be almost dead at the end, then a monk should be able to do the same in a minute and end up almost dead". This would be an example of constant ratio between offense and defense and the two classes. This however isn't the case. If the ratio were constant as suggested, there would, again, be no reason to have the warrior, because the monk's other skills would make them preferable in all cases. Not to mention, there's an added benefit any time a creature is killed faster than normal, a benefit that can't be measured directly against the power of the class, but more against its usefulness to the group. Would a group, for instance, like to kill things in 2 minutes and end up OOM and near death at the end? Or would the rather do it in 1 minute and end up the same way? They'd want it done faster in all cases. That's what monks and rogues add as melee classes.<BR>
<BR>
Concerning everyone saying that the test wasn't "valid", I fully agree with that from a scientific standpoint. Many more combats would have to be carried out than the ones I could do over a couple of hours yesterday. To be honest, its not really my job to test things of this nature, I just do it as needed so I can speak with first-hand experience. Though the specific percentage point differences can't really be considered averages, I do think that the test fairly well answered the question: Do monks outdamage warriors?<BR>
<BR>
There was one interesting thing in the test that I didn't mention in the post yesterday, concerning the one time that the warrior outdamaged the monk. The warrior was using his best combo out of the 5 weapon combos I tried, the monk his worst (bare knuck). The damage ratios were determined by seeing how long it took for the character to kill the NPC in question. The monk completed the task in under two minutes in every case but one, where it took 2:03. The warrior was over two minutes in every case, with its fastest time at 2:01. The monk's best time, by the way, was 1:30.<BR>

Abashi did a test, read all about it below.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I'm about to take off, but I thought I'd drop by some data before I do. <BR>
I took a level 60 human monk and a level 60 human warrior with the same stats, equipped them each with an FBSS, and cast strength, dex, and SLTW on them. <BR>
<BR>
With the monk, I tried 6 different weapons combos, starting at bare knuck, and ending with the top PoS weapon. (Didn't get into VP stuff which is better). With the warrior, I tried 5 different weapons combos, starting with dual SSoYs, and ending the the top PoS weapons. (Again, didn't get into VP).<BR>
<BR>
Both PCs, at level 60, spawned an engaged a level 45 NPC (one on one with the NPC) for each test. As this is a test of offensive potential, the NPC was not allowed to fight back. Both PCs used 1 additional combat skill as often as it was available. Kick for the warrior and flying kick for the monk. Neither used any disciplines. It should be noted that since the NPC was not allowed to fight back, the warrior never entered berserk mode, which could sway results some in actual combat. I might run the tests over for the warrior while keeping him in berserk mode.<BR>
<BR>
Results: The monk outdamaged the warrior given appropriate equipment in every case. The only time the warrior outdamaged the monk was when the warrior had his best weapon, and the monk his worst (bare knuck). <BR>
<BR>
Matching up weapon-type for weapon type, the monks worst set (bare knuck) versus the warriors worst (dual ssoy's), the monk outdamaged the warrior by nearly 25%. Best versus best, the monks outdamaged by just over 25%. The lowest difference obtained for appropriate equipment was still a 20% surplus to monks. The worst armed monk versus the best armed warrior still favored the monk by 10%. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there was only one combat versus the NPC per PC per weapons combo, so those numbers will probably move a bit over several combats. As it is, it's a pretty good indicator that monks are doing fine, and yes, they rock <BR>
