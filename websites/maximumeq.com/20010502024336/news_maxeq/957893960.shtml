Hard caps on faction (effectively not allowing them into any city but their own) would definately be a challenge.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have been killing Gnolls in BB for almost a total of 15 hours and have yet to see a faction change. I would thhink I would decrease to atleast threateningly by now.. but nope. Any general idea of how many hours I will need to spend in BB total to get good enough faction to enter Qeynos alive being an Iksar Monk of Cazic?<BR>
Some factions have thresholds for how good or how bad they can get. I wouldn't be able to comment on whether or not it was this that you are hitting here (haven't checked to be honest, but wouldn't be able to say if I had), but it's possible.<BR>

Of course, the only time that more would be needed is on large raids (like planes and dragon runs).</font></p>

>>>Custom send groups. Being able to add friends from all guilds, or unguilded to one send, and vice versa, would make talk between friends far easier.<BR>

We're still working on an enhancement called /ftell. When implemented, it will send your message in a /tell to everyone on your friends list. <BR>

>>>On the 27th I was able to obtain several wings for the newbie shaman quest for Iksar's. I camped for the night, and when I awoke the next day all my wings were gone and after hours of hunting mosquito's I was unable to find any wings in the loot. <BR>
</font>
This was our fault. One of the guys attempted to make the wings stackable, but something didn't work out which caused the mosquito wings to become invalid. This caused them to disappear.<BR>
