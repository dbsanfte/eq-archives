Or talk to her, get the heart, give it to varsoon, and then you get the gbs?  If this is true, does that mean I'm supposed to let Varsoon live if he spawns?  Hehehe, some clarification would be nice.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok here are my findings after camping her for 15 hours. First of all she will NEVER spawn at the ruins. The closest she will come to spawning at the ruins is on the zone wall to the NE of ruins. But it is very rare. Tovax has nothing to do with her spawning. I was with a druid and Tovax was up every single time Pyzjn spawned. She has 3 PH during the night and 3 during the day. Even though she cant spawn during the day, she still has mobs that spawn in her place. The daytime PH's are a grizzly bear, giant rat and large rat. The night PH's are a Putrid skelly, Dreadcorpse skelly and a Skeleton. She is a rare spawn but not real rare. Im guessing that alot of people that camp her by sitting at ruins never see her even when she is up. She can spawn a considerable distance from ruins. I have read the above post about Varsoon and letting Pyzjn walk to him, but the problem I have with this theory is that Varsoon is 5x more rare than Pyzjn. In 15 hours I have seen Varsoon once and he despawned and Pyzjn never spawned while he was up. I dont know what makes Varsoon spawn, but maybe thats what we need to be looking into instead of what makes Pyzjn spawn. If the Varsoon heart theory is correct, then things seem to more difficult now than I previously thought. First of all keeping Pyzjn alive long enough to have her take a stroll through the zone seems next to impossible. Second of all, having Varsoon up at the time that Pyzjn is up seems nearly as impossible. Until I actually get a chance to check this out, I will not try to discredit it. But I do know that people have pinpointed her exact spawn points and time(13 min btw) and put friends at those points and have seen her actually spawn and have gotten the stone. I will be taking a break from camping her now, but will definately be back after my patience heals a bit. Good luck to everyone!!!  </font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok now we are getting somewhere. I did research the quest that gets Varsoon to spawn and yes it does definately exist. You have to get a note from Gharin by giving him 4 Crows special brews that can apparantely be bought off an Npc guy named Crow. Then you take the note to Nomaria Doseniar who is located in the the Sk guildhall. Then in return she gives you a fake note. You then take that note to Surefall and give it to an npc(cant remember name). This causes Tovax to high tail it to the ruins and drop a note and this causes Varsoon to spawn. Now in order to do this, you need to make an evil character in Qeynos. So after researching this quest, I was very eager to give it a try. I made an evil Sk and went and found Crow. This is where I ran into my first problem. He would not sell to me. He kept saying he was busy right now. I was indifferently to him so faction couldnt have been the reason. Does anyone know how to get him to sell the Crow's special brews? I talked to him for a long time and finally gave up. So then I went to plan B. Apparantly you can just kill this Gharin guy and get the note that way. So I made a ranger and tried to track this guy down. He is supposedly in South Qeynos. I walked all over the zone and couldnt find him. I looked for a good half hour and covered every area of the zone and he was nowhere to be found. He is listed in the South Qeynos bestiary, so Im sure that is where he is. But I finally said screw it and gave up. I guess its possible for him not to be up. Now on a different note. I think the GBS camp has gotten alot tougher as of lately. Verant has put new mobs in Qeynos Hills that are semi-high level. They are called Loathsome Individuals. I started camping the GBS before they were there and Ive noticed that the mid to high level player traffic has tripled since these mobs were added. There is always a group right by BB entrance camping them and usually a couple of them are druids. Now you know that any Druid that is over level 20 is checking tracking quite often in hopes of getting Pyzjn. And most people believe the myth that Tovax and Varsoon are PH's for Pyzjn. So basically in order to get the stone, you need to have Tovax, Varsoon and Pyzjn all up at the same time. Now I have witnessed on several occasions people shouting whenever they see Tovax and he is usually hunted down like a dog. But prior to the new mobs being added, Varsoon had a good chance of staying alive for quite awhile. But now with a bunch of level 30 somethings flocking in to camp Loathsomes, Ill bet you Varsoon will be hunted down like a dog now too. The only way I can see this working is if you do an OOC every 30 secs telling people not to kill Tovax and Varsoon. But Im guessing that some idiot will ignore it and kill them anyway. Any follow ups on the Gharin note quest would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.<BR>

Here it goes.<BR>
<BR>
 Ok, my uncle who has long been a gm, has told me details involving the quest, I know you are thinking i am making up crap but that is what you think. Ok, first off qenyos and qenyos hills were the first 2 zones implemented into the game. And scuffy, the rat, Was the name of the first Char on EQ, and guess what? She was a gnome necro and her last name was Pyzgn. Since she was the first char, the EQ staff decided to make a NPC that would drop one of the best int items AT THE TIME. The way to make her spawn is to kill scruffy which is % rate of something to get Varshoon to spawn. If you kill scruffy and tovax it is a 100% sure that varshoon will spawn. He spawn all over the place so it is not certain where he spawns. After he spawn, It's is around 2 hrs till Pyzgn will spawn. Almost everytime she spawns is at night is because the scruffy spawns and tovax are set up on a time basis. She can spawn in the morning but very slim chance. Just go hunt for 2hrs and when you get back it is sure she will spawn with the stone. This is not BS this is the truth.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>That guy with the uncle sounds like his story jibes with mine.  I went to Qhills off-and-on to try and get this stone.  One day when I was going to do the camp, I heard someone shouting they just killed varsoon.  I was running up towards BB and saw the that the undead version had since spawned outside BB and was terorizing an unssuspecting group.  they ended up zoning into BB, i messed varsoon and blasted that mummie into a heaping corpse.  I proceeded up to the ruins and was gonna clear the camp, but didn't have to because some lowbies were camping it. (one guy later left and said varsoon was killed a little while ago so Pyzjyn should be here soon) I just mulled around killing everything in the area, and on the second night about 2hours from varsoons death, i was telling a friend how boring the camp was and low-and-behold i turned around and there she was.  I melted her mind with some DD and she fell lifeless.  I crossed my fingers and looted.  I got one!<BR>
<BR>
HAS ANYONE GOTTEN ONE SINCE THE PATCH??  I am curious with the added mobs and change in loot tables.  I am thinking of going to get another one with my newest character</font></td></tr></table>
