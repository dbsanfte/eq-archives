<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Girge had a good post, which is exactly where I am now. Here is a repost:<BR>
<BR>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>
<BR>
Since a previous post was so close, I thought I would post what I DO<BR>
know. "a visiting priestess" spawns occasionally (about 1 in 5 spawns) to the left of the ogre captain. If evil, you can hail her and she asks "are you the champion that Najena sent for?". Now, the trick to getting her started is you HAVE to say "I will champion for Najena". Spent 15 minutes figuring that out so you're welcome :P <BR>
After you say that she tells you she wants a relic known as "The Staff of The ankexfen", and asks you if you've heard of it. All you need to say here is "I have not heard of the staff", and it continues.<BR>
She then gives you some history about a people known as the Ankexfen and talks about a tragedy involving them. The next thing to say was another one that took me a few minutes to figure out because there arent any simple keywords that she gives away. You need to say "What happened to the Ankexfen?" to continue.<BR>
<BR>
She then tells you the Ankexfen were destroyed and that the 4 goblin races became of their ashes. Each goblin race was given a remnant of the Staff of the Ankexfen, each with a crystal. She tells you to bring her these staffs and you will be rewarded. <BR>
So putting 2 and 2 together I realized she wanted those 4 Crystal staffs. You know, "Slime Crystal Staff", "Ice Crystal Staff", etc. All 4 are found on goblins epcept the Slime crystal that is found or King Xorbb. <BR>
So I set out to get these staffs, bought most of them from other players.<BR>
<BR>
I came back and camped the priestess thinking "oh boy I'm gonna get a Blued-Two-Handed Hammer or maybe she'll give me some Staff of the Ankexfen that isn't on any item sites yet!" But no, I gave her all 4 staffs at the same time and she created her Staff of the Ankexfen and disappeared leaving some note in my inventory.<BR>
<BR>
The note is called a "Scroll of Flayed Goblin Skin" and considered a book. Here is the ENTIRE text, sadly "(some illegible writings about Neriak and blue flames)". That is it, almost word for word. So now I'm running around the Neriak commons hoping for some wanderer to spawn that I can talk to/give the note to, to continue the quest. <BR>
<BR>
Alright, that's all I know about this quest and I would appreciate anyone who has further info at least emailing me, or posting it here.<BR>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<BR>
<BR>
OK, so last night I go into Najena with all four crystal staffs. I luck out, and she is there. So I promptly go through the steps listed above, and lo and behold, exactly what happened to Girge happened to me. She combined the staffs, I got experience and faction adjustments(one faction adjustment was for the Priests of Innoruuk!!!!, which is the first time I have ever seen a faction adjustement for that). <BR>
Anyways, she IMMEDIATELY disappears, leaving a very strange scroll. It actually had a different graphic, and looked like a scroll instead of the normal note you usually get (even different that the Kiljn plans). The note said exactly what is listed above. Being a level 50 wizard, I immediately gated to neriak to find any npc that I<BR>
have never seen before (and I have searched for any strange npcs that I have never seen before in the last 6 months, and I have never seen a new npc in neriak commons). I took a lot of screenshots of what she said, and even recorded her name (she tells you her name after you give her the staves).<BR>
<BR>
A few points:<BR>
1) The quest actually starts with her. It does not start elsewhere as I will post exactly what she said. <BR>
2) The quest results are unknown right now, this may not be for the blued hammer or anything else we know of. Actually, she only states that "you will be rewarded by the Priests of Innoruk".<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind folks, this quest may yeild a really pathetic item. For instance: The unkempt druid quest in Rathe Mountains, whereby you turn in two RARE items of two ubber rare mobs and you end up getting a real crappy druid scimitar. The rare items you get for the quest are argueably better than the scimitar. I just wanted to make that point first before people assume anything. <BR>
<BR>
OK, back to this quest: I continue searching more, and check the Blue Flame forge in Neriak commons for anything unusual (i.e. I ask all npcs questions by spamming them) and still nothing. I check for any unusual 'new' item they are selling. I check for any new npcs. I look for her and still nothing. So I decide to go to the clerics guild as I reveiwed what she said before she disappeared, which was "..you will be rewarded by the priests of innoruk". <BR>
<BR>
I search the third quarter. Checking everything and anything. I stand there, re-reading the text and all of a sudden a new npc spawns that I have never seen before, right on the stairs I was standing on. Immediately, before I can say or do anything, she 32k's herself. I was like WTF!!. I petition, but I can't get any response from a verant GM. Just guides and they can't tell me why this npc kills herself. <BR>
<BR>
So I wait longer, and lo and behold she spawns again. She dies so fast I can't even get her to respond to a hail. I think I'm on the right track though.<BR>
<BR>
I will post a link to a website next and show screenshots of what she said...perhaps one of you guys can figure out this mystery. I hope this quest isn't broken. <BR>
<BR>
Oh, a few more things:<BR>
Please disregard people who say it's in the new Splitpaw dungeon...it isn't there. I know that dungeon like I know the back of my hand. I can even show you where Kurpok spawns, and I have killed everything over and over there. The highest level mob is level 40, and he drops the necro spell summon corpse. The Blued Hammer is not dropped there.<BR>
<BR>
Ah the rumors, they really make things worse. I swear, sometimes I think they are verant employees just trying to throw us off...<BR>
