**Submitted by Chris B.**<BR>
<BR>
"The quest for the Soulfire is VERY long, and involved. To begin the quest you must speak to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth (In North Freeport). She'll give you a note which you need to deliver to Guard Alayle (Or something close), a spy in the freeport militia building. Go in and<BR>
deliver the note, only to receive an illegible peice of paper in return (And get to see the guard get killed). Take the note back to Kalatrina, and she'll tell you to talk to Rashinda Elore in the Freeport Office of the People (NOTE : Once you give the note to Kalatrina, you'll have to wait six<BR>
hours to get another one.) Ask Rashinda "Have you heard of Zimel's Blades?', then ask her about Ariska Zimel ('Who was Ariska Zimel?'), and finally about Groflah Steadirt ('Who is Groflah Steadirt?'). Head back to Kalatrina and<BR>
tell her that Zimel's Blades was condemned. After this, it's time to visit Groflah Steadirt. Go to Groflah's forge in North Freeport, and give him the note. He will give it back, and tell you to meet him in the seafarers roost<BR>
at night. Don't bet on seeing him. I have stayed in that building for nearly two straight days, without seeing him once. Instead, wait for a beggar named 'Tykar Renlon' (Or something close, he's the only beggar who appears) to<BR>
spawn and immediately set about giving him five Drom's Champagnes. He disappears quickly, so you must hurry. Once you've given him all five, he'll give you a blanket. Go make yourself some bog juice and edible goo (Two easy<BR>
baking and brewing recipes), then give one goo to the beggar in jail. Once he asks for 'Bog'n goo! Blanket too!', give him 1 bog juice, 1 edible goo, and the blanket, to get a key (H.K. 102). Take the key to the banker in high<BR>
keep to get a note. Give this note to Brother Hayle (The Cleric imprisoned in Splitpaw - Be careful you don't lock yourself in his cell!), and he'll give it back to you, as well as the intructions of what else to get to gain<BR>
the Soulfire. He will tell you to get the Glowing Hilt, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, and your Testimony. The Glowing Hilt is found on Xicotl, the troll shadowknight in Mistmoore Castle. To get the Brilliant sword of faith, kill<BR>
Sir Lucan D'lere and his skeletal remains, gain his testimony, then give that testimony to Valeron. To get your Testimony, first speak to Merko in the hall of truth. He'll give you a note to give to  Altunic Jartin in EC.<BR>
Wait in Altunic's house for him to appear (It's near the last inn before WC), and give him the note. Walk outside, and fight Squire Narl. He packs a good punch, and his Harm Touch can be painful on a lower-level character,<BR>
but he's not too hard. After killing him and getting his head, go buy a cloth shirt from one of the merchants in the commons (I beleive the inn between orc camps sells the shirt). Give the head to Altunic, then give him<BR>
the shirt, to get a Token of Generosity. Buy (Or fight for one) a Spider Venom Sack, and return to Merko. Tell him you've earned the Token of Generosity, and he'll ask you for the sack. Give it to him, and get the Token of Bravery. Then hand in both tokens to get your final task : Run into<BR>
the sewers and kill the Militia spy there, and return her token to Merko to get your Testimony. Once you have all these items, hand the returned note from bother hayle, the hilt, the sword, and the testimony to Brother Hayle<BR>
(NOTE : You must have AT LEAST Kindly faction with him, or you'll have to start all over again!) to receive the Soulfire.<BR>
<BR>
<p><BR>
The Soulfire is the coolest looking sword in the game, with flames running<BR>
up the length. It's only attainable by a good group of level 40+ players, as<BR>
killing Lucan is a very hard thing to do."</div>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Nicko, right on with the pull tactics on Lucan, he went down with 9 of us on him.  This was on 7/16/00 so yes the guards were beefed but done correctly, the only fight you will have is with Lucan, and his healing little buddy, Brother Jentry.  <BR>
<BR>
Faction needed as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Knights of Truth  WARMLY<BR>
<BR>
Temple of Life    WARMLY  <BR>
<BR>
Quickest way to raise faction with the Temple of Life is to hail Lashun Novashine in Qeynos and give him 3 gold at a time.  From indifferent to warmly took 270pp 3 gold at a time, about 2 hours.<BR>
<BR>
I have heard that kindly is good enough but do you wanna have to go through all this again? I thought not.<BR>
<BR>
I question was asked earlier, concerning testamonies.  If you have the BSoF, you have already turned in Lucan's testamony.  What are you waiting for? :D<BR>
<BR>
Do not be invisible when you turn in your items to Brother Hayle in Splitpaw!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ! ! !  When invisible, you are indifferent to Brother Hayle, this is not good!<BR>
<BR>
The four items required by Brother Hayle:<BR>
<BR>
1 rolled up note (from HH bank)<BR>
2 Brillant Sword of Faith (Lucan's testamony turned over to Valeron in the Hall of Truth)<BR>
3 Unholy Hilt off of Shadowknight in MM.  We got real lucky on Xit, we were in Mistmoore zone for 10 minutes. Pulled him to the zone and smash! The hilt dropped.  I hear it drops every time but I cannot confirm this.<BR>
4 YOUR testamony.<BR>
<BR>
Lucan being whacked:<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Here's my input on this quest cause I dont want anyone to mess it up like I did.  When I got all the pieces I needed, I went to Brother Hayle and gave him the first note from HHK.  He basically said that my faction with the Temple of Life is good, but not good enough with the Hall of Truth.  I had raised my faction with the Temple of Life to amible before going to Brother Hayle.  So amible is good enough.  He then gave me the revised note.  I went to the Commons and killed Orcs for hours, and conned a paladin at the Hall of Truth.  I was now kindly, which is better than amible.  So I went back to Brother Hayle but this time, I didnt not have the letter from HHK to check if my faction was alright.  So assuming that you would need equal faction with the Temple of Life as you would with the Hall of Truth, I handed Hayle all the pieces.  And instead of receiving soulfire, I was told that I had not proven my loyalty.  So through my tears, all I can conclude is that either 1) You need better faction with the Hall of Truth than you do with the Temple of Life, or 2) Verant put a lvl requirement on this quest (which I hear they have started to do for some other quests).  <BR>
<BR>
Here is my advice:  If you give him the first letter and you need to fix your faction, do the letter quest again so you have another one to hand him to make sure you can do the quest.  It's a pain in the butt, but believe me, it's better than doing the entire quest again.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Just so you guys know. After you get your testament you can go straight to seafarers roost  and work on giving tykar renlon the four droms chaipagns( maybe 5 forgot). YOU DO NOT HAVE TO do the part about giving the spy the letter. its just for info about it dont  bother big waste of time. When you give tykar the drinks you have to do it fast cause he despawns every fast.. to keep him spawned hail him and keep saying ariksa zimel you mgith have to do this for a long tiome cause merchant who ssell shte ales barely ever sells to you ( something abvou thte bard in there) hope this helps someone.. and if anyone on Fenin ro knows how to kill the sk or lucan and wants to help a young pally out look me up =) <BR>
