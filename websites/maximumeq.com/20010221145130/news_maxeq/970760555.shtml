*Velious Launch Party and Real-Life Events*<BR>
<BR>
There are two real life events coming up for EQ fans!<BR>
<BR>
First, on November 4-5, you are invited to attend the Velious Launch Party in Las Vegas! There, you can meet other players, the Velious Development Team, and have a chance to play on the new Velious continent before it is released! You can also win great prizes, including signed copies of the expansion pack (to be shipped when it is shipped to the retailers).<BR>
<BR>
Also announced is the next Real Life event. The EQ Fan Faire will be held in February in a yet to be determined East Coast city. Check out the site to cast your vote for our destination! <BR>
<BR>

*Guild Maintenance*<BR>
<BR>
We are in the process of preparing to do maintenance on the guild database.  To that end, guild creation and activation will be on hold for the next three weeks.  After that time, we may be running a process to remove inactive or under-subscribed guilds from the system.  We would ask and recommend that those in guilds with under 10 separate members (on separate accounts) consider merging and deleting the under-subscribed guild.  <BR>
<BR>
In addition, it's apparently become common practice for people wishing to register a guild to enter the chat server and advertise there for help creating the guild.  This will no longer be permitted.  People wishing to submit a guild must organize prior to entering the chat server.  Advertising for assistance within the chat server could result in a short-term (24 hour) suspension for the account.<BR>
