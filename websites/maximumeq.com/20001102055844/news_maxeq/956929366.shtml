&gt;&gt;&gt;I think a server of 30-year old plus limits should be created. I know this is stereotyping the younger generation as a bunch of adolescent goofballs, but the majority of people that drive me crazy are under 20 years old. <BR>
</font>
It is very important to remember that age does not necessarily equal maturity, nor does it have anything to do with how people will act in an environment with a relatively high perception of anonymity. We hold everyone, regardless of age, up to the same standards of conduct in game. Though I do certainly sympathize with your desire to be free of those who are anti-social, that aspect of society will always exist in the massively multiplayer world regardless of the restrictions that we place on age.<BR>

Anyone know what the Iksar experience penalties are?<BR>
Are they more like Halflings (a +5 or so bonus) or more like a Troll (a -20 or so penalty)?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Trolls.<BR>

----------------------<BR>
<BR>
Greetings everyone! <BR>
<BR>
This morning's update is one of the final updates necessary for the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark launch scheduled to take place on Monday. <BR>
<BR>
As part of this update, a new EverQuest Patch Program was sent to your system. For those who have installed the Ruins of Kunark, this update has added a button labeled "K-Patch" to the patch program control panel. Within these patch messages, Ruins of Kunark players may be asked from time to time to press the "K-Patch" button following the download of the regular patch. This will allow them to download Kunark-related updates when they are required. <BR>
<BR>
If you have not installed EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, you will not see a "K-Patch" button. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to the Kunark-related changes made today, a bug that lowered the maximum damage of two-handed weapons that was introduced earlier this week in the Emergency Update was also corrected. Finally, the art update yesterday implemented a solution that we've been promising: Male barbarians can now see their shields.<BR>
<BR>
We continue to appreciate everyone's patience while we get the servers ready for Kunark. <BR>
<BR>
Thank you.<BR>
<BR>
- The EverQuest Team
