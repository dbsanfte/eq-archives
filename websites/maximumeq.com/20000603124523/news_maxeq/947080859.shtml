<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="New Server Crowding">New Server Crowding</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 12/23/99 08:55 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>Gordon Wrinn commented in the official EQ message boards regarding the crowding on the new (and old) servers.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Poster:<br>I found that the new server was added last night and to my dismay it immediately had the MOST people on it than any other server which points me to believe that just adding a new server is the incorrect way to go.<p>
Gordon Wrinn<br>
This happens whenever we add a new server, and even when we add several at once. Server population usually begins to fall almost immediately and stabilizes after a week or so. 
<p>
Poster:<br>Set a max limit on each server say 1200 people max, and then put something in place that monitors this and does not allow any new accounts to be created when the max # of people is reached on a particular server. 
<p>
Gordon:<br>
We can’t really do this. People would leave the game when they were denied access to the server. The server would end up with far less people on it, because many people log on the server just to reserve a character name or two.
<p>
The other problem is that people would get upset and quit when they find out that they can’t play on the same server as their friends, or, when they are denied access to the server after they already have established a character.
<p>
We’ll certainly do things with future products that take advantage of the knowledge we gained with EverQuest, however to implement active server population control mechanisms at this point would just upset people.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Newsgroup Poster:<br>
When grouped, why isn't the mana level of each group member not displayed along with the health bar? It would be so much easier to be able to see how much mana everyone had instead of constantly having to get updates from everyone.
<p>
Gordon Wrinn:<br>
Health bars were included simulate the ability to "look" at someone and see how bad they are hurting (Oh no! Bill has blood pouring from every orifice of his body! Maybe I should toss a heal his way?). I really don't think it would make much sense to be able to tell how much mana someone has by looking at them.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Newsgroup Post:<br>
And then it happened. I was in lake rathe, and somebody was auctioning a camping spot. Sigh..... guess it was bound to happen. Roleplaying at its best. Essentially saying "Highest bid can stand where im standing!!" <p>

Gordon Wrinn:<br>
That is despicable. If I saw something like that in my play character, I would have gone over there and told him to go jump in the quite conveniently placed lake.

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Gordon On Group Experience">Gordon On Group Experience</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 12/21/99 14:08 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>Gordon has given a great explanation of how grouping is beneficial:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"There is a bonus to experience given depending on how many in your group, but that bonus is linear. You don't receive an extra kick of XP for having 6 people as opposed to 5, other than the straight linear bonus. <p>
But I would like to take this opportunity to see if I can explain exactly how grouping is more efficient. This will take a few assumptions, but I think you'll see that it's valid in the end. My figures here are very round, but are applicable in any situation. 
<p>
Suppose you have a warrior with 100HP, who can deal damage at 50HP per minute. Furthermore, you are fighting gnolls with 100HP, who can deal 25HP's damage per minute, and pay 100XP points. Let's say your rule is that you fight until 50% health then heal to full before fighting again. 
<p>
Ok, fight 1. It takes you two minutes to kill the gnoll. After the fight you have 100XP points, and are down to 50HP health. Since you decided to rest to full health when reaching 50%, you'll have to rest 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) before you can kill again. Let's just suppose that you don't heal while in combat to make the math easier. Your total yield is 100XP/4.5 minutes, or 22XP/Min. 
<p>
Now, let's try two warriors, same rules, same level, damage spread equally. 
<p>
Fight 1: 
<p>
You and your partner take down the gnoll in 1 minute instead of two, since there are two of you. The gnoll only was able to deal 25 pts of damage during this time, which, spread between the two of you, puts you each at 87 health. Since you are now in a group, the gnoll gave 110 XP instead of 100, but it's split between the two of you, so you get 60 each. Here's the outcome after fight 1: 
<p>
Health Remaining: 87<br>
XP Earned: 60<br>
Time Elapsed: 1 Minutes <p>

After Fight 2: <p>

Health Remaining: 75<br>
XP Earned: 120<br>
Time Elapsed: 2 Minutes <p>

After Fight 3: <p>

Health Remaining: 63<br>
XP Earned: 180<br>
Time Elapsed: 3 Minutes <p>

After Fight 4: 
<p>
Health Remaining: 50<br>
XP Earned: 240<br>
Time Elapsed: 4 Minutes <p>

Now, since you are both at half health, it will take 2.5 minutes to rest to full health, giving you a total yield of 240XP/6.5 minutes, or 37XP/Min. 
<p>
Of course the actual figures will differ according to class and level, but the principle still applies. If you group, you get more experience, providing you take things harder and/or faster than you could solo. 
<p>
All of that said, yes, some people like to group, others don't. Regardless, EQ is and will remain a group-oriented game. Some classes have been made to be more suited to soloing than others, and if you want to get by through soloing exclusively, you'll have to be one of those. "

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>December 21st, 9:00am<br>
---------------------<p>


After a week of thorough testing, the Summon Corpse spell is now
functioning properly (we promise!), and available on all servers.  In
addition, it is now possible to cast Cancel Magic on non-grouped players
on the PvP and PvP-teams servers.  All changes were made on the
server-side, therefore no patch is required.  
<p>

From everyone on the EverQuest team, and Verant Interactive, we would like
to wish all of you safe and happy holidays.

It seems some miscreants killed a linkdead GM on Vallon Zek.  <p>

They are now upset at the punishment because there was no rule that you could not kill a GM.  <p>

Hello!!!  Do they have to tell you stuff like that?  Here is a tip from me, don't defecate where you sleep.  It seems pretty reasonable, but apparently the rules must be laid out explicitly.</font></p>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"I'd like to thank everyone for their input in regards to the proposed merger of Tallon and Vallon Zek. Based upon public opinion, we've decided not to pursue a merger of those two servers at this time. We are instead going to apply our energies to making Racewar, and PvP in general more palatable to the players in general, which should lead to more people playing on them. <p>
I hope to open discussion on the best way to go about this very soon. "<p>

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Pickpockets Picked By Gordon">Pickpockets Picked By Gordon</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 12/21/99 09:12 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>More from Gordon, this time it is about the rumoured Pickpocket nerf.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"I've gathered all of the information that there is to be had. The official statement is this: <p>
The only change that has occurred to pickpocket since release is a change to keep rogues from stealing magic items, and another change to decrease the chance that a rogue will successfully pickpocket *any* item. I'm aware that there are a number of people who will disagree with this, but I assure you that this is the truth. 
<p>
I have seen the public post by Brad some time ago in regards to this, and what can I say, even a producer is allowed a mistake once in a while :)
<p>
If anyone would like to start another thread to discuss ways to make pickpocket more group-friendly, we can certainly do that.

I’m not sure how you are getting this information, but you might want to check your source. There appears to be a group of people out there trying to cause a ruckus by saying things are changing that haven’t. I don’t know why they do this, other than to cause you all a bit of grief.
