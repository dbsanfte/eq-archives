This is part of a series of questions that originated on the Gameplay forum
on the Official EverQuest web site directed at Brad McQuaid on Sunday April
2, 2000.  Brad offered to try and answer as many of them as he
could.<BR><BR>

<font color=white>Brad, being a longtime RPGer yourself, do you REALLY
believe that understanding the basics of stats (not even exact formulas)
reduce the appeal and longevity of an RPG? I understand you don't want
players to concentrate on the numbers, but this "wall of silence" regarding
even general questions is taking things too far.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, I really do think that. When I played AD&D the DM tried very hard to
keep us from hard numbers and such, opting instead to try to create a more
immersive experience. And it worked.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Thought you were going to OSI. When will that happen and
who will carry on the Vision?</font><BR>
<BR>
**That was an April Fools joke put on by one of the websites I think. I am
extremely happy at Verant and plan on staying here for a very long
time.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are you ever going to embrace Open GL?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We already are with our newer engines (Sovereign, for example). Back when
we were working on the EQ engine, though, it just didn't make sense - Glide
and D3D covered all the bases. That's still true to an extent, and we don't
plan on adding Open GL support to the EQ engine.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Currently an INT of 200 for a caster is the ceiling for
purposes of adding via multiplier to your mana pool. Will this limit of 200
go higher in RoK?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Can't say yet, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I would like to know what you mean by balance. (I
personally think that any class should achieve the same goal by different
ways, either as fighter in close combat or as caster with magic)</font><BR>
<BR>
**I think what we mean by 'balance' could also be turned into a detailed
essay - there's just so much to the topic. In a nutshell, we want all
race/class combos to be appealing, but not necessarily exactly appealing.
We don't want gross variations in how long it takes a character to advance,
or to obtain things. We want decisions on how to play EQ to be as much
subjective as objective. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there any plans to enhance the ability of PCs to
essentially "take-over" zones or cities to a greater extent than already
possible? If not, why? </font><BR>
<BR>
**We really don't have the game mechanics or zone makeup in place to handle
a 'take-over' as you describe.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What was the original vision of Warriors, specifically,
tanks in general? How well do you feel you've met that vision?</font><BR>
<BR>
**You can read the class descriptions on www.everquest.com. Essentially,
they're supposed to have the best weapons, the most HP, and be the best
tanks. I'm pretty happy with Warriors right now.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>How do you foresee the role a tank (warrior specifically
again) will play in the expansion lands/levels?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Pretty much the same overall as the rest of the game.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can you state your opinion on not allowing binding in
cities by NPC's (say the POD who does nothing, but stand around on blue
servers) As servers become higher level, one can waste not only minutes,
but hours waiting for a bind in small (Rivervale).</font><BR>
<BR>
**Waiting that long has not been my experience in-game - I can usually find
a bind very quickly. In any case, relying on other classes is part of the
interdependence we designed into EQ. Needing an actual character to bind
you is important because you have to go out and talk to people, ask them
favors, etc. We feel this supports an environment that fosters making
friends and alliances with other players.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Hehehehe, I think you got more than you intended to get,
eh?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes and no. I figured there would be quite a few questions asked, but you
guys never cease to amaze me <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Anyway, is the Bard song Kellin's Lucid Lullaby ever
intended to be fixed? It currently has a 3 second duration and a roughly
60% resist rate. Even those that are in favor of it the way it is admit
that it requires a dedicated healer to keep the Bard alive while using it.
One resist causes the monster to go berserk on the bard and instantly
interrupt the song, and then the Bard is more or less dead because all the
monsters are<BR>
going to be un-mesmerized in three seconds.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Don't know, sorry. That's definitely a GZ question.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Also, is it intended that Bards don't get any magical
instruments until mid 30s or higher? If not, please examine the quests that
give the unfound/missing instruments, they may be broken.</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'll ask GZ.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Abashi said players don't get indoor sow or selo's or any
kind of speed buff because in beta they caused a lot of trains. How about
Mobs not getting indoor sow etc? IMO sow'd mobs cause more trains then any
sow'd players. If it is just to prevent trains please remove the ability of
mobs to cast sow indoors.</font><BR>
<BR>
**I agree with Abashi, however that's not the biggest reason we don't allow
SOW indoors. The biggest reason is SOW and similar spells were originally
intended to only help with travel. They were not meant for kiting and such.
Since dungeons, relative to outdoor zones, are much smaller, we designed it
such that 'travel' spells wouldn't work there.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>How about adding 3DNow optimization?</font><BR>
<BR>
**It's already in - the engine uses 3dNow instructions.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is it within the vision to ignore all bard posts/concerns
except the least important for two months straight? So far we still don't
have any class specific weapons and only two non-planar, non-dragon
instruments that have an effect (and one is from Kedge and extremely
rare).</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'll ask Abashi why he hasn't responded to 'bard posts' if indeed truly
he hasn't.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will there EVER be a "/who guild <guild name>" to list
all the members of a guild currently online (and displaying tags)? I think
this would be a great tool for guild leaders and officers for organizing
events. Heck, you may already have something similar implemented. If this
is the case, please excuse this waste of time </font><BR>
<BR>
**You can already get the listing for some guilds by using /who all <first
word in guildname>. Obviously, this method is sub-optimal and doesn't
always work. Adding better who/guild functionality is on the programming
list of things to do.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Any plans on adding an NPC that can reduce the weight of
shadow Knight Quest Armor? It seems that this armor was designed with only
Troll and Ogre Sk's in mind.</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'll bring the idea up.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Please comment on Trade skills and what you had in mind
when you made them.</font><BR>
<BR>
**They're there to offer players an alternative to adventuring, and they're
also there to bolster the player-driven economy, create item and money
sinks, etc.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Any plans to make baked food last longer than store
bought or even add some stat points?( i.e. str bars , mana crunchies
etc.)</font><BR>
<BR>
**Unfortunately, probably not, at least not short term. We'd really like to
have food with differing strengths and durations, and had planned that to
be the case before launch. Some programming directions we went in, however,
made it such that implementing varying food durations and strengths a very
complex task and so I don't see this happening.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What good is a high alcohol tolerance?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Alcohol Tolerance is a trade skill that's really there purely for RP.
There's no practical purpose to increasing it.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>If EverQuest is a grouping game, with a certain soloing
ability, why is it the strong pet classes (Necros, magicians) are given the
ability to both tank and use powerful magic? I do not understand why
meleers have to resort to casters to keep them alive, but the opposite is
not true. You must be aware the power of pets at higher level, isn't a pet
a last line of protection? A servant? why is it given the power equivalent
to some of the principal melee classes? In hp, ac and attack?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I have to disagree with your assertion that melee classes cannot solo -
some can. That said, some mage classes are just as good at soloing,
probably better.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Has the clip plane slider bug been identified and if not,
what information do you need to identify and fix it? Bug: Increasing the
slider between the midpoint to the extreme right in outdoor non-forested
zone does not increase visibility distance. It used to work.</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, internal testing and the programmer involved are still looking into
it. I appreciate the information.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I don't want to get too much into game mechanics, but it
just seems odd that the entire FOCUS of the game mechanics (grouping up to
take on more powerful critters) impacts some classes so
negatively.</font><BR>
<BR>
**There are definitely some classes that need to group moreso than others.
This is by design.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>When is druid armor being put in and why isn't it in
already?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I don't think we ever promised druid armor per se. I think it is safe to
say, however, that more class specific quests and items are on their way
in, especially with the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Any plan to increase the number of spell slots? 8 slots
to memorize spells is not enough.</font><BR>
<BR>
**The 8 slot limit is there so one has to use tactics depending upon the
situation and upcoming battle, deciding which spells to memorize and which
spells not to.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will you ever shorten the time it takes between starting
the EQ.exe file and entering the world of Norrath?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We have a few times, and if any additional ways pop up where we can
optimize things, we will. At this point, though, I don't know of any ways
we haven't thought of. WARNING: the zones in the Expansion are much larger
than previous zones and slower machines with less RAM will take a while to
load them - zoning time in general will be going up with Kunark, not
down.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will more items be added to the Smithing skill? Are there
items that can be smithed now that PC's are unaware of?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Not sure if there are any items players are unaware of, I'll try to ask.
As for trade skill upgrades, they're definitely coming.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are mobs not given missile weapons? Seems to me that
they way to fix all kinds of problems you guys are having is to make it
possible for mobs to attack from a distance if they are not casters. Kiting
isn't a problem when a mob stops and crit hits yah from behind with a bow
for backstab-like damage (no agi bonus either.) Centaurs have the ability
already, there damage just sucks like a Ranger's does...</font><BR>
<BR>
**Some mobs DO have missile weapons. Are you suggesting that more should,
and that we should increase the damage they can do with ranged weapons?
<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What do you think is the most important thing (as a
programmer/game designer) you've learned designing and maintaining
EverQuest?</font><BR>
<BR>
**That a lot more players than I ever thought would follow the path of
least resistance and play the game the absolute easiest and most efficient
way possible. I would have thought, for example, that players would embrace
a slightly harder dungeon with slightly less appealing loot perhaps
slightly farther away to avoid crowds. Boy was I wrong.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>If you could change anything about the way things turned
out, or the way something happened along the way to where EQ is now, what
would that something be?</font><BR>
<BR>
**There are quite a few areas where EQ failed in a sense, even though we're
extremely pleased with the game overall, are damn proud, and consider it a
huge success. I guess the biggest one is that people don't 'do' dungeons as
much as they 'camp' single locations within a dungeon. I wish we could go
back and radically revise the way dungeon spawning works.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Some time ago, you mentioned that you were going to try
to get a "history" put together for player consumption. It would be nice to
have that for "fitting into" the world we are supposed to be role-playing
in. Any status?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Good question. I believe Abashi was supposed to be working on this - I'll
ask him about it in the morning.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What is the "vision" for each of the character classes -
a "sound bite" that advertises the essence of the class? </font><BR>
<BR>
**Please see the class descriptions on www.everquest.com -- for the most
part they're pretty accurate and sum up the classes fairly well (boy, gonna
get flamed for this one &grin)<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there any areas of the game, in zones which have been
around a while, players have yet to discover?<BR>
Are there any creatures in the game players have yet to see?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Hrm. I doubt it. None spring to my mind, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there any plans to expand group features in the game?
For certain activities, i.e. Planes and Dragon runs, 20+ people are
required. This causes issues with communication and looting rights. Maybe
maximum group size could be expanded in certain situations?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We've tossed around the idea of linking groups together, enabling better
communication. No short term plans to do this, but we like the idea.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Any chance certain items in game will be made
rechargeable?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Aren't some already? If not, there will be some in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I know you must hate this one, but: Could a concise
definition of all Attributes (str, stam, agi, dex, cha, int, wis) please be
given?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, I won't get more precise than we already have, multiple times,
sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is some attempt made to mathematically quantify the
relative usefulness or uselessness of spells or abilities that don't
directly affect combat, or are classes balanced more "by feeling"? In other
words: Would you call class balancing more of an Art or a
Science?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Both. We have internal programs we run to test ideas out, weapons,
spells, etc. We do a lot of math to make sure certain ideas are balanced.
But there are just as many times that we make decisions based on the
Vision(TM) of what we think should happen for subjective reasons.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>The vision is frequently cited as the reason for making
changes in the game. Do you have a Vision statement for EQ that is a
detailed, written statement? No sound-bites, but a "position statement" of
sorts that is used as a guiding principle for development? If not, would
you consider writing one and publishing it?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, we have internal documents that talk about the vision, or mission
statement, behind EQ and our other games. I don't think we want to publish
internal documents, but if there is really a demand, perhaps I'll write an
essay on the Vision(TM) one of these days.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Could you add a /broken command to enhance the current
/bug command? This new option would allow people to "report" and EverQuest
to "compile" broken quests ...(like the assassin in Qeynos not dropping
[black wood chips] broken since beta)... and cosmetic stuff like typos
without the information being hidden in bug reports.</font><BR>
<BR>
**We have an email address (which escapes me at the moment - doh!) that
we'd prefer players use to report problems with quests. Abashi, if you're
reading this, please re-post the quest help email addy.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Could the language skill be used to enhance the taunt
skill? You would, for example, get a bonus to your taunt skill if you use
your opponent's language (after achieving a certain skill level). Running
with this, could people learn language skills from the creatures they are
fighting. </font><BR>
<BR>
**Sweet idea - I'd never heard that one before. We'll toss it around.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>It's been said many times that one of the reasons druids
don't have quest armor is that we run around in wolf form once we hit 24.
What if the armor gave us different tints for our animal form or, better
yet, allow us to have different forms. I know that all animal forms are not
in each zone, but what if the animal form was a random polygon from the
zone's existing animal table.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Actually, the reason you don't have quest armor is that the quest armor
was supposed to make up for the fact that we removed Rubicite armor from
the game, and druids couldn't wear Rubicite in the first place (in other
words, we put in quest armor for those classes that COULD wear
Rubicite).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why doesn't EQ have a quick quit? (not /quit which
requires me to click again and again, exit, yes I'm sure, exit, yes I'm
sure) I have a time limit on my ISP and like to try and reconnect real
fast.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Good question. I'll ask the programmers how feasible it would be. Like
/quit, though, I don't think it would generally be a good idea to use, in,
that you'd remain in the world a bit after using the command, subject to
attacks.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why do we have to click agree (to the disclaimer) each
time when log in?</font><BR>
<BR>
**To protect us legally.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are there 4 splash pages to log in? We all know who
made the game after all, wouldn't one page suffice?</font><BR>
<BR>
**When you have multiple companies involved in the creation of the game,
they pretty much all want splash pages shown all the time. Honestly,
though, I just click ESC really fast, 3 times, and it doesn't bug me.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Do you believe that the lack of non-durable items in the
game is a key factor in the need for "money sinks"? </font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. We want most items
to be durable, and now that we've added some quests that consume items,
other consumable items (potions and such), as well as other money sinks, we
feel the economy is in pretty good shape. I don't think there's any real
need to make items wear out in general.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>The Shaman's Alchemy and the Rogue's Poison skills appear
to be the only "unbroken" trade skills in the game. The products do not
stay around forever and create a supply glut in the long run because the
are "consumable."</font><BR>
<BR>
**I do agree that as we continue to update Trade Skills in the game they
need to involve more and more consumables. We should have made it that way
in the beginning, of course, and as you've noted, Alchemy and Poison, both
of which have been updated significantly since launch, are based on the
consumable principle. I think it's safe to say future revisions of many
other trade skills will be handled similarly.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why do quests give so little experience? Abashi stated
that the reason for this is that Verant doesn't want players repeatedly
doing quests for experience. I just do not understand this position. Aside
from the name, why is an endless period of "camping a single mob" superior
to completing a non-trivial quest?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Many quests do give out decent experience (they didn't always, be we
updated many of them several months back). The problem is that it's hard to
control who is doing the quest and then to award 'proper' experience for
the character, depending on his or her level. I guess this is a deficiency
in the quest system, but then putting in quest level limits isn't something
we're too keen on doing. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>The majority of the players (over 70%) now under the
Equipment Loot system (reference the risk poll Gordon initiated on PvP
servers) overwhelmingly prefer Exp loss in PvP to Item Loss in PvP, why is
Exp loss NOT being considered as a Valid option in the next patch or "ever"
for that matter?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I think Gordon still has plans for making PvP even more viable, but most
of the solutions require quite a bit of coding, and so they have to compete
with other enhancements.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Planes armor is all no drop lore, however in Fear the
Shaman and Cleric belt are just lore and droppable, why do you allow armor
or weapons droppable at all from the planes?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No clue - I'll ask.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Overcrowding is a huge issue on the older servers even
with Kunark many servers will still be overcrowded do you plan on bringing
more servers up when the expansion goes online? I'm not talking one server
every two months but more servers to help allow more gaming time w/o the
pressures of crowding</font><BR>
<BR>
**We plan on launching four more servers short term. As soon as we have
fairly solid dates, we'll try to announce them.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are the mage spells posted on castersrealm and the like
really real? Or are they just some joke like the early April fools thing.
(I've heard the answer about not believing that stuff but I want to know if
its truth.</font><BR>
<BR>
**I don't know which post you're referring to, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there any plans to change the mage's phantom armor
line so it's useful? </font><BR>
<BR>
**Don't know, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Since rogues have crit with thrown weapon and Rangers
have crit with bow, can Paladins and ShadowKnights have crit with
bash?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'll bring it up at the tuning meetings, but I doubt it - we're fairly
happy with where Paladins and SKs are at right now. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Was wondering why the armor in EQ is not damage
absorbing? My reason for asking is that this would help differentiate the
weapons (i.e. pierce does the class armor piercing damage). Also would
allow you to diversify the classes more.</font><BR>
<BR>
**It would be great to have different types of armor that responded
differently to different types of weapons. Perhaps one day in the future we
could implement something like that.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will hybrids ever get unique upgrades/abilities, or just
pull off their parent classes? Will we see new spells and skills in
Kunark?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Being hybrids of other classes, I doubt they'll get unique spells, other
than the traditional special abilities some of them already have (lay
hands, harm touch).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Would you consider switching the character development of
melee classes to getting more different skills at more levels as opposed to
getting new and better gear?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Funny you should ask that… we're doing something very similar to what
you're asking for with the Expansion for the pure melee classes.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>How do I go about getting a job on the dev team?
</font><BR>
<BR>
**Check out www.verant.com for information on how and to whom to send in
resumes.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will there be anything for players below level 50 in the
expansion other than new areas and items? Spells, skills, etc.</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there any plans for more of a symbiotic link between
the Magician and their pet, (especially control-wise)? It'd be nice if it
actually followed me when I used /pet follow me.</font><BR>
<BR>
**No plans, but it's a neat idea.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Do you ever intend to address the spawn in Plane of Fear
and the safe spot inside the zone to prevent farming of items?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Probably, yes. We'd like to address that issue in some capacity.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>You said: **To preserve a sense of mystery and
exploration in the game. Ok, so isn't this sort of a catch 22? I can't know
what to put stats into a character creation until I explore the game, but I
can't explore the game until I have created my character.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, by design. You're supposed to start out with a character and learn
and explore both the world and the game mechanics. That may mean at some
point you want to start another character to better use the knowledge you
have gained playing the game previously.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why does Verant think that spending 8 minutes meditation
or spending an equal amount of time for health regeneration fun?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Downtime between battles is pretty traditional. It allows players to
talk, re-group, cast buffs and other related spells, head to the restroom,
etc. That said, I wish there was more to do during downtime, more gameplay
involved.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are you doing this (responding to all these questions)
because of the recent deal with Lucasarts and because of other online games
coming up soon? OSI wasn't very attentive to its customers until a game
called EverQuest started beta. Coincidence?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, coincidence. I'm not aware of any other MMORPG coming out in the
near future, are you? Is it even remotely possible I'm doing this because I
care or must there always be some hidden motive (greed, fear, or some other
nasty emotion)? I explained why I'm doing this in an earlier batch of
answers - take it or leave it.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Instead of randomizing loot, which doesn't make sense as
you've said, the fire giant warlord crown SHOULD drop from the Fire giant
warlord, why don't you randomize more spawns?<BR>
For example instead of the Goblin Knight who drops the BIBS spawning in the
same place all the time, have him spawn in a random Dazed Goblin guard
spawn point. This would encourage "doing" a dungeon instead of camping the
spawn point.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Agreed, at least to a point. You'll see more of this experimented with in
the Expansion zones.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>One of the great draws of a graphical mud is to see your
character evolve and develop graphically as well as statistically. Why is
it that most classes have a huge range of robes/armors that change their
look, while Monks and Druids must look like "newbies" for a long, long
time?</font><BR>
<BR>
**There is a limitation of texture memory (which used to be much more
restrictive, btw, but recently 3D cards have been shipping with a LOT of
memory, thank God), so we were limited as to how many texture sets we could
put in the game for player characters. We were able to get around this
limitation to a point by using 'tinting' which allowed us to tint a single
texture set multiple colors without affecting texture memory. The more
uniform the texture, the less 'bad' it looked when tinted. Monks, having
lots of skin showing, are the least tintable without things looking bad.
Anyway, in the future I hope we have the resources and time to add more
texture sets - heck , you can never have enough variation in a game like
this, I agree.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>You have said that there are many planned fixes to a lot
of this stuff. Would you ever consider posting a list of planned fixes in
advance? Not a timetable, people will ***** if you don't do it on time, but
a priority list so people know what is being worked on in the future and
don't whine so much? </font><BR>
<BR>
**We have an 'In Development' section on www.everquest.com that we just
haven't been using. That's definitely our bad  - sorry about that. Part of
the EQ Live team's responsibility post-Expansion will be to keep that page
up to date.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why did you make the role of the magician and wizard so
similar?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We did? I have to respectfully disagree on this one. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>With many of the characters 'getting married,' will you
ever implement instead of the 'pet' that follows the character around, an
offspring?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Hrm. Involving 'children' as player characters or even NPCs at this point
in MMORPGs… well, we're afraid to, honestly.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Enchanters get the instill mana line fairly recently and
it has proven to be useless (with the exception of Wu's gauntlets). Are
there any plans to add more items for the skills (in a gradual process) or
will everything be added at one time?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Definitely a GZ question there, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>This might be a question for GZ, but why don't enchanters
get a level 49 illusion? Also, will enchanters get any illusions after
level 50?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Another GZ question.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Has the idea of houses in the game completely vanished or
is it still planned for the future?</font><BR>
<BR>
**It's completely vanished, at least for this incarnation of EverQuest.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I've noticed that a few of the questions you have
answered indicated that the fix or change to the bug and or enhancement
would be implemented via the Expansion. For those people who do not buy the
Expansion, how will these changes be made or will they not be
made?</font><BR>
<BR>
**The vast majority of global fixes will be available to everyone. More
specifically, many of these fixes will be made in a global file everyone
will get when we launch the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Any chance of giving Cleric's a bash skill when they
equip a shield?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Doubt it - they're supposed to be a limited melee class and primarily
casters.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why no Halfling Rangers? With warriors and druids in the
race.... it would also help with a guild closer to East
Antonica...</font><BR>
<BR>
**That's a good question. I'm pretty sure we discussed this years back, but
it's hard to remember. Essentially we felt (and feel) that the number of
races that could be certain hybrid classes needed to be limited. Also,
traditionally, we just couldn't come up with an image in our mind of a
ranger Halfling <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will Verant ever look at locating some servers overseas
in the future? Has the feasibility of this been looked at? Being an Aussie
I'm just curious.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Very unlikely. The way the EQ infrastructure has turned out it's much
easier for us to administrate when servers are local. In any case, with EQ
being as latency tolerant as it is, and with ping times not being a big
issues in terms of gameplay, we haven't really felt the need to host
servers remotely.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>EQ isn't really a role-playing game is it? It's a game
based on the principles of addiction outlined in current psychological
doctrine. It's based on positive reward and positive punishment. Pavlov's
Dog, so to speak. It's designed to keep people addicted for as long as
possible. That is the vision, isn't it?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Heh, um, no. It's certainly designed to be addictive in the sense that
any good game is. EQ has its heritage in all the great text MUDs of the
past, many of which were very addictive and a hell of a lot of fun. Perhaps
some of the early MUD pioneers were evil, scheming psychologists with a
hidden motive , but we just wanted to make a damn fine graphical MUD that
was fun to play for months, even years. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why were the Jboots made more difficult to obtain in
terms of camp time and level range when the reason you changed them to a
quest was because of complaints of that nature?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Actually, the reason we changed them from a campsite to a quest was
because of the complaints of people fighting over a single campsite and the
customer service issues that arose because of that.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Would it be more realistic if someone who has looted a
timed-out guard's corpse received the same appointed faction loss as if
they were to kill them?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Well, we really don't want to tie looting in with faction hits, which is
what that would require.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>DO you honestly think gnome newbies should get away scott
free with selling their own guards equipment to their own
merchants?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Heh, probably not, but there's no code in place to make merchants
selective as to what they'll buy and what they won't. I wish there
were.<BR>
