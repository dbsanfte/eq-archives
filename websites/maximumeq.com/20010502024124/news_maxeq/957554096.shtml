I guess it just all depends on what rolls the MOBs made when they spawned, if they have anythingon them or not.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt&gt&gtHowever, with the coming of Kunark, most people congregated to Burning Woods and Karnor's Castle. Why? Because the loot was good.<BR>
</font>
Well it's more of a combination of good loot, and the fact that Karnor's is the first dungeon that people find when they get to Kunark. People will fan out to the other dungeons as their comfort levels grow and as Karnor's becomes crowded.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt&gt&gtSure, Chardok looks very good, but a raid was done in TM and we found 2 staffs that were completely useless (like 7/38 2HB or something). Any ETAs on itemizing the zones? I'm rather disappointed that Kunark was so hastily finished and zones are not truly complete.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Your assertion that the other zones are "unfinished" or "unitemized" isn't true. I'm not sure how much time you spent in them, or how deep you went in, but they are very well itemized. It will just take a little while for the masses to explore these zones and see what they have to offer.<BR>

After reading the comments for items that I've already added, the way that things are dropped is radically differnt (for the better!) in Kunark.<BR><BR>

Either items drop off of a random mob in that specific zone(s).  Or from a mob within a specific level range on Kunark, or both.<BR><BR>

I must say, the dungeons and zones are simply massive!  Kunark is the most fun I've had in a very long time in EverQuest.  I don't see that changing either, because of the sheer size and quick spawn rate.</font></p>

*Patch Today*<BR>
<BR>
Several changes were implemented as part of today's patch:<BR>
<BR>
*Spells*<BR>
<BR>
- "Scale of Wolf" is now group-only.  You must be grouped with the target in order to cast this spell upon them.  This change was made due to the fact that Scale of Wolf overwrites Spirit of Wolf, which may be more desirable in some situations.<BR>
- The "Cannibalize II" spell has been enhanced.  <BR>
- Corrected a bug with "Song of the Sirens" that caused an unintended level-cap to affect the spell. Bards should now be able to charm everything that they once could with this spell.<BR>
<BR>
*Binding in Timorous Deep*<BR>
<BR>
Due to a feature within the zone, players can no longer bind within Timorous Deep.  This functionality was intended in the zone prior to launch, as binding presents a possible balance issue.  Players who are already bound in this zone will retain their binding location until they bind someplace else.<BR>
<BR>
*Iksar Quests*<BR>
<BR>
A few items associated with the Iksar newbie warrior quests have been repaired. The EverQuest team would like to extend thanks to those who reported the problems.<BR>
<BR>
*Iksar Factions*<BR>
<BR>
As announced in the patch server message yesterday, this morning we corrected a bug in Iksar faction that allowed them to travel outside Kunark without fear of being attacked by most things.  In the event that any young Iksar find themselves in a bind/death loop, please /quit, log in another character, and /petition for assistance.<BR>
<BR>
*Server Splits*<BR>
<BR>
The recently announced server splits will be completed roughly two hours after the other servers come up from this patch.  Movelog registered accounts from Veeshan and Bristlebane will be moved to Saryrn, and Xegony and Bertox to The Seventh Hammer.  As requests to move were very strong, we were not able to move everyone who requested.  We appreciate everyone's understanding.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you!<BR>
<BR>

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Server split news">Server split news</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/29/00 12:07 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I'm glad to see these server splits.  Not many servers get above 2100 people often now.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Actually, over 1000 people from each server were moved. However, when we publish that we are taking registrations, invariably people who don't play at peak ask to be moved, as do people who have multiple accounts. Unfortunately, there's no magic way to determine what percentage of those moved represent peak usage. Population on Veeshan rose to 2800 at the time that we opened registrations, so it's quite evident that many of those who were running the command were not peak users. <BR>
We'll give it a few more days to stabalize and then may consider moving some more.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;I heard that the Kunark sounds will be added in a later patch. As of now, Iksar make no noise when they get hit, and everything else sounds like a human (goblins, skeletons...). Any ETA?<BR>
</font>
Aiming for a week, perhaps two.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Poison update">Poison update</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/29/00 12:03 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Looks like June for an update for rogue poisons.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I respectfully ask for a firm date as to when we can expect this upgrade to occur. I don't want any beating around the bush. In reality, if it's going to be mid-August, then say it's going to be mid-August, and work towards OBTAINING that goal, using whatever means you have to. No more vague terminology, please!<BR>
In cases where we have a firm date, we don't have any problem giving them. Unfortunately this is not one of those times, and I would just be making things up if I gave you one. I can say that the chances of getting it done before the end of the month of May is slim but possible. The month of June is looking better.<BR>
