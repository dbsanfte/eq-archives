<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Hate to burst your bubble but paladins are one of the hardest classes to play.  They get a bad rep as a tank who dies too quickly because most players try to play paladins as warriors.  The paladin is pretty much a warrior until level 9 and they really do change.  Get to know your spells.  Let your groups know that you will heal after the fight and that if the primary healer goes low on mana (lom) then you can back off and pick up the slack some.<p>

Trust me on this one use those heals use the yaulp and use buffs when buffs arent available.  More people will appreciate you more because most people disrespect paladins as a whole.  The reason why is by high levels people have seen so many ####y paladins die too quickly acting like pure warriors they forget the benifits of a paladin.  It like any other class with a specific role, if you have a bad cleric or bad enchanter people will die.  Same with paladins a bad paladin puts people at risk.<p>

As for equipment.  The age old debate of 1 handed vs 2 handed slash may come back, but try to max out on all weapon skills if you can.  You can never tell what weapon varant may make tommorrow to drop for paladins it may even be a piercing weapon.  But really here are the advantages to using a one hand vs 2 hand.  One hand generally means more ac and the cool shield bash which stuns casters (oh ya learn to save your bashes when you see something like an_orc_oracle begins to cast a spell.) Using bash does tip the balance.<p>

But a 2 hander gives more damage per hit (or should give more)  The more damage you do the more likely you are going to taunt if you need to use taunt to save the life of a caster being pegged.<p>

Now the important thing stats.  Work on getting the highest ac equipment you can afford, then work on your strenght, work on dex last.<br>
Agility is a nice stat but is also a trap.  Agility accually does make monsters miss you more but at level 40 or so the monsters become so powerful that pure ac begins to show its advantages over depending on agility stats.  I fell into this trap and had to scramble to earn money to buy a whole new set of armour when i reached level 42.  It wasnt pretty to say the least.  A full set of bronze or even steel plate will carry you to about level 25 but by then start changing out for more strenght buffing items and better ac.  Get yourself both a 1h and 2h by level 25 the reason is that each player will develop thier own taste of 1h over 2h and that becomes a solid personal preference by the time you are 40.  (i went with 1h cause i hate npc casters, a friend of mine went with a 2h because he wants to deal damage to tank type casters, either way is right in its own way.)<p>

Another consideration is to get your resistances up, at high levels magic using npc's have more potent spells.  Sometimes you may want to carry a box of special high ac high resistance armour pieces to change out when you go up against a camp with more casting npc's then normal.<p>

And lastly (as if i didnt ramble on already) is guilds.  Find a guild that is suited for your class.  I tend away from larger guilds for one main reason, a paladin is really a class that must bring people together.  Not only do you get a sort of commaradarie in a smaller guild but a smaller guild will be more able to accomadate a paladin when he/she is struggling on the equipment end.  For some reason a larger guild, at least to me, will tend to use thier heavy tanks more and not even consider hybrids as needing equipment, but the truth about paladins is completely different.  A paladin does need the help from his/her friends to keep his equipment up, unless of course the paladin is extremely rich.  Plus the quests for paladins are some of the hardest quests and are designed purposely to require groups with the goal to get equipment for the paladin.  And that usually means the paladin must be willing to do favours back.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Hi! I am a lvl 12 Paladin and I saw your message asking for lvling tips etc.. I also noticed a reply to it... I have to tell you I disagree with the reply. Paladins are not difficult to play if you know how to play it. Before you reach lvl 9 you are a essentially a warrior, no u dont have the hp's a warrior has but you come mighty close if you practice right. Look in the EQ Stats book they will agree with me when i say that a Paladin has very much the same stats as a Warrior mixed with some Cleric. That's because that is what a Paladin is.. a hybrid between a Warrior and a Cleric.<p>

You need to concentrate on your melee skills... dont ever rely on your casting because you dont recive them often and when you do they heals aren't worth a whole lot and the buffs arent either although if you are soloing the buffs work great for yourself they have gotten many a Paladin through some tuff times. The best casting spell u have is the Lay Hands spell that u begin the game with. You can only use it once every game day which is about an hour and a half real time. avoid using this spell on anyone else unless you are in a group u feel confident in. It's for emergency use and is best used for yourself when a healer doesnt see your health or can't heal you due to low mana.<br>
You can solo very well! I used a 1hs weapon until about lvl 6 where I received a 2hs weapon from a friendly player who donated it to me at no cost. You can't rely on this kind of help but dont be afraid to ask as long as yo not a pest people dont mind the shouts ie "lvl 7 Pally, would like a nice weapon to help him/her out, can donate what money I have" i have a full set of bronze armour and a 2hs slash weapon thats base damage is 17 and usally hist around 28, 90% of what i have was given to me by different people along the way.<p>

SOLOING:: When you enter a zone use the /who feature and check everyones lvls, if there is quite a few people of your lvl chances are its a good place to be, if evryone seems lowere leave you wont get much exp, and if everyone seems higher, leave because its most likely too dangerous for you. Solo when you can (paladins are great soloists) and use the /con feature.. /con everything! If you are solo attack blue things but try to bring them near a zone, so that if you need to run you can. Blue npcs will award the most exp to a solo pally, just make sure you have a plan b because like it tells you.. you might win (there is a chance for loss), avoid fighting at lower lvls with anything less than about 90% health, just because it cons green doesnt mean u can fight it with less than a bubbles health always keep that in mind...<p>

GROUPING:<br>
Paladins are also a very good grouper, groups are always willing to invite a pally due to your abilities as a puller and in case of emergency a healer.  A good ratios is this.. dont ever try to be a healer. If you are in a small group that has no healer, nobody should continue to fight when they become low on health, dont expect ot heal them with your heals they dont do much trust me. You are mostly considered a tank, at any given lvl you will have higher hp than other classes of the smae lvl with the exception of the warrior they will have a higher hp,so you are mostly used as a tank unless there happens to be a warrior in the group which even then you are still a tank but rather a backup to the warrior.. Leave the healing to the primary casters such as clerics... try to group with clerics or their healing, druids for their ability to hold a target still while you fight another which comes in very handy when tackling lare groups of enemies, and rangers for their ability to reack an enemy (find it for you). As far as what to fight in a group a group can easily fight what is red to the group members as long as they come one at a time.. Blues can be brought in several at a time if your group is big enough. <p>

PULLING:<br>
Get a cheap bow and some basic arrows, place this in your range wapon and ammo slots on your inventory screens.. these come in very ahndy when you are soloing or are in a group. The reason is that if you run into a group of enemies and do the typical attack, and run tactic to bring the enemy to your group 9 times outta 10 the entire group of enemies will come with you which is fine i fyou have a druid or the like around to"hold" the others for you but if not youdont wanna bring a big group of enemies with you, no matter what they /con a large group is tuff to handle.. With the bow and arrow you cans tay a safe distance away froma  creature and shoot it. Stay put and the creature will run by itself to you and away from the mob where you can safely attack, and run tacic to bring it the rest of the way to your group or if you are soloingyou can bring it back near a zone or other safe place. Dont worry about getting expensive bows or arrows its not yor main attack, you dont need high dmg with them because even the slightest prick of an arrow will irritate the enemy enough to chase you. <p>

1HS vs 2HS:<br>
Do not allocate your abilities evenly between 1hs and 2hs weapons, this will limit your abilitys in noth skills. You need to find one you like and stick to it... Consider this: 1hs has less delay (you attack faster) but less damage (your hits dont hurt the npcs as much)--2hs weapons have a higher delay (you attack slower-more time in between hits) but they award more per hit damage (your hits cause more damage)... <br>
My advice is to get a good 1hs weapon and use it only until you can find a 2hs weapon.. ask around, be friendly to higher lvl players and try to get yourself a good 2hs weapon, yes the delay is slower but as you get into higher lvls the delay will shorten and your hitpoints will be what you are worried about. If you didn't know, just because a weapon says its dmg 10 or in my case 17 does not mean thats what dmg it wil do. when you begin to use the wapon it will vary from much lower than the base dmg to a little higher than the base dmage, the more u youse it the better your skill gets, the better your skill gets the more accurate you become and the mor focuse dyoru hps become and like mine which base dmg is 17 and hits around 28, you will surpass your weapons base hp.. This doesnt work for all weapons of the category though.. by this I mean thta if you need to pick not only one category such as 1hs or 2hs but you need to find a good weapon from that category and stick to it. You may have heard that u  must be a certain lvl to use a 2hs weapon, this is not true. The thing is until you reach a certain lvl u cannot go to your trainer adn train with that category (2hs slash), but you can however improve by simply using the weapon  which is much more effective anyway.<p>

Using Spells:<br>
Never rely on your spells!!! If youre soloing put your courage buff on anad whatever other buffs you have, watch the chat bar to look for nearby higher lvl player who are giving buffs they will usally donate for no charge. At lvl 9 your best spells are yaulp (a spell that increases your dmg temporarily while fighting), flash of light (blinds the target temporarily make it  easier for you to attack it and preventing it from attacking you) and courage (a buff that hads to your hp and ac). I know ive mentioned it but dont rely on your minor healing spell to save you.. it is exactly what it says.. minor, very minor, the time it takes u to cast a creature  has time to attack u for more than the heal spell will replace. You are a good melee fighter, use that to your advantage and use the flash of light and yaulps in your attacks, when your fighting something that cons blue or abpve use the yaulp and flash of light constantly! hit the yaulp then the flash of light then kepp alternating between the two. This works very well.<p>

LEVELING:<br>
I find that once you achieve lvl 7 or 8 yo can get a lot of exp by grouping and fighting in Crushbone often referred to as CB). Like I said earlier use the /who command but do it more specifically. Do not join a group where there will be more than 3 recurring lvls in it (dont join a group thats lvls 14,10, and 8 or 12-8... stick with the ones that are 7,8 and 9 or 10-12, etc), if you get into a lvl gapped group that contains more than 3 lvls such as 14, 13, and 10, the exp will get messed up and nobody will get their fair share. Usally the higher lvls get the most of the exp so stick with people around your lvl. Use the /who command to see who is in your area and in your lvl be specific if you are lvl 8 use, /who 8 or /who 9 or /who 10 to try to get a group thats 8-10 or do the /who 6 or /who 7 or /who 8 to get a group thats lvl 6-8.. This /who system helps out greatly once you see that there are players within the lvlsyou need send tells.. dont rely on someone responding to your shout for a group although you should do that as well..So Send tells to those in the lvls you need and shouts for a group. When soloing fight blue things near a safe place at full health and when in a group get a healer and fight groups of blue items or single red items... avoid fighting things that con green to you they award the least exp (if any).. generally once you start getting less (to none) loot form corpses its time to move on to something stronger.. Avoid death, that takes away exp the more u die th emore exp it takes away when u do. <p>

If you have any questions you can reply here or email me SmilesInCal@aol.com or contact me in game, I fight in Crushbone most of the time on weekends.. the characters name is Laurelie (High Elf Paladin) and the guild is Clerics of Norrath (they accept all classes above lvl 10, soon will be upping it to minimum lvl 25) the guild name should help ya see me but just look around an ddo some /who commands... hope this helps you out and like i said fell free to contact me.. the tactics I have described have worked and continue to work wonderfully for me.. I only play on weekends yet seem to lvl as fast if nto fast than people in my class who play much more often.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

Personally, I love the paladin class. Difficult at some points, but the overall reward is great if you play the paladin as close to the paladin spirit as you can. In other words, do every paladin quest that you can, even if the item is worse than something you already have.<p>

Here are some good low level quests:<p>

1. Shining Star of Light 1HB 6/26, proc Cleanse (paladin/cleric only.) Great quest weapon...almost as good as screaming mace.<br>
Good weapon, especially for  for paladins/clerics under 20th season. Good to keep up 1hb after 25 still. Quest is easy, but you have to kill a lot of WK bandits and turn in their sashes for the right faction.<p>

2. Bonethunder Staff 2hb 9/36 +3 WIS procs: Ward Undead...paladin/cleric only NODROP.<br>
Another great quest item for paladins/clerics only. The quest is very easy, but may need help killing the mammoth in Surefall Glade (hes 20) or you have to run to Ak anon to get the vomit potion for the mamoth to caugh up the quest item.<p>

3. Falchion of Koada'Vie. Good 1hs weapon, paladin only. The quest is a little tougher than the other two quests, since it involves a box from 1 of 3 low 20s creatures in Ocean of Tears, Dvinn's heart and Emporor Crush's head or something. <p>

All 3 of those quests are for good paladin only weapons that are great for mid teens and early 20s.<p>

But I HIGHLY recommend doing the Shining Star of Light and the Bonethunder Staff quests...they both raise the faction required for Armor of Ro and Soulfire quests. Once you are able to do those quests, your Qenos faction will be good enough for Soulfire and Armor of Ro....so you only have to work on your Freeport and other paladin factions.<p>

Besides, the bonethunder is +3 wis and procs a 41pt DD undead spell...great weapon! Shining Star of Light procs cleanse, which helps to remove Poison/Disease/root and other dots. I still use SSoL and Bonethunder in my mid 30s to keep up my 1hb/2hb skills.<p>

<br>
Especaily if you are new to EQ, do the quests. They will help keep your equipment upgraded. Buying equipment is hard as a new player, since you don't know the best places to hunt and earn coin yet.<p>

Hope this helps, and always feel free to ask for help on quests!<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I Agree with most of the advice given except the on part of "dont rely on you spells". Its true in a perfect group enviroment. Chanter/warrior/Shaman,druid/and any other assortment of  tank or caster your spells will be secondary. But your melee will also be secondary to the group. a Warrior or rogue will almost always outdamage you if your on an even basis and a cleric shaman druid they will almost always out buff you. But the fact of the matter is you dont always get theese perfect groups and as you go up in levels your spells do get better when u get to the top the only heal spell you dont have is complete heal and you have always had Lay Hands. The key to playing a Paladin is realize that your a Hybrid and a Jack of all Trades. Ive been in groups that i was the Tank and we did well Ive also been in groups with 5 other tanks and played cleric sit med heal repeat we also did well. At early levels you tank at later levels you do alot of different things so learn your spells use them you will need them and you will become an asset. You go thru a constant learning curve as a paladin the higher you get the more you do. Where as a cleric has always healed and a warrior has always done the main ammount of damage and damage absorbtion. As a paladin you can and will be called on to do both considering the situation. So dont discount your spells and say im a tank because your not but learn and develop your skills as you go.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Okay there was one more thing I disagree with that of picking a single weapon and sticking to it if you have a decent int and wis there is no need for this the reason why is your combat level skill cap which means you can only get so high in a weapon skill based on your level. It is real easy to reach this cap level with two weapons if not three if you switch up when you notice your not improving your level any more or when you go up around five skill points after you level. The biggest reason i recomend this is that you never know what kind of weapon u might happen upon and it would kind of suck if your lvl 30 get a Ghoulbane and only have a 40 skill level in one hand slashing it would then take at least a couple of levels to get your skill up to where it should be.<p>

Also look at the different weapons that are great you can get<br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I disagree with Laurelie that said not to rely on your spells.  Paladins have great spells that will save your butt.  For example at lvl 9 tou get "Flash of Light" this spell will be a great companion through your mid teens.  If you get in over your head cast flash of light it casts quick and blinds your opponent allowing you to run away. It does not last to long but will give you a head start.  "Yalp" is also a quick cast and will increse your strength and ac for 18 seconds during which you will hit for maximum damage more often and take less damage.  Every little bit helps. <p>

I say explore your spells and use them as often as possible. Rely on them as additional skills, they will save your life.<p>

I do agree that Pally's are tank-like.  I say Tank-like because you will never be able to out damage a warrior, ranger or rogue (except maybe against the undead), however your ac could make you more desirable in a smaller group.  You will not be the primary tank at later levels, you will be asked to jump in the fray and when needed, cast on the undead, stun casters (with your stun spells), heal when necessary (hmm, spells again), and use "Lay on Hands" (thats a spell too) on a party member when things get ugly. (notice most of these involve your spells ;0))<p>

As with every class, knowing your characters strengths and limitations is essential.  You will always find a group if you play your character well within those strengths and limitations.  The key is to not be foolish and get members of your party killed because you believe that you are a tank.<p>

You also get root which is great for getting a mob off of a chanter. one it imobilizes the mob letting the caster get out of the way and two it works ten times better than taunting a mob if you just used tank tactics and taunted, the mob will proabally kill the caster. Also heres an interesting fact a Lvl 34 cleric can heal for around 1400-1800 hp when full of mana a pally of the same lvl can heal for around 1000-1200 hp. We cant do it as fast so for combat healing where not anywhere near as effective as a cleric but as far as getting health back up before the next pull we can make a real decent contribution to a group.

An di was more or les trying to say not to let yourself get low on health just because u have a heal spell like a cleric can.. thats whats i meant by dont rely on your spells, they are a great help when u have things to back them up but they are purely a benefit and should not be relied on to win a battle.<br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Hmmm, it's difficult on where to begin.  Alright, first I have to disagree with the people that are saying not to be proficient in 2 weapon styles.  Go with 1HS and 2HS.  You have the entire level to get each up 5 points.  Usually it takes less than a bubble to do that so just DO IT.  Why?  Because there's great weapons for both.  And you might go only 1HS and later on find that there's an incredible 2HS out there that you just HAVE to use.  And then where would you be?  1HS 200 and 2HS 50?  The Ghoulbane is a great 1HS weapon that I use as a main.  At level 40 I can deal out 57 damage a slash.  Doing double attack and a bash that can equal out to 130 a round.  And the GB is perfect for those undead things out there (and there's a lot of them).  Once you reach 20, you won't want to leave unrest for quite awhile.  Then when you get higher there's a bunch of undead everywhere else.  But I know that there's going to be a 2HS out there that I'll be green with envy to have, so I keep my skills up with my Soulfire.  And how come no one seems to mention bash?  It's a great stun for them caster creatures.  Make sure to time your bashes so that you hit them right before they start casting a spell.  It will interrupt their spell casting if the bash hits and that is always nice (especially with them healer creatures).<p>

Spells, huh.  Don't discount them.  Yaulp is my fourth hot key.  Melee attack, bash, taunt, then yaulp.  As someone said, it gives you that extra boost, and I HAVE noticed a difference in the damage of my attack.  Stun is also great when you get it at level 30.  I have the same heal as my druid friend that's close to my level, so don't discount heal either.  Who better to heal the group AFTER a fight than the paladin?  You have less mana so it's faster to recover.  Let the druid, cleric, whatever rest and get their mana back.  YOU take the initiative and heal the group as best you can.  I've had many a clerics thank me for it.<p>

DO NOT save your lay hands for yourself!  That's plain selfish.  If the cleric's in trouble, or the druid, or the enchanter, or anyONE in your group, use it on them!  If using your LoH on the druid gives him the opportunity to gate you all out of there then that benefits the whole group.  If by laying hands on the cleric gives the cleric the opportunity to heal YOU in return or, by chance if you die, you can get ressed by him, DO IT.  If someone in your group is in trouble, if it's not a mob then it's not on you, being part tank.  LoH usually turns the creature to you, which is your job in the group anyway.  I can understand about not using it on someone that's NOT in your group, but please, use it to your best advantage, which is usually someone else.  I'd rather get ressurected by the cleric, knowing that I saved the whole group, than knowing put LoH aside for when "I" needed it.  Using it on a druid especially has saved my pally hide more times than I can count.<p>

I concentrate on str stuff only because high elves tend to be weaker and armor is so dang heavy!  Only recently have I been able to get AC items and that's because my mate in game is a druid and can cast strength on me whenever I want it.<p>

My favorite area was the oasis.  For some odd reason I loved hitting the caimens and crocs.  I solo'ed myself there from 13 to 21.  Unrest is a good area for low levels to 30s.  Get a ghoulbane though.  After level 20 you'll hug it to you like your bestest teddy bear.  =)  Cyclops (in group, of course) are fun in the 30s.  There's greater skeles there too for the mid 20s.  Right now I've been doing tundra yetis for 4 levels and I'm still getting great experience at level 40.  It moves about every third yeti and that's great for a so-called "hell" level!<p>

I definitely agree with the person that says to do quests.  Half of my pally life has been quests.  Hehe  I have the Soulfire (thanks to my great friends that were bored before Kunark came out), Aegis of Life (again, thanks to my great friends although I WAS the tank for the evil Lord Grimrot - I should say thanks to the healers!), several pieces of Ro armor, Hero Bracers.......  A lot of these quests have small parts.  Small enough for low levels to start them on.  Like the Ro armor.  If you're killing dervs, save the rings and go to the named orc in South Ro and give them to him 4 at a time.  That is a minor quest you can do over and over again and it builds your Ro faction.  If you're killing skeles save the bone chips and go to the dwarven city's pally guild and hand the bone chips over to the dwarf at the end of the hall.  It builds your faction up there for parts of a lot of quests and it gives you a bit of experience.  You can even start the Soulfire quest by doing some of the little things.  =)<p>

Hope this helps!<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Hail Brother and well met,<p>

     The wisdom that Lord Marr has imparted to me in my journeys to right Norrath of Evils blight!<br>
            1. Remeber you are a servant of light and as such must conduct yourself in acccordance with the code of your temple! <p>

 ( This means several things, one always always aways help others even if you know it will cost you! Why, you will be pleasently suprised later in your career to have a deep red con player visit you and talk to you about how you LOH him or how you started him out with good equipment when he started his character. In my time in the game i have been passed by several players i knew, im not a powergamer or a twink and im not a player who can spend the many hours i would like to playing. But i have made many friends that are always willing to help because i held the horde while they got away!  This doesnt imply be stupid and die on every encounter but you will know when it is time for the heroic pally death, when it is time for you to LOH your group mate and save the day, BE SELFLESS it will pay off when you least expect it!)<p>

<br>
          2. Learn your trade, never favor the blade when one day your God may hand you the Mace!<p>

           ( Point here is max all of your skills out NOW and keep them their, this will make your character more usefull and rounded than probably 90% of the others youll encounter in the game. Think about it how many times have you seen the ubber troll warrior standing over a lvl 30 HighHold Gob mob asking if he cn practice his 2h bash because the skill is only 16 when it could possibly be maxed at 225? Ive seen it often in fact im paying the price of still developing my skills to max at 40th. Specifically, got down time swim, need to work on divination cast a spell repeatdly until it increases, etc..etc... just keep track of your skills and try to train on them each as you level this will pay major dividends for you later believe me. I wont go into weapons selections just aquire one of each type and hunt with them when you get one skill maxed switch weapons to get the next maxed etc..etc... REMEBER KNIGHTS WERE REQUIRED TO TRAIN IN ALL WEAPONS)<p>

     3.Know your enemy just as you would your companions!<p>

         ( Well this sounds very general like hehehehehe....anyways my point here is this dont get caught in the routine while your grouping of tank, tank, tank, tank  learn what parts each of the people you are grouping with do, find out how they would tackle the situation this will open your knowledge of the game up so that you will know instintaviley what to do to best help your group! Dont play into the Mobs hands that your fighting! example I watched a Pally soloing dead he would walk up to mummys in N Ro and stand Toe to Toe with them swinging away until he or they dropped, he ran to the guards a few times to be saved, when he came back i asked him if he had the spook the dead spell? when he said yes i showed him how to fear kite{spook mummy, chase mummy while it runs and beat on it}. Im not the brightest guy in the world and in fact someone had to show me the same trick when i was a younger Paladin and as you can imagine his downtime decreased and subsequently he leveled faster. Really the more you learn from other the more youll benefit in the game. Think out of the Box JUST BECAUSE YOUR A KNIGHT IT DOES NOT MEAN YOUR GOING TO WIN BY STANDING TOE TO TOE WITH YOUR FOE!<p>

          All of the articles above have great points and ring with truths! The most important thing to remeber is TO THINE SELF BE TRUE! You brother are a Paladin a great calling that many cannot accept (e.g. why paladin my warrior is much better, etc..etc...)<br>
We are a brotherhood and will always be!<p>

          May Lord Marr grant you strength in your task, Sir Sonodar!<br>
           ( Or whatever god you worship)<br>
          /em salutes you!<br>
          /says Now off to slay those windmills.....err i mean giants!<br>
          /shouts CHARGE!!!!<br>
          /em think to himself "why are all these gnomes standing on these giants feet?"<hr>Ceddrick Peredhil<br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I didnt read all the posts, If u want help my best suggestion is a few tips on soloing. it can be rememberd very simply. (u gota be at least level 22 to try this though) Tank, root heal, repeat. Basically u tank the mob root him an get back a few steps and heal urself. Now never underestimate flash of light. It is a fear spell if u use it properly. If u ever gota run cast this spell take a step back an watch the mob run away heh. Also try to train 2hs early, ur gona be using it later. It will make a dif in dmg u deal. now as for pally taking dmg an dealing. at 45 i could outdeal some mnks wars rogs etc in dmg. Arb combine greatsword and a fbss) save up and camp taht fbss to hell lol. soulfire isnt worth using anymore ( hopefully i get Fa soon anyhow. just a few tips enjoy.   And this is a very underestimated class. My best frend in RL plays a war i dueld him at 40 an kicked his ass, an he has great kunark/velious gear. then he saw me kill a 41 twnk monk when i was 40 the same week. (the mnk actually cheated an got his frend to come to arena and blind me a few times lol) anyhow show us off and remember pride. You are a paladin, a holy knight, defender of truth. <p>
