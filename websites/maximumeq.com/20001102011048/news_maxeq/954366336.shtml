Brad has this to say about Warriors getting enhanced healing power.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The reason is our Vision(TM) of a Warrior (which certainly isn't original, but rather is quite traditional): They hit stuff with weapons, and they get hit.<BR>
They're not supposed to have any magic skills.<BR>
<BR>
They are supposed to be dependent on others for healing, magical protection, travel, etc.<BR>
<BR>
It's all part of the class interdependence that is key to the game. Giving Warriors the ability to heal themselves beyond Bind Wounds would, in my opinion, blur the distinction between classes and harmfully homogenize class balance.<BR>
<BR>
Bottom line, if you want to melee and still cast spells, play a hybrid.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The difference here is that the good races have an outpost on Kunark, a beachhead of sorts. <BR>
I think a good summary of the KOS situation is that a LOT of Kunark KOS to evil races and even more KOS to good races. Basically, Kunark is a nasty place, great for adventuring and the pursuit of treasure, but bad for Sunday walks <BR>

Personally, I don't twink any of my characters, but that's only me.  I enjoy the challenge of getting each one their own gear.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Here's a thought:<BR>
What if twinking, or actually the trickle down economic effect of items (both characters being 'twinked' items for free AND the prices of 'better' items lowering daily because of the constant influx of items into the economy with nothing taking them out) was there to HELP the casual gamer?<BR>
<BR>
What if we knew the hard core gamers would head out and conquer the game over a shorter period of time, able to commit more hours and willing to face more dangers? <BR>
<BR>
What if we knew eventually, as more causal gamers came to EQ, the better items would trickle down to the more causal gamers, making it easier for them to play EQ because they are, essentially, more powerful?<BR>
<BR>
*shrug*<BR>
<BR>
It's just a thought.<BR>
<BR>
(personally, I have mixed feelings about twinking and it's long term effects on MMORPG economies and game balance. I think I could probably argue both pro and anti-twiking very effectively. We definitely have people from both philosophies on the EQ team, which is a good thing.)<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>(This may be old news, but I've not seen it talked about)<BR>
After some thought and consideration, we've made it such that one can bash when wielding the FA, even though it remains 2H.<BR>
<BR>
We're also contemplating adding FA type weapons for all the classes, including special 'particle' effects for those weapons, but it's going to take us a WHILE to get them all in (meaning the quests, graphics, and such), so please be patient.<BR>
<BR>
Also, making some 2h weapons 'bash ok' is something we're going to limit to FA type weapons, so I'm going to go ahead and say 'no' to all the requests to make other 2h weapons the same -- sorry in advance <BR>

Our intentions are to muster troops of all race and class(shorties excluded) at high noon (central time) at the enterance to Ak'Anon.A head count will be taken and parties made promptly at that time. Warm upon the local guards is encouraged! Once parties are assembled, I will leadthe invading army to the destruction of this mini-race to the maximum extentpossible. Our primary target will be the King of Ak'Anon and to my knowledge(mainly from the local bards) this has never been done on our server. SoDON'T MISS THIS ONE! It will be big. Goodies are invited to play the role ofscout, photographer, res services, etc. Tell your friends and bring yourweapons, for Ak'Anon will fall!<BR>

-------------------<BR>
<BR>
***UPDATE MESSAGE***<BR>
<BR>
This morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes to improve performance of the game engine in general.  However, there are several changes to note:<BR>
<BR>
*Spell Changes*<BR>
<BR>
- Skin Like Nature has had its damage shield removed and has regained its regeneration component.  We're certain this time :)<BR>
- Many Shaman buff spells have had their recast delay removed.  You can now cast them on multiple people without having to wait between each cast.<BR>
- The Wizard spell "Rend" was improperly saving versus cold.  It now saves versus Magic.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Bug Fixes and General Enhancements*<BR>
<BR>
The spawning problem in Solusek's Eye (SoldungA), related to the spawn of the Clockwork gnomes, will be fixed later today in a zone patch.  <BR>
<BR>
The +/= key will no longer take screenshots. <BR>
<BR>
You can now adjust your clipping plane by using the SHIFT/- and SHIFT/+ key combinations. <BR>
<BR>
You can now view the Message of the Day by typing /motd.<BR>
<BR>
Corrected a bug in the /follow process that would cause your character to loop around to the right at times when following someone.<BR>
<BR>
Corrected a bug that would cause item-loss associated with trading a container marked LORE. <BR>
<BR>
Corrected some grouping bugs that had the potential to cause the client to crash. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Feign Death and Pets*<BR>
<BR>
The Feign Death spell will no longer wear off.  This change had been made due to an issue that was discovered that allowed Necromancers to solo creatures while feigned and AFK.  The change had some unintended effects, as we discovered that there are a few cases where someone could be legitimately feigned for a longer period. Instead of having the spell wear off, any summoned pet will automatically suicide 2 minutes after its owner feigns.  This is the solution requested by most of the players who voiced an opinion, and should serve the same goal as the original change.<BR>

<BR><BR>
Nestled in the deep forests near the City of Houston Texas, is a small and friendly town which takes you back to the days of mystery and imagination! Not unlike the cities of Freeport and Qeynos, visitors can eat, drink and be merry to their hearts content!  Guntar Pontdecardon, leader of the United Norrathian Brotherhood, will be your host as he takes you on a tour of this wonderful place. 
<BR><BR> 
There will be Food and fun, and links to Travel and lodgings will be added to assist in making your venture to the Houston area as easy as possible. (I assure you it will be easier than finding someone to port you there!)</font></p>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway my question is this: are you guys aware the jboots are much more difficult to acquire than off Drelzna now?
<BR><BR>
What do you mean by "difficult"? I would say that the Drelzna camp had relatively no difficulty, but a significant time investment. Are you saying that it takes more time, or just more work? I've hard about people running 80 hour jboots camps before.
<BR><BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If a physically disabled person complaned about the slope of a ramp to Verant's offices as being too steep, would you guys make the incline greater so they couldn't get to your offices or lower it so they could?
<BR><BR>
The analogy is flawed. In EQ, if you have a problem because everyone wants an item, the solution usually isn't increasing the supply of the item. When you do that, you just decrease the value of the item since anyone can get it.
<BR><BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently once Brother Zephyl spawns you can forget about getting your ring until the zone crashes or the server reboots. 
<BR><BR>
We're aware of the Brother Zephyl problem. This should be fixed on the Test server now and will hopefully see production soon. The problem is that Brother Zephyl gets stuck on a rock and can't complete his script.

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Where Will the Servers Be In 5 Years?">Where Will the Servers Be In 5 Years?</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 03/16/00 12:57 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This is a question that I've been pondering for a bit.  Thankfully someone else asked.  Looks like we could be playing EQ for some time to come!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Something dawned on me the other night. With Verant making more games in the future, what would happen if they shut down the Everquest servers ? In other words, say in 6-7 years, Verant has another breakthrough game and starts to concentrate almost exclusivly on it, they need the severs, so the take down the EQ servers to use.
<BR><BR>
It's safe to say that we won't be using the EQ Server's for anything else. The rate at which system resources (processing power, memory, etc) increase is only rivaled by the rate at which programmers can consume them. Its fairly safe to say that in 6-7 years, the EQ servers won't be powerful enough to run any game that we would come out with at that time. 
<BR><BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If that ever happened, this game would 100% unplayable (well almost...we could still play the tutorial). I mean I can still play games from 15 years ago IF I wanted to. I could still install something from my floppy drive and still play it IF I wanted to (like the oringinal System Shock, lets say)
<BR><BR>
Though we know that EQ won't last forever, the concept of it going away is still a bit out there to really comment on it. EQ is still growing a year after release. In fact, well over 60% of the people who ever played EQ are still playing, so we can't even forecast a reliable figure for the average subscription length. 
<BR><BR>
For these reasons, we haven't even begun to consider downsizing or exit strategies. It will probably be several years before we can even hypothesize about it.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>>>>I was told tonight by a GM during a petition as my FD wore off after only 2 mins it will not be fixed. The message in the Patch was a mistake and FD was intended to effect all FD classes..(Shadow Knight class)
<BR><BR>
It's being completely changed. Instead of having Feign Death wear off on anyone, we're going to make it so that the pet will suicide after 2 minutes.

<BR><BR>
A Question was recently brought up on the Gameplay forum about faction and wolfform.  I was wondering what had happened to the UnrestInhabitants and BefallenInhabitants faction myself not too long ago.<BR><BR>

Here is what Abashi had to say:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Without the UnrestInhabitant faction hit, this allows high level druids to essentially farm the entire zone without a risk of being attacked by anything he doesn't chose to attack him. I believe that druid wolf form was intented to increase faction in some zones, but not to a degree where they can kill as many mobs as they like in a given zone as often as they like with never a risk of retribution.
<BR><BR>
You have a good point, and it sounds reasonable. We'll probably look into changing it some time. I always thought it strange that someone could do that (sneak around unrest in wolfform in perpetuity), but hadn't thought of it since I started here. 
<BR><BR>
I'll chat with some people and see if we want to make or decline the change.

Has Sony/Verant gotten to the point where they dont even pretend to care about keeping us informed anymore?<BR><BR>
It's just a minor client-side non-gameplay affecting change. Didn't even require that the servers come down. I suppose someone could have put up a "Just some art" patch message though.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;1. Was the zone in debuff part of the original game plan or a change made to prevent ppl from accessing the platforms out of order?<BR>
It was a measure to prevent people from zoning in with levitate, which then enabled them to get to islands out-of-order.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If it was a preventative measure why was the level of the islands not altered to prevent ppl from moveing up out of order? (Besides a new download) <BR>
<BR>
The new download is a big part of it. Changing world geometry leads to having to download the entire zone again. The other thing though is that our people who are capable of doing world geometry are tied up for a while. There are also more problems than just allowing people to get to islands out of order, it's letting them get down to an island that they've already been to. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Since the new change people are no longer able to access the starting platform once the get higher up. (You used to be able to float down) You have to jump off and gate back up. Costing a player upwards of 250p per trip. Are the costs to get into sky going to be changed to reflect this new demand?<BR>
<BR>
Not at this time. Perhaps if we see an excessive shortage of platinum, we might reevaluate our money sinks so that they are in line with the means of the players.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;3. What is the average amount of cash that a lvl 46+ player (ballpark it) has on his person? Most folks that i know usually have between 500p and 1k.<BR>
<BR>
Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. I suppose it depends on your class. I know a few enchanters with over 30K in the bank. I know that as a solo high-40s necro, I can make over 200pp per hour, and I have 3500pp in the bank. <BR>
<BR>
Considering that there are auctions out there for hundreds of thousands of platinum, I think there's probably still enough of it out there.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;4. We spent around of 15000p - 18000p so far this week getting to gorgolask platform in PoA for a 30 person trip. Thats 500-600p per person so far. Is this the target Verant is looking for?<BR>
<BR>
Considering that the only mandatory cost in the Plane of Sky is the component to zone in, with everything else being optional for short-cuts, it sounds ok. Of course, the entire zone is supposed to be the pinnacle of difficulty.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;5. Do the above figures encourage farming of items to gather easy cash for these trips?<BR>
<BR>
I think that people are probably depleting their reserves before resorting to farming. They can also start selling some of the items they find in the world for plat, rather than making them trade-only. There's a bit of this going on currently, and overall the economy is getting healthy.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;6. I get the feeling that PoA is a work in progress. Should we expect any other "high impact" (high impact to me was the "anti buff" patch) changes to the zone or is it getting close to verants "vision" for PoA?<BR>
<BR>
I won't call any zone perfect, but we think we have it pretty well figured out. That's not to say that we won't have to make a change or two should no one ever be able to reach the top, or should some loophole be found that makes it entirely too easy, but it's looking good at present.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;7. One last comment/question... If I had been given a choice of loosing buffs or moving the islands I would have chosen the latter. I feel being able to levitate in PoA... with all the mobs that can cast blowback and gravity flux... is useful for keeping yourself in PoA and preventing damage to yourself. Is it possible to have the islands adjusted to prevent people from exploiting levitate? Another 30min patch makes me no difference if the change is a good one <BR>
<BR>
We don't have any plans at present to change zone geometry. As mentioned above, we have all the people who are capable of that tied up for a while. <BR>

A player recently asked why we aren't seeing the actual value for the skill (as in, 1H Slash 102 instead of "Master").  It's pretty difficult to tell if you have maxed out your skills for a level unless you log everything and look through the log later.<BR><BR>

Here is Abashi's response to the topic:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Wasn't there a patch message a while back that stated we would be able to see our skill levels in numbers as opposed to Master, Average what not? 
Yes, a patch message to that effect was put up a while back by mistake. We won't be doing that as we don't want to support focusing on numbers.

Below is Abashi's latest response:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;HOWEVER, the trade-off was supposed to be doing more damage than any other class. 
No where did anyone say this, and I'm sorry if that's what you got out of the FAQ. Take the FAQ to mean direct damage, or take it to mean damage in a given amount of time, in either case, wizards take the cake. You do more damage in X seconds than anyone else can do. You're spells do more damage than anyone elses direct damage spells.
<BR><BR>
Did you expect that you'd be able to do more damage in a full load of mana? I'm sorry, that just isn't the case. Most of the other casting classes can do more damage than wizards can in a full load of mana, it just takes a LONG time to do it. 
<BR><BR>
I wouldn’t expect this to change dramatically. We are toying with the idea of giving you a new series of spells to help in certain conditions, but that’s basically it. Nothing dramatic.

<BR>
You are all invited to the Black Burrow Hunting party on March 15th (9pm
Eastern, 8pm Central, 7pm Mountain, 6pm Pacific).<BR>
<BR>
Our primary target will be the named player killer, and Murderer known as
Geli, a dark elf Necromancer.  After she has been delt with, or in the event
that she does not show up to face the music, the Black Burrow clan will be
throwing a party (apparently they don't like Geli to much either).  Events
include a diving contest (all participants are to jump from the top of the
water fall at the same time, the first person to race to a yet to be
mentioned place in black burrow will be crowned the winner.  A game of hide
- and - go seek (suggested for high level players only) one lucky person
(see invis. provided) will have to find all the other players hiden through
out the black burrow dungeon.  After you have been found, you will then join
in the search to find the others.  The last person to be found  (assuming we
are not looking for you all night) will be the winner.  There will also be
several high level players on site to heal and buff all the youngin's who
just want to hunt gnolls.  We are not expecting to much trouble from other
darkies, but you may want to leave your polished armor at home...<BR>

Currently, even though you may have enough faction to obtain the quest, you probably don't have enough faction to receive the reward.<BR><BR>

It should also be of note that you need the NO DROP scythe.  Not sure why Verant made a droppable and no drop version with the same name off of the same MOB, which is used for a quest, but they did.<BR><BR>

It is possible to complete the quest, but not without a large amount of time spent to get your faction very high.</font></p>
