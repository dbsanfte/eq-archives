Tuesday August 15, 2000<BR>
 <BR>
Ready for a DAILY Comic Strip fraught with dazzling color and fast-paced comedic relief?<BR>
We've got it for you at GUComics.Com. <BR>
 <BR>
The attention getting comic strip "gu ..." is a single-panel, tongue-in-cheek venture into the <BR>
world of EverQuest. Not to mention a wonderful addition to your daily line-up of EQ links.<BR>
 <BR>
It's safe to say that you haven't seen anything quite like this in an EQ-based comic, and <BR>
we can't offer much more than to say: "You have to see this for yourself!".<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Even more client changes!">Even more client changes!</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/15/00 01:32 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Some of these changes may look small, but I find them rather significant.  One of the biggest ones is "soandso casts suchandsuchaspell on suchandsuchatarget".  All spell casters are going to love this one.  Heck, all players period.  I'll just let that one sink in.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Using activatable items from the hotbutton panel is in and should be on test. I'm looking into why the hotkeys don't operate from a keypress while in the spell book.<BR>
---<BR>
Looking into the Ctrl-1 thru Ctrl-8 for memed spells.<BR>
---<BR>
The main issue with selecting party members pets with the F keys is that the client doesn't currently track the info. I will look into it and see if this can be done. As usual, no promises.<BR>
---<BR>
Looking into the shift click while buying to buy stacks of 20. One thing to keep in mind, if you don't have enough money for all 20 it will just cancel the sale. This will only work on stackable items.<BR>
---<BR>
&gt;&gt;1. When emoting, the text of the emote YOU typed used to be blue. But when others saw it, it was white. Similarly, <BR>
&gt;&gt;when you saw other's emotes, they were white. Now all emotes are the same color.<BR>
I had to make "classes" of text, and in order to keep it from being a separate color control entry in the ini file <BR>
for every text message printed (meaning hundreds of entries) I had to group stuff together. I thought it made sense <BR>
to put all emotes into a class together. This reason applies to alot of the messages.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;2. With my color User_11 RGB as specified in Gordon's file, full red only, the text is still WHITE on messages <BR>
&gt;&gt;where others are hitting me. This is probably just a bug.<BR>
&gt;&gt;3. Wasn't the duel color (User_14) yellow?<BR>
Some of the messages are sent from the server with a color tag, I have already fixed most of these and it should be on test. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;4. Was all spell activity really dark blue? I must be losing my marbles, that seems wrong.<BR>
<BR>
See my responce to 1 above.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;5. When you do a /who friend all, your friends list comes back white, rather than the color of all other friends <BR>
&gt;&gt;queries (again, likely just a bug).<BR>
<BR>
The "local" /who command is handled by the client, the "/who all" commands are all handled by the world server. Those will be colored properly soon.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Couple things I wanted to address:<BR>
Cancelling a spell you already cast and having to wait until the casting time is done is part of the game. If you click the wrong spell you have to wait... <BR>
<BR>
I doubt I will be able to increase the number of hotbuttons per page above 6 pages of 6 buttons. It would change the player data format stored ont he server, and that could cause serious problems with character data. I might be able to make it 4 pages of 9 (still having a total of 36 buttons, just more available at a time). I am still investigating this one.. I'll let you know what comes up.<BR>
<BR>
Several of the other things asked for here are either in or going in this week. Like a /cast 1-8 for casting memmed spells, /book # to open your book on page #, /sit, /doability # (so if you have tracking set on ability button 1, then /doability 1 would invoke tracking), more control of certain text message colors, the spell and target being mentioned in the "casting" message, custom emotes that include the target name (/em gives @ the look of death and @ is frozen in his tracks would replace the '@' with the current target), and more... some of these are on test already, and some will be there later this week.<BR>

I have spells all over the place (yes, I know you can rearrange, but half of them I just don't know where to put).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I am working on a /book command that will briong up your book, I plan to allow you to specify a page number with that and have it pop open on that page. So /book 5 would open the book with page 5 visible. This should allow you to get to any page in your book easily.
<BR><BR>
Duplicate spells icons in the book is not an easy thing, I'll peek at it, but doubt it will get done.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Part of the GUI overhaul for Velious will likely involve something along these lines, but because of the new art and data changes for that it won't be until Velious.
