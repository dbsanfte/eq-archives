I'm particularly worried about the implications that it could have on people performing trade skills.  Nothing like giving an enchanter that shiny jacinth to attempt making something, they go LD and *poof* the items are gone.<BR><BR>

It also means that you will need to do these quests all in one sitting.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>*snip*<BR>
Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color=white>
as an enchanter in the planes, i've spent more time spinning in circles looking for someone that just poked me than i've spent meditating or casting.<BR>
would be nice to be able to type: /target bob, and cast my spell without clicking on him.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
This function will be in the next client patch. It will have a limited range so that it is not unbalancing for PvP and other purposes.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="XP lose while duelling">XP lose while duelling</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/25/00 11:17 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This is such a weird issue.  Abashi is always changing his answer it seems (to me at least).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Lose of exp. in a duel Abashi please read <BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I think you should test a character who has very little exp. on the current level. It may be a bug or something. Maybe the exp. loss is so minute that you don't even notice unless you have <BR>
jsut gained a level. Thanks.<BR>
</font>
Though it's probably not the most desirable situation, it's not a bug. <BR>
<BR>
Experience loss from PvP combat (including duels) on non-PvP servers has the potential to cause experience loss if you die in certain ways. For instance, if you are killed by a DOT, are rooted in water or lava, killed by a pet, or bleed to death, you will lose experience.<BR>
<BR>
These issues do not happen on PvP servers because we've turned off all environmental deaths on those servers due to the fact that PvP occurs there more regularly. On non-PvP servers, it's the exception to the rule.<BR>
