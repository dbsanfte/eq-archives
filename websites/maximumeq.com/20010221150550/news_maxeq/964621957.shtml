<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We've posted another <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">new issue of Ask Milo</a> here at Everlore. This week Milo dishes out his colorful responses with a sugar coated tongue. (Heh, yeah right). None the less, still quite funny as always, Mr. Cooper talks about Solo'ing dragons, cleavage, programming, Star Wars online, and of course N'Sync. Great read as always, here's a snip.

    Question: Why do the loved-by-all Guides have the coolest graphics like the electric sword and hot looking green plate armor         while the people who are paying for the game get nothing but totems that look like a little dolly no matter how bad-ass it should     look. My point is that there are allot of graphics in the game that could be improved to make the customers happy. Instead it         looks like Verant is more concerned with making those that don't pay for the game happy, I.e guides.
