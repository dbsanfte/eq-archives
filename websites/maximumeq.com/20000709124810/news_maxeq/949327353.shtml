It is called "How I really feel about EverQuest" and reflects many of the feelings from present and past players about their experiences with the game.  It also discusses the game in greater detail.  It is one of the best examples of positive feedback I have read yet!
<br><br>
Head over and post your comments.  Thanks Omnix for starting the thread off with your insight!

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Online RPGs and muds have been around forever, but nothing like everquest. Verrant did borrow from other games, blended the best ideas from one with the best ideas of anouther. In the end I think what they achieved is a foundation on which greater games will come. they laid the work for a new standard in online play, and I can't wait to see what games will come in the future with this standard in place.</font></p>

It looks like this triggers the hacking flag in EQ.  If anyone has any information regarding these bannings please send it my way and we will do our best to ask Verant about the situation. </font></p>

<BR>
*Announcements*<BR>
<BR>
The Plane of Sky is now open!!!  As a reminder to our customers, the<BR>
alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the same physical<BR>
or ethereal rules as Norrath proper.  Enjoy!<BR>
<BR>
Today is patch day! The EverQuest servers have been patched with the<BR>
following changes:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*General Changes / Fixes*<BR>
<BR>
- Some changes have been made to the exit of Nagafen's Lair into the<BR>
Lavastorm Mountains.  This will hopefully reduce if not solve the bug<BR>
that causes people to fall into lava when exiting Nagafen's Lair.<BR>
Please let us know how this goes.<BR>
<BR>
- Due to feedback received from the customers concerning the density of<BR>
fog during rainstorms, visibility has been increased.<BR>
<BR>
- All drops of steel weapons have been replaced with higher quality<BR>
fine-steel weapons of the same type.  This change was made to reduce the<BR>
amount of new currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper<BR>
levels.  The fine-steel weapons are in all cases superior to the steel<BR>
weapons that were dropping, they just sell to vendors for less money.<BR>
<BR>
- Casting times have been implemented on several activatable items.<BR>
This was done to correct issues that could arise from people<BR>
chain-casting these items.<BR>
<BR>
- The safe-point (the point which you return if you fall below the<BR>
world) in Kithicor has been moved near the entrance to Rivervale, a<BR>
safer part of the zone.<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected a bug that caused AC to be improperly displayed for higher<BR>
level<BR>
  characters.  Your AC should now reflect all of your items.<BR>
<BR>
Additional Bug Fixes:<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected a bug in the client that could cause a crash if you were<BR>
spammed with emotes by someone on your /ignore list.<BR>
- Corrected a bug that allowed ships to move faster when disarmed<BR>
- Corrected a bug that caused the Aqualung to lose its charges if<BR>
dropped on the ground.<BR>
- Fire Giants in Nagafen's Lair should now recover properly when stuck<BR>
in lava.  Consider yourself warned.<BR>
- The Instill Doubt skill has been disabled on the PvP servers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Spell Changes*<BR>
<BR>
- Shadow Vortex is now a "drain" spell.<BR>
- Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<BR>
- Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced.  In addition,<BR>
the spell is less resistable.<BR>
- Angstlich's Appalling Screech had its radius increased slightly.<BR>
- All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly<BR>
increased<BR>
- Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<BR>
- Form of the Great Wolf had its speed component increased.<BR>
- Terrorize Animal had its casting time reduced and is less resistable.<BR>
- New magician's spells have been added.  Check your spell vendors.<BR>
- Reoccurring Amnesia has been made more effective.<BR>
- NPCs will now treat the "Cancel Magic" series of spells as hostile.<BR>
Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs<BR>
before attacking.  Now they will.<BR>
- The Fear and Charm series of spells now properly notify the caster<BR>
when they break.  No, seriously, we're certain this time.<BR>
- Harmtouch now does more damage beginning at level 41.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Levitation Changed*<BR>
<BR>
Due to the implementation of casting times on activatable items, the<BR>
code that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell while it was<BR>
active is no longer necessary and has been backed out.  The Levitate<BR>
spell may now be refreshed while the spell is in use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Quests and Items*<BR>
<BR>
- The Armor of Ro should be more obtainable.  We will continue to<BR>
evaluate and adjust the rarity of other class-specific armor components<BR>
to make the pieces obtainable in a reasonable amount of time.<BR>
<BR>
- We have changed the reward of a newbie quest in the Qeynos area from a<BR>
level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll.  The issuance of a level 49 scroll<BR>
was a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to amass an<BR>
abnormally large amount of currency.<BR>
<BR>
- The stats on the reward for the Rogue Redemption quest have been<BR>
increased to make it better than the favorite dropped-weapon for the<BR>
level range.<BR>
<BR>
- Ravenscale boots will now drop as frequently as other Ravenscale<BR>
items.<BR>
<BR>
- The Mask of Deception may now be equipped by the appropriate races.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Fletching Update*<BR>
<BR>
All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped Arrowhead (formerly the<BR>
Bladed Arrowhead) are now magical in nature, and may be used versus<BR>
magical creatures.  All existing items in your possession will<BR>
automatically morph into the new magical items.  Additionally, each<BR>
successful attempt to create magical arrows will yield 10 arrows instead<BR>
of the previous 5.  As such, the vendor buy-back value has been<BR>
decreased accordingly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Paw*<BR>
<BR>
The difficulty of Paw has been decreased.  We found that many of the<BR>
gnolls in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the dungeon more<BR>
difficult than it should have been for the desired level target.  Please<BR>
let us know how this change affects the viability of the dungeon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*The Plane of Fear*<BR>
<BR>
The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear have been increased.<BR>
This change was supposed to have occurred in the last patch, however the<BR>
data was not exported.  It has been tested and equipment drops are now<BR>
occurring at a much higher rate.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*The Plane of Hate*<BR>
<BR>
The item-drop percentages on roaming and fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane<BR>
of Hate have been decreased.  Previously, these NPCs used the same<BR>
drop-percentages as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall drop<BR>
percentages to be extremely high.<BR>
<BR>
Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no longer fall for illusions,<BR>
and tend to "Hate" everyone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Monk Enhancement*<BR>
<BR>
A monk's speed in hand-to-hand combat will now improve with level,<BR>
beginning in the high 20s. This will result in higher level monks doing<BR>
substantially more damage in a given time-frame.<BR>
<BR>
Though this change does increase the power of the average monk, it<BR>
should be stressed that the monk is now even more in need of true tank<BR>
classes who have the ability to taunt upset creatures off them. We want<BR>
to stress that the "taunt factor" of a monks fist has NOT been<BR>
increased, though it may appear so due to your increased damage.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement*<BR>
<BR>
Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher hitpoints and higher skill<BR>
caps on Bash and Taunt.<BR>
<BR>
The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for Paladins and SKs over<BR>
level 25.  This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and Rangers had the<BR>
same HP base, which upon further consideration is not compatible with<BR>
our vision of those classes' roles.  This change will basically put<BR>
Paladin and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit Points) between rangers and<BR>
warriors of the same race.<BR>
<BR>
The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and in particular, Paladins<BR>
had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks, Rogues, and<BR>
Warriors due to their lower damage output.  Though the Paladin and SK<BR>
will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in<BR>
addition to some of the taunting spells should help them become more<BR>
effective tanks.<BR>
<BR>
Bash was increased because Paladins typically aren't switching to<BR>
two-handed weapons, choosing instead to continue using the bash skill.<BR>
Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part, do<BR>
not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which uses the same<BR>
skill. Paladins are typically the only characters who use a shield<BR>
throughout their lives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Rogue Enhancement*<BR>
<BR>
Whenever a rogue is invisible, whether by spell, potion, or skill, they<BR>
are now also invisible to undead.<BR>
<BR>
This change was made to add a definite class-advantage to the rogue,<BR>
allowing them to do something that no other class could do.  It is the<BR>
first step in a multi-step process to improve the rogue class.<BR>
<BR>
*Wizard Enhancement*<BR>
<BR>
Level 35 or above wizards will find that their spells (Magic, Cold, or<BR>
Fire) much less likely to be resisted.  This effect stacks with the<BR>
Staff of Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician resistance<BR>
debuffs.<BR>
<BR>
This change was made to increase the effectiveness of wizards at about<BR>
the level that all spell-casting classes start seeing their resistance<BR>
rates go up.  Wizards specialize in direct magical damage. It makes<BR>
sense that they should be better at causing that damage than the other<BR>
classes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Bard Enhancement*<BR>
<BR>
Bards will now receive the Meditate skill at 10th level.  This skill<BR>
will be granted automatically the first time a bard zones after reaching<BR>
10th level, and cannot be trained further.  It will have the effect of<BR>
decreasing the amount of time that it takes a Bard to memorize their<BR>
songs.  Previously, it would take 50th level bards upwards of 2 minutes<BR>
to memorize a song.  Now it is much faster.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Druid Enhancement*<BR>
<BR>
The skill cap on a Druid's tracking skill has been increased.  This<BR>
change was implemented based upon general public opinion that the former<BR>
cap was far too low for the skill to be even marginally viable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Feign Death and Pets*<BR>
<BR>
After a serious discussion regarding the Necromancer's Feign Death<BR>
tactic, as well as reviewing public opinion on the matter, we have<BR>
implemented a change.  As we would like everyone to understand why we<BR>
feel this change was necessary, here is a summary of the issue:<BR>
<BR>
Problem:<BR>
Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances,<BR>
providing offensive tactics that are abusive.  For this ability to<BR>
remain balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility.<BR>
Offensive tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting a<BR>
saving throw verses the effect.  Since creatures do NOT get a direct<BR>
save verses feign death (as you cast it on yourself), and since you can<BR>
retry the combat once you have feigned death, there is very little risk<BR>
to necromancer himself.  As this tactic involves charming an NPC and<BR>
turning it against another NPC, which could be part of the same spawn,<BR>
it allows for Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any other<BR>
class could.  This situation is well beyond what would preserve game<BR>
balance for any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and<BR>
Ghoul Lord room, for example).<BR>
<BR>
Example:<BR>
While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic<BR>
is abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of<BR>
Lower Guk.  The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord<BR>
himself.  Using the current system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the<BR>
room at virtually no risk to himself. The Necro can get into the room<BR>
quite easily with Invis To Undead.  To clear the room he uses Screaming<BR>
Terror on one Bok and Charms the other.  When the Ghoul Lord rushes him,<BR>
he feigns.  The Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking<BR>
considerable damage during the fight.  The Necromancer waits until the<BR>
Ghoul Lord returns to its spawn point.  When the necromancer gets back<BR>
up, he is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign Death<BR>
works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again.  The fight goes<BR>
on and the 2nd Bok is killed.  When the Necromancer gets back up he has<BR>
a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly full mana.  The Lord is now an easy<BR>
kill, and the Necro collects his special items.<BR>
<BR>
Solution:<BR>
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<BR>
suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<BR>
adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What<BR>
we do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necro's from<BR>
exploiting key spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed<BR>
NPC will immediately break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will<BR>
NOT be affected.  While this still allows the use of the Feign Death<BR>
tactic with your summoned pet, it does not imbalance the game and many<BR>
dungeon spawns to the degree that charming an NPC does.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Manastone Changed*<BR>
<BR>
The players have raised many concerns about the power of the Manastone,<BR>
which no longer drops.  They cite that people without a Manastone are<BR>
not as welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other areas as<BR>
people with them.  Since dropping additional Manastones via quest or<BR>
removing them from the existing populace is not desirable, we've decided<BR>
to make it so that the Manastone will no longer function in the<BR>
alternate planes.  Furthermore, it will not function in any of the zones<BR>
included with the Kunark Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
We apologize to those adversely affected by this change. Our general<BR>
goal is to avoid making changes to items in peoples' possession, however<BR>
we felt this change was, all things considered, warranted and for the<BR>
benefit of the game as a whole.<BR>

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Mailbag: Overcrowding">Mailbag: Overcrowding</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 01/20/00 10:22 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>Another fine letter covering the theme of overcrowding.  

Unfortunately I am unable to keep up with the flood of opinion on this topic.  Please post your comments in our message board. =)</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"With the discussion of the new servers coming on, we are seeing what some 
have already foretold.  As the game continues to grow in sales, the number of characters grow exponentially (If you figure 8 characters available on each server).  What we have now are too many high level characters, and not enough room.  As it stands, when a player reaches the maximum level, they have a choice of exploring the zones for the fun of the exploration, or starting a new character and trying their hand at something new, and we must not forget the option of hoarding magic items, or trying to convert those items into "real life" currency.<p>


What is happening, is that players are becoming addicted to the Everquest 
lifestyle, and are afraid of playing the game from ground zero.  It is the 
rare occasion that any of the older servers will yield a level one character that does not have several hundred plat worth of items before level 4.  I for one know the feeling.  <p>


I have multiple 30+ characters on several servers, and I'm not ashamed that I do not have a single level 50 character.  I recently started a level one mage, and instantly had friends and guild mates start handing him items that they had cluttering up their bank.  I also had the privilege to get several spells to start my new character out, and reached level 2 within two minutes of playing time.  By the end of an hour playing, I was already level 5.  I now look back to my first character on EQ and laugh at how hard of a time I had originally getting that far.  This game isn't so hard, is it?
<p>

The type of playing that I have been doing, will be the downfall of EQ.  
There are already people that are saying that they have no challenge.  They complain that now that they have "done it all," there is nothing left to do.  After all, how many people are willing to play a game they have seen through to the end?  The answer is, the several thousand people playing EQ.<p>


I am against the "splitting" of an older server.  The gamers that want the 
split, are people who feel like their existing character is the only 
character they will have any fun with.  If you feel like your server is too 
crowded, it probably is.  But, is it keeping you from turning your back on 
that character, and starting all over?  No, you have to make that choice 
yourself.  Either you can stay with your older character on a server filled 
with people "just like you," or you can try another server, also filled with 
people "just like you."

Verant is trying to please all the customers all the time.  Hopefully most of us can see how futile that effort is.  It is nice to see that they are 
actually trying new, and inventive ideas on keeping the customers' money...I mean keeping the customers happy.  Let's see what kind of reaction people have to the idea that gave Beta it's last days of playing.  How would 
everyone feel if every player became PvP, and after the battle, all 
characters are erased?  Now, don't you think THAT would cure the overcrowding 
issue.  .)"

How to balance out the Ranger<p>

Hello , here are my ideas on how to balance out the ranger and to make my favorite class more fun to play because we will be able to compete in the Everquest environment more equally. To start off we are supposed to be the masters of archery but warriors along with Paladins have a greater attack and can out damage us and warriors get the same critical attacks we get. Paladins have an even great advantage over rangers with their laying on of hands. This could be solved by making it after reaching 25th level all delays on the bows for a ranger are reduced by 15% increasing with levels to a higher percentage to stimulate our mastering of the skill. Rangers have always been known for being able to move with stealth and speed through the woodlands. For this reason I believe, SOW should be received at 30th lvl not 39th, and camo and superior Camo should be received at earlier levels to represent the rangers mastery of camouflage. Next I would like to see the spell grasping roots fixed because as of now it only causes 10 points of damage and only holds our opponents about 10% of the time. I believe the rangers attack and defense attributes should be raised slightly to better balance them for when they are competing against the other melee classes, also while rangers were never as affective as warriors they were still fearsome fighters on the field of battle which at this time they are not.. Now about tracking, it was supposed to be our strength that set us apart but now with druids and bards tracking we are once again in the position that makes it difficult for us to find groups. They would prefer to get a druid or a bard. The rangers  biggest problem is that they made him to much of a utility player. He can heal, he can tank, and he can nuke. But he can not do any one of these well enough to be effective. Verant spread the rangers abilities out to far rather than giving us a couple of specialties to make us needed by groups.  So most people look for druids and bards to track down the rare creatures that spawn. Granted the introduction of these creatures did help us find groups but it is still difficult. After 20th level groups want druids before they want rangers. The druids appear to melee as well as us rangers and their lack of armor is more then made up for by their powerful spells and healing ability, and the bards songs more than make up for their lack of fighting skill. To fix this I do not suggest removing there tracking ability but to increase the rangers attack and defense also to balance this out. I also think the rangers duel wield needs to be increased and our off hand penalty needs to be removed like the warriors. I think at 49th rangers should get a more effective DoT spell and should receive the personal gate spells to the first 4 (Tox, Butcherblock, NKarana, & Wcommons)  druid stones at 49th  and the rest of the gate spells at a later level in the expansion. I would like to see these improvements made to help balance the Ranger with the other classes. These are the things I feel would greatly enhance the ranger making my favorite class come from an under powered class to an equal class. Thank you for your time."<p>
