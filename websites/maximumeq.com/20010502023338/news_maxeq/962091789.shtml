    Hiya Milo i just ask you one question about the graphics of eq. I played the other weekend at my friends house for my first time     for a couple hours and i haven't played since then, but some times i couldnt tell the difference between the real world and the EQ     world so my question is have you ever had this happen to you before and hats off to ya with the graphics man.
