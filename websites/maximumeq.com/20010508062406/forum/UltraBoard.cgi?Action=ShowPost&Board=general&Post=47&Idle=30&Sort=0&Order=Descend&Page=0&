<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I have responded to some posts now, and my responses have been pretty negative. Since I could not find a post that I had some positive comments to add to, I will start one.<br>
Everquest is really a great game. It's a masterwork of connectivity and multiplayer interaction. Verrant is really a good company. But the truth is, it's really a first of its kind. (ultima online people shut up, if you disgree with this point you didn't understand it.) Online RPGs and muds have been around forever, but nothing like everquest. Verrant did borrow from other games, blended the best ideas from one with the best ideas of anouther. In the end I think what they achieved is a foundation on which greater games will come. they laid the work for a new standard in online play, and I can't wait to see what games will come in the future with this standard in place.<br>
Truth be told everquest has its problems. Most of its problems are its players. We all have our own vision of what a game like this should have been, and not a one of us is 100% satisfied with everquest. Some of us however can't seem to play without out our feelings of its shortcommings affecting how we play.<p>

I made a lot of good friends in everquest, people I really liked. I met a lot of jerks in everquest, most of them were gms and guides. In the end the game got very crowded and I myself would prefer to play a less crowded game. (I do infact think the servers are overcrowded.) I did what I thought was responsible, I sent verrant an email explaining my point of veiw, and I stopped playing. If verrant aggrees with me and they have the time and effort maybe things will change and I will come back, maybe not. Here I point out again that many players feel the same way I do, but instead of leaving  like they should they linger on and on, causing striff and problems for others where ever they go.<p>

I hope everquest grows, I hope they add more servers. I hope they allow players to move characters from a crowded server to a not so crowded server.<br>
If they don't I wont come back to the game. And If I never come back I still hope that those of you who are left are happy with the game as it is.<p>

I felt it important since my other reply posts where so anger filled and negative to stress in a seperate post that I don't hate the game. I may hate some bad GMs, and I may hate some stupid players. But the game was good fun, but in the end I just felt it was to crowded and filled with to may bitter people. <br>
Many of you who read this will agree that as a whole it is a good game. everybody knows a bad player or two. (I knew 87 of them, I kept a list. =) Those of you who can go on playing without letting them bother you are the real players of the game, and I hope you find it more enchanting than I did. <br>
some of you however will respond to this message with anger and rage. I have a tip for you, pick on my spelling and grammer, thats what all the really good antagonists go for. If the game makes you that mad, seriously its time to play something else. Meet me in Half-life I will blast some anger out of your system!<br>
See I have respect for a good game, even if I myself no longer like it.<p>

Good luck all, and forgive my ramble.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Well since we lost a lot of replies on this post I am reposting mine so here it is...<p>

I agree that this game is excellent, but some of us are forced to camp for a crazy amount of time. I'm a 38 SK and I've been in Cazic Thule trying to get my quest armor for the last 4 WEEKS (8 lvls). Now thats a camp. <p>

It hasnt been all that bad cause there is some decent loot, great XP, and I have made a lot of great friends! Sure I got tired of it after being there for a while, but i took a short break killing Hill giants and headed back. CAMPING IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. I have had some of my best times camping there dealing with people I hate and fighting with people I would die for. I think its a blast calling all your friends to the Avatar room to try and win back that prized loot on the Avatar of Fear which a lvl 50 is trying to take from you )<br>
 <br>
Childish people will always be around that will totally piss you off (Killing your charmed friend grrr or letting a group member call in a lvl 50 friend to say that they are going to help and then KS, take the loot, then later give it to that person who called em because your group member didnt want to wait his turn to loot it and so on...) But hey wut are you gonna do. Remember there names and make sure you and your friends never do em any favors. In a game like this reputation is everything and once its smeared your screwed.<p>

Its all about good and evil! Thats what roleplaying is about! just remember just like in real life sometimes its hard to tell between good and evil; appearance isnt everything.( Just look at the friendly Boomba in Freeport that sells everyone pickles hehe). Maybe I'm looking at the game in to much of a RL situation but we have RL people playing with and against us.<br>
I do everything I can to be honorable in the game and if everyone played this way there would be no problems, but not all people are like this so if you want to play an on-line game, keep this in mind and realize just as in RL no one is perfect and everyone has there own personality good and bad. <p>

Yes it has it's probs, and yes there are improvements that can be done, but dammit, look what they have accompished already! Give it and them time, things will hash out, give them feedback, not mindless rantings. That is what is needed if this game is ever going to evolve to the point where it can keep a majority of it's customer base satisfied. This is my first ever post, and it took a decently honest post such as that to have me actually respond to one. I concur about guides and GM's...they need help and lessons in customer service, but what are we to do? Grin and bear it, and have a blast. And to all you out there not having fun, and being miserable, greedy bastards while you play.....GET OFF MY SERVER! Go play another game, do something else other than play EQ. I am so sick of people telling me where I can and cannot fight cuz they were on the "list" and I was not. Who cares? I payed my cash too, and I'm gonna play where I have fun, hee hee. Bottom line..if you aren't having fun, leave. That's what I do. See you in Norrath, I'll be the one laughing and having a great old time....<p>

I think Everquest is a great game; offcourse i also think some improvements could be made (like to some tradingskills), but overall it REALLY is a great game. But... <br>
The thing that is gonna kill my love of this game eventually is the social aspect of the game. (now everybody is gonna shout...well...go and play offline games then!)<br>
I think the social aspect off the game is in itself a noble and great thing but the problem imho is that there are to many little children playing this game. And because no-one can tell who is playing a char they feel themselves real big. Ok...even some kids are polite and social enough to play, but most of them feel so safe behind the computer and put all their real life frustration in this game.<br>
What they wouldnt dare to do in real life they are doing in everquest. Look at all the shouts and auctions by example.<br>
Dumbass is a word that scrolls over my journal very often.<br>
And this is the same problem with grouping, communication is tough with a frustrated 10 year-old.<br>
The game would be soo great without the dumbassword sliding over my journal, without harrassments because you just have no time to give sow to 25 people every hour (sow me...now!). I could go on and on...tell you off the girl that tried to force me to group with her...the kid that wanted me to boost her level 4 char...(and when i say wanted to i mean WANTED to) <br>
If just everyone could keep in mind that behind every char there is a real life person that wants to have fun in this game and politness isnt a bad thing, the game would be SMASHING GREAT!<p>

Phew..with this of my chest i am gonna shut up now and return to the game to play with some nice people and having lots of fun !<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I see EQ as the first massive online adventure game that is actually working.<br>
They pretty much got the technical basics down, but the world of Norrath is much too small, soulless and unrealistic for it to be a game that could truly make the old pencil and paper roleplaying games as we know them obsolete.<p>

What I see when I look at EQ is first and foremost tons of potential though I am not saying that the game doesn't work well within it's parameters.<p>

In the 'pretty near' future you will have online games in which;<br>
You will have a realistically evolving world with plants and animals that grow, die and decay.<br>
You will have NPC's that you can actually converse with on a multitude of topics.<br>
You will have civil politics rolling back and forth with nations warring eachother and where things and cities are destroyed and must actually be build back up or reconstructed for them to be real again.<br>
You will have orcs that get killed and will have to be replaced by orc kids that must be born and grow up again. (Probably in a much speedier tempo than real life however, but not nessecarily)<br>
You will have actual characters that make the magical items with whole metaphysical and philosophical systems to choose from in order to be able to do it.<br>
You will have dynamic religion in which gods will follow evolving personal agendas and divine powers will be connected to ie to which degree they are being worshipped.<br>
You will have worlds that are so big that wanting to cross an ocean will be a whole sailing adventure in itself, making waiting for the ship to Freeport seem like one dimentional timespark in comparison.<p>

I could go on..and on.<br>
These are all visions and some may take long to accomplish and some may be just around the corner. I personally don't care much if it is Verant or someone else that will contribute and provide with the realisation of these dreams, just so long as I get my parallell universe 8)<br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">How I really feel about EverQuest...<p>

An interesting question.  I like the game overall, and I've probably got another month or so of occasional play in me before I put in on the shelf for a while.  3 months is a pretty good showing for an MMORPG, based on my past experiences.  I have played most of the classes now, with a 11th level Cleric, 10th level Wizard, and everything except a Shadow Knight solidly under my belt for a few hours, at least.  Excellent technical work, a nicely detailed (if a bit small) setting, and a decent if uninspired game system behind it.  Unfortunately, it stresses one-dimensional character designs and an advancement system chained to the old D&D level/XP paradigm.<p>

Verant can be proud of their offering in several respects, I think, especially on the technical end.  Server lag is minimal, the graphics are excellent, if occasionally minimalist (look closely at a tree, for example), and the sound is good, especially certain sound effects (I love listening to skeletons fall apart!)<p>

I believe EQ has failed in at least one respect where UO did shine, however.  It conquered the technical difficulties that plagued Origin, but implemented a simplistic character design and development scheme, a fact which is, to me, even more annoying since they have the basic mechanics in place to move beyond it.  Individual skill scores, but tied to maximums based on experience level.  Individual skill selection, apparently strictly limited by initial choice of profession and race.  At least in D&D, you could multi-class.  Sigh.<p>

There are other gameplay issues I find annoying as well, but they are relatively trivial: creature warp, KSing and the associated tension between players which arises, the healing system (bandages priced at an average of 4 to 6 full meals?), the lack of a robust player-run trade system, cumbersome and frustrating NPC interaction (can you guess the precise phrasing the developer was looking for?), and the various rules subsystems which make helping newbies a development-stunting experience.<p>

EQ definitely builds on the ever-expanding MMORPG experience.  As the first truly 3-D MMORPG (at least that I am aware of), it shouldered an awesome technological challenge, and pulled it off quite well.  In the wider realm of MMORPGs, however, they failed to significantly improve on the deeper game model to any great degree, and even underperformed certain earlier offerings in some respects.  I look forward to watching the ongoing development of the game, to see whether (and how) these deeper issues are addressed. <p>

Overall, I would rate the game as a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Definitely a strong effort, and well worth exploration, especially for those new to the roleplaying experience.<p>

My opinion, for what it's worth...<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Great game, my only problem is the feeling that it has become one big auction. The goals set for a character are so limited. Everyone wants to be lvl 50 and have cool stuff and lots of money. A dynamic social structure controlled by the players would make this game so much better. Politics, more wars, revolutions and such.<p>

Asheron's Call took advantage of this and created a game in Everquests image with some great components(it's still a crappy game).<br>
 <br>
Everquest's technical aspects and overall gameplay blow everyone else out of the water.<br>
But if they want it to be an RPG give us something to Role play for.<br>
I want to be the king of Norrath, let someone have the chance, then let me kill them.<p>
