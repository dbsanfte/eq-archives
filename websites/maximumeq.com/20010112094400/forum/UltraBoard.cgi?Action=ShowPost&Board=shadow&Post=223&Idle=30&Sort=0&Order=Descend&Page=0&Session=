<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Ok.  We all know how many people whine about harm touch.  And we all know that everyone who plays a Shadowknight wants to see it changed so that it is better.  But face it; harmtouch will not be changed.  So why doesn't everyone figure out what is good about it and use it for that.  I'd like to see comments on here about how SKs kick butt even without harmtouch or how harmtouch has worked well.  I'd personally play one even if we didn't have harmtouch at all.  So I see harm touch as an extra kick-butt attack.  One experience I've had is in highhold when I was level 20.  I was camping the named Gnoll for a couple hours and some level 38 warior came along to take it.  I got worried but didn't lose hope.   I thought about fearing etc but thought that I might just pull some nasty train or send it to a guard.  So when it finially spawned I cast darkness, sent my pet on it and started beating.  I waited until it was at about half life then Harm touched (He thought I was just another warrior.  lol.  I alwalys have /rol on)  The harmtouch took a quarter life off it and I was well on my way to getting the kill.  He was pissed that a green con got the kill from him.  So at that moment I was very pleased with my harmtouch.  I have also used it countless times to taunt and enimy off a friend.  I've used it in duels and it rocks.  It has a casting time of 0 which rocks!  It is one of the best DD spells and casting time of 0.  Wouldn't that be unbalanced if we could use it more than once every game day?  I know this message board is going to get filled with a million idiots saying how HT sucks but I'd prefer not to hear from you.  Ok here is an example of why increasing the damage on ht would be the dumbest thing they could do.  If the damage was increased that would mean a SK could instantly kill any caster at the same level.  And if it was the same as a paladins LH than it could just about get any class!  Now that would be unbalanced!  I think we can use it enough (about every hour and a half)  It kicks butt even in the 30's so it would be unfair to use it more than that.  I think it's annoying that people want it upgraded just so they can solo yellows.  The vamperic idea everyone says isn't horrible but can't you already see SKs are as good as any onther class in their own way.  Who cares if HT isn't as powerful as LH.  Shadow Knights ARE just as powerful as paladins.  If HT was upgraded then wouldn't you have to argue that rangers need something equally as powerful.  That's just lame.  Rangers have their own abilities just like SKs and Pallys.  So lets hear all those good stories about HT which are rarely heard because usually only the mad people post on here.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Whoever posted this above post is a complete idiot and needs taken out and tortured.  Our harm touch is usefull but it doesn't quite satisfy the requirements that verant had made it for.  We are the anti pallidians right, well make our dmg equal to their heal p.  You don't know what you are talking about, whining, come on man, have you ever been to befallen, you will notice the mistakes verant has made on us sk's.  A very low green con sk used his harm touch on me, it stuck.  Yes i was 20 lvls higher than him and his harm touch stuck.  Our harm touch get's resisted by mob's 2 lvls higher, yet this npc shadowknight had his harm touch go for his max dmg against me , 20 lvls higher.  Well i petitioned this and got a strange response from a gm.  The gm said becuase i worship an evil god that these things happen.  WTF.  I am evil so verant has the right to screw me???  This is total and utterly ignorant.  I do think shadowknights are a powerful class, but they aren't as powerful as they were intended to be.  When swinging my dark reaver, which 2h is maxed, I miss sometimes 4 out of 5 swings, when a warr hardly misses.  Maybe this is also because i worship an evil god, who knows?  Well let me just end with this, before you put a post up saying harm touch is fine, maybe you should play a shadowknight. If you have played one or have one then you are just ignorant for not finding the various faults that verant has made in the creation of the shadowknight class.  You ksed from a lvl 38 warr when you were lvl 20 and you were soloing this named orc, BS.  The named orc still cons blue to me at lvl 28 there is no way you were soloing this orc and got the kill from the warr, LOL get a life man.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Lets just say the vast majority of Shadow Knights past lvl 30 truely believe that HT is greatly underpowered.  Even if HT only did 100 dmg at lvl 40 some people would think that was just fine with them.  I'm not calling anyone stupid... however if you like the fact that the ONLY class defining SKILL that we get is Harm Touch and its weak.  Well my fellow Shadow Knights... I really feel sorry for ya if you think that doing only 10 to 15% total damage to a BLUE con mob is just fine  (Once a game day).  To be quite honest I believe it would be more enjoyable to be able to at least do 50% of the total dmg to a High Blue MOB.  Would that make or break the class....Nope...in fact if they took HT away we really wouldnt miss it that much, since we only use it once per day.<p>

Another gripe with HT is the change in % dmg done to the MOB changes (Lowers) in the higher lvls past lvl 30.  Which basically makes it much less useful. <p>

I want to say that I do love playing my Dark Elf Shadow Knight and the spells and HT resistance makes the class more challenging to play.  <p>

Yet we do lack a decent class defining skill in our weak Harm Touch.  Especially considering that most caster classes around lvl 45 can easily out blast our once a day SKILL in one quick dd spell.  40th lvl Necro's for example get a 2000 HP DoT.....compare that to a 40 SK once a day DD skill of 401 dmg....and it is a very weak class skill indead.<p>

Finally the class comparison.  Paladin and the Anti-Paladin (Shadow Knight) 25/lvl LOH and 10/lvl HT  (with some slight increase at higher lvls).  In my opinion this was completely arbitrary and should be improved on the HT side to be at least 20dmg/lvl.<br>
801dmg at lvl 40<br>
Will you solo a yellow con MOB ?  <br>
Hell no<br>
Will this improvement make you all powerful?<br>
Not against 2000 to 8000 HP MOBS<br>
What about PvP?  <br>
Nerf it to half dmg in PvP....Thats not why we want it improved in the first place.. We dont need it for PvP we need it to fight MOBS<p>

Sorry for the long rant....but I said my peace<p>

Well he did say a lvl 38 warrior and there is no chance in hell a lvl 20 sk could KS a lvl 38 warrior, but then again I do agree that HT is good as it is. My main is a warrior but i play a sk too and i must say that sk is a fun class to play. And to the above tread saying that sk s miss and warriors dont lol. Warriors miss too, all melee classes miss a lot (at least when fighting high blues+. You whine about your HT, but you dont think about the fact that you have almost the same combat skills and HP as a warrior, and on top of that u have a bunch of nice utility spells (making ur life easier). HT is "a fun extra" not a reverse heal. If u want to unbalance the game, why dont you write to Verant and ask if they let you play a Dragon?? I must say that I like the classes as they are (well maybe the cleric could get some boost to make them a more attractive class to play). On the warrior boards people ask why most of their crit hits are for less damage than their normal hits...(that is a good question according to me). HT is just fine as it is and it still has it uses. <br>

HT is sometimes usefull, has saved my life or a friends life before but i agree it's kinda shamefull to have to say HT is our class defining skill.  The only good thing about it as that ALL casters are scared to duel a SK just because of it, but they shouldn't, if they have good resistance they will probably resist most of it anyway and their dd spells will just kick the crap out of us.  I mean come on, 301 dmg at lvl 30, once per day?  401 dmg at lvl 40???  That is so little damage while fighing a mob that has thousands of hp, plus yellows usually resist half of it anyway!!  YEAY, HT did 150 dmg on a lvl 32 mob!  I can do that just by swinging my sword a few times...  ok, we have this very very weak pet to help making damage as well, but i'd be scared to duel my archnemesis Pally cuz i know they can fully heal themselves when almost dead and i'll have to start killing them all over again, when i'll be almost dead myself... <br>
I doubt Verant will change it, perhaps cuz we could then duel a caster and almost kill him in one shot, but it could be changed to only have greater damage against mobs...<br>
Anyway, i still love my SK and could not imagine playing any other class<br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Ok ive seen enough SK to Paly comparisons that im beggining to be sick.  Ya HT does not live up to its supposed reputation.  Seems like you all expect a lil much from it.  HT has very practical uses in the game at any level and i belive that no one will deny that.  Now to look at other aspects that are over looked...first off we have a pet.  Pet is usless is an argument to this, my reply is yes it is usless in the "normal" pet usage.  If you try to let it tank for you then you are doing this in error.  An SK pet is quite possibly the most mana efficient DOT spell in the game.  Turn off the pets taunt and rock n roll with it.  Then if things turn grim while you run your pet will take a few hits so you can get a running start.  Couple this with the fact we can pile on 3 DOT spells on something at later levels and you have one nasty tank indeed.  Ok harm touch dosent suck half the life from black coned baddies later on, one hit at 1/4-1/5 life aint anything to laugh at.  Just stop thinking of it as a last resort and you'll enjoy it much more.  Sure its not like LoH but we are also not much like paladins even though we are deemed their  counterparts.  This is conceptually true but in the way we deal with things it is very wrong for we fight much differently then any pally.  And for those complaining about the pally/SK duel feature...try saveing your HT to interupt his LoH.  takes timeing but its possible...ok ive rambled enough<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Lol.  Well those of you who think a level 20 sk can KS that gnoll from a 38 warrior aren't too bright.  Think about it.  That gnoll only has about 600 hp's.  If the shadowknight got his HT off (It should have been blue to him at 20) that takes it down 200 pts.  Then all the Sk has to do is 100 hps damage in the time the level 38 does 300.  Though it isn't a sure win it deffinatly seems possable.  At 20 I was double attacking for 40s and I see high 30 warriors double attacking for 60s.  And for harm touch...  Well it isn't bad but not great either.  But those of you who think is should do as much as a paladin...  get a clue.  You deffinatly have never been a gm for a game before.  Once per day an instant kill!  Yeah right you are dreaming.  As for it being our defining ability, so you think it should kick ass, well what do rangers get for a defining ability...  a quest spell at level 50 that most people seem to complain about as well?  Would you rather have that?  I think doing 10-15% damage once per day is quite nice.  But when you get higher it doesn't even do that.  Why the hell would doing 50% damage per game day make the game balanced?  I agree that our measly 500 at level 50 sucks and wish that it would be more worthwhile.  Adding too much damage to it would make it overpowered though.  They could add a weakness ability to it that debuffs or slows attacks or the vampiric drain at later levels.  But it's not changing as peeople said.  We SKs are already quite powerful and need no improvements and to tell the truth I think improving HT would make us too powerful.  Though it sucks a kick ass ability would make us dominate.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

WHO CARES, my butt has been save a bunch by HT. So to all you whiners out there, if you don't like it go play another character. SK's kick ass, I mean come on, heres a list; we aren't as good at melee as warriors but can they cast spells and have a pet, no; we aren't as good at casting as a pure caster but we can still cast some spells back at them and we can kick there butts physically; I didn't even mention HT. so we can melee, if we have a shield we can bash, we can cast, we can have a pet, and we can HT. that's pretty awesome in my book, remember when you created your sk it said this was rated difficult compared to the others.<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Good point Caza.  I have no particular stories to tell but my HT has come in handy many times.  No I can't solo Yellows or reds but sometimes I've pulled two light blues that can give me trouble.  If they get the upper hand (I miss a few times or do something wrong) I pull out my HT and I'm doing good again.  Most classes don't have that extra help (aside from the paladin).  If a warrior gets behind in battle they just pray or hope they can make it to zone.  I'd have to say that every time I play my HT saves at least one persons life.  Oh... the other day I hit a slightly red con with a full HT (Named cyclops).  I didn't think it would work but it did.  I'm sure that's 1 in 100 because I've probably had 100 totally resisted red cons...  But it did happen.  Saved me and my ranger friends life.  I've been very impressed with my SK.  We really have an awsome assortment of spells and my pet makes up for a warriors kick.  Besides I want to keep both my feet on the ground so I can pay more attention to dodging their attacks  &lt;smile&gt;.

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Cloen, my hat is off to you mate.  And here's why.  Because all of those sorry saps who whine and complain and hurl insults at Verant are missing the point.  You had FUN.  How gratifying was it to keep control of the kill on that mob ?  Im sure that you had a grin from ear to ear and were laughing your balls off bro.  Good Game.<p>

All those numbers that everyone posted are worthless.  SK were not designed to be masters of damage.  Their HT was not intended to put them on par with a monk or Rogue.  Why would you think that ?  SK planar armor has the same AC as Paladins, so they are tied for the second highest.  They can heal themselves whilst still damaging the enemy.  Dot's that debuff the enemy.  Pet, pet and did i mention that they have a pet ?<p>

SK are TANKS.  They are not casters, they are not healers.  THey are the masters though at just being plain badass.  Feign death ?  are you kidding me ?  how damned good is that spell ?  pulling, clearing agro in a fight.....wow.<p>

You might think that this post had nothing to do with HT, but it does.  I will side with Verant on this issue for the first time in my life.  Balance.  Have any of you ever seen an SK with a cloak of flames and a YK outdamage a warrior ?  I have.  Have any of you ever camped the fishbone earing ?  My SK stole that kill before the guy even spawned. ZERO cast time.  What about the Ancient Cyclops ?  KSed again.  Did you guys see me duel that enchanter ?  oh yeah, i harmed him down so fast, resisted so many of his spells and his pet couldnt do shit to me cause of my AC and the fact that his sword and shield was fleeing in terror that the duel ended in under a minute...and he certainly didnt flee due to him being snared.<p>

If anyone would like to try to pull the plane of hate or fear with a warrior or a paladin, by all means, get the group killed.  BUt frankly, if you ever want something accomplished, call in your local SK and get the job done, because THAT ladies and gentleman , is where the true beauty of an SK becomes readily apparent.<p>

TO all of you who disagreed with CLoen, children, open your eyes.  Dont be so damned narrow minded about the HT.  No shit you dont do damage to a mob that has 4k + hitpoints.  WHy are you so surprised ?  it's just simple mathematics as some joker pointed out earlier.<p>

You will flame me im sure for not stating my name, but i will tell you this.  I have played all three tank classes.  War, SK and Pally, and far and away the most versatile was the SK.  very simple.  this game is about adaptation and accessability.  Bread and butter of the Sk class.<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Cloen, I would just like to say that it was nice to see someone try to have a good thing to say about Harm Touch and the Shadow Knight.  I was just sorry to have to read all the trash and flames to find the true stories you asked for.  <p>

The more I read these boards, the more I come to believe that the Shadow Knight is not for the average player.  The spells and skills available to you provide for some interesting tatical posibilities.  If people would quit trying to kill with harm touch and explore these posibilities, there would be more good stories for you to read.  (Note: Harm Touch is not the defining skill of the Shadow Knight, it is only one skill.)<p>

Anyway, here are a couple of stories.<p>

Being a level 34 Shadow Knight and wanting the Darkforge armor I spend some time in Cazic camping the Crusaders.  The group I was in was in the middle of a group change and somehow only 3 of us ended up in Upper Tae when a Judicator spawned.  I quick kill was desired so the caster started dropping the DDs and promptly started getting attacked.  A couple lucky hits with my sword and a full damage harm touch and it was on me allowing the caster to get off that all critical heal stopping DD.  We won the fight as additional spawns came up and party members started to arrive.  I like to think that this was a case where 'harm touch' and not 'lay hands' was called for to save the day.<p>

Now I do not count on harm touch allowing me to slay things out of my range, but when a rare comes up and has one of those nice drops it can be very tempting to try.  Was in South Karana when the druid with the Bark Shield ran by while crossing the zone invis.  Was just too tempting and without thinking I started to cast the first of 2 dots.  Got the first to stick and decided to close and not waist time on the second.  Was taking a real beating but was trying to get her down into harm touch range.  Well it was getting close so I fired off the harm touch.  In this case it was not enough so I promply casted feign death.  I may have lost the fight, but I was able to give it a try and did not die.  Now you could say I should have one, but hey them Druids use fire and us trolls burn easy.<p>

I hope these stories are what you are looking for.<hr>Bluud Wyrmbait<br>

Harm touch is niiiice.  Rather than bitch about it not nuking as much damage (in proportion) look at its new useful side.  Breaking the lord spawn in lguk?  Got that wiz blasting away on you, NUKE HIS ASS!  I do 441 dmg at lvl 42 (lvl 41 and up you get more than 10 x lvl plus 1) 441 dmg is nice on a caster, period.  Also this business of resists....use HT wisely, and you won't have an issue with resists.  Don't open a fight with harm touch, you will likely get a partial resist.  Don't harm touch mob's that are very-red cons (unless you're about to die anyway).  It comes down to this....a lvl 40 wiz is nuking for like 380, i was nuking for 401, so for that 1 time in 90 minutes emergency situation, yeh, it rocks.  Would it be nice for them to up the dmg on HT in a non-pvp situation, yes, i'd dig it, and i'm all for it.  Will it happen?...No.  They've said no before, they've said no again, and i'm sure they'll say no in the future.  Do you NEED HT's power upped....if so you are doing something wrong.<p>

ALSO!! To the jackass who responded to the first post with an immature flame, just go away.  I've anti-ks'd with harm touch more times than i can count, and i could solo any gnoll in highpass by lvl 20.  To the guy that kept the warrior from snatching the named, saweet, fun to strut your stuff isn't it :)  .<p>

Angur<p>

also i've changed my mind, anyone who wants a more in depth dissertation on harm touch, post here i'll get more technical for ya.  I've got over 90 lvls of shadowknight covered, on 4 servers.  Highest is a 43 TSK that i'm currently playing, and "I DIG THAT"</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

What other class can deal hundred of point of damage, 0 cast time, while swinging their weapon? We have many tools at our disposal. If SK was nothing but a weakened warrior with HT, I would agree that it would be weak. In the lower levels, it's power is incredible. As you get up in levels, it changes its role. <p>

You find a named mob, dot, dot, pet, hack, fear, dot, hack, ht, dot, dot, etc. This is extremely powerful! I think people want their ht to just be the death touch where I can pull a SG (I am 37-38) and hack it a little and kill it with ht when it has 1/2 life left. THAT is too powerful. If anything, I would like to see HT recharge faster, but I am not complaining.<p>

HT is not an entire class defining ability. Dont treat it as such. Discussing LoH vs HT is apple to oranges. We are NOT anti-paladins. We are shadow knights...</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

HT is NOT necessary.  how many people use HT every time its free? i sure dont.  i usually use HT for when i pk (i play on vallon zek) and i never need to use it when fighting NPCs.  i can EASILY solo some yellow NPC's, like deathsinger.  he is yellow to me, and i can kite him all around innothule, and get him down to 1/2 health without being touched.  or, i can melee him the entire time, and still beat his arse.  SKs are a great class, and it seems like not many of you know how to play them.  i suggest choosing another class for most people on this board, one that doesn't take time or effort.  make a druid.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

pet tries to hit me. damn obsorbing shield. <br>
pet gets hit for 22 damage by my damage shields. (OH WAIT NO PETS IN THE ARENA)<p>

thats right scenario 2. (in arena)<br>
you try to break my obsorbing shield and cant. your hit for 22 damage. <br>
you try again. cant 22 damage again. <p>

i recast obsorbing shield to make it fresh. <br>
you DA me your hit for 44 damage. <p>

i stick a dot on you.  recast shield. you will never win. not to mention my 80 magic resistance on your low level spells. an sk of my level can do about 300 damage with a full HT. though with my 80 magic resistance i doubt it would be a full hit. so i still have 400hps left anyway. <p>

OR we could go outside. and use pets. i buff my pet to holy hell give him a damage shield and obsorbing shield. i mez you have him kill your pet and then root you. dot you nuke you med. reroot. slow you down debuff you like mad. have my pet beat you down. maybe recast damage shields. not to mention your HT in a duel doesnt do full damage. ROFL come on now. tanks are so easy to beat. <p>

oh yah. if we are in the arena. i just might charm a blue tank to beat you down while i med =)</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

I can have 147 magic resist with full magic resist gear on with a decent 120STR. (PVP dun need AC unless u r fighting melee class... just dump all the point into resist and STR... a bit of dex for proc weapon...our magic resist based is 30... so making high resist is not a probelm if u have money to buy good resist gear)....Aaein, try to debuff me, even ur tashan with 40 MR down, I still have 100+ magic resist and keep debuff me u will run out of mana fast. I will start a small dot on me before fighting so u can not be able to mes me well... a pumice stone on u...poop... all ur buff gone including damage shield and clarity. Well... it is welcome u to annual me though... even all buff are gone... i still have avantages over u for blunt melee. I dun really depends on my spell but with my yaki 2 h sword, I can chop u with 100+ per damage and vampire vambrace to suck ur blood and the yeksha effect proc u for 80+. I am erudtie sk, I have plenty of mana to lifetap u for healing.  Darkness ur pet so I can charge to u easily. Dakrness will snare u down. If ur magic resist is too high, i will just use melee down with my jboot on. Ur 800 HP I just need to chop u 8 times. Any double attack goes off to ya, i just need 4 or 5 chops to make u a bloodball meat. Ur damage shield? ROFL!!! damage shield wont work well to heavy punch 2 h weapon. I have jboot.... I have 5 pumice stone in bank for pvp purpose while I normally bring all of them if i have a pvp coming. To fight an enchanter, u just need to buff up all your magic resist. No fire, cold, poison or disease resist...JUST MAGIC RESIST!!(Their tashani mr debuff is poison based though... who cares if u have 147 MR while he can MR debuff u but u still have 100+ MR....however u make their life hader, u can trade ur str to poison resist... make sure ur str still have at least 100 so that u can still give them a heavy punch... a good 2 h sword or mace is crucial) it is easy to get that stat if you are pally or SK. (well...king thex crown is a good one :) and jewels!!) Go to the gear page and find all the magic resist gear. HT is used if the enchanter start gating or before reaching the zoneline. And hope it can stop their escape... and believe me, it is normally do hehehe coz when they gating or wanna zone, normally u r chasing them coz they have low HP :) They still scare of ur HT when their half life is gone. <p>

A druid, wizard, mage is harder for us though. As durid and wizard has ice, lighting, fire attack which we cannot buff all into 100+. To fight an enchanter, u just need to have good equipment to fight him. ROFL, Aaein, don't think about you can best anyone coz u r the best pvp class. MR resist Pally and SK is ur worst nightmare. Aaein, u loser!! May the harm touch always on your head!! muahahahahahahahaha</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I think there is a big problem with the understanding of a Shadow Knight.<br>
Almost everybody compares HT with LH and that is sooooo... wrong.<br>
I have to be honest I have little experience playing SKs and the first ten levels are quite dragging,<br>
but I have played Pallies to higher levels. <br>
Harm Touch is a life saver as well as LH and so far I was fighting all the stuff in Nektulos and <br>
HT saved my life I don't know how often. It is just a question when to use it.<br>
I allways use it in the (almost) last moment (when my life hits 1 1/2 bubs) I HT the bear who is from<br>
dragged out fighting in his 50%s, after the HT he is either dead or so damaged that I can finish him off<br>
Once I also managed to run away (when the bear was close to death, but I could't finish him off) but the <br>
HT made him slow enough to not get even close to me.<br>
But HT is not the main best feature of an SK. <br>
1.I think the best features are DOING casting and serious mele damage and lifetap (heal)<br>
Any other hybrid class can pack and go home on that combo. <br>
2.You get a pet and just having a friend arround when a warrior and a pally gets lonely is cool.<br>
3.You have all the options with a SK and I had the greatest fun playing her.<br>
4.When ever you get into the "good" parts of norath people look at you with 10 times more respect than at a Pally.<br>
5.And its much easier to outsmart MOBs much easier than as a Smashin-Bashin-Warrior-type which makes it much more fun <br>
than just hitting one button and wait till that thing in front of you falls.<p>

Sorry for the little Excurse here, but once and for all if you don't like HT and SKs then play a stupid Warrior<br>
it might match your intelligence level.<hr>Terrora <br>

When fighting a MOB who heals, once you whack them down to about one third HP,if you time it right you can HT them to death before they can heal again. (I have been in groups that have had to whack a MOB down to one third health three times or more!) Sure it's better if you have casters to nuke the MOB when it's low, bit sometimes you have no casters, they are OOM, or worse, they are being whacked on.  Then HT is a 340 point insta-nuke to finish off a pesky healing MOB.<p>

The other useful time is when a MOB is fleeing.  Say you've left your party to chase down the MOB so it doesn't retuen with friends.  You know your non-tanks are likely having to deal with other MOBs back at the pull spot, and you have to get back fast.  Worse, if you chase the fleeing MOB much farther, he's gonna find a buddy.  So harm touch him to death and get back to your group ASAP.<p>

HT can also be used as a maga-taunt, or it is handy as a last blast to finish a weakened MOB so you can get over and start taunting/tanking the MOB currently beating up your healer.<br>
  <br>
Yes - you can only do this once avery hour and a half, but HT is very handy to have when breaking a spawn or when several mobs show up uninvited and your group is stil in recovery mode.<hr>Falkko<br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Verant in it's infinite wisdom, has nerfed the hybrid classes in order to make pure casters and melee'ers appealing. Its that simple. But in doing so, the SK's bore the larger brunt of the nerfing. To anyone who things Harm Touch is weak, your wrong! It is a powerful tool, but it must be used too sparingly as it's a once a day charge. If it can't be vamped to match the Pally's Lay Hands (And I don't think it should!) then it should at least be a once each HALF day charge. Why? Contrary to the opinion above where someone said we SK's are almost like warriors in our skills, we are NOT!!! We NEVER get duel wield, only get Double attack at 20 (5 levels past when warriors get it), I just heard we can NEVER get critical hits regardless of strength or level, and our spells that supposedly give us an edge are probably about the same as necro's half our level. Pet? Lame! No means a tank, but I agree on someone's comparison to it being a decent DoT with 'taunt off'. And unless we butcher our stats at creation, we do NOT have the hit points of warriors! This is because we have to make sure to annie up some of those extra points into intelligence so that our casting works well! Unless someone screws up creating a warrior, they will not concern themselves with beefing up that stat! And are you all aware that hybrid classes take an XP nerf? That's right! On a level to level comparison, SK's get less XP killing a MoB than non-hybrid classes. All that said, I'd take the nerfed SK over a warrior anyday, as the personality of an evil, anti-paladin, along with the lame, but still extra casting ability, as well as the lame pet and the once a day Harm Touch, all combine to quite a fun package to operate in an RPG! So while I do point out the pitfalls, I am aware of the advantages! And by the way, all the players I know in the upper (+40) levels, seem to all agree that they'd prefer having an SK over a Pally in their group anyday, because of the versatility the SK brings! So enjoy!<p>

... No way no how will the effect of HT lead to significant diff. upon higher/major mobs in dealing dmg. aside from haveing the ability say when your chanter is unable to get his/her mez cast off BOOM !! ht the critter and enable your chanty pal to redo his/her werk while the baddie is beatin you... or clearin for FG/Nag. raid and shucks druid fergot to snare or was resisted and that damn LDC start heel-toein it to stone room to gather help, BOOM!! dead spider or greatly weakend to a crawling pace where melee will kill it shortly after.<p>

... disregard or accept as u will, no matter to me... i enjoy groupin with any other tank class immencely cause being able to trade off orrig. taunt skill with another makes for easy times.<p>

I would see 81 dmg to blues and 131 dmg to greens when HT was used.  My int has been increased through magic items and is at 127.  HT in my opinion might be better served in changing the spell to a group effect for the same damage.  SK's will then be more wanted in groups when HT is charged. It does not help us much in soloing as we still couldn't take on two blacks at the same time, but could help with blues in some cases.  I had to use HT on lava Snakes as those blues kicked my ass, so soloing would be about the same as it is now.

I am now 10 levels older and I still can only agree with people who like HT. Reasons again.<br>
1. Finish off one when you little overpowered and kill the rest without sweat.<br>
2. TAUNT .. ultra important .. when a warrior stand behind the mob beating the cleric screming I cant get him off...<br>
and the cleric screams TAUNT TAUNT TAUNT.. I go BAAAM warrior looks stupid and all survive cause the cleric lives.<br>
3. Get rid of some casters and healers.. orc medics and stuff.. beatem down to 30% and then BAAAM usually does it.<p>

And when you need LOH as a SK just smile at a Pally and they lay all hands they have on you. (Like yesterday when I trained the whole upper GUK zone ... KOS and L20 ... got me shin greaves... survived thanks to Firestarter)<hr>Terrora <br>

 first lets look at what he is saying, He is soloing the named gnoll. Anyone who has ever camped him knows that there are three gnoll that spawn there. Now how you are soloing there when the named gnoll is around level 20 himself and those brawlers are around the same level is beyond me. Maybe you mean you where there trying to KS the 38 warrior who was there that might have been it.<p>

Second you said he thought you where another warrior. heehee thats kinda funny you said you sent yer pet in on the mob. I dont ever remember seeing a warrior with a pet do you?<p>

And third a level 38 warrior would be able to steal anything he wanted from you even if you had 3 HT to use. they hit for an ungodly amount and crit for even higher. And I am sorry to say your little swing of 30 points is not going to outdamage his double attacks of 70 points ad thats without his 150 point crits added in.<p>

Just a little input about how stupid your post is.<p>

I said this before when someone said he couldn't have taken the named gnoll.  I remember fighting in HH and fighting there at 20 seems fine to me.  Most of the other gnolls are 16 so someone could easily solo there around 20 with only 3 spawns...  And about taking the named gnoll from a warrior.  Think  about it...  If the gnoll was even to the warrior there would be no way.  But SKs can easily take something even or lower to them from a warior.  The gnoll probably doesn't have more then 600hps.  His HT would do 1/3 of that (201 points)already.  Now a level 20SK can do 100 points of damage in the time a 32 can to something like that.  Not saying it's a guarentee or anything but you're a fool and underestimate some people if you think it can't be done.  <p>

P.S. And saying he couldn't take it with 3HTs is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  That should instantly kill the gnoll.  Take a math class and add it up.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

9: Saves your ass. <p>

<br>
Thats what its for. Cloen RIGHT on bro. You guys see  HT isnt for hunting, it aint for KSing (but its fun and funny as hell when u use it for KSing);P Well its suposed to be there to help u out in times when your in trouble. And if your soloing something that it will have no effect on your a dumbass. Your suposed to be in a group. At lvl 52 my shadknight  would rarely solo. It just comes to the point where you cant solo at around lvl 35-40 you cant solo every mob thats gonna give u exp.(u might just need one more person but you still cant solo) Harmtouch is in a group when you need it is a last hit or your groups gonna die, or your healer or nuker did too much damage and has this big ass mob kicking the shit out of him, at that point u use HT as a taunt. So Dont Rag that. HT is Fine. And it doesnt need anything. A few more Damage points per level would kick ass. but were fine. Ah the beauty of SK's soloing was great but were for groups eventualy. Time to end my rambling that I'm typing as I think it. In conclusion DONT COMPLAIN, SK's HAVE IT KICK ASS as it is, oh yeh we could kick the shit out of any enchanter or magician in my opinion.<hr>Xuzk.<br>
