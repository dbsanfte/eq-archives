<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok, the first day I decided to try this quest I sat in the tower for 4 hours before the watchman decided to show his self to me.  I hailed him, collected my box, and proceded to go out and kill tiny Skels.  I have to warn you all that haven't done this quest that you should let everyone in the zone know what the skeletons are and what they are for before you make them spawn.  I collected 3 remains and was runnin for a fourth that someone shouted out that they killed.  By time I made it to where he said he killed it he said he looted the remains and then proceeded to ask me what it was for, the nerve of some people, ruining your chances to complete a quest and then asking what it's for.  I couldn't find any of the others that supposedly had spawned so I ran back to the watchman beings I heard you can make more skels spawn if you tell him "I am a brave fighter" again.  To my dismay I returned to the bridge only to see a high level punk killing the watchman!  It's now been 5 days since I have started this quest, I could of been done with it 4 days ago but it seems to many damn inconsiderate people are in NK at one time...<BR>
<BR>
I did try the mule tactic with hailing the fighters guild leader and initiating the quest on the first night and the watchman spawned within the next 4 hours.  I am going to follow up on that to see if that makes a difference beings I am getting tired of sitting in the tower for 8-10 hours waiting for this beavis to spawn.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>it sucks to be you trist<BR>
first i want to say that if you dont want to read this(its long) just skip over and PLEASE no flames<BR>
<BR>
anyway i was with a ranger buddy hunting in NK one night when i got jumped by a skeleton as i was medding. then i thought "skellies? in NK?" when i got up to look for the bastard who most rudely interupted my medding (the nerve) i couldnt see him. "hmm methinks this no ordinary invisible skeleton" i thought. then i went to try and sit back down wehn i saw the little bugger. MY GOD ARE THEY TINY! since they were blue i decided to kill it (without full mana) and i was shocked to find out 10 castings of Ignite left him with a large amount of hps. NOTE they DO have an ass load of hps, tho i didnt get hit very much (dodge level 65) and i was an AC challenged druid. "HMM meSURE this no ordinary tiny skellie" i thought. i meleed him for a bubble and a half of hps to finish him off. then i looted his corpse at which point my ranger buddy became quite intersted. i thought they were for the speed increasing boots (journeyman) so i figuered i wouldnt need em (sow). SO, i helped my ranger buddy track and kill the remaining skel and brought him to the spawn point of the gnome. we both got boxes and set off. after some gruesome combat (the worst of which was fighting off the KSers, the nerve) we both had three bones each. i decided to med and told my ranger buddy to go get more to spawn (hopefully). he comes back with some bads news. "he wasnt there man, this sucks". my heart sank. I didnt really NEED the boots ( which i still thought were speed increasing) and he very much did. i apologized many times and he surprisingly shrugged it off. "what a great guy" i thought. so we hunt some more and kill  some scythe beeltes (good exp for 17-19) when he tells me that he had four tiny bone chips. "really, i feel better now" i said. it was at this point when i became suspicious. "just so you know," i said," you have to combine them in the box and hand them back to the guy the next time he spawns" i was a little peeved for being lied to, but, after all, i still thought they were for speed boots. anyway to make this story shorter (i hear you all cheering) he tells me that not only did he already turn in the box, got his reward to take back to akkanon, BUT he KNEW that succeding would despawn the gnome. "GRR betrayed by my own ranger buddy" i thought. but i was cursed with a compassionate heart and forgave him and told him id gladly group with him again (though i will always be suspicious..........)<BR>
meanwhile im shafted out of the boots, but have 3 chips for the next time he spawns<BR>
<BR>
I apologize to all of you fact searchers out there but here is what i am pretty damn sure about:<BR>
1 turning in the box o skells DOES despawn the gnome<BR>
2 you do have to have a semi good faction with the gnomes<BR>
3 you NEED TRACKING, seeing the skells is very difficult due to their size, plus they scatter (and everyone tries to kill them)<BR>
4 TRUST NO ONE<BR>
<BR>
again i apologize for the length and if i am repeating some of the facts about this quest, but there is too much Power Gaming and the roleplaying part of this role playing adventure game is very much overlooked<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I've waited on many occations for Dexlin to spawn after having a run in with him my first time but not having enough faction. So i make it a habit to stop by when i'm in the area. I had camped in the tower in front of Bilbis and when i logged one morning Dexlin was there. I went through the whole process and it was fairly easy as i am a 25 ranger and could track the skele's. Needless to say i believe i was just lucky to finally catch Dexlin there.<BR>
    Anyway. I got my boots and am very happy. (They look great with silver-plated leggings by the way)<BR>
    I was traveling through NK when camo wore off and one of the Giants - Froon Choon Proon, whoever - started frumping on me. I was down to 2 bubbles of health with about only half the zone crossed when i decided to use my only charge of sow. I escaped and here i am. Well at least i now know that sow is NOT UNLIMITED. Whether you can recharge or not i dont know. I hope so. I hope this helps.</font></td></tr></table>
