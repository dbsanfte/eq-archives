While we are swapping roulette stories, I was at a table once that had 00 three times in a row.  Talk about crazy odds...</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;My point to this, is that nobody should have to camp this long for an item and not get it. Its just wrong. It shouldn't happen. Your random programming is terrible.
Ive had people say that they've gotten 3 cowls in a row, while others have never seen it.<BR>
</font>
I once read about a streak on a roulette table at a casino. The number came up black something like 37 times in a row. People started beting heavily on red after about the 10th straight black, and the bets kept increasing with each spin. <BR>
<BR>
The point I'm making is that in a random system (or even a simulated random system such as any electronically based system will be), past results in no way influence the present. Each spin of that roulette wheel still gives a 18 out of 38 chance that the number will be black, and 18 out of 38 chance that the number will be red, and a 2 out of 38 chance that the number will be green, regardless what came up on the spin below.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Every time a named mob doesn't spawn, the % chance for it to spawn next time goes up. This keeps happening till it spawns. And if it spawns with the common loot, then the % chance that it'll drop with the rare loot goes up for the next time it spawns. Once it spawns, the % of it spawning goes back to normal. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
The streaks that you mention really aren't indicative of a problem with our random number generator, but rather that it's working ok. You seem to be asking that we introduce code to thow some assurances into the equation, but that would actually break the random number generator. Right now, no one can predict if a creature is going to drop the rare on the next spawn. That's how it should be.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;And at the same time, you don't know when you'll get what you want. But you still won't spend 20 hours in a row camping for nothing. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
Your assumption seems to be that if someone wants an item, they are entitled to it. That's not how we feel. There still has to be an element of chance involved. Increasing chances of acquiring an item on each spawn does nothing to reduce camping. In fact the perceived entitlement to an item actually encourages it. People camp things like the runed cowl because they feel relatively certain that they can get one in X hours. The only way to get rid of camping entirely would be to 1) Make items so common that they no longer mean anything, 2) Make it so that they are lible to drop anywhere (we are testing this idea for some things in Kunark, but will still have the best items dropping off of named critters), or 3) Make items so rare that no one would camp them (for instance, if the average camp time on the Runed cowl was 100 hours, very few peopel would camp it, more likely people would just happen across it and get lucky). <BR>
<BR>
None of these options used exclusively appeals to us. What we are trying in Kunark is making nice items drop randomly, but keeping the best items on the rare mob, but at a rarer rate than usual. By doing this we make it so that you don't need to have absolute best item to be competative, you can get a good one just by fighting. However if you do want the best weapon/item out there, it might take a bit of specific planning and execution, or maybe some luck <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Lore and no drop items">Lore and no drop items</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/24/00 02:05 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I have often wondered why certain items aren't lore or no drop (such as the SMR or Runed Cowl mentioned in the original post).  Abashi gives a good explaination for why.</font></p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Abashi why aren't popular items like the SMR and Runed Cowl Lore?<BR>
</font>
The LORE and NODROP tags on items have different effects on the player economy and the farminmg issue. <BR>
<BR>
For instance, NODROP, though created for the purpose of making people complete their own quests, is *very good* at controlling the farming problem. However it's very bad for the player economy, and actually promotes camping, or gives people the feeling that they are required to camp. It also makes things such as looting a persons corpse for them when it's in a bad place impossible.<BR>
<BR>
LORE, though not as good as NODROP at stopping farming still does does something, making it a bit cumbersome for one character to hold a bunch of items on their own. It's easier on the player economy than NODROP, but still presents some gameplay problems. It also gives people the feeling that they are required to camp because people are less likely to want to trade LORE items since they they have to go back and get another one for themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Though the absense of both of these tags does present some farming issues, it is by far the best for the player economy, general gameplay, and gives people another reasonable option to acquire something besides camping it themselves. With the implementation of the play-nice policies, as well as the addition of all of the new zones with the expansion, the farming issues are being handled through other means. <BR>
<BR>
So, to answer your question, we don't want to place the LORE and NODROP tags on items as a matter of course, and would prefer to give each item and situation some serious thought due to the negative consequences of these tags.<BR>
