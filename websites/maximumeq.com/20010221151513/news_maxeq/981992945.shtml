This is such a large setup line that I won't even comment on it.  Put in your own witty retort [here].<p>
They are also looking for anyone who is selling items on EBay and for the Wazzzup guys. </font></p>

Yahoo .. Gone!<p>
It appears that two of the very small auction sites have also bit the dust.<p>
Playerauctions.com and Egamesauction.com seem to have been short-lived alternatives to the big auction sites.<p>
Both sites spammed the world with e-mail letting them know that they existed.  I guess one of those e-mail got to Verant.  <p>
On a tip from an anonymous reader I checked out Playerauctions.com to find it was refusing connections.  Egamesauction.com simply has no EQ items in its database.  Could this be the end of Everquest auctioning?</font></p>

Below are some snippets from it. <p>  I can understand how a new player would love this.  The rest of you will have to make your own decisions. </font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>As you validly point out, this product is mostly destined to the new gamers, though we have been surprised to see the positive feedback from some of the  hard core gamers, being among others that:
<p>- Remapping a game creates its own drawbacks such as eliminating the possibility to refer to the game existing documentation ! So no need to remap when you have our cover.<p>

- Can one reconfigure our cover ? Obviously not since all key commands are printed upon it, replicating the game developers default setup.<p>

- The cover allows for the whole set of commands to be visible at once.
<p>
- Key letters (qwerty etc...) are printed upon the cover itself.
<p>
- the KCC sure beats the ugly looks of a keyboard.<p>

Our Quality Assurance department is looking for some AVID EQ gamers to join us as testers at the San Diego branch. If you would like more information please visit www.verant.com or mail your resume to resume@station.sony.com with "QA Openings" as the Subject.
<p>
Applicants should include their time playing EverQuest, and their number of characters and their respective classes and levels as part of their resume.
<p>
*Small Patch*
<p>
The EverQuest Team is currently hard at work evaluating, planning, and documenting our project plans for the current year. As such, we did not plan game updates during this period, forecasted to last a few weeks.
<p>
However, given today's server maintenance being performed by our Operations Team, we were able to include a few small updates. These include some minor polishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the placement of the wizard's Velious teleport spells on merchants.<p>

Very soon, we'll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game world. We'll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.
<p>
- The EverQuest Team

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hi all,<p>
As has been posted and talked about here and elsewhere, it would appear some artificially buffed and equipped characters were illegally moved from the Test server to a live server.
<p>
Those characters will be moved back to Test. The situation has been dealt with internally -- we apologize and will do our best to not let something like this occur again.

Control Zone Interactive has created keyboard cover for Everquest players so they don't have to remember which keys do what.  Excuse me if I'm daft, but is anyone really having a problem remembering what functions the different keys perform?   <p>
What if like most players you customize your keyboard to your liking?  Will this cover still work?  Is it customizable?  It sure looks pretty though. <p>
The quote below is from their website.  The ever so swell play on words at the end is sure to get some of our more immature readers in a tizzy.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>"Our collection of Keyboard Control Covers will make you smile.  Knowing the
	basics are one thing... to have the complete command set on top of your
	keyboard is another!  You will fly better, fight better, know your virtual world
	better... and best of all, you'll be better at what you do the minute you...<p>

As per our recent news story we posted the pop up ads.   As per the current spew of vitriol they will be limited to the top page only.  I'm not sure why some of you were getting multiple pop up windows.  I only get one.  C'est la vie.<p>

Do not expect to see the site after a week or so.  Without advertising the EQ free for all that is MaximumEQ will be turned off.  I like you all, but not that much. =) Grab all you can now!<p>
