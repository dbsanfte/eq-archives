Good luck!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>
<br>Hello again from Aven du Sora on the Innoruuk Server! We'll be hosting a Raffle (our third) this Friday Evening. The Raffle itself will be at 8:30pm Pacific (11:30pm Eastern) on December 15th. We'll hold the Raffle in the Commons/Ro tunnel, just inside the entrance from North Ro.
<br>We plan to distribute 50 magic items as prizes, and will then divide up the platinum from ticket sales into 3 cash prizes. The Grand Prize will be a Mithril Breastplate!
<br>
<br>Ticket sales will begin Tuesday 12/12 and continue each evening until the raffle. Sellers will be stationed at different times in Qeynos, East Commons, Greater Faydark, and Firiona/LoIO in Kunark. Keep an ear out for ticket sellers, or visit our guildhall at http://ads.eqhq.com for the selling schedule.
<br>
<br>Tickets will be sold for 5pp each, with a limit of 5 per person. Youngsters without means will be able to earn a single ticket for a small quest. Each ticket can only win 1 prize, but different tickets can win prizes if you hold more than one.
<br>
<br>Attendance is not required to win. We will publish a list of winners, and hold prizes for at least 14 days for pickup in the East Commons neighborhood.
<br>
<br>Good Luck!

</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>As the dust settles and the fog clears, shapes begin to take form within the clouds. Small, bearded forms with larger hammers sit in a circle patting each other on the back in congratulatory praise. It has been a long time in the making, but some sort of shrine needed to be built and who better to craft one than the dwarven workers of Kaladim.
<br>
<br>The spire shot forth into the sky in splendor and magic seemed to be naturally imbued in the stonework as a blue glow emanated from the structure. Along its base were chisled one word which seemed to thrive with life - PlanetEverQuest.
<br>
<br>Aracnakat, the dark elven cleric of other renowned spires such as Cazic-Thule Corner & EQ Corner, contracted the dwarves for the new project. After much protest and even more ale their will had been broken and Aracnakat's vision began to take form. It was with great pleasure that the spire was completed for all to see. The only thing left to do was to dispose of the dwarves.
<br>
<br>OOC: PlanetEverQuest has officially launched with the release of Scars of Velious. Please take the time to come give us a look and let us know what you think on our message forums. It's taken awhile, but we're happy to be here!

<br> 
<br>http://www.grrlgamer.com/gamegrrl.htm
<br> 
<br>"There’s been a lot of talk lately about “the failure” of EverQuest, both as a game and as a customer service oriented entity. In a piece posted in the EverQuest forum, an ex-player named Skyrain Dreamweaver has left his mark with an editorial called “Bullies on the Playground”. It’s a great piece, and makes some interesting and valid points about playing EverQuest. And yet on the whole I believe that the “failure” mentioned in this article does not belong to the game. It belongs to the players."

<br>------------------------------
<br>*Patch Day*
<br>
<br>Today's patch addresses a few issues brought up by players over the last several days:
<br>
<br>- Fixed an issue with /split that would cause people to go linkdead in the event that they used the command in quick succession.
<br>- Fixed a bug where you could not edit socials or skills (via the hotbutton window right click) in fullview mode if you had hidden your "MainMenu" window.
<br>- Fixed a bug where you would not see hotbuttons in "normal" mode if you had hidden that window in fullview mode.
<br>- Fixed it so you can't use hotbuttons when looting, trading, banking, or using a merchant in fullview mode (which is how it is in normal mode, but with the inventory working in fullview mode now it wasn't blocked properly for that).
<br>- Fixed the message for the /dynamiclights command to report properly.
<br>- Fixed a problem where INI setting were not being read properly if you had camped or went LD to server select then reentered the game. This was causing various UI problems with window positions and colors being wrong.
<br>- Fixed a problem with Sirens Grotto - Some people entering the zone were getting stuck.
<br>- Fixed a problem with passage from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar. Travel in that direction was supposed to require a key.
<br>- We believe we fixed a problem where NPCs sometimes would hit a pet-owner no matter how far away the owner was from the pet and the NPC. 
<br>- Corrected loot drops in Thurgadin
<br>
<br>We again appreciate patience while we stabilize following Velious launch.
<br>
<br>- The EverQuest Team

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Please be patient with us over the next few days. As Velious goes live we are expecting to be very busy, both on the servers and with tech support. We will be doing everything we can to keep things running smoothly for everyone. But if something untoward happens, please understand that our staff will be working hard to help you out. We are anticipating a rather large increase in volume on the servers, in petitions and on our tech support phone lines. Velious is an exciting new adventure for everyone, with people rushing out to see the new lands. Servers will probably see a lot more activity than they are used to, and they already see a lot. So will our customer support personnel. Please, be patient with them during this busy time.
<br>
<br>And happy holidays to everyone!

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I'm betting the "name nazis" on Vallon Zek are doing it just to get a rise out of people and then sit back and watch the message boards overflow with complaints. I'd bet verant's profits that they are sitting back and chuckling and joking with each other about it right now, guides, guide managers, Abashi, Absor, etc alike.
<br>
<br>Ok everyone, enough.
<br>
<br>Let's stop using 'nazi' to describe anyone here. It's a very offensive choice of terminology. Consider doing so worthy of a warning from here on out. I have no problem with people talking about our policies, even if you don't like them. But using terminology that is designed only to offend people like this is something that I'm not going to allow.

Once there, players will face all-new challenges and rewards in their quest for dominance and survival. The new frozen continent, Velious, is located south of Antonica, and its 19 new zones include ice caves, crystal caverns, crypts, dungeons and frozen towers. The expansion pack features visually stunning non-player characters including frost giants, ice dragons, snow orcs, cave bears, Snowfang gnolls, storm giants and vicious ottermen.
