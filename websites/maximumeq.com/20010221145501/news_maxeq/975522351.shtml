<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello everyone.<BR>
As you probably know, we've taken the servers down for an emergency update.<BR>
<BR>
We are patching to fix a bug that was causing zones to crash and to fix a nasty bug with hit point granting items that were causing unexpected deaths.<BR>
<BR>
We don't like to take our servers down during prime time, but we felt that these bugs were too serious to wait. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Right now I don't have an estimate about how long they will be down.<BR>

Multiple pets. Imagine the thought.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>November 16th, 8:00am
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>*Follow-up Patch*
<br>
<br>Today's follow-up patch addresses the following issues from yesterday's patch:
<br>
<br>- The spell Torpor received an unintentional reduction in effectiveness
<br>- Illumination in game was not as bright as it should have been.
<br>- Pet using classes unintentionally gained the ability to summon multiple pets.
<br>- Bard songs were reacting poorly with invisibility/hide/sneak.
<br>- Hitpoints were being reported incorrectly to clients.
<br>- Changing resolutions would cause some to crash.
<br>
<br>In addition, the following changes were left out of yesterday's patch message:
<br>
<br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some to not be able to cast after being feared.
<br>- Data for group members and targets will be updated more frequently.  This change should reduce complaints of warping and slow hitpoint and other updates.
<br>- Bards received increases in the skill cap for their instrument skills.
<br>- Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 to ALT-1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe.
<br>
<br>Thank you for your continued patience.
<br>
<br>- The EverQuest Team</font></p>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hail all, 
I am Kotno Holywind, Paladin of Tunare, and Officer of the Brightblade Knights on Saryrn. As was previously posted here, the Brightblade Knights are holding an open Team Tournament on November 25th at 12pm pacific time. The tournament will be open to teams of six consiting of players lvl 20-29. There will be prizes, but they will not be announced until they are given out. This tournament is open to all guilds throughout Norrath to enter a team. In order to make things run more smoothly we ask that you arrive at The Arena with the full team on hand one hour prior to the event (11am PST) to register for the tournament. There will be dueling before the tournament to warm up, and drinking afterwards to celebrate plus some fun games for higher lvl characters who want to participate (ie. drunken dueling, or "lets watch the six lvl 20s try to take on a lvl 40 player"). For more information send questions to BrightbladeTourney@yahoo.com or send questions to either Kotno or Inxighte of the Brightblade Knights in game. Thanks all, and we hope to see you there.

------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
***Patch Day***<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included with DirectX 7.  You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play EverQuest.  Please refer to http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been speaking about for some time.  The new sound engine supports additional EAX features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the past.<BR>
<BR>
*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<BR>
<BR>
The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight.  All players wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog yes" during the windows.<BR>
<BR>
The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm time when it is decided.  Remember that corpses will not follow you to the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move.  <BR>
<BR>
As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during the window.  You will need to be present and execute the command in order to move.<BR>
<BR>
*Spell Changes*<BR>
<BR>
-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<BR>
-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<BR>
-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item.  The effect was checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<BR>
-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<BR>
-- Fixed the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate races.<BR>
-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<BR>
-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength spell.<BR>
-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<BR>
<BR>
-- Modified the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat.  In addition, we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<BR>
<BR>
*General Fixes/Changes*<BR>
<BR>
-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on "Sister's Isle" to attack people who were fighting pirates.<BR>
-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game since they do not have the piercing skill.<BR>
-- The "Belt of the River" quest should now work correctly.<BR>
-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<BR>
-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<BR>
-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items.  Please check your items to see your changes.  Note:  Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<BR>
-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct loot.<BR>
-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<BR>
-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<BR>
-- Made the "Gravebinder" a magic weapon.<BR>
<BR>
-- Repaired the Forager Bag.  It was causing people to lose weight when placing items in the bag.  It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<BR>
<BR>
-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50.  Previously, creatures above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill.  Now, most creatures below the character's level can now be successfully taunted.  As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that of a creature below 50th.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Client Enhancements*<BR>
<BR>
-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<BR>
-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total number of available socials by 108.<BR>
-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate incorrectly.<BR>
-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at higher resolutions.<BR>
-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<BR>
<BR>
-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider.  Users should now see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an adjustable clipping plane.<BR>
<BR>
-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show "[LD]" over their heads when linkdead.  In addition, these same players will no longer show as "LinkDead" in the /who list.<BR>
<BR>
-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game.  /usercolor:  Usage "/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B" where "UserColorNumber is the number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red, green and blue respectively.  All changes will be automatically saved to your EQCLIENT.INI file.<BR>
<BR>
-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character name indicating the server number.  As such, you will now be able to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom options.<BR>
<BR>
-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and character name.  For instance, if your character is named "Bobb", and you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<BR>
<BR>
-- Added two new entries to the "Defaults" section of the EQCLIENT.INI file:  AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on automatically when assisting.  Defaults to "TRUE".  ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the "Soandso is inspecting you" message.  Defaults to "TRUE".<BR>
<BR>
-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced.  You can now set two keys, a primary and an alternate, for each function in game.  In addition, things that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your preference.  Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, right-click to set the secondary.<BR>
<BR>
-- Added the /note command.  /note will append the following text to a file called "notes.txt" in your EverQuest directory.  For instance, typing "/note This is a note" will put "This is a note" on the next line in the notes.txt file.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Why would any company release false information to their clients?
<br>
<br>Why would YOU (Verant) release false information in the spDat files for any other reason than the screw w your customers? Expecially when you know darn well that your customers are going to look over with a fine tooth comb?
<br>
<br>Thank you for reposting your thoughts thus explaining what it is that you mean.
<br>
<br>Who said the information isn't true? Of course, who said it is? I know that we've said in the past that we are quite likely to put false information in that file just to slow the parsers down, so considering that we've warned you that we might do that, what's the problem?
<br>
<br>You aren't supposed to be looking in that file.
<br>
<br>-Gordon
<br>
<br>Who says I cant look in whats on MY computer? 
<br>
<br>Ok then, who says we have to put correct information in that file?
<br>
<br>Abashi, seriously here, and it a flat manner (unlike my usual post). Why would any company screw with their customers like your doing with us, by posting crap spells, or posting that their new product will be crap, when they are just about to release it?
<br>
<br>And again, I ask, who said that we have?
<br>
<br>There's absolutly ZERO wrong with the spells that have shown up on the net. I'm not going to get into a discussion about them, as it's part of an UNRELEASED PRODUCT, but some are acting like something is being taken away from them. 
<br>
<br>There is NOTHING being taken away. All are getting the ability to do something that they couldn't do before. If you choose not to like your new abilities, so be it, but you still have all of your old ones to work with as well. The new expansion is primarily new areas to explore. That is the primary focus. 
<br>
<br>Everything else is gravy.
<br>
<br>-Gordon
<br>
<br>Has Verant actually misled anyone in the past on the SPDAT files? I can't remember ever seeing wrong information brought to light, just the continued threat that the information could be wrong.
<br>
<br>Well there was that April Fool's thing that didn't go over all that well, and don't forget the "UltraDeath" spells :)
<br>
<br>Abashi, i think you are taking this too personal
<br>
<br>Not personally, just passionately. 
<br>
<br>Passion not unlike that shown by the players who post here. As much as EverQuest is not "just a game" to many of the players, it isn't to us either. It represents the culmination of years of work and investment for some who were trying to build the game that they always wanted to play. 
<br>
<br>It's that passion, both that of the players as well as that of the developers that makes EverQuest what it is today. Of course nothing good is without its downside :)

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="More on Velious and "my class sucks"">More on Velious and "my class sucks"</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 11/14/00 15:58 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Seems Gordon is getting tired of the whining.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Methinks Abashi is growing weary of Robert's posts
<br>
<br>No, not at all. I'm getting weary of the fact that everything "sucks". It seems that most things that we put in are met immediately with "this sucks", "that is useless", "Verant hates my class", or "my class gets the shaft". 
<br>
<br>It seems that unless something is obviously overpowering, that is the first response to nearly anything that we put in. We put in Evade for the rogues and got a "this sucks". We put in the lure series for Wizards and got a "this sucks". Both of these despite the fact that these are now well known to be good features. That's just TWO things that were put in, met immediately with "this sucks", which were later found to be very useful. 
<br>
<br>Harvest for wizards. Reduced aggro for bards. Increased bash and taunt caps for hybrids. More harmtouch damage for shadowknights. Crits, crips, and nearly everything that's been put in for warriors taking them right to the brink of being overpowered. Haste increases for unarmed monks, though hailed for roughly six months now "suck". The screaming terror change from a "Fear+blur" to a mez. I could go on.
<br>
<br>I'm absolutely not saying that these boards don't bring valid issues to light from time to time, but unfortunately those valid issues are often hid by layer upon layer of complaints about everything under the sun. It's gotten to the point that often the first indication of a problem is when there is an issue or facet of the game that no one complains about. I've read "Verant hates our class" posts by virtually every class in the past week or so, in varying degrees. Are all of these issues "valid"?
<br>
<br>Sure, I'll buy that *every* class has valid issues. However, if this wasn't the case, wouldn't that be indicative of a problem? I'd have to think so. 
<br>
<br>Now I don't blame the people here for the problem. I'll take some of the responsibility. We've continually shown a willingness to address the concerns that have been brought up here and have made many *many* changes based upon your thoughts. This makes sense as the most valid issues tended to get the most "face time" in the beginning as valid issues often do. We of course addressed them as we saw them. While I have no doubt that the game is better because of this, it has caused the feeling that there is no limit to what can be accomplished given sufficient complaints.
<br>
<br>There is. That limit exists at the point that the core function of the game, the core definition of EverQuest is to be changed. It cannot happen, and it will not happen, as a matter of common business sense. We will not take a successful product and keep tweaking its core definition in an attempt to please 100% of the people. As has been said, if you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one, and that applies here very well.
<br>
<br>Here's the deal. Following Velious we will begin to freeze aspects of the game. We will become as firm on various issues as we have been on subjects such as melee binding or experience curves. Things that aren't related to content will be closed down. First skills and their caps, stats, etc, followed by spells from the bottom up. We'll then start reviewing some of the rarer items as well as quest rewards. Within a month or two we'll get to the point that we'll be focusing solely on content-related issues such as implementing new quests, fixing old ones, and more or less moving forward all of the time.
<br>
<br>I think that it is essential that we move in this direction, as it is the only way that we can help increase the number of "valid issues" that are brought up here back to the level from when I first started. That will allow us to stop a lot of wheel spinning and again work towards making the game better for everyone.
<br>
<br>And my condolences to you Robert for having to witness such an event.

Here is an answer to a monk complaining about SoV.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Why do Monks get screwed with exspansions?
<br>It may just be me but why when new exspansions come out it's always the "Spellcasters" that get all the new items and such. Why couldn't monk say get new abilites or even new disciplines, that they could get ast lvl 60! My main charecter is a monk and i fell cheated when exspansions come out becasue we don't get crud. My hope to get a new skill.
<br>
<br>We've not been commenting on what specifically will be involved in this expansion, but who's to say that they don't? 
<br>
<br>There has been one expansion released. Monks got new abilities (and disciplines) in that expansion. Why do you feel "cheated when expansions come out"?
