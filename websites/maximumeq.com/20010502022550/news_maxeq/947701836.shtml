<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Monks Getting Faster!">Monks Getting Faster!</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:">Chris</a> - 01/07/00 12:39 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>Gordon 'Abashi' Wrinn made the below comment yesterday.  Monks should be getting a nice boost in speed with their fists.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Given some of the issues we’ve seen from the public lately in regards to Monks, we’ve worked with a few for the last 3 hours on an enhancement. Monks now receive a built in haste effect beginning in the high 20s. The haste effect increases with level, and stacks with haste-items and haste-spells. At 50th monks will find they do *substantially* more damage per minute. 
<BR><BR>
I suppose this is a bit of a blessing and a curse, since doing more damage (over 15%) will make the creature more likely to turn on you, but we think it will be well received. This should reaffirm Monks as the masters of melee damage. I was even able to solo an experience-giving creature at 50th without using the mend skill. 
<BR><BR>
Baring any problems on test, this should make the live servers at the next patch. Let us know what you think.

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Test Server Message">Test Server Message</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:">Chris</a> - 01/07/00 12:38 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>The following patch message has appeared on the test server.  It mainly concerns Necromancer's Feign Death.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Well, we have finally completed the hardware maintenance on the Test Server - which took quite a bit longer than we expected.  Due to this hardware failure, some characters were restored from backup therefore a few hours of gameplay may be lost for them.  We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.
<BR><BR>
The following changes have been introduced to the Test Server.
<BR><BR>
- Druid's Tracking skill base has been increased.
<BR><BR>
- The behavior of the Necromancer's Feign Death spell has been modified on the Test Server.  Here's a description of the reasons behind this change: 
<BR><BR>
Problem: 
Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances, providing offensive tactics that are abusive.  For this ability to remain balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility.  Offensive tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting a saving throw verses the effect.  Since creatures do NOT get a direct save verses feign death (as you cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat once you have feigned death, there is very little risk to necromancer himself.  As this tactic involves charming an NPC and turning it against another NPC, which could be part of the same spawn, it allows for Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any other class could.  This situation is well beyond what would preserve game balance for any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for example). 
<BR><BR>
Example: 
While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic is abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower Guk.  The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself.  Using the current system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the room at virtually no risk to himself. The Necro can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead.  To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok and Charms the other.  When the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns.  The Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and kills it, taking considerable damage during the fight.  The Necromancer waits until the Ghoul Lord returns to its spawn point.  When the necromancer gets back  up, he is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign Death works now. He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again.  The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok is killed.  When the Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord AND nearly full mana.  The Lord is now an easy kill, and the necro collects his special items.
<BR><BR>
Solution: 
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected.  While this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet, it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that charming an NPC does. 
<BR><BR>
We would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no unforeseen problems have been caused by it.  </font></p>

Thanks for bumping the post. I was looking for it yesterday but couldn't find it. Anyway, the fact that the additional AC isn't being displayed is a bug. There should be a patch on the Test Server soon to fix this.

In the mean time, you can limit the distance that the fog comes in by adjusting your clipping plane slider to the left side of the bar. <p>

<p>
Poster:<br>
Since Str increases ATK, it affects chance to hit, not just damage done. (This one conflicts with your recent Dex/Str post, but Str DOES increase ATK. Is ATK only related to damage?) 
<p>
Gordon:<br>
No. ATK and AC, despite the fact that they are represented by one number, have several different factors that make them up. AC, for instance, is the combination of a "Damage avoidance" factor, and a "Damage mitigation" factor. ATK is comprised of "chance to hit" and "damage potential". Some of the beta people will remember when AC and ATK were presented with the two factors listed seperatly. This was confusing to a lot of people, so the two seperate factors for each rating were combined into a ratio versus 1000. 
<p>
So, in other words, just because more STR increases your ATK, it doesn't mean that your chance-to-hit is also increased. 
<p>
As for the questions regarding dex and the monk, I'll check Monday to see if they figure into the monk-specific attacks. "

Should melee classes be able to bind anywhere?  Read on...</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>"Binding is set up the way it is and always has been for balance. It is part of the death penalty and is there to pace the game. <p>
The idea is that casters are more prone to dying and thus can bind in more places. It still paces the game, however, because groups need to wait for melee characters to return. If melee characters could bind anywhere it would alter the pace of the game, further minimize the death penalty, and let well balanced efficient groups just scream through dungeons. 
<p>
I realize some players reading this might think that sounds great, but there has to be a pace to the game and a penalty for dying. 
<p>
We are also considering making it such that casters cannot bind in Expansion dungeons (the fact that they can now is actually a bug that is too late to fix for the rest of the world). "<p>
