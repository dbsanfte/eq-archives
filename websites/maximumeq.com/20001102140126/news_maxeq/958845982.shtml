Milo D. Cooper has updated his <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask
Milo column</a> here on Everlore. This week Milo talks about his own
personal EQ model (or lack of one), EverQuest character specific questions,
his fascination with Jewel, insults more people's grammar skills, and a heck
of a lot more. Funny and informative read as always, here's a quick rip from
the page.

    First, must say I love the ASCII art in the background of your website.
Is that hand done, or is there a program out there         somewhere that
can generate those? It's been a while since I've seen one and was starting
to think of it as a lost art                 form.<P>

    Second, the custom scrollbar on your site is a nice touch. Did you grab
that from somewhere, or write it from scratch             yourself?<P>

    Third, great work on the female wood-elf. I would like to sincerely
thank you, the texture artist, and the man who did the         concept
sketch for that one.

I'm reading reports from all sorts of message boards and mailing lists that even high level characters are dying very quickly.<BR><BR>

If you are of a light race, avoid Nektulos forest if you can.  If you are a dark race, avoid the Commons (or keep a very sharp eye out for guards).  I know I'm missing quite a few places.<BR><BR>

Bascially, if you are thinking of going to an area where that guards are KOS to you, excersice extreme caution.  The guards can now see through invis as well, so that won't help.</font></p>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Class titles">Class titles</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/11/00 14:37 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>The idea of gender specific class titles is interesting.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;An enchanter gets to go through Illusionist (whichisn't that bad, except we don't get any illusions after lvl 44), Beguiler (which is something we do, but sounds real stupid), and finally to spend the rest of our time in eq at lvl 60 as a Phantasmist (this title is neither pleasant nor befitting the class at all).<BR>
</font>
We actually though Phantasmist was one of the coolest level 60 titles out there. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there a chance that the Titles for 51+ can be changed?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
We're considering making some gender-specific changes, but that's about the extent of it. This is one of those subjects that is very subjective, and I doubt that we can give everyone exactly what they are looking for.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Evolving factions">Evolving factions</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/11/00 14:34 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It would certainly make for an interesting game in faction would evolve, but then you would wonder what the purpose of doing faction work would be?</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Could it ever be the case that factions change? Couldn't it stand to reason, that at some point, the dark elves would form an alliance with the Iksar. Or, even better, how about a quest, which, when completed, allows faction alignments to be dynamically altered. Factions are fine, but for them to NEVER change is just not realistic.<BR>
</font>
We have the ability to do this, but the door would swing both ways and people get very upset when they become KOS in an area that they used to be able to go through unmolested. As a result, we've left the global faction issues the same in most applications.<BR>
<BR>
The closest thing we've done to changing something in this fashion was the update to Kithicor. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, When a god such as Cazzic or Inorruuk is killed, shouldn't those characters that worship him suffer in some way-such as a innate decrease to magical resistance, or stats, etc. Shouldn't there be vast worldwide consequences when a god dies?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Possibly, but before we could do that we'd probably have to put up a "Plane of Love" or something along those lines to give people another option.<BR>
<BR>
Also keep in mind that Innoruuk is the god of Hate. What better way for a follower of hate to prove himself than to slay his own god? <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Enchanting items">Enchanting items</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/11/00 14:31 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I'd like to see some more things that enchanters can enchant.  Currently, only 1 of the 4 in the thicken mana series actually does anything.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;So in essence if I am reading this right Enchanters will NEVER be able to enchant items to proc a level spell etc. So are you going to let us do ANYTHING to items or is Verant planning to never give Enchanters the promised ability of item enchantment?<BR>
</font>
It's certainly possible that we could enhance trade-skills to make use of enchanted metal or the vials of mana (from the thicken series) like Wu's Fighting Gauntlets, however the ability to take a mundane item and magically imbue it is not planned at present.<BR>
