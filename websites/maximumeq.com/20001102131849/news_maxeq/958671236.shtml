<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Old froglok models in Kunark">Old froglok models in Kunark</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/08/00 13:45 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Someone recently asked why the frogloks in Kunark don't have an ungraded model, like the goblins.  Brad McQuaid answered this one.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>2 resons (sic), really.<BR>
1. We wanted to nice mix of old and new models in the Expansion -- blending familiarity and newness has always been key to EQ (including the setting, the creatures, etc.)<BR>
<BR>
2. There's always finite time in creating a product. Would I like a new froglok model like there's a new goblin model? Sure! Heck, I'd like there to be tons more models... but one has to draw the line somewhere in terms of how much content you can get into a game in so much time.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, I'm very proud of how many distinct models are in EQ, both in the original release and in the Expansion -- I don't think any other 3D game even comes close to the variety we have. The EQ character model team has a LOT to be proud of.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Just a quick question: When are the sound issues on Kunark going to be addressed? I'm sure I'm nto the only one who's sick of hitting just about anything and having it grunt like a human...<BR>
</font>
They've been addressed in code already, we just need to get them over the live servers. It's looking like the week after next for the next patch.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="VenrilSathir faction in kunark dungeons">VenrilSathir faction in kunark dungeons</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/05/00 15:14 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It appears that faction is starting to make a bigger difference in where you fight, and what you do in EQ.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>With the number of posts about dungeon factions in Kunark, I wanted to take an opportunity to address them all at once:<BR>
Yes, it is correct, fighting in several dungeons in Kunark will lower your faction with VenrilSathir, and thus make conducting business in the outpost in the Overthere a bit rough. This is intentional, and is not a bug. It's also necessary for the political environment of Kunark to make sense, and our stance on it is firm. There are consequences, the importance of which each person has to decide for themselves, for killing everything that moves.<BR>
<BR>
We're not forcing anyone to fight anywhere, or to stay out of any particular zone. Like all faction issues, it is your choice whether or not that faction is important to you. This is the same choice that players of good alignments had to make when deciding whether or not to kill things that give them bad faction. It's a personal choice. Being KOS in the evil outpost does not put the spells that are available there out of your reach. You certainly have the ability to have someone else, who is not KOS there, complete the quests for you. Evil races are KOS throughout Faydwer as it is, and people get along fairly well there. Kunark is not meant to be an encapsulated environment that people never leave. We expect people to have to go back to the mainland from time to time to get supplies and such. If you make yourself KOS to the outpost, there are other ways for you to get into Kunark without going through it. <BR>
<BR>
So just to summarize, the factions are intentional. I suggest that everyone consider their options carefully before making a decision on how to tackle the continent.<BR>

Gordon explains why Verant is doing this.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>This is another case where it is not our goal to make everyone the same. We don't want everyone of a given level to be clad in the same equipment. Equipment that is able to be widely used by a large number of race/class combos also encourage camping, something that we would like to see go away. <BR>
Restricting items by race and class works towards this goal.<BR>

Having an innate AC bonus, plus plate would give them too much AC (if there is such a thing :) ).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;So do Iksars have an AC bonus or not? <BR>
</font>
Yes, Iksar have an innate AC bonus based upon race. Monks also get an innate AC bonus based upon class. The Iksar monk gets both the race and class-based AC bonuses.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;I've yet to see anyone casting a spell past 50 they didn't buy at their vendor. In almost 3 weeks of playing, I've yet to hear of a single post 50 spell dropping off a mob.<BR>
</font>
I've got the EQLive team checking on this. I'll get back after I get the report from them. Just one note, Kunark has only been live for a week and a half  <BR>

The spells uses a peridot to cast.<BR><BR>

A level 52 wizard recently timed just how much time it regens.  Apparently it's next to nothing.  Abashi had this to say.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>It's not bugged. Manaskin only adds a very small amount to the mana-regen rate. The resolution of each "chunk" of mana that displays when medding is probably too large to show the additional 10 mana/minute that this spell grants.<BR><BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;We get this spell at 29 and it now has a lock so you cant charm anything higher than 26??? PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAN BE USEFUL????? AND WHY IT WAS DONE?<BR>
</font>
With levels going above 50, we had to put in code to catch caps that were controlled by the level ceiling before. One of these was a safety net for charm, which caught this spell. Assuming that they don't have it already (my spell list is dated), we'll be giving Shaman the higher level animal charm spell with a higher cap. <BR>
<BR>
I apologize for this not being in the patch message.<BR>
