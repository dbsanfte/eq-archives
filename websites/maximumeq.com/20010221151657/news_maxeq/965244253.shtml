It's good that they are going to be changed.</font></p>

>>>Put a minimum level on duels. Lets say 6, because that is the level you start losing experience, and your corpses stay on the ground.<BR>
</font>
We already have something like this planned. I don't know yet if it will be in next weeks patch, but if it isn't, it will betthe patch after that. When it is updated, if either duel participant is below level 5 or 6 (Not sure which it will be yet), the duel results will not be broadcasted to the world.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Powerguilds">Powerguilds</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 07/17/00 11:05 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Abashi talks about powerguilds, and his thoughts on them:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Blame EQ for Powerguilds, not the guilds Verant created the powerguilds<BR>
</font>
"powerguilds" as mentioned here will occur in any environment where like-minded players are allowed to join together. It really doesn't matter who is "blamed" for it happening. There's really nothing preventing two different guilds from getting together for the purpose of taking on large projects. Sure, communication is marginally more difficult, but it's far from being unmanageable. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, Verant has blackballed option #2. Because they provide no guild alliance code, it is nearly impossible to associate closely with your allies. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
Whether it's "powerguilds" or "poweralliances", the only difference is the name that happens to be over everyone's head. Either we end up with everyone belonging to the same guild, or we end up with the same guilds always in an alliance. <BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure if a sure fire "solution" exists, or whether this is even a problem that we should "solve". There should be some benefit for being part of a large army (safety in numbers for one), and a disadvantage for choosing to go-it solo or small, as the case may be. We of course do not want to see anyone monopolizing areas with their groups, but if someone cannot make enough friends to take on some of the larger encounters, is that a problem? <BR>
<BR>
Player interaction is one of the main points of massively-multiplayer online games. I'm not sure that just rearranging the way interaction takes place from fewer large guilds to allied smaller guilds will make much of a difference.<BR>
