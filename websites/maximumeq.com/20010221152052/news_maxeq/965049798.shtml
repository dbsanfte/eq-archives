Hobart is one of the QA (Quality Assurance) guys at Verant, who is answering questions on the new message board for this kind of thing.</font></p>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Ranger damage output increase">Ranger damage output increase</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 07/14/00 11:03 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Yesterday, Abashi mentioned that they are working on increasing the damage output of Rangers in a thread that was about Rangers getting too much attention from mobs.  Of course, this would only add to the present situation, so Abashi clarified what he meant.<BR><BR>

Personally, I don't think this won't work, especially against summoning mobs.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;now correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't higher dmg output make it WORSE for us? <BR>
</font>
It depends on how we do it. In this case the plan is to enhance damage output from archery under certain conditions, giving rangers an incentive to back out of melee range for a few seconds. <BR>
<BR>
If rangers can make a *big* hit from time to time at a greater delay rather than a *bunch* of smaller hits at a lesser delay, the desired affects might be obtainable.<BR>

I often have to wait to sit to med with my cleric if I stun a mob.  Just part of the strategy I feel.</font></p>

I recently found out that the Aggro Radius on MOBs was raised when a character is sitting down or looting a corpse. I find this absurd! A challenging game is funner than one with no challenge, but this is purely annoying. The game is already very challenging, but having the Aggro Radius go up when you are most vunerable is so annoying it is not even funny. I find it somewhat sadistic to leave the game this way. A player that is annoyed is not a happy player. Leave the game challenging but PLEASE take this feature out...<BR>
</font>

I've always felt that it was a nice touch. Creature "x" is too afraid of you to risk a conflict while you are alert, however decides that he might take a poke at you if you turn your back. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Only creatures that have faction that determine what they will and will not attack give messages in /con indicating if they do or do not see you. Some things in the game will attack anyone, regardless of faction, and these things are always "scowling". <BR>
If you check hill giants while invis you'll see the same issue. It's working as designed.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Iksar warrior and shadow knight quests">Iksar warrior and shadow knight quests</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 07/14/00 10:55 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This is an issue we will probably see more frequently, as more Iksar become high level.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just wanted to state again that I would like to see some high level quest armors for Iksar(warriors and shadow knight especially) put into EQ. It is called Everquest after all, but what is a high level Iksar Shadow Knight going to quest for, he can't wear Umbral, heck he can't even wear darkforge.<BR>
</font>
We've spoken about this issue internally and agree that it is something that we need to work on in the near future. I'll be sure to let everyone know when we have some firm plans.<BR>

I still don't understand just where they gate to.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1a) Fire pet: pretty useless as it is casting aeria dds, dispells and gate.<BR>
</font>
It probably shouldn't be casting gate. I'll see if I can get that addressed.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1b) Earth pet: root was broken, but seems to be fixed already (correct me if I'm wrong)<BR>
</font>
<BR>
The fix for this should be live.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1c) All pets: Not strong enough (I do not know if necro pets are better, some say yes, I hope someone tested it and can reply if thats true)<BR>
</font>
<BR>
We disagree that there is any problem with the stregth of the pets. They are absolutely as strong as we want any pets to be.<BR>
<BR>
As for DD spells, the magician class is appropriately balanced. Doing anything additional for the class would overpower them. Concerning summons, there's really nothing else that we could have summoned that wouldn't step on the toes of another class, thus reducing class interdependance. <BR>
