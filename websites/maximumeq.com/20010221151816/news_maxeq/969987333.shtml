<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
For those who are new to online games, a “dupe” is a bug that allows a player to “duplicate” or “copy” items, creating two items where once there was one. We've heard some reports that there may be a dupe bug somewhere in game. While we're confident that we do not have any current issues of this type, we'd like to provide an incentive to everyone to report such things should they become aware of them.<BR>
<BR>
The FIRST person to submit reproduction steps for any dupe bug will receive the following: a) A free EverQuest account. We'll mark your current account as free, or provide you with a new, free account, and b) Subject to approval by us, the title of your choice will be applied to one of the characters on your account.<BR>
<BR>
To qualify, you must include all of the information below. Furthermore, THE REPRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CLEAR, CONCISE, AND PRESENT LOGICAL STEPS ALLOWING OUR TEST DEPARTMENT TO REPRODUCE THE BUG. Send an email with a subject line of "Dupe Bug Report" to eqmail@verant.com containing the following:<BR>
<BR>
1. Station Name<BR>
2. Real Name<BR>
3. Phone Number (Day and Evening)<BR>
4. Primary Play Server<BR>
5. Primary Character Name<BR>
6. Complete reproduction instructions.<BR>
<BR>
“Dupe Bug Reports” will only be considered if they contain all necessary elements of information including complete instructions for reproducing the bug. While we appreciate notification of all potential problems, only concrete first-hand experiences will be considered for the award.<BR>
<BR>
