<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Everquest Website Scam">Everquest Website Scam</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 01/06/01 18:16 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This came from Gordon. Seems the site in question has been taken down, but it never hurts to be warned.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,
http://eqstatus.cjb.net is NOT an official Sony Online Entertainment or EverQuest website. Entering your login name and password as requested at that site will email the same to iui6@hotmail.com and give the owner of that address access to your account. 

As a reminder, representatives of Sony Online Entertainment will NEVER ask you for your password.

While on the subject, it is recommended that EverQuest account holders choose a "strong" password. Strong passwords consist of at least 3 of the following 4 character types:

- Uppercase characters
- Lowercase characters
- Numbers
- Special characters (e.g. !, @, #, $, %, ^)

In addition, it is also recommended that you choose a password no less than 6, and preferably 8 characters long. Try to choose something that you can remember that does not contain logical components. For instance "RedBall123" is not a good password since it contains three components, two of which are common words using logical capitalization, followed by a logical sequence of numbers. If one insisted on using those characters, "rEdbaLl231" would be a much better password.

Thank you,

Gordon Wrinn

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Best of the Best – Magician - Event Rule Sheet Magician 54+
<br>
<br>Single Elimination 1 vs. 1 competition for all rounds but final round. 
<br>
<br>Final round (to determine 1st and 2nd place on both test and live) will be 2 out of 3 matches. 
<br>
<br>Dates: January 8th though the 13th on Live Servers, times will be posted at least 48 hours in advance. 
<br>
<br>Final is on Test Server, January 14th at Noon, all servers will be represented.
<br>
<br>Spectator and General Rulings 
<br>
<br>Guides and GMs are considered judges and therefore restricted to attack. Anyone found attacking a GM or Guide can be banished from the arena or death touched without warning. 
<br>
<br>The Arena is off limits to unauthorized pvp 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the event. This is to ensure that the contestants and spectators are safe. 
<br>
<br>Spectators shall remain seated and not casting during the match. Any spell casting shall be considered aimed at a participant, and either harmful or helpful to someone in the match. Anyone who casts any spell during a match can be death touched (for no XP loss) and removed from the arena. 
<br>
<br>Spectators shall not use shout for any reason, but use /ooc instead. This is so that those involved in the match use shout, and the channel can be turned off to reduce distraction to the wizards involved. Use of shout at anytime can result in a silence command being issued rendering the player unable to use any form of communication, or banishment from the arena. 
<br>
<br>Spectators shall not interfere with this event. This severity is used only when directly attacking a player involved in the match, attacking a judge during the match, or healing a player involved in a match. 
<br>
<br>VI may limit the amount of people in the zone to control conditions of lag or frame rate for the participants. The event shall start open seating, but may close off during time. The Event Staff may use any sort of decision on who stays and who leaves to ensure the event is a success. This should not be implemented until a minimal of 150 players in the zone have been reached.
<br>
<br>Combatant Rules 
<br>
<br>The owner of the account must play the Magician, no “Ringers” will be allowed. Any account found with someone besides the registered and original owner of the account playing that character is breaking the EULA as set forth by Verant Interactive. 
<br>
<br>There is no entry fee for this event, and the only prizes will be titles awarded to the winners. Title for winning at the server level will be the level 51 title for magicians “the Conjurer” The title for the 3 runners up will be the level 56 title “the Elementalist”. 
<br>
<br>The grand champion shall have his level 60 title given to him on his own server “the Arch-Mage”. 
<br>
<br>Both magicians will be summoned out of the zone, and summoned back before the start of the match to clear any previous bugs with permanent spell effects. 
<br>
<br>Both magicians, once debuffed and resummoned shall be asked if they are ready for the match to start. Once the match starts, a timer will start of 30 seconds that the magicians are allowed to cast on themselves, and quickly rememorize the spells. During this time pet spells and any non-offensive spells will be allowed, pets will not be allowed to attack until after the 30 seconds. 
<br>
<br>The judge of the match will count down on every 5-second interval until the time is up, at that time offensive spell casting maybe used. Mana used for buffs will not be restored. The offensive spells start at the 30-second mark regardless if wizard is ready for the next stage. 
<br>
<br>An explosion and a verbal statement will start the 30-second period, and also the start of the match. A single “Fault” will be allowed (Casting before the explosion), and an event warning (not an official warning) be given to the offender. A second “Fault” per match is disqualification. 
<br>
<br>Both magicians shall stay on the tiled area at all times, you may not stand on or behind the firepots. You may not stand on or in the throne. Binding in the ring and gating to a different part of the ring is no longer allowed in any VI Event. 
<br>
<br>The 60th lvl Banishment spell has been disallowed for this event. 
<br>
<br>All items and armor available to the magician class will be allowed in this event. 
<br>
<br>No activatable items of any kind shall be used in the match. This includes any right click items. 
<br>
<br>Any use of exploits or bugs will result in immediate disqualification from the event, and is a break in the rules of conduct as set forth on www.everquest.com. 
<br>
<br>Rallos Zek Specific Rule: There shall be no looting of any item at an event, this includes spectators. Anyone found player killing for profit at an event shall have action taken against the account. 
<br>
<br>Tallon Zek and Vallon Zek Rule: You may request to have your faction restored to the condition it was in at the last available save. This is to insure that no unnecessary faction hits are taken at an event.
<br>
<br>Test Server Finals 
<br>
<br>Those champions who go to test are bound by additional rules. The character used for the event cannot adventure on test for any reason. Handing off even the smallest items to a player on test is considered duplication, resulting in a warning against the account, and loss of that item on your home server. Those found extremely abusing this rule can have further actions taken against the account at the desire of the development team. 
<br>
<br>The transfer of characters to test is midnight (give or take an hour) PST the night before the main event. 
<br>
<br>Lake Rathetear will be shut down several hours before the main event. The only characters allowed in the arena on Test for the main event will be the champion wizards, the judges of the event and the event staff, other members of Verant Interactive, and members of the press who sign up with Lady Daegarmo at least 3 days in advance via email. 
<br>
<br>All other characters on test found in the Arena during the main event will be summoned out of the zone and binded so they cannot return. If a second character is found to enter the arena for any reason, it could be considered disruption and subject to action taken against the account.
