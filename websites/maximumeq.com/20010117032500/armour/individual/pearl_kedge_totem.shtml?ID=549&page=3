<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>With regard to the above post about 2 yaks and FBSS for the Kedge, the answer is absolutely yes, at least on Veeshan.<BR>
<BR>
On Veeshan, you could get easily get more if you're patient.  As an example, the reed belts now are priced right around Golden Eff. Boots range, which is 15-18 K pp on Veeshan.  You can also get 2 yaks or dang close with reed belt.  Yaks are pretty common now in Freeport for 7 K pp, and the asking price on FBSS are 15 K pp.  Given that the Kedge Totem is the rare drop, there is no doubt in my mind that you could hold out for quite a bit more than the 2 yaks and FBSS.  Again, this is on Veeshan, no idea what the economy is like on other servers.<BR>
<BR>
Oh, and as for those who say, he spawns right at this precise location <enter one of a dozen spots in DC>, the answer is nope.  I mean the guy wanders like a madman and there is no way (in my opinion) he spawns at one point.  Even if he ends up at a particular point in DC (i.e., he has ONE placeholder who follows a particular path which I think unlikely), I don't think it's a great strategy to sit at the loc, turn on the TV, and hope he'll pass through.  More likely one of several trackers on at the same time will kill him long before he reaches your spot.  And then you log after eight hours and think, man, Bilge didn't spawn all day.  And you'd be wrong.<BR>
<BR>
My advice - kill tons of gobs and keep tracking in different areas of zone.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok here is the true low down on bilge for all you who care.  He is a 24 (real time) hour spawn.  The reed belt is his common drop and the pearl kedge totem his rare drop.  His spawn point is random, although one place significantly more than others.  The common spawn point is in the water, out from the NPC camp.  As fas as him wandering in to the NPC camp and getting killed, that is also false.  He is a self terminating spawn.  Which means he disappears (or suicide) 15 minutes after his spawn.  When he spawns in the water, his first move is usually to swim over by the goblin camp along the shore.  From there he has a few different paths which seem to be ever changing.  Hope this helps.<BR>
And the price in this item, looks to be about 50Kpp on Tunare and most other servers around the same.  Take no less for it if you should happen to sell it.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Because I'm obsessed with all matters concerning Bilge, I can't help but respond to the above post.  I have no problem with people guessing about certain things regarding Bilge or any other matter.  Heck, a lot of info about Bilge and other stuff is based on rumor, hearsay, etc.  But the above post smacks of certainty and it's inaccurate about one thing and I suspect wrong about other itmes.<BR>
<BR>
I have spent more time in DC than I care to remember.  I have completed several LONG days (10+ hours) in DC, doing nothing but track in different locations with no one in zone capable of killing Bilge.  I am patient.  I am also furtunate, because I have killed him numerous times.  I'm currently auctioning off a kedge totem on Veeshan (my second).  And I can say with 100% absolute certainty that Bilge in not a 24-spawn.  I've killed him two times well within 24 hours.<BR>
<BR>
As for the rest of the information, I of course cannot verify or deny any of it.  And that's the problem.  If Veddar (and naturally I mean no disrespect here) says Bilge is on a 24 hour spawn and I know that's wrong, I find the rest of the information immediately suspect ESPECIALLY since I think it extremely unlikely anyone would know that kind of information.  For example, "the common spawn point is out in the water."  Huh?  How in the world does someone know this?  Sat underwater and seen him spawn?  Not likely.  Had him come into track range in that area?  That doesn't prove he spawned at the location, just that you picked him up on track.  Probably the most troubling aspect of this sentence is the implication that Veddar (or someone who told Veddar) has monitored Bilge's spawn point and can say the spawns "commonly" under the water near the NPCs.  On Veeshan, I can count on two fingers the number of players who spent as much time in DC (and killed him as many times) as I have and they sure as heck don't know his spawn point because they are running around tracking as much as I am.  Believe me, I watch them.  :)<BR>
<BR>
Not sure about the NPCs ignoring Bilge.  Never seen it, but it might be true.  The NPCs ignore Dwigus, of that I'm sure (again) because I have seen it.  But of course Dwigus is much higher level than Bilge.  Finally, that Bilge is a self-terminating spawn...that would be verified truth in only one of two very unusual circumstances.  Someone saw him go poof after watching him for 15 minutes (and please, who in their right mind would do that?) or you lose him on track and no one in zone killed him.  I think it is possible this is true or else the market might be more crowded with reed belts but I can't say for certain.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I have no answers.  I have started to see patterns when I've picked up Bilge but nothing approaching certainty.  Most of the time, I just track and move.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps.<BR>
