The guild Arcis will be holding an auction of some of its members on Sunday the 21st of January at 2pm EST. Each PC will be brought up, Race/Class/Lvl given and the bidding will begin. We encourage the entire server to come over and have some fun. I mean who wouldn't mind having a pet smart enough to fetch food and water for ya? There will be of course a few rules, however those will be stated before the auctioning. The duration will be approx 2 hrs from when the player is auctioned. After that time we will all head back to the Arena for a bit of drinking, a little fighting. And some time for the pets to thank their masters (with a swift kick to the arse). We hope to see you all there!<br>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Brad talks about Server Population">Brad talks about Server Population</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 01/15/01 16:20 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Looks like they have changed the target amount of users for peak times. Read about it below.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hi all,
<br>
<br>I wanted to bring up this issue officially and also talk about some aspects of it, and how we are looking to solve some of the issues.
<br>
<br>First of all, we are working to come up with a new target server population at peak hours number. Our inclination at this point is a number somewhere between 2300 and 2500 players during peak hours. We feel we need to adjust this number because of how much Velious has added to EverQuest's size and quantity of content.
<br>
<br>We also feel that undercrowding is probably more detrimental to the game than overcrowding, in that while crowded areas are frustrating in that there is greater competition involved, there are some advantages to it (help from others when an encounter goes bad, help with CRs, etc.). (No, I'm not saying Overcrowding is good overall -- so please don't misunderstand me). Undercrowding, however, can mean a player can't find anyone to play with, and thus leaves. In other words, that frustration can be worse.
<br>
<br>There have also been some problems with packet loss and link death, specifically on E'Ci, when populations are growing high.
<br>
<br>So, what are we going to do about all of this? Well, before launching new servers we're going continue to analyze where players are at, what zones are crowded, and what zones are underused. Significant experience bonuses are going in next patch for underused zones (mostly dungeons). 
<br>
<br>With E'Ci specifically we found out that after a recent hardware change, the network interface was incorrectly configured -- last night this was fixed, so please tell us if anything has improved.
<br>
<br>Also, when there are network problems out there with the Internet and a large group of players go link dead, this can cause zones to go down. We are working on this issue as well.
<br>
<br>So, there you have it, both gameplay and hardware solutions we hope will have significant effect. And please understand that any hesitation to launch new servers is due to undercrowding fears only -- if after these adjustments and attempts to better utilize all the zones we have it turns out target populations are lower than we believed, we will launch new servers, both split and new.
<br>
<br>thanks, and we look forward to your comments and feedback.
<br>
<br>-Brad

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>January 14, 2001
<br>
<br>Hello all,
<br>
<br>Since the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, the EverQuest Live team has been working on a number of things, from addressing issues in Velious to adding additional content to other portions of the world. At this same time, we've been working towards a point where we can stop tweaking class-based abilities, and declare with confidence that they are as "balanced" as we can make them.
<br>
<br>It is a foregone conclusion that the diversity of EverQuest's population will never let us reach a point where everyone will be perfectly satisfied with their class's abilities, as nearly every change we make tends to bother some people while pleasing others. Still, we are confident that we can reach a point where problems in our current game systems can be reduced to the point that those left are either negligible in their impact, or offset inversely by a similar problem affecting gameplay in an opposite direction. We're nearly there, but following heated debate and the review of material and opinions sent in by the players, we've decided to make some exciting and unprecedented changes to a game system that has remained intact since release: the experience system itself. 
<br>
<br>While the EverQuest Message-board FAQ states that the experience system is not subject to post-production changes, it also explains that as developers of an ongoing MMORPG in a dynamic world, there are times that we need to be flexible and address issues as necessary. Though it has always been our goal to avoid changes to core systems whenever possible, our additional goal of finalizing class balance takes precedence in this case. 
<br>
<br>We're going to depart from our usual method of releasing information by giving everyone some specific information in regards to how these systems currently work, and how they will work after the patch. It is very important to us that everyone understands our goals, and the fact that these changes are helpful to all of the players. We can only do that by giving you the details necessary for you to draw your own conclusions. 
<br>
<br>Zone Experience
<br>
<br>The first and perhaps easiest to explain change that we are making to the experience system is the modification of what we call the "Zone Experience Multiplier", or 'ZEM'. Currently, every creature in game of a given level yields a fixed amount of "Base Experience" (experience before it is allocated to group members). That base experience is then multiplied by the ZEM which is set to a value in correlation with the risk in a particular zone compared with the reward; at least, that is the goal.
<br>
<br>Recently we evaluated many underutilized dungeons and considered reasons why they might be underutilized. Some people suggested that proximity of bind locations plays a part, and as such we are considering adding more binding locations to the game. We of course will not allow everyone to bind on the doorstep of a dungeon, but these changes should hopefully reduce the potential run for a melee class. While additional binding locations probably will not be in the next patch, we did want to discuss our thoughts on the matter.
<br>
<br>Another suggestion, one that probably has the most merit, is that some dungeons are too risky given everything concerned. The natural conclusion is that we should increase the reward in order to offset the added risk. Our contention is that most people would rather be grouping and fighting their way through a dungeon because it's more fun, but feel "forced" to sit outdoors and camp zero-risk single spawns because it is safer and thus more efficient. While that statement might be true in an ideal world, it usually results in crowding in these popular outdoor zones (for example, Lake of Ill Omen or Oasis). The crowding in these zones really results in less efficient progress than one could make in a dungeon given a good group, but is still SAFE, at least ensuring that one will not have to tolerate "going backwards". 
<br>
<br>We can increase the reward of a particular dungeon in two fashions: We can either put in good loot, or we can change the ZEM. The problem with increasing the quality or quantity of loot is that if the loot is good enough, it's more likely to draw people far above the desired level range for the dungeon, making it some place that appropriately leveled folk choose to avoid. The second problem with the ever-increasing quality of loot is inflation: as good loot becomes more widely available, its value and the prestige value from owning it declines. 
<br>
<br>In this case, we decided that the most appropriate action for several underutilized dungeons would be to increase the ZEM; that is, increase the amount of experience that everyone gets when adventuring in the zone. 
<br>
<br>As of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in the following zones:
<br>
<br>Droga increased by 12% 
<br>Nurga increased by 12% 
<br>Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13% 
<br>Najena increased by 13% 
<br>Befallen increased by 13% 
<br>Paw increased by 13% 
<br>Permafrost increased by 13% 
<br>Kaesora increased by 18% 
<br>Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20% 
<br>Runnyeye increased by 20% 
<br>Kerra Ridge increased by 20% 
<br>The Hole increased by 25%
<br>Grouping Bonus
<br>
<br>We've always been the first to say that EverQuest is designed to promote grouping. Those who prefer to solo should be able to do so with some restrictions, but probably will not be able to go everywhere and do everything like a well-oiled, or like multiple well-oiled groups. This is a main foundation of EverQuest, and is what drove our decision to implement a class-based system where classes have strengths and weaknesses that complement each other. 
<br>
<br>Aside from making it so that the best gear requires groups, either to get quest items or get the best gear directly, our goal was to make it so that groups could advance faster than a solo player. One way we tried to reach this goal was by putting experience bonuses in dungeons, so our changes mentioned above should certainly help in that area. Another way we tried to reach that goal was by giving a per-kill experience bonus based on the size of the group. 
<br>
<br>One thing that has been confirmed by many of our high level players, both inside and outside the company, is that the "best" groups can already advance faster in a grouping situation than by any one member camping a single spawn. However, it has been pointed out that not everyone has the opportunity to get in the "best group". This led to many players choosing to "camp the single spawn" because they then do not have to worry about someone else getting their character killed. This in turn exacerbated the problem, as many players chose to "camp the single spawn" from creation to old age, and are just beginning to experience grouping and learn group-skills at about the time that dungeons become the most unforgiving. The inevitable result is that the level 50 "dungeon newbies" contribute to the fact that the group isn't the "best group". 
<br>
<br>Our goal is to get people grouping earlier, and provide them enough of a bonus where they do not feel that they are losing ground during the learning process. We feel we can do this by doubling the grouping experience bonus and by scaling it up based on the size of the group. Currently, the bonus is an additional 2% experience per group member, not counting the first one, leading to a maximum bonus of 10%. Following the next patch, the bonus will be as follows:
<br>
<br>2 person group - 2% total bonus. 
<br>3 person group - 6% total bonus. 
<br>4 person group - 10% total bonus. 
<br>5 person group - 14% total bonus. 
<br>6 person group - 20% total bonus.
<br>This bonus is applied to the total experience reward for killing a creature prior to distributing it to the group. 
<br>
<br>Many people have pointed out that when killing in a group you get less experience per kill. This is of course true, but what is often missed is that you can kill many more creatures, and creatures of a higher level when in that group. For instance, a good two-person group should be able to kill things of a higher level over twice as fast as a solo person should. Now, we're going to give them even more of a bonus for doing so, AND make it easier for people to find pickup groups on the basis of getting higher scaled bonus.
<br>
<br>Finally, we very well may decide to revamp and/or readjust NPC populations and/or experience multipliers in the future in order to ensure that groups adventuring there find them worthwhile.
<br>
<br>Experience Penalties - Description
<br>
<br>I think that it would be appropriate to say that most players are aware that there are different experience requirements for advancement based upon the race and class you choose to play. Ogres, for instance, require more experience to level than Halflings, and Shadowknights require more experience to level than Warriors. As such, an Ogre Shadowknight requires FAR more experience to level than a Halfling Warrior does. What some people have discovered is that when in a group, everyone shares in this penalty. Before getting into our plan, I think that its important to talk about what our goals were regarding experience penalties and the group sharing in that penalty.
<br>
<br>When EverQuest player characters were being designed, it was immediately apparent that some races and classes would be more powerful than others given versatility and other factors. Later, it came to light that the concept of being "more powerful" began to break down at the upper levels, given that everyone capped at the same level. We could not let any one race or class be immensely more powerful than another at that final point, as it would essentially put parts of the game off limits to those who chose the less powerful classes. While we did a good job of making races vary in power, but not so much as to be unbalancing, the same could not be said for classes. Still, though classes would be roughly equivalent in regard to the compelling reason to play them through versatility, the experience penalties were kept.
<br>
<br>In regards to the sharing of the experience penalty, it was apparent in beta, before the penalty was shared, that those playing characters without an experience penalty leveled faster than those that did. It was obvious that this would occur, but it was to the extreme that a group of friends, all playing together, would become separated to the point that they could no longer group efficiently in the mid to upper-mid levels. So we chose to distribute experience in the group on the basis of the total experience of each member rather than the level, in order to keep groups together. 
<br>
<br>As such, a level 20 Troll SK, having more experience total than a Human Wizard of the same level, would get more experience from each kill, while the total experience for the kill was unchanged. Essentially, the SK would take part of the Wizard's share were everything distributed equally to begin with.
<br>
<br>Experience Penalties - Resolutions
<br>
<br>Over the past week the EverQuest team has been considering experience penalties in all their forms. We had many meetings where the issue was hotly debated from both sides. We had to consider not only the effect on the individual player, but also the effect of any changes on the game as a whole. Eventually, we nearly unanimously decided the following:
<br>
<br>1. Race-based penalties are appropriate. An ogre, for instance, does indeed make a better warrior than a halfling. It is not so little that the faction and size problems make up for it, and not so much that it is really unbalancing at upper levels, but enough that the penalty should apply. Secondly, the penalty is not so severe (compared with class-based penalties) that it would cause groups to break up on the journey from one to sixty due to level differences.
<br>2. Class-based penalties are not appropriate. Classes are roughly equivalent in power throughout the level ranges, and the versatility does not make up for that penalty. In fact, the majority of changes made to classes in the name of balance in the last year were based on the assumption that, at the high end, each class should still be roughly as needed and balanced as any other. 
<br>
<br>3. Penalties, in any form, should not be shared with the group. Players know that no one class is immensely more powerful/valuable than another, and as such it is not fair to ask them to share a burden. If classes with penalties were really more powerful or valuable than the other classes, then it might be right, but that isn't the case here. Furthermore, sharing of penalties causes people to reject potential group members on the basis of them "sucking" too much experience.
<br>
<br>4. We're going to fix it.
<br>
<br>5. Class-based experience bonuses (which warriors and rogues get) are also not appropriate, as they cannot be so if penalties are not. However, we've decided to leave this as-is, since the bonus is not so severe as to be unbalancing. Bottom line: we don't feel the bonus is enough to warrant a fix that could be interpreted as a 'nerf'.
<br>
<br>Experience Penalties - Implementation
<br>Though people often refer to the class-based penalties as the "Hybrid Penalty", most classes have a penalty. Hybrids just have the largest. A hybrid requires 40% more experience to level than standard, Monks require 20% more, and Intelligence casters require 10% additional experience. 
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, we cannot change the experience tables themselves without running each character (which number in the tens of millions) through an "Experience Converter" without existing players changing levels spontaneously. While some might argue that we should grant free levels to everyone with a penalty, that would not be in the best interest of gameplay. After all, who would want a paladin with level 40 skills (skills in the player-sense, rather than the character-sense) in your level 60 group tomorrow? Everyone earns his or her experience under the rules that exist at the time. 
<br>
<br>This means that we must address the penalty differently: basically, for every kill, after all grouping bonuses and zone bonuses are applied, the experience will be split up according to level, rather than experience. For those classes that do not have a penalty, they will then be given that share. Those classes that have a penalty will get their share, multiplied by their experience penalty. Essentially we are creating extra experience to give to those with a penalty after everyone else has gotten their share. 
<br>
<br>Since penalties are always a value over "1", this results in the creation of additional experience. And, since shares are determined by level rather than total experience as before, a character will get just as much experience for a kill based upon the size and level of the group, regardless of the class makeup. Finally, everyone in the group gains experience at a faster rate because we're creating the additional experience for those with penalties out of thin air, rather than taking it from other members of the group. That means that after implementation, those without penalties will get more experience for every kill than they would have if they ever grouped with a class with a penalty.
<br>
<br>Now you'll notice that we are dividing up experience based upon the LEVEL makeup of the group. For instance, if a level 20 and a level 21 group together, the level 21 will get more experience per kill. That is however only fair since the level 21 does actually contribute more value to the group.
<br>
<br>There is a problem, however, with this 'new' formula. Death penalties are currently based off of the level before your current one. Secondly, everyone suffers the same numeric experience loss on death as anyone else of their race, regardless of class or class-based experience penalties. What this means is: if I am a cleric, and you are an SK of the same level and race, we both die and lose the same numeric value of experience (Example: 100,000 experience points). When we go back to recover from death, you as the SK will get your 100,000 points back faster than I will as a cleric, since all of the experience you get is multiplied by your class-penalty (1.4). Essentially, I lose and gain experience at 1.0, but you lose at 1.0, and gain at 1.4. 
<br>
<br>This is a balance issue we decided was also necessary to address. If we are going to make the statement that class experience penalties should not exist, we then have to do it on both ends (with exception to the two classes that we've decided to leave as-is). As such, rather than losing the same numeric value, loss on death will ALSO be multiplied by the experience penalty. Since everyone currently loses experience as if they are a warrior of their own race, we do not want anyone to lose more relative experience (e.g. experience such that recovery from death is more difficult). Hence, we further multiply the experience loss on death by the class experience modifier for warriors (0.9).
<br>
<br>In our example above, my cleric would lose 90,000 XP on death at my level (Same as before since clerics do not have an XP penalty), but your SK will lose 126,000 XP (Same as before, plus something to offset the experience gain bonus). Death is, however, still easier to recover from for both classes since we create experience out of thin air for every kill. 
<br>
<br>We felt that it was important to announce this as well since those with penalties will see a larger portion of their "bubble" lost upon a death, but will now recover that experience much faster. It's VERY important to understand this. Again, if you play a class that gets a bonus now when you make a kill, you will also lose more due to death. Please remember this when, after your first death post-patch, you see a greater experience loss on your screen: you are ALSO gaining more experience for each kill.
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>The changes that we are making in the next patch should have a profound impact upon the game:
<br>
<br>Classes no longer have a true class-based experience penalty, making it easier for people to play the class that they want to play, rather than the class that they feel compelled to play due to faster advancement. 
<br>Race based penalties are no longer shared with the group, and in truth are not severe enough to greatly impact the advancement speed of any particular race. Even the race with the worst penalty will level no slower than a human monk does now, and in truth will level faster due to the other changes that went in. 
<br>The grouping bonus increase, in addition to the other changes, makes grouping much more efficient, without reducing the current efficiency of soloing for those who prefer that route. 
<br>Experience modifiers turned up in the other zones should encourage people to spread out, have more fun, and allow those staying behind in other areas to have more fun themselves since the area is less crowded. 
<br>All players, assuming that they have an experience penalty, or ever group with anyone who does, will level faster.
<br>Many of these changes are quite involved in regards to their implementation, and as such we want to be sure that everyone interested understands them. Alan "Absor" VanCouvering will be happy to answer any questions that you may have on the EverQuest Message boards. Until then, we sincerely hope that these changes will help all players, whether "uber" or "causal", experience and enjoy EverQuest to their greatest potential.

<br>It will now be located in the Large Room of "The Tunnel" located in Eastern Commonlands. Everything else (time, date, prizes, etc.) will be the same. If you have any difficulties or further questions, please email me at mondijan@jinzoo.com
<br>
<br>Again, please let any member of the Lost Patrol (especially either Anigo, Leafrunner, Heavyboar, or Mondijan) know as soon as possible that you are interested in being in the competition.

Read about it below.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>While on a forray into the filthy lair of the Splitpaw gnolls to obtain spells for our necromancers today, we encountered an Iksar monk by the name of Master Vyyth Swiftscale deep in the bowels of the dungeon. He beseeched us to aid him in locating the paladin Brother Hayle so he could be 'freed'.
<br>
<br>While some were weary about aiding a follower of Cazic Thule on such a benevolent mission, we agreed anyway, if for no other reason that to find out the Iksar's true motives. Upon arriving at the entrance to the jail holding the Qeynos paladin, he made his those intentions clear: He was to destroy Brother Hayle. Being an open-minded group of adventurers we decided to listen to his motives before making the decision on whether or not to aid him. He sat down and told us a story of a pact of Gods and betrayal (the log of which I will have linked up shortly). Being Gods with similar motives, he explained a secret pact made between Innoruuk and Cazic, overseen by the Tribunal, to spread the glory of the deities across the face of Norrath. This began with the opening of terror in the Kithicor Woods and was to continue with the razing of Qeynos. To this end, Cazic Thule sent his son as an avatar to give him the city. This son was Brother Hayle. Overcome by fear, Brother Hayle decided to turn his back on his father, and sided with the Paladins of Qeynos, becoming one of them. Enraged by this turn of events, Cazic Thule banished his son to the festering cave of Infected Paw. However times are changing, and Brother Hayle's death has become necessary to fulfill the pact made by Cazic Thule and Innoruuk.
<br>
<br>After hearing his story we were shocked. Everyone's reaction was different. The paladins stalwartly insisted that no harm come to Brother Hayle. The Iksar and Tier'Dal viewed his death as a holy mission, and the key to unleashing the glory of their deities onto the face of Norrath. Worshippers of Fizzlethorpe could not see past the irony of the situation, thinking it all a great joke. The godless among us scoffed at the entire situation, disdaining meddling in the affairs of the supposed 'Gods'.
<br>
<br>In the confusion that ensued, Master Vyyth ran for the jail. The paladins and others attempted to block his entry into the cell, bodily, but the slippery lizard managed to dart past them. It was then that Brother Hayle was confronted and defeated by Master Vyyth, along with some present, as others watched in horror, knowing they were powerless to save the paladin.
<br>
<br>Master Vyyth left with cryptic words of returning to the Plane of Fear to report to his Master. One can only speculate at what, if anything, may arise from these developments. Only time will tell.

<br>----ATTENTION---
<br>By order of Sir Lucan, let it be know that a dangerous Dark Elf renegade has escaped into our fair city! Fortunatly, Loyal Teir'Dal are already on the track of this foul enchanter. On Saturday the 20th, the Phantom Guard will comb the city streets for their prey.
<br>
<br>BY ORDER OF THE FREEPORT MILITIA: All citizens will coorperate with these Dark Elves in any way possible. If approaced by the Dark Elves of the Phantom Guard, citizens will most likely be asked to identify themselves. Failure to do so, could result in the offender being reported to the Militia, or worse.
<br>
<br>If you happen to encounter the enchanter, DO NOT attempt to apprehend the individual, DO NOT approach him/her, DO report to the nearest Phantom Guard checkpoint.
<br>
<br>-Sir Lucan of Freeport- 
<br>
<br>/ooc
<br>Greetings all.
<br>I am pleased to announce that the Phantom Guard, Winterblood and Illumanati will be hosting a roleplaying event in East Freeport on Saturday the 20th at 3 PM EST, we hope that many people will partake in this event. So if you are hailed by a Dark Elf and ordered to identify yourself, then either play along or just let us know that you are not a roleplayer.
<br>
<br>Should there be anyone who would want to play a greater part in the event (read: assist the occupational forces), please e-mail me, post a reply here, or post on the guild message board at www.geocities.com/eqphantomguard/home.htm
<br>
<br>Hope to see you there

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>There are several fixes going in with the next patch. Due to the volume of requests for information regarding these topics, I thought it might be useful to mention them all at once in a separate thread.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
The Trueshot discipline will be modified, it will be more effective (to exactly what degree we have yet to determine)<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We’re looking at Celestial Healing. All the data shows that it always overwrote regen. I’ll take your word that it didn’t. But, whether it did before or not, we’ll look at it and see what it really should do, and either change it or leave it as is. I don’t know which it will be right now, but I think we’re leaning toward making them stack.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Trueshot, when first implemented, was horribly broken. We, basically, gave the archer a minimum amount of damage using the Trushot, plus some modifiers. It turns out that doing this made the fast bows way too good, because their low base damage was being ignored, and some of the higher damage bows were made worse because their base damage was also being ignored.<BR>
So we recently changed it recently to work as intended. There is an amount of damage added to the base damage of the bow. So higher damage bows use their base damage, as do lower damage bows. The discipline is now working as intended…<BR>
<BR>
But we agree that ‘as intended’ in this case isn’t really good enough. We are evaluating some changes to the discipline, and we are running them on test. We are thinking about increasing the damage, or increasing it a bit more and reducing the duration… We’ll let you know what form the changes will take as soon as we are more certain what they will be. But we will definitely be improving the discipline.<BR>

<BR>
I find it hard to defend the fact that we missed this bug. I can assure you that it is not because we harbor some secret hatred of bards. For as many bugs as we’ve missed regarding bards, we’ve caught many more. There is no excuse for missing it. But it happened. And we’re sorry that it slipped past us.<BR>
<BR>
We’ll be patching again as soon as we can. But we won’t be making an emergency patch for this one bug. Again, I’m sorry that we introduced this bug, and I’m going to look into how it was that this got past us.<BR>

<br> Freeport. The Event will also be announced within the game 10

<br>There are several new brewing recipes that may now be discovered on the production servers. The books containing the instructions for these recipes are not yet available in game. The books will be available after the next patch.
<br>
<br>The multi-charged Shaman Potions will now sell to vendors for the appropriate values instead of the same as one charge potions.
<br>
<br>Several other minor tuning changes and fixes have been made as well, such as impossible race/class/deity combinations listed on trade skilled items.
<br>
<br>With my attention not completely consumed by Velious now, I intend to address many of the long standing issues such as the lack of Imbued and Cultural items for all race and deity combinations, Elven Chainmail/Tier`Dal Chain Mail Boots, Blue Diamonds in Jewelcrafting, etc.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>This saturday, let's all take a brief break from the leveling and the loot mongering for...
<br>The Running of the Gnomes!
<br>What? A footrace using level 1 gnome characters.
<br>When? This Saturday, beginning at 1:00 PM EST (10 AM PST)
<br>Where? The entrance to Akanon in the Steamfont Mountains
<br>Who? Anyone who wants to attend.
<br>Why? To have a good time.
<br>
<br>Sign up below if you think you'll attend. Questions/comments welcome 
<br>
<br>
<br>Phat lewtz? Yeah, I'll put together some sort of prize package, but this isn't a contest to win a Cloak of Flames or a Fungi Tunic. It will mainly be something to throw some adventure back into the old world, where so many of us take for granted our ability to walk from one end to the other without fear.
<br>
<br>The Rules:
<br>
<br>The honor system will be used. This means you will be trusted to follow these rules. I will be watching, as will others, but mostly, the success of this event relies on trusting the contestants to play fairly. (i.e. Don't have guildmates train other runners, etc.)
<br>
<br>Each player who wishes to attend will begin a level 1 gnome character, the class of your choice.
<br>
<br>This character may posess nothing on his person, not even the guild tunic and newbie weapon. No additional armor, money, potions, Jboots, or other twinkage. We're talking naked as the day you were born.
<br>
<br>You may carry the 5 pieces of food and water you recieve upon birth. That's all.
<br>
<br>All characters must have names beginning with the letters "Run", followed by whatever you wish (Runhwedung, for example). This will more easily facilitate my ability to track the contestants.
<br>
<br>No Anonymous/Roleplay tags allowed. I must be able to track you to a specific zone via "/who all gnome 1 run"
<br>
<br>No buffs will be allowed. No Spirit of Wolf, no Invisibility, no bard songs, no Jboots, no potions, no enduring breath, nothing that would give you an advantage over your fellow runners.
<br>
<br>Should someone cast such a spell on you, you must immediately click it off. Any runners caught using buffs will be disqualified.
<br>
<br>If the buff cannot be self-removed (HP and AC buffs), it may remain, but you may not request such buffs or prearrange friends to buff you. That honor system again.
<br>
<br>No teleports.
<br>
<br>You may bind in cities as you travel, if you wish to take the time to stop and request a bind. However, these pitstops will require you to slow your travel, so take this into consideration.
<br>
<br>All characters must be level 1 when they reach the finish line.
<br>
<br>Prizes will be awarded to your main character later, but please keep in mind that this event is strictly for fun! 
<br>
<br>

<br>Why: To heal the sick, aid the dying, and give some stuff away
<br>Hail and well met, Norrathians!
<br>
<br>The members of Random Acts are pleased to announce another First Aid Camp, this Sunday, January 14th, in the Butcherblock Mountains. We'll be setting up our tents at 9am PST, noon EST on the Morrell-Thule server.
<br>
<br>Our expert healers, buffers, binders, and camp-breakers will be there to aid any and all adventurers as they battle their way through the zone. Just look for the Random Acts guild tags. We'll be there for a few hours, so this would be a great day to bring your lower-level character, or start a new one!
<br>
<br>We will also be giving away the surplus items we have picked up in our journeys around Norrath. No epic quest weapons yet, I'm afraid, but we may have something you can use! 
<br>
<br>As ever, there will be no charge for any of our services during the event. Everyone is invited to attend. Solo players and guilds are encouraged to email us or see our message board for details on how you can participate in this or future events.
<br>
<br>Hope to see you there!

<br>Well, we've been giving all of this a lot of thought (as have you all). I've been thinking about the issues in two separate contexts: 1. what could be done with EQ to make it better in this area and 2. what could be done in the future to make MMOGs but probably not to EQ.

<br>So, focusing on #1 for the time being, here are a few things we might try short term:
<br>
<br>1. The post that probably disturbed me most (actually, I didn't respond to it because I wanted to give it more thought) was the one that claimed many classes could advance more efficiently soloing than in a group, but that soloing inherently involves more boring downtime, so therefore we encourage boring downtime for those who want to play efficiently with that subset of classes. 
<br>
<br>Now, EQ has always been a game focused on grouping, with a subset of classes that could solo if the player chose, but soloing was supposed to be slower and probably less exciting. No, we don't 'hate' the solo player or some such, but we think it might be impossible to make a great grouping AND great soloing game (oh no, I probably just started a new gigantic thread with that one -- if so, please start it somewhere else so we don't get too confused, thanks). So, we designed most of the game in terms of balance and content around grouping. BUT, if we've erred and some classes can solo and gain experience more quickly than were they to group AND these players feel therefore compelled to solo when they might be happier grouping, then we've goofed up.
<br>
<br>To this end, we are seriously considering significantly increasing the grouping experience bonus, where the more people in your group, the bigger the exp bonus you get.
<br>
<br>2. Risk vs. reward, especially in dungeons. One of the very easy ways we could 'revamp' underused zones would be to increase the experience you get across the board in that zone (in case some of you didn't know, there's simply an experience modifier field in each zone header). What does this have to do with downtime? Well, it indirectly helps out, because one would advance more quickly in these dungeons, and one could also recover experience loss due to death more quickly in these zones. For example, would low to mid level players head to Najena were that zone to give out significantly more exp? (Yes, that's a question to all of you &&)
<br>
<br>3. Lastly, we MAY consider more teleport spots, perhaps with soul bound keys. MAYBE. My inclination is no, but we're going to seriously debate it today.
<br>
<br>Oh, and on a semi-related note, many of you have concerns over our announcement of our plans to revamp old world zones using techniques similar to Kunark and Velious. Though Absor alluded to this, I wanted to be very clear: this does NOT mean necessarily increasing the difficulty. Our attempt in general will be to keep the style and difficulty levels of the old world zones pretty much the same. We realize that old world zones, Kunark zones, and Velious zones are different also in difficulty and types of groups required to adventure in them. I think this is a GOOD thing -- players with different playstyles, time available, etc. can focus on different areas of the world. What we want to do with many of the old world zones is as follows:
<br>
<br>1. adjust the experience gained (as mentioned above).
<br>2. randomize existing loot (to hopefully help camping issues)
<br>3. completely re-do pathing from scratch on some of the bad ones (Mistmoore comes to mind). We know more about pathing now, and MAYBE we can make some of these tricky dungeons better -- but no promises (we can't change the geometry, after all).
<br>4. Add some cool quests.
<br>
<br>Anyway, these are our thoughts going forward, but nothing is set in stone yet, so we'd love your feedback as well.
<br>
<br>thanks,
<br>

And in an update (http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045899.html)
<br>After a long meeting that started before lunch and ended just now (we did break to eat, though), here's what we're going to try out short-term:
<br>1. Increase the grouping experience bonus significantly. It's currently 2% for each group member other than yourself. When it's finalized and about to go live, we will release the actual percentages.
<br>
<br>2. Increase the experience modifier for underutilized Old World and Kunark dungeons. We will post the percentage by which these dungeons were increased when this data goes live.
<br>
<br>3. Place more bind spots in the Old World and Kunark (we decided to try this as opposed to more teleports). These will most likely be placed somewhat near to dungeons we consider underutilized.
<br>
<br>Realistically, these changes will probably go live not this patch (hey, it's tonight/tomorrow), but rather the next one.
<br>
<br>More longer term, we are doing to randomize loot, re-path, and even totally revamp some Old World dungeons.
