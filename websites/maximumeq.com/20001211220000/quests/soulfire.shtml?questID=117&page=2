**Submitted by Chris B.**<BR>
<BR>
"The quest for the Soulfire is VERY long, and involved. To begin the quest you must speak to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of Truth (In North Freeport). She'll give you a note which you need to deliver to Guard Alayle (Or something close), a spy in the freeport militia building. Go in and<BR>
deliver the note, only to receive an illegible peice of paper in return (And get to see the guard get killed). Take the note back to Kalatrina, and she'll tell you to talk to Rashinda Elore in the Freeport Office of the People (NOTE : Once you give the note to Kalatrina, you'll have to wait six<BR>
hours to get another one.) Ask Rashinda "Have you heard of Zimel's Blades?', then ask her about Ariska Zimel ('Who was Ariska Zimel?'), and finally about Groflah Steadirt ('Who is Groflah Steadirt?'). Head back to Kalatrina and<BR>
tell her that Zimel's Blades was condemned. After this, it's time to visit Groflah Steadirt. Go to Groflah's forge in North Freeport, and give him the note. He will give it back, and tell you to meet him in the seafarers roost<BR>
at night. Don't bet on seeing him. I have stayed in that building for nearly two straight days, without seeing him once. Instead, wait for a beggar named 'Tykar Renlon' (Or something close, he's the only beggar who appears) to<BR>
spawn and immediately set about giving him five Drom's Champagnes. He disappears quickly, so you must hurry. Once you've given him all five, he'll give you a blanket. Go make yourself some bog juice and edible goo (Two easy<BR>
baking and brewing recipes), then give one goo to the beggar in jail. Once he asks for 'Bog'n goo! Blanket too!', give him 1 bog juice, 1 edible goo, and the blanket, to get a key (H.K. 102). Take the key to the banker in high<BR>
keep to get a note. Give this note to Brother Hayle (The Cleric imprisoned in Splitpaw - Be careful you don't lock yourself in his cell!), and he'll give it back to you, as well as the intructions of what else to get to gain<BR>
the Soulfire. He will tell you to get the Glowing Hilt, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, and your Testimony. The Glowing Hilt is found on Xicotl, the troll shadowknight in Mistmoore Castle. To get the Brilliant sword of faith, kill<BR>
Sir Lucan D'lere and his skeletal remains, gain his testimony, then give that testimony to Valeron. To get your Testimony, first speak to Merko in the hall of truth. He'll give you a note to give to  Altunic Jartin in EC.<BR>
Wait in Altunic's house for him to appear (It's near the last inn before WC), and give him the note. Walk outside, and fight Squire Narl. He packs a good punch, and his Harm Touch can be painful on a lower-level character,<BR>
but he's not too hard. After killing him and getting his head, go buy a cloth shirt from one of the merchants in the commons (I beleive the inn between orc camps sells the shirt). Give the head to Altunic, then give him<BR>
the shirt, to get a Token of Generosity. Buy (Or fight for one) a Spider Venom Sack, and return to Merko. Tell him you've earned the Token of Generosity, and he'll ask you for the sack. Give it to him, and get the Token of Bravery. Then hand in both tokens to get your final task : Run into<BR>
the sewers and kill the Militia spy there, and return her token to Merko to get your Testimony. Once you have all these items, hand the returned note from bother hayle, the hilt, the sword, and the testimony to Brother Hayle<BR>
(NOTE : You must have AT LEAST Kindly faction with him, or you'll have to start all over again!) to receive the Soulfire.<BR>
<BR>
<p><BR>
The Soulfire is the coolest looking sword in the game, with flames running<BR>
up the length. It's only attainable by a good group of level 40+ players, as<BR>
killing Lucan is a very hard thing to do."</div>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>First. It is true that once you make level 10, Kalatrina<BR>
wont give you the quest, but you can start it by having a<BR>
level 1 to 9 paladin start it, and hand you the letter.<BR>
once you have the letter (it is not no drop) you then<BR>
continue from there.<BR>
<BR>
Second, Guard Alayel is found out in the back courtyard<BR>
of the militia house, he will be standing in the shadows<BR>
under the balcony. Handing him the nate will cause the<BR>
corrupt guards to kill him. So if he is not there, just<BR>
wait around for him to respawn or go do other things and<BR>
keep checking back frequenly.<BR>
<BR>
Third, it was stated that once you do your testimony quest<BR>
you will automatically become KOS to Freeport Militia. This<BR>
is NOT TRUE. I did my testimony quest at level 5 (with help)<BR>
and am now level 42, and have killed a few militia and <BR>
turned in thier helms for the bounty, and I am still not<BR>
KOS. But I am very close to it. Point is, getting your <BR>
Testimony DOES NOT make you KOS.<BR>
<BR>
It was also asked if 2 people can turn in items like you<BR>
can do on JBoots quest. No. Most items in the SoulFire <BR>
quest are no drop, and for some reason, this is one of the <BR>
many quests that somehow keep track of who hands what. So<BR>
the person doing the quest has to be the one turning in the<BR>
items. Perhaps it was dont as this is one of the Paladins<BR>
Holy sword, and as a Paladin, you shouldn't cheat the quest.<BR>
<BR>
Also, when you give the first note to kalatrina, she keeps<BR>
it. You can get a second not by restarting the quest. Or, <BR>
instead of giving Kalatrina the note, you are able to skip<BR>
that step. If you just keep the note, and go straight to<BR>
the office of the people, you can get the information you<BR>
need to inform Kalatrina of. NOTE: You CANNOT just tell<BR>
Kalatrina that Zimel's Blades has been condemned without<BR>
going to the Office of The People. You MUST have the person<BR>
in the Office Of The People tell you it was condemned and<BR>
THEN you can tell Kalatrina.<BR>
<BR>
Non human Paladins may have to do some faction work for The<BR>
Knights Of Truth. It's best to start your Testimony and <BR>
SoulFire quest with an AMIABLE faction rating. Knights of<BR>
Truth faction is easy. In West Freeport Newbie Area, and in<BR>
East Commons, just kill every orc you see. Your faction will<BR>
go up rapidly.<BR>
<BR>
The only part of the quest that is near impossible now is<BR>
the Sir Lucan fight. While before it required a couple<BR>
good high level groups, now with the beefed up gate guards<BR>
it's basically a suicide mission. But there is a tactic that<BR>
will work, if it is done right. Follow this line of attack<BR>
for the Lucan fight.<BR>
<BR>
#1. Position your 2 high level  groups near the West<BR>
Freeport / East Commons zone border. Anyone in the combat<BR>
groups that are KoS to FP Militia should stay clear as to<BR>
not attract a fight before it is wanted.<BR>
<BR>
#2. Position a "detainer" (can be any level, as long as<BR>
they are not KoS to militis) near the zone. This should <BR>
only be 1 person, and they can be a member of one of the<BR>
groups if you desire. They have a specific job to do<BR>
just before the fight, so make sure they stay alert.<BR>
<BR>
#3. You need a runner. MAKE SURE this person had SoW, and<BR>
is not KoS to Militia. A shaman would work best, as they<BR>
have the self only speed boost of Spirit of the Cheeta.<BR>
It is this persons job to start the whole fight, so MAKE<BR>
SURE they are NOT in either of the combat groups.<BR>
<BR>
#4. Your runner, SoW equiped, must know the militia house<BR>
well. Have them go in, and enguage Sir Lucan. Once they<BR>
do this, damn near every miltia around will be out for their <BR>
blood. Once the runner enguages Sir Lucan, they immediately<BR>
make a break for the East Commons Zone. Make good use of<BR>
Spirit of the Cheeta. The runner should know EXACTLY where<BR>
the "Detainer" is, and zone there.<BR>
<BR>
#5. Once the runner zones, the Detainer should quickly target <BR>
Sir Lucan and HAIL him. Do not hail untill AFTER the runner<BR>
zones, and make sure Detainer and Runner are not grouped <BR>
together or Sir Lucan will attack. The Detainer should KEEP<BR>
HAILING Sir Lucan OVER AND OVER. This will cause Sir lucan<BR>
to stay at the zone, while the other guards that trained out<BR>
after the runner will return to their posts.<BR>
<BR>
#6. Once all the other guards leave, and are VERY FAR away <BR>
from Lucan, then both combat groups should be safe to move<BR>
in and take Lucan out. I do not know if Lucan will try to<BR>
flee when he gets low on health, so he should be rooted as<BR>
much as possible towards the end of combat. Or at the very<BR>
least, he should be snared.<BR>
<BR>
#7. Once you kill Sir Lucan, his Skeleton will rise up and<BR>
attack, you must kill his skelleton also.<BR>
<BR>
#8. It may be a good idea to have reserve people standing<BR>
by, so that if anyone in a group dies, the group leader can<BR>
remove the dead group member and invite a fresh body into<BR>
the group to assist. Make sure all group members agree that<BR>
if they fall in combat, it is ok to remove and replace them.<BR>
<BR>
(note: this is only an RP suggestion, as any people standing<BR>
by can assist in the lucan fight, they just will not likely<BR>
get any experience.)<BR>
<BR>
If all the steps are exicuted correctly and safely, Lucan<BR>
should be taken out without too many losses.<BR>
<BR>
BE FORWARNED: This portion of the SoulFire quest will make<BR>
quite a few people in the groups KoS to Freeport militia.<BR>
if you are in a group, and do not wish to be KoS, I <BR>
suggest you take the following steps:<BR>
<BR>
First, make sure the groups know that you dont want to be<BR>
KoS, and make sure they dont have a problem with these<BR>
steps.<BR>
<BR>
Second, just before lucan is about to fall, I suggest you<BR>
drop from group and ZONE IMMEDIATELY! This should wipe<BR>
agro, and after Lucan is killed, you shouldnt take any<BR>
faction hits.<BR>
<BR>
Please keep in mind, this will leave groups short, and <BR>
Lucan's skelleton must still be killed. So by doing<BR>
this, you could jepordize the entire mission.<BR>
<BR>
Also keep in mind, this fight is usually done on the<BR>
behalf of one paladin. This paladin must be the one to <BR>
loot the corpses. This is an "HONOR FIGHT". So all people<BR>
participating should be certain that there is a HIGH<BR>
PROBABILITY that they may die. If you have a problem with<BR>
this, DO NOT AGREE TO HELP.<BR>
<BR>
There is nothing more frustraiting than organizing a <BR>
major event like this, only to have people back out at the<BR>
last minute because they dont want to be KoS or loose any<BR>
experience.<BR>
<BR>
All participants should know AND ACCEPT THE FACT that they<BR>
may end up KoS and they may loose a little experience. But,<BR>
assisting a Paladin in recieving their Holy Sword (if the<BR>
Paladin is worth of the title "Paladin") will ensure that<BR>
the next time you are in need of a group of people to <BR>
assist you in a quest, you will be sure of atleast 1 person<BR>
that wont let you down.<BR>
<BR>
And my advice to all Paladins who recieve their SoulFire:<BR>
<BR>
Keep a list of names by your computer. Write down the name<BR>
of every person that helps you in this quest, and remember<BR>
them. Upon recieving SoulFire, you will owe these people<BR>
a great debt. DO NOT abandon them. If they ever need<BR>
assistance with anything, your name SHOULD be at the top<BR>
of the list of people assisting them.<BR>
<BR>
After all, Honor is the way of the Paladin.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>You can start this quest at ANYTIME now...I just started at level 35.  Testimony and all.  No need to start before 35 as killing Lucan and getting the hilt will be very tough.  I am going to have to have a well-coordinated party of 40+ people to bring down Lucan and also to get into MM safely.  By-the-way, go to www.gameznet.com/eq/quest/zimelsblades for a nice printout of the quest.  You can skip numbers 4 and 6...those are NOT necessary.  And the guard named Alayle is in the courtyard as you go out the BACK door of the bldg...look to your right just outside the door.  You may have to wait for him to spawn.  I was in there twice and he was there both times.  And remember not to help him with the guards or you could die as well.  If you get the printout of Zimels Blades, follow everything closely..skipping 4 and 6...and you only need a skill of one to make the Bog Juice (brewing) and Edible Goo (cooking)...I bought the juice in the bars near bank in NF and made the Goo with rat ears (newbie area at gate) and fire beetle eyes (same area)  <BR>

 Well, im sad to say that our attempt in killing sir lucan last night has failed. We had about 50 people there only to come about with about 20 who had not died, or almost been killed. We had a very good chance, BUT, for some reason Sir Lucan now has i guess what you could call body guards that follow him EVERYWHERE! be careful when attempting to do this quest, sir lucan is lvl 50 and quad hits for a whoping 125, not to good if your a caster, amazingly, i survived for about 30 seconds lol, neways, it is very hard to kill him, we tried to kill him for 4 hours and everything went bad..........neways, we will be attmpting this sunday again at about 6pm pacific time....if you have a lvl 50 charecter on mith marr the help would be greatly appreciated<BR>

Second. One post mentioned a faction requirement for Brother<BR>
Hayle in Splitpaw. What faction does he belong to? Does <BR>
anyone know of a newbie quest that will raise faction with<BR>
him? I have never been to Splitpaw, is there any strategy<BR>
that will help reach Brother Hayle?<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Thanx :-)<BR>
<BR>
The question about Faction for Brother Hayle. I am somewhat<BR>
curious myself. First, he is a Paladin (Cleric?) from Qeynos<BR>
and I raised my faction using 2 small quests. First, you can <BR>
turn in the red bandit sashes to the Temple of Thunder in<BR>
Qeynos. I forget which paladin you turn them into. I believe<BR>
it is the paladin standing outside of the building on what <BR>
looks like a large area rug. He is standing next to a<BR>
merchant that sells shields. Although I am not 100% confident<BR>
of my memory on this, I suggest you talk to all the NPC's to<BR>
see which offers the quest, or at the very least, do a few<BR>
/shouts and ask if anyone in zone knows.<BR>
<BR>
Second, if I am not mistaken, there is also a newbie "Box Of<BR>
Bone Chips" quest you can do. I dont remember if this one is<BR>
given in the Temple of Life or House of Thunder. Again, would<BR>
be best to check around. My advice, go to Tox, make your way <BR>
into the Newbie area of Paineel. Take ALOT of empty packs, as<BR>
I spent about 2 hours killing skells, and in 2 hours, I filled<BR>
6 back packs full of stacks of 20 bone chips. Wall to wall<BR>
Skells here, not alot of people, no experience, but you will<BR>
get all the bone chips you can carry in a very short time.<BR>
<BR>
I was also told once that there is a way to "buy" faction. I<BR>
tried this with a compairable cleric in Erudin, and it didnt<BR>
work, but 2 bro's of mine did do it in Qeynos and raised their<BR>
faction in this manner. Look for a cleric in the Temple of Life<BR>
who (when haild) offers to heal you or cure your disease or<BR>
poison. Pay him 4 gold for a quick heal spell. You will hear<BR>
the trumpets sound like you recieved experience. You will not<BR>
get an experience message and will not actually gain experience<BR>
but at the time they did it, you did recieve positive faction.<BR>
(NOTE: Ofcourse, this was quite some time ago, and we all know<BR>
Verant, when they discover something in the game that works<BR>
to OUR advantage, it must immediately be "fixed" so that you<BR>
cannot achieve your goals)  :-)<BR>
<BR>
Now, someone mentioned that in order to recieve SoulFire from<BR>
Brother hayle, you must have ATLEST Kindly faction. I was <BR>
also told by people on the Karana server (when I did shouts<BR>
asking what my faction needs to be) about 50% of the people<BR>
shouted back that faction needs to be Kindly or better, and <BR>
the other 50% shouted back that it has to be WARMLY.<BR>
(and ofcourse, when I shouted "HOW MANY OF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY<BR>
POSITIVE?" The response was, 100% of them were positive.) So<BR>
Your guess is as good as mine. But, since I have all the items<BR>
and all I have left to do is to trade them all for Soulfire<BR>
I figure my advice would be to do what I am going to do. Play<BR>
it safe. Just bite down, do the faction work, and raise your<BR>
faction to "WARMLY" which is the highest faction, and then<BR>
you'll know for sure that when you trade the quest items<BR>
in you will recieve SoulFire.<BR>
<BR>
About the question of how to do the "Brother Hayle" portion:<BR>
<BR>
First, take the letter you got from the bank in High Keep, and<BR>
go to SplitPaw. IMPORTANT: Bring a friend. Preferably one that<BR>
can cast invisibility on you. If you cant get someone that can<BR>
cast invisibility, bring anyone you want, and spend a few platinum<BR>
and get you both ATLEAST 2 Invis Potions each. At Any rate, <BR>
YOU WILL NEED ANOTHER PERSON WITH YOU.<BR>
<BR>
Print out a map of paw so that you can find the jail cells. Go<BR>
into Paw, and make your way to the cell blocks. Hayle is in the <BR>
last cell at the end of the passage. <BR>
<BR>
There are levers on the wall that operate a couple cells at<BR>
a time. Search for the lever that opens Brother Hayle's cell.<BR>
Once you open the cell, go in and hail him.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: If you were smart, you used 1 invis potion to get to the<BR>
cell. Hayle will not talk to you while you are invisible, and he<BR>
con indifferent. To get an accurate reading of your "con<BR>
status" you must make yourself visible.<BR>
<BR>
Hand the letter to Hayle, and you will recieve faction, experience, <BR>
he will tell you what items he requires from you. He will also<BR>
give you a new copy of the letter. Keep it, you'll need to<BR>
give it back to him again when you turn in everything else.<BR>
<BR>
Once you kill Lucan and trade his testimony for the<BR>
"Brilliant Sword Of Faith", and get the Glowing Sword Hilt<BR>
from Xicotl in Mistmoor, you need to take the sword of faith,<BR>
the glowing hilt, YOUR testimony, and the letter that Hayle gave<BR>
back to you, and return them all to Brother hayle again.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: Once you enter the cell to talk to hayle, the jail<BR>
cell door will close locking you in. Hence the need for a friend.<BR>
Make sure your friend DOES NOT enter the cell. When you are<BR>
finished with your business, they need to throw the lever<BR>
again to let you out. Then you can either teleport out of<BR>
Paw (if your friend has that ability) or drink your second<BR>
invis potion and walk (run) back out.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helped, if ya need anything else, just E-Mail me<BR>
(my e-address is on my previous post or look me up on the<BR>
Karana Server)<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Oops... me again... forgot to answer the other question:<BR>
<BR>
Grofflah Steadirt: When he spawns? At night. But you have<BR>
to keep in mind, Verant played a rude trick on us. For Paladins<BR>
to get their swords, we must enlist the aid (information) of<BR>
Grofflah Steadirt. But, the forces of evil are constantly<BR>
working against us. The ultimate evil (i.e. Verant) has also<BR>
included Grofflah in a second quest. That of the darker classes,<BR>
and in THEIR quest, they must PREVENT Grofflah from divulging<BR>
sensitive information that Sir Lucan does not want him imparting<BR>
to any would be seekers of a certain sword that Lucan himself<BR>
wishes to aquire. So, Lucan has gone out of his way to convince<BR>
some of the "less moral elements" of Norrathian society to<BR>
"silence" Grofflah once and for all.<BR>
<BR>
In Short, you need Grofflah to show up to give you information <BR>
you need for your quest. And at the same time, there are others<BR>
who need to KILL Grofflah. So, it's pot luck.<BR>
<BR>
Give him the note, and then do what he says. Go to the Seafarers<BR>
Roost and wait for him. He will show up durring the night time<BR>
hours (if he has not be otherwise detained or killed). Once<BR>
the morning comes, if he has not showed up, all you can do is go<BR>
back to Grofflah's and try again.<BR>
<BR>
Stick with it, sooner or later you will see him and get the<BR>
information you need.<BR>
