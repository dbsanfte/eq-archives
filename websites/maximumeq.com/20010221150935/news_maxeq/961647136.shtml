As infrequently as pickpocket will get an item, and as infrequently as the creatures drop spells, and considering that there's no way to tell when killing it that it has a spell, I really don't see a need to eliminate this.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We're going to be testing keyboard translations for international users on the Test server over the next week or two. Logging on to the test server will create a file named "Keyboard.txt" in your everquest directory. This file may be edited to put in alternate keyboard definitions. <BR>
Editing this file isn't exactly an easy task, but we're hoping that enough people will log on from the various areas to present us with alternate Keyboard.txt files that we can put up on the web page. <BR>
<BR>
If any users of alternate standard keyboards would like to try their hand at editing the file, please give it a shot and test it out. Assuming everything works out, please email your modified Keyboard.txt file to jbutler@verant.com.<BR>
<BR>
Here's a copy of the patch message that will be on the test server shortly:<BR>
<BR>
---snip---<BR>
Today the testeqgame.exe file was updated to allow users to modify their keyboard layout in order to account for some international keyboards. When the executable launches, it will create a file in your EverQuest directory named “KEYBOARD.TXT”. You may modify this file using an ASCII text editor to substitute keys where appropriate. <BR>
<BR>
The beginning of the file contains un-shifted keys, and the end contains the character that will be printed when the SHIFT key is depressed. Feel free to edit this file as you wish, but take care to leave any unprintable characters or spaces intact. If you make a mistake editing this file and have problems, merely delete the file. A new default version will be created the next time that testeqgame.exe is launched.<BR>
<BR>
If you use a standardized keyboard layout other than QWERTY, such as the French AZERTY layout, we would be interested in seeing your version of the file. After you’ve modified and tested your version of the KEYBOARD.TXT file, please email it along with a description of what standard it is for to jbutler@verant.com. <BR>

*Patch Day*<BR>
<BR>
Hello everyone,<BR>
<BR>
Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future.  Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch.  Most of the changes are in regards to quests:<BR>
<BR>
- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed<BR>
- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<BR>
- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.<BR>
- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<BR>
- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the Lost Circle.  <BR>
<BR>
A few items have also been changed this week:<BR>
<BR>
- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<BR>
- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See Below).<BR>
- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear when you log off (See Below.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<BR>
<BR>
We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect.  Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.  <BR>
<BR>
The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now.<BR>
<BR>
*Gunthak Harpoon*<BR>
<BR>
In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff.  Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.  Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it.  <BR>
<BR>
For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time that you log out.  This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession.  We do apologize to those who acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<BR>
<BR>
*Chat / Login Process*<BR>
<BR>
The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate, meaning that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of people in the chat server.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
