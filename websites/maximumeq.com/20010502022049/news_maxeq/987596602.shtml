<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Big Time Changes On Official Boards">Big Time Changes On Official Boards</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 03/29/01 07:13 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>The following says it all...</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,
<p>
Upon EverQuest’s release, Sony Online Entertainment, then a separate company, came to Verant Interactive and proposed that they set up and host community message boards on the EverQuest site. The purpose of these boards was to provide a place for EverQuest players to hang out, get to know each other, and basically do what EverQuest players do in any of dozens of message forums hosted by EverQuest fan sites.
<p>
As they grew more popular, a culture of dedicated and knowledgeable players formed, and the forums quickly evolved into a place where game design concepts were discussed freely by a relatively small group of people. As a developer always open to new ideas, the boards did not go unnoticed by the EverQuest design team, and we began commenting on issues there regularly.
<p>
As the weeks went on, some EverQuest players heard that the “Official” EverQuest forums were the place to go if you wanted to speak with the EverQuest Development Team. As issues were addressed, it was apparent that the boards were a phenomenal tool for collecting player feedback, listening to issues, and occasionally to release information.
<p>
In late 1999, we decided to even further our commitment to communicate with players about development issues – a philosophy that remains true to this day. And it seemed the boards were the best place to do this. To that end, a full-time Community Relations Manager was hired to not only disseminate information to the public via the boards, but also to bring the public’s issues to the development team such that valid player issues would be addressed and not overlooked – the latter part being key.
<p>
Fast-forward to today: Unfortunately, the EverQuest message boards are often a hotbed of exaggerated negativity where only through one-upmanship, melodramatics, and dauntless persistence can one hope to create a big enough thread surrounding an issue as to have it addressed. Posters with the opportunity and time to engage in these tactics at least get to see an Official tell them “Yes” or “No”, while others with equally valid stated concerns and the same desire to make the game better for everyone see their posts fall off within minutes, only to be overlooked or missed in the end. That, or they simply don’t post at all, avoiding the boards and the negativity found therein (we’ve received a lot of player feedback via email and at Fan Faires attesting to this phenomenon).
<p>
Well, this is simply not acceptable. Our original goal for the boards was to have them serve as a place where valid player issues would be addressed and not overlooked. We need and want to hear the feedback of anyone willing to send it. You deserve to know that your feedback is being read, that your issues are being considered by the design team, and that the chance of having your thoughts heard is not tied to your ability to be outspoken and persistent in a public forum. That is one thing all of our goals have in common, and one thing that we need to improve such that we are able to give players the input and feedback they deserve – the current “public” process.
<p>
To that end, we’re making a number of changes, both to the message boards and the procedures for sending feedback. First, you’ll notice that the Harpy’s Head and the Official Message Boards have been shut down. This is a temporary measure to allow people to time to read up on the new processes and rules in place prior to posting on official EverQuest forums. Some boards will be reopened in one-to-two weeks time under the new rules.
>p>
The Harpy’s Head boards will reopen under their existing rules (in-character), but will require an active EverQuest account to post. The Wishlist, the Newbie Zone, and the Customer Service/Technical Help forums will also reopen at the same time, but will have very strict guidelines concerning the type of content that is allowed in those forums. Other former forums, including the server and class forums, will not reopen.
<p>
Two new forums, “Developer’s Corner” and “Quality Assurance”, have been added. These forums will take the place of the former “General Discussion” and “Testing” forums. The difference here is that attempting to post a message or reply will take you to a special form where you can “Submit Comments” to the Development and Quality Assurance teams. Representatives from each team will read all of the comments submitted and choose several daily to which to reply publicly. Those representatives will then quote your comments if chosen in individual posts under the appropriate read-only forum. These forums will also be used for special announcements, inquiries, and the release of important information as it is appropriate. And we also hope it will be much easier for players to keep track of what is going on in EverQuest.
<p>
It is very important to us that we are able to address the needs of our customers. It’s not only important from the perspective of our goal of providing good service, but also for our primary goal: To be the number one online gaming company in the industry. Player feedback is so important to this process that we are taking these steps in order to gather feedback from more people more effectively. We are committed to responding not only to more issues, but also to more issues of concern and interest to a broader range of players. Finally, we are committed to giving our playerbase more input into what we do, and more insight into how and why we are doing it.
<p>
These changes are a sincere attempt to make all of that more possible. Please join us in ushering in a new age of communication and collaboration and visit the EverQuest Message Boards to submit your comments today.

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Patch Message">Patch Message</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 03/28/01 08:19 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Here it is...</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>*Spell Changes and Additions*<p>

- A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids and Wizards. These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands. These spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.
<p>
- Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.
<p>
- Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available in the game. May your quest for such spells be successful.
<p>
*Item Changes*
<p>
- Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves. After a fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and water effects from these items. They have been replaced with modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves).
<p>
- The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the waist.
<p>
- The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate.
<p>
- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to right click and worn to activate.
<p>
*Bug Fixes*
<p>
- Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at the wrong location.
<p>
- Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6 to 16.
<p>
- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging.
<p>
- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals.
<p>
- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters even when he is away from his home.
<p>
*Enhancements*
<p>
- Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild. Typing /guildd in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete. /guildd now has a confirmation box so that such an error should no longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild.
<p>
- Added /showspelleffects. Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells. This will only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon particle effects. This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain paladin weapons...
<p>
- Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages. This will allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the client. This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over your connection, and can help those with slower connections with better performance and connectivity.
<p>
- Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones. They will also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through. Any of those zones that they are not currently making announcements in will be added in the next patch or two.
<p>
- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window. This means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it reaches the beginning of the line or until you release the keys.
<p>
- The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.
<p>
- View perspective in wolf form has been fixed. First-person view will now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it. At the same time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be standing on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it.
<p>
- Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the craftsperson is using the proper ingredients. Failure of the craftsman to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being sent.
<p>
- In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed from a trade window. You will have to cancel the trade and start over to adjust the amount of money involved in the trade.
<p>
- We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands. This will allow those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be surpressed.
<p>
*Quest*
<p>
Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you.
<p>
