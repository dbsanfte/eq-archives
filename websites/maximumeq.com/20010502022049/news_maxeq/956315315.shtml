-------------------<BR>
<BR>
EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark (upgrade) should now be arriving on doorsteps around the world. Please note that attempting to create an Iksar character will not work until the expansion zones are officially opened within the next week. <BR>
<BR>
We ask that if you attempt to create an Iksar character out of curiosity that you do not proceed past the "History" page (the page that speaks of your lifestyle) in the character creation process. Once at this page, please use the "Back" button to get back to the character creation screen. Pressing "Next" on this screen will cause the name you have selected to go into the "used name" list, making it unavailable for future use. <BR>
<BR>
We appreciate your cooperation.<BR>

*Today's Patch*<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch consisted of preparations for the launch of Kunark, as well as some new art. The following spell changes were also included:<BR>
<BR>
- Corrected a bug with a new bard song that allowed them to charm anything, such as deities and dragons.<BR>
- Added a lesser included wisdom effect with "Brilliance" as well as a lesser included intelligence effect with "Insight". These spells will no longer stack.<BR>

Most of the items received via quests in the Plane of Sky have been an utter joke.  Level 30 players are able to obtain equipment that is superior to what has been received.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
I've noticed that quite a few people are upset about the quality of some of the Plane of Sky items that have been found so far. <BR>
<BR>
Part of the problem is due to the fact that the most powerful items still have yet to be acquired. Once you start seeing these items come out of the plane, you will understand what I meant when I said "There are items in the Plane of Sky that make other planar items look like rusty weapons". <BR>
<BR>
The other part of the problem is that some of the items that have been found so far are indeed underpowered. Since we were entering uncharted territory with many of our ideas for these items, we erred on the side of making them underpowered, thus avoiding the problems that occur should we have to downgrade them later. That said, while some of the items that have been found so far are appropriately powered, many are not. <BR>
<BR>
Though I will not comment on any particular item at this time, we will be reevaluating the Plane of Sky items in the near future, probably after the initial excitement from the Kunark release. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Today's patch primarily contained preparations for Kunark, including some new art. There was also a bug that was fixed with a bard song that was put in last Tuesday. The song (a charm upgrade) was not capped. Someone was kind enough to send us a screenshot of someone with a *really nice* pet named Cazic-Thule.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Snare resists increased?<BR>
We haven't made any global or specific changes to the way resists work in a *long* time, except to lower their possibility via code. An example of this would be how wizard's spells are resisted less after they hit level 35. <BR>
<BR>
Specific NPCs on the other hand are adjusted frequently, and not to mention have a chance of being boosted dynamically if the NPC makes a good roll. It sounds like the second part is what happened in your case.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Well it's designed so that if you want the best thing on you, it's going to cost enough that you'd consider it "expensive". Looking at the lineup you've posted, and remembering it from my leatherskin days, it looks like Jasper may actually be underpriced, but I don't think we'll be changing it at this point.<BR>
One good piece of news, the next in the line of Symbol's will use the same reagent and last longer.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;The Cleric class is suppose to be a plate armor class, and the Ranger is a chainmail class. And from my understanding plate armor is suppose to be superior to chainmail. That and I'm all for my healer to have more AC.<BR>
This is correct, and that was the motive behind our changes. Now we realize that there are pieces of armor that the ranger can wear that use the plate texture, but that is *really* chain-based, and was set to use the plate texture since it looked better. <BR>
<BR>
There needs to be an advantage to being a plate class, and that's why the cleric armor was boosted to bring it in line with the hybrids.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Fear is still dropping ALOT less than hate.. I think the problem is that instead of actually revamping fear when they moved (bard, cleric, enchanter, magician, warror, rogue and shaman) stuff to hate, they took out the drops of the before mentioned classes and left the mobs. <BR>
Interestingly enough, we got the impression over the past several weeks that people found the drop rates in Fear to be acceptable, and hate unacceptable. Prior to that, the general feeling was that drops in Fear were bad, but Hate was great. At that time, we adjusted both of them in opposite directions. This time however, last patch fixed Hate, but didn't change Fear. <BR>
<BR>
I'm starting to think that the problem at this point might be coming from the standpoint that "equality between the planes" hasn't been acheived.<BR>
<BR>
The truth is that both planes are now engineered to drop the same amount of armor (on average) in the same period of time. They are basically equal now with possible exception to a surplus of cleric armor that might be dropping in Hate due to public reports.<BR>

Although it proc's Ward Summoned, it's actually doing damage to all mobs again apparently.<BR><BR>

If that is the case, use them while you can summon them!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Somehow the sword of runes are proccing on all mobs again<BR>
Against *all* mobs? It should only proc against summoned mobs. I've sent this report to the test team to check it out. I know that it used to have the problem of proc'ing against all mobs, but this should have been fixed.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;but did any of u notice that he wastes a round to cast the proc?<BR>
<BR>
No, no round of melee is lost. The casting animation might make it appear that that is what is happening, but if you look at the combat messages, this isn't the case. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="No Environmental Effects">No Environmental Effects</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/18/00 06:34 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Someone recently thought that the Iskar shouldn't be allowed to go to Everfrost (because of the whole cold-blooded lizard thing).<BR><BR>

As for the encumbered plate wearing cleric comment, I resemble that comment :)</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I hate to use logic on this board, since so much seems to be lacking in the game, but wouldn't it make sense that the Iksar should be restricted from going to Everfrost? The Iksar are a lizard race. Lizards are cold-blooded. Therefore, it would stand to reason that they would fall over asleep as soon as they enter the frozen plains of Everfrost, Permafrost, and Halas<BR>
Environmental effects from cold are something that wasn't put into the game. If we were to do something like this, we might have to make it so that Trolls can't go to Lavastorm or something of that nature. This is one of those times that realism takes a back seat in the interest of gameplay, like when we let full plate wearing encumbered clerics swim.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Kerra Ridge Too Difficult?">Kerra Ridge Too Difficult?</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/18/00 06:32 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It may be best to read the entire original post (too long to post here), which can be found at the link below.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I cannot see how Verant thinks that ANYBODY hunting this zone for xp could do it. The spawns are way too close, the casters too powerful and there is really no way to clear out anything to camp anything. There is no way to "do" this dungeon<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;If you walked in and cleared out the kerrans from the front, they would all have spawned back by the time you got to the middle, so if you had to run out you would get waxed anyhow.<BR>
The dungeons are designed with the idea that there will be several groups all "doing" them at the same time. In your example, the idea would be that some other group should have cleared out the area behind you by the time you need to run. Of course then you train and kill them, so you might have a point  Let's give it some time however, we are committed to having people use this and some of the other underutilized dungeons. If we need to make further changes to make that happen, we will.<BR>
