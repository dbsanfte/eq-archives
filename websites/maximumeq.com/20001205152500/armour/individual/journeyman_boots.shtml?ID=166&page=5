Previously I'd only killed undead, spiders, and madmen, but he didn't show till 20 hours later. So I think you need to kill everything you see. He truly is a random spawn and has no specific placeholder, but he always spawns on the sand. He conned blue to me at 36 and was taken down easily by myself and a 35 ranger. Got my shadowed rapier off Shadowed Men in Nektulos, hit the Freeport bank for 3,250 gold pieces, and headed to Rathe Mountains. I knew to look for Hasten near the "Giant Valley" because I'd seen him there many times before ever even thinking about doing the Jboots quest. I was told you don't need to ask Hasten the right questions, just Hail him to get him to stop, then give him the AC ring, Shadowed Rapier, and the 3,250 gold pieces and he hands you your Jboots! =)</font></td></tr></table>

Here is a trick while waiting for Hasten; let someone kill you and loot everything except the shadow rapier.  If you DO go LD, or Hasten is a no show and you don't want to wait 4 or 5 hours for him (which happened to me!) the Rapier will still be there when you reenter the game.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Yes, the AC can take a real LONG time in OOT. I got to the camp at about 8am, another group was there, so I told them to give me a tell when they were leaving, and then bound there. <BR>
<BR>
Got a tell just about 11 am. Started camping, the spawn point spawns a variety of things, 6 min spawn time, (pirate, aqua goblin, boog mudtoe, a cyclops, ancient cyclops). The "a cyclops" is most common, and was pretty decent exp at level 49. A friend came to join me at 1pm (2hours after I started by myself). I had to log at 4:30pm for personal real life. I called my friend later that night (10pm or so) still no AC. I went to sleep, woke up early, and called friend. The AC spawned at 7am. <BR>
<BR>
So, we camped from 11am, around the clock, until 7am (total time 20 hours). This is such bullsh**. No way should something take this long to spawn. Anyway, there you go. </font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>To the person who said that making these boots a more common drop would unbalance the game, because noone would buy sow from you.  Im a lvl 49 druid, and havent charged for a sow since about lvl 15.  They are free, gratis.  I dont think I have ever charged for a port.   I give both ports and sows freely, and I believe most druids do.  Same with enchanters, most will never charge you for a clarity. Same for every rez from clerics I've received, save one.<BR>
<BR>
Now, both enchanters, clerics and druids spend most of the time anon because they dont want to be given a "tell" from someone 2 zones over to ask for a clarity, rez, sow or port.  But if someone does ask me, or any of the other druids I know, these things are freely given almost ALL the time.  So if most sows in game are given for free, (and almost ALL sows above lvl 30 are given for free), then how would giving more of these boots unbalance the game, especially since the quest is so hard, (due to the creatures you have to kill),almost noone under lvl 30 attempts it anyway.  And anyone lv 30 or over get sows for free anyway. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, my 2 cents, I am a druid and I would love these things to be dropped way more often.  It would lower my downtime from giving out sows, and would probably reduce the amount of port requests too, since people would be able to run to a place faster.  I think 99% of the druids over lvl 30 would agree with me.  </font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Hey,<BR>
<BR>
Got my ring last night...woot...!! I entered the Sro zone and asked if anyone was camping the Ancient Clops...no replies. So I commence killing everything. I notice that a few other folks that are anon ( I am not ) are just hanging around the zone. I talk to one of them a Sk but he says nothing not even sure if he spoke english or not. Anyway just after talking to the Sk I run past the dervush camp and who is running up the hill your friend and mine the ancient!!! I commenct to put a whompin on his butt and quickly get him to below 50 percent life so I know I am safe from ks from all but enchanters. Just as he falls dead to the ground a wizzy comes up and accuses me of ksing... he said he had been in the zone waiting for 10 hours and I stole his camp. I appologised for taking what he thought was his BUT I had asked when I entered the zone and that I was looting this guy for sure! I was so happy but rather than let my enthusiasm get the best of me I logged at the druid ring in Wc and will complete the quest tonight. Total camp time 45 mins. <BR>
