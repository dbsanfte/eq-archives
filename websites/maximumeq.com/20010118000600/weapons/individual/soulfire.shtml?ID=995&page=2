<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Let me clear up some information on this. <BR>
<BR>
First, Sir Lucan WAS a Paladin.  He was stripped of his powers, and as such, he is a level 48 Warrior model with approximately 8000 hps.  He DOES spawn into an undead form, and THIS drops the testimony.  The undead form is NOTHING compared to Sir Lucan himself.  <BR>
<BR>
Second, his friends are a Guard Jaczen (sp?) and Brother Jentry.  They do NOT LH on him, but they might as well, because Brother Jentry is a Cleric and will complete and greater heal Lucan all day long.  He must be separated from Lucan at all costs, or you will not drop Lucan.<BR>
<BR>
Third, no WAY do you need two full groups of level 50's to kill Lucan.  I know, because our guild (Sentinals) killed him tonight on the Povar server with NOBODY over level 41.<BR>
This is what we had on the raid:<BR>
<BR>
Level 41 Paladin<BR>
Level 41 Monk<BR>
Level 40 Cleric<BR>
Level 39 Cleric<BR>
Level 38 Paladin<BR>
Level 37 Druid<BR>
Level 36 Ranger<BR>
Level 34 Druid<BR>
Level 32 Rogue<BR>
<BR>
The 34th lvl Druid did NOT fight, as he strictly kited Jentry around W Freeport.  Tanks will take a BEATING, and you WILL die.  However if you pull him close enough to the zone, you can die, respawn in the zone, and you can grab your weapon and start slugging again.  He double attacks for 119, and dual wields.  He CAN be disarmed, as our Monk took out one of his weapons.  <BR>
<BR>
Would have dropped a lot sooner if we hadn't have had to just slug it out and melee him to death.  Bring two high level wizards, and a balanced party and he will drop.  <BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>The faction needed with Brother Hayle is kindly (one step above amiable).  However, for me, Brother Hayle is one faction step below the Temple of Thunder (paladin guild in qeynos).  So I had to get warmly with them, and in turn was kindly with Brother Hayle.<BR>
<BR>
To raise faction with them, there are several quests you can do, but the most effective one is Bandit Sashes.  Kill bandit's in West Karana and every now and then they drop a NO DROP red Bandit Sash.  There's a few camps around, but the easiest is bandit hill, near the ogre camp...there's about 8 or 10 bandits there on a pretty quick spawn.  After you kill them, there's a couple bandits that spawn at the base of the hill and about 3 or 4 more over at that farmhouse nearby.  I filled my inven with sashes (about 15 free slots) and it raised me a faction level.  Oh yeah, you turn those sashes in one at a time to Chesgard somebody in the Temple of Thunder in South Qeynos.  He also give you back a bronze weapon which you can sell to the guy next to him for a couple plat a piece.<BR>
<BR>
You can also turn in bone chips (2 at a time) to Lashun Novashine, a newb looking human that's usually in the newbie area near the gate walking around shouting some annoying stuff.  Either there or on the ramp to the space ship at the Temple of Life.<BR>
<BR>
These two are how I went from indif to warmly with these qeynos punks  :)  Very annoying, but worth it in the end I suppose.<BR>
<BR>
I too am very interested in knowing whether or not SoulFire can be recharged in the Temple of Marr in Freeport as being reported by various sites, however, nobody has mentioned a specific NPC that does it.  And I don't exactly want to go around handing my SF in to random NPC's to test it out either  :P</font></td></tr></table>

And before you can hand in your items, Brother Hayle must respond positively to "What proof of nobility?"  Basically, you have to be kindly with him, or else he will say something like "I may only talk about things like this with our most trusted members", but if you have high enough faction he'll give you the list of things he needs (note, testimony of truth, hilt, and BSOF)</font></td></tr></table>

A cleric was also present to help heal as he hits for hell of a lot of damage! We gave him a good trashing and the fight lasted about 2 minutes. He didn't lay hands at all and was never healed a considerable amount.  We beat down his 2 friends in a few minutes as well. Good luck to you other paladins in giving that filthy militia a good ol' fashioned beatdown. Don't worry about being KOS in freeport. Just use the sewers.

Pulling to NFP zone would not agro the super guards but still have the problem with Lucan KILLING your team because you can't kite him around a zone.

What would happen if before killing lucha, you pulled him to the zone in the sewers, and hailed him again till jackson and the cleric are back to their spawn points?  would you be able to kill him w/o militia interferience that way?<BR>

Lucan does not have LoH, and You can count on Brother Coming from the militia house to help him, even if you wait for Gentry to return to his home point by hailing Lucan, Lucan is very tough and has about 10K hit points in his human form and only about 5K as the second incarnation. A 55th level Ogre SK was getting whacked real good by Lucan and required considerable healing, this was after Lucan killed a 41 and 33 Ranger in no time. We put him down though, and here was are configuration<BR>
<BR>
55 Ogre SK<BR>
54 Human Pally<BR>
37 Human Pally<BR>
41 Woodie Ranger<BR>
33 Woodie Ranger<BR>
40 Troll SK<BR>
39 Woodie Druid<BR>
<BR>
When Gentry got back to the Militia House we began the assault on Lucan way out by the Ecommons zone against the wall the sewers are on. Farthest possible point from the Brother Gentry, Brother Gentry still came, The 54 Paladin and the 40th SK interecepted him before he could heal Lucan, the rest of us stayed on Lucan, with the exception of the 39 Druid who was kiting another Guard that showed up.<BR>
