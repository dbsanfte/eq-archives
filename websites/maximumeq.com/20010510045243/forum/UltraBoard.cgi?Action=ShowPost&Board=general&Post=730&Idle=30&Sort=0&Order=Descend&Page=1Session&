<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">This is a petition.  A petition that verant actually fix and improve the mage class, as they havent been fixed or improved since beta (I played a mage in beta 3).<p>

Many of you on the tribunal server, prexus, lanys tvyl, rallos zek, and test might have talked to me, as for the last 2 weeks I have been spending quite a bit of EQ time going around to these servers (chosen randomly, except for tribunal which I play on) to discuss the problems with fellow mages and see if all mages were agreed on them.  Thus far I have a list of over 40 mages who have heard in depth all of which I will outline in this message, and all 40 mages were in complete agreement with the problems at hand.  Only 2 mages out of the 45+ that I talked to had any dispute about any of the problems - not all of them - but merely one or two.  I would also like to take this chance to appologize to all of the mages I have bothered in-game about this, as most people dont log on to have some stranger start talking to them about thier class for 10 minutes while they should be helping thier group kill monsters.<p>

I will first outline the problems as both I and the mages I've talked to see them, and will then post proposed solutions below by problem #.<p>

Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks...<br>
This is one of the biggest problems with mages, both in combat (soloing especially), and in travelling (which is half of the game).  The problem is quite simple - a mage gets aggrod on by a monster: 1) he has a pet to defend himself, in which the pet can eventually taunt the monster off of the mage so the mage can either help his pet kill the monster or he can get a head start running to zone -OR- 2) he has no pet to defend himself, in which case he also has no way to get the monster off of him, and so he dies.  This is a huge problem, mages are the ONLY class that have no means to evade a monster that is aggrod on them while they are perhaps just running through a zone, or fighting a monster that just WILL NOT taunt onto his/her pet.  Necros have snare (darkness), root at 34, shadow step, and feign death - by all means a good necro should never die.  Enchanters have root, stuns, mezmerize, memory wipes, charms...the list goes on...enchanters are the best at getting an aggrod monster off of them, whether it be when travelling through a zone or in a fight gone bad.  Wizards have snare and root, starting at lvl 4 - this is thier bread and butter, they also have stuns, so wizards are by all means quite capable of travelling anywhere without risk and ensuring that they can get away from a monster if they end up in a fight gone bad.  Dictating whether or not you should stay and fight/die or run and live is half of the game, so it is a big deal.  However for mages, we do not have that choice, we stay and die, end of story.<p>

Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper!<br>
This problem has arisen from the fact that mage summon spells havent changed since beta, and all the equipment in norrath certainly HAS.  In beta, when a tank was on a corpse run, he might ask me for 2 swords of runes so that he might fight off anything that aggros him along the way.  Back then, this weapon was quite adequate, it still isnt as good as fine steel, and although it is the mages best summoned weapon, it is still good enough to give to a person in need (heck, a rusty sword is better then nothing, right?).  Mage weapons are useless, we only summon them for necro pets and recently our own pets (mages pets used to be unable to wield weapons), and still, they are only summoned to make our pets look "neater"...they dont actually help them much, if at all (I have seen absolutely no difference, so I will continue to believe, until I see some actual implemented code, that weapons do not do a single thing but make the pet look different).  Mages can summon food, drink, bandages at 4, a useless pouch at 8, infravision stone at 16 (until then, erudites and humans, you are blind), water breathing stone at 24, more food and drink at 24, ultravision stone at 29, finally a ring that gives us levitation at 39, and a modulating rod at 44.  Not exactly masters of conjuration if you ask me: we are the only caster class that is unable to enhance vision until 16, the items we summon give us effects that should be available at half the lvl in which we recieve them (who needs levitate at 39? at 20 it would be useful, at 39 its just something more we can summon for newbies who dont even thank us).  Also, I just outlined everything a mage can summon...that isnt much you say, and no, its not...the infravision and ultravision stones are useful only to erudite or human mages, the water breathing stone is mostly unused, the levitation ring at the level which we recieve it is not even useful anymore, bandages are good, food and drink is good to have, those pouches are useless - too small and you cant even put most items into them, and the modulating rod...well, better thought of then it actually is.<p>

Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again?<br>
This has been a problem since beta, however it wasnt as much of a problem back then, as the rest of the classes hadnt been so highly enhanced and improved yet, and the monsters hadnt been tuned up and buffed.  Back in beta, a mage was actually a foe to reckon with.  Our pets were almost on par with necro pets, our DD spells were sufficient, our AE spells were nice to have (although unusable now), and at least half of the items we summoned were actually useful.  Sadly, this game is all about hack and slash, thats all there is to this game, and although verant has implemented this hack and slash ideollogy (sp?) in a manner which it is much more entertaining then the normal diablo clone, it is still hack and slash.  If your class doesnt have sufficient means to dispatch monsters with, then your class is useless...I could care less if you can cast clarity, sow, all the buffs in the game, heals, etc....if you cannot kill monsters solo your class is group dependant and thus you can no longer just log on and play the game, you must log on and try to find a group before your time runs out and you have to log off.  A mage has 1 way to kill monsters.  Direct damage spells and his/her pet.  That is all we have.  Now, our DD spells are supposedly second only to wizard...this is untrue during most of the game (lvl 1 to 60).  We also have a few AE spells.  However, AE spells only get us killed, and so they are useless (and mana inefficient to begin with).<br>
So, the first issue with this problem is mage pets.  Mage pets, every single one of them, can be easily taken out by a necro pet of same level.  Throw into this equation the mage pet being buffed by the mage burnout, fire shielded by the mage fire shield, and given the best weapon the mage has: the necro pet will still win.  I have tried this duel every lvl of the game, as I have previously played a lvl 50 mage along with a lvl 50 necro all the way to 50.  I have also tried pretty much every pet at every level (I had to do some of the duels for lvl 24 through 44 pets when I was in fact 50 and could actually research the pets we could not buy).  Mages should summon the most fearsome pets on norrath, we are afterall CONJURATION MASTERS, are we not?  Mage pets should be bar-none able to out-tank, out-damage, and out-taunt any other pet of the same level in the game.  Our pets should have more HP, more armor class (our pets get hit for max damage by mobs of same level as them), more attack rating, more strength/dexterity so that they hit harder, land more of thier hits, and can actually take some damage.  Mage's pet's spells (root, gust of air, burst of fire, slash of ice) are also more of a burden then a good thing, as they resist 99% of the time, they require the pet to sacrifice a round of combat (where they could be missing the target in melee instead), and they cause the pet to stand still and allow the monster chasing us to get ahead of them (most solo fights invole the mage running from the monster, and the pet trying to keep up hitting it from behind trying to taunt it).  I do think that pet's spells were a good idea, however they were not implemented correctly.  If verant wishes to keep this good idea of thiers, they should at least FIX it.  Make pet's spells unresistable to monsters up to 8 levels above the pet (ie: halfway to our next spell lvl, white monsters cannot resist our pet's spells).  Also, do not make our pets sacrifice a round of combat to cast the spell, implement it as a proc (with a very high proc rate) instead to allow them to continue hitting (otherwise, for example, our earth pet sits there and casts root 6 times in a row and every time it resists, which accomplished absolutely nothing except make the monster hate the mage more since the pet isnt taunting or doing damage).  Pet's spells in fact do not do much, the root obviously does some good (allowing the mage to flee), and the gust of air obviously does some good (it stuns the monster, ie: allowing the mage to flee), but they resist so much that I would much rather not have them at all the way it is right now.<br>
The next issue with this problem is mage DD and AE - our only other asset besides our weak little pets.  Mage DD spells are NOT second only to wizard.  Mage DD spells are only a few points higher then necro DD spells, they are sometimes even less then enchanter DD spells, and even druids have a higher DD then mages for half of the game (ie: 1 through 50).  Mage DD and AE spells SHOULD be second only to wizard, EVERY level of the game, WITHOUT question whatsoever.  That doesnt mean that we should do 1 MORE point of damage then the necro, enchanter, and druid spells of any specific level, it means we should do 20, 50, 80 points LESS then the wizard spell of that specific level.  Mage DDs at level 29 for example, 176 damage, versus necro DD at 24, 160 damage.  We should be doing about 200 DD at level 29, more in line with the wizard's DD of 250 at that level.  We still arent as mana efficient - by far, and we still dont do as much damage, and we still cant cast our DDs as fast - this keeps wizards out in the front by far in direct damage (especially with wizard spells being less resistable).<br>
Also, our AE spells should be pumped up a bit.  The way I see it, although wizard SHOULD be the master of dealing damage in anyway spellwise, mages are tuned for AE spells.  We throw rains of fire down over our pets wreaking havoc on the monsters he is taunting away from us - that is what a mage should be like - that is what verant says a mage is - that is very very far from the truth.<br>
Our malise line of spells, it should have the same resistance check as tashan, it is the same kind of spell, and the shamans have been petitioning this for almost a year now.<p>

######################################<br>
Proposed solutions<br>
######################################<br>
Problem 1 - wandering mages, sitting ducks...<br>
Mages are masters of conjuration and masters of the elements.  Our post lvl 50 class names are even "Elementalist" and "Conjurer" so if verant even disputes this, they have proven how mentally ill they are.  Snare and root come straight from the earth element.  We should have both of these spells.  We should have single target root, single target snare, AE root, and AE snare.  Mages should have these spells starting at either lvl 4 or 8 and they should correspond to about the same level that any other class gets the spells.  This would give us a way to evade monsters, a way to be more helpful to our group, and it would actually finally give mages what they were meant to have - mastery of the element: earth.<p>

Problem 2 - conjuration masters: but, but, I can summon you lots of toilet paper!<br>
I already know that verant has admitted to this problem, so I wont go into too much detail as I have faith in thier abilities, and hope they have already come up with some solutions.  Basically it is simple, every weapon a mage summons is useless at the level he/she is able to summon it.  Back when there were level 40s wielding well-balanced and fine steel weapons, and that was normal and "good" equipment for thier level, mage weapons were not all that bad.  However, now, they are rusty short swords.  The items a mage summons are also useless and very limited.  We should be able to summon items that give us any desired effect in the game.  I would even go so far as to say we should be able to summon sow rocks (1 charge stones alike that of the water breathing stone that click to give us sow equivalent to [(our level) - (level we recieved sow rock)].  For example if we recieved the sow rock spell at 20, at lvl 20 we would summon a lvl 1 sow rock spell (equivalent to lvl 9 shaman sow).  We are also the only class that has no means to regenerate mana faster.  We are the ONLY caster class that just has to sit and meditate every point of our mana the hard way.  This should not be so, especially since our DDs are mana inefficient, and our summons cost a huge amount.  We should be able to summon a "breeze fan" at level 20 (4 levels after enchanter breeze), and a "clarity rod" at level 34 (5 levels after enchanter clarity).  These items would be one charge items, alike all other mage summoned items, that will give the appropriate and corresponding level of a "breeze" and "clarity" type spell.  This will hopefully negate the hard fact that mages have the longest downtime of any caster.  Now, I realize you are all perhaps thinking I am crazy to think that mages should recieve sow.  However, think about this, what do mages have that one of the 3 other caster classes dont?  We can summon food and drink...thats about it.  We should be able to conjure items that give us any desired effect we want, why not give our class something unique? Actually give us what was promised?  Its definitely not something mages dont deserve, afterall, it falls completely in line with what our profession is, so why not actually fix our class?<p>

Problem 3 - how do you kill monsters with a mage again?<br>
Mage pets should be the best pets in norrath.  That is our calling, to be able to summon beings of great power to do our bidding.  We are not enchanters that merely animate inanimate objects, we are not necromancers that reanimte dead corpses or control the essence of bones, we summon actual beings from the planes of the elements.  They have names, they have personalities, they are our friends and companions.  Mage pets should have much higher AC, mage pets should NOT get hit for the same amount of damage as the mage him/herself gets hit for.  Mage pets should have more HP, as a mage, your heal pet spell is one spell that MUST be memorized AT ALL TIMES, otherwise your pet dies and there goes another summon stone (and usually a bit of exp too, since you die next).  Pet healing spell should be for emergencies, it shouldnt be a neccessity.  Right now I am playing a level 30 mage, and to even try and solo low blues/high greens I have to heal my pet at least twice or it WILL die.  The process of a fight with mage solo right now usually goes like this: burnout on pet, fire shield on pet, malise or nuke moster to pull, send pet on it, run around in circles until pet can taunt monster, sit and med for 10 sec, heal pet, nuke, heal pet, sit and med for 10 sec, nuke, heal pet, nuke, by now mana is all gone, so I either die or I am victorious with at the most 20% mana left and a pet that has at the very most 40% of his life.  Then I sit and meditate and go grocery shopping or run some errands, because it takes that long to meditate back to full, and without full mana you cannot solo monsters that give anything near good experience, especially since mage has such a high experience penalty.  In groups where our pets arent the tanks, we dont have this problem too often, but we are still not very useful in a group.  Personally I would rather have a necro, enchanter, wiz, druid, shaman, or just another good tank in my group then another mage.  We are weak, and we are mostly useless.<p>

<br>
And this was one heck of a long post...so my parting words will be that if you are a fellow mage, help our petition out, because I know you know the burdensome task we have at just being able to play.  It is a game, we pay for it, this should not be the case.<br>
Also, if you are a mage and think differently about anything written here, please voice your oppinion.  The above stated problems are only problems in the eyes of myself and the mages I have talked to.  The more ideas and oppinions we get, the better overall solution will be.<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I have played both mage and necro and to the guy who says he sees mages quad kiting all the time all I can respond is please lay off the crack or spring for the extra and get the good stuff you are melting your brain.  Mages could never quad kite in any way shape or form that I have ever seen unless I take a level 39 Mage and quad kite Orc Centurions in the East Commons nimrod.  A response like that simply REEKS of ignorance.  You must be watching mages with sow and a partner snaring for them or something.<p>

Before you convince everyone of just how uninformed and class envious or class hateful you are try this:<p>

Take an average everyday level 35-38 Mage and go try to walk without sow from the Eastern Wastes bridge to the Great Divide.  You cant make a pet because if you do you then can't invis yourself.  You can't walk without invis because you would be fortunate to solo a Walrus let alone all the other mean ugly agro things in this 35-40 zone.  Your best chance short of the obvious risk of invis and hope it doesnt drop is to beg for a sow or make a pet and fight your way across.  Chance of running without sow invis this huge distance is about 20%.  Verant forgot to consider how much larger and more dangerous zones have become and has not bumped the average duration of invis these are the sorts of mini-nerfs that have crept into the game over time as it evolved and is WHY some enhancements to mages are way overdue.<p>

My suggestion to restore balance with a SINGLE change would be this.  <p>

Add a new Summoned item at level 34 which is a NO DROP 1HB dmg 8/35 dly Staff of Impact or Staff of Mist have modest direct dmg proc say maybe 24 dmg max when it procs (twice what velium does) and have the effect of Wizard style Snare.  This should be usable only by the mage or his pet to make him more able to solo and more able to run from a fight gone bad.  Maybe make the snare proc a single use right click instead and make it lore so you cant summon many in advance.  A single stun would prevent mages from using it to quad kite and the proc weapon would make mage pets not suck so bad again.<p>

Lets face it the proc was "Fixed" on runed swords because Verant wanted everyone to get velious and stockpile dropped velium swords for pet weapons instead.  For those rare few that this tactic worked on <br>
I submit they already own Velious by now and for those that play mages they already hate you for the nerfage.  Time to stop screwin the pooch Verant!<p>

Considering the game has become 50% walking from zone to zone shouting for a group I agree it ought to at least be possible to walk from zone to zone seeking a group as mages have to do a LOT these days (post all their many nerfs) with only minor risk of death in zones of their level.  This new suggested item would make this possible.  Since mages typically give up on 2HB and go to 1HB pretty early on to free up hands for Binders and Mugs a nice 1HB would be a fair summon.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

Just a quick toss in here concerning mages. I grabbed a mage and an enchanter last night. We made quick work of the BnB room of solb, and held it for 4 hours uncontested. The mage was the coolest dude I've met in EQ in ages. He was versatile, capable, and willing. I have never personally played a mage and I will continue to leave that class to those of you that have the calling for it. I will appreciate your skills though! This is an isolated case I understand, but I have a friend who plays a mage, he tends to be solitary and quiet typically but I will search him out to go partner with him, the druid/mage combo is a powerful team. I can't solo alone being an alteration specialist at least not very well but partnered with a mage make us unstoppable, the Enchanter in the group was just icing on the cake, he left after 2 hours and we filled the slot with  ..... another mage. Why? Because you can't dupe a mage in a group. They have so many skills and abilities that two mages together are 2 tanks of specialized skill and 2 casters. I hope you stay with us it sounds like you know the class very well and I would enjoy playing with you if you decide to stick around.<br>
