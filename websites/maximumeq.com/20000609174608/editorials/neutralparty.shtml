                    (Verant Buttocks Kisser), as those players supporting Verant have come to be called. This
                    editorial is being written to help improve a game that I enjoy immensely. I hope it can
                    help. Perhaps it cannot. </font></p>
                    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Wood Elves, Ogres, and Barbarians; - Lend me your ear.</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">I have been a staunch supporter of EverQuest since I began
                    playing in April of 1999. I thoroughly enjoyed the game. I thoroughly enjoyed the people
                    who played it. </font></p>
                    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">The game has evolved since April 1999. The players have also
                    undergone change. As you read this article remind yourself that I support the game. This
                    does not mean that I support either Verant or the players on all counts. It means I
                    support the evolution of the game. That is very important to understand, as it will belay
                    your immediate emotional reactions to some of my points. I am not on your side or against
                    you. I am selfish and wish to play a game that I enjoy.</font></p>
                    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">And so it came to pass that I saw a thread on the official
                    EverQuest message board titled, &quot;Verant VS. Players&quot;. Would a company choose a
                    course of action that alienated its customers? It is highly unlikely that any company
                    would. Why then are threads like the one above being posted? Let&#146;s take a look at
                    some of the game issues that are raising the most commotion.</font><ul>
                      <li><font color="#C0C0C0"><strong>Server Overcrowding</strong>: The first thread I could
                        find on this topic had 211 posts in it. It is a volatile issue. Here are the facts as I
                        have been informed of them. They may be incorrect. If so, please correct me. </font></li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">1800 is the optimal number of players per world according to the
                      people who designed it. I am using a post by Brad McQuaid to come up with this number. I
                      am sure that both gameplay and profitability came into play when choosing this number. </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Let&#146;s look at the gameplay issue first. There are some
                      underlying problems with arbitrarily choosing a number like 1800 and they should be
                      addressed. 1800 players distributed evenly across all of the zones on a server would put
                      approximately 25 players in each zone. We know that in practice this is not the case. Many
                      zones are empty and many have in excess of 70 players using them. Why is this the case?
                      One possible answer is that some zones are simply more enjoyable to play in than others
                      are. They are so much more enjoyable in fact that players are willing to share them with
                      70+ other players. City zones are relatively boring it seems. Lower Guk is relatively
                      enjoyable, as is Oasis of Marr. </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">A secondary problem that many players do not immediately think of
                      is that the design of the game inherently creates logjams of players based on level. It
                      gets increasingly hard to level as you play through the game. Remember how easy levels 1-5
                      seemed to be when you were level 20? Levels 15-20 look almost as easy when you are level
                      40. Player progression through the game is slowed by game design as you play deeper into
                      EverQuest. This causes zones like Upper Guk to be crowded one month and relatively empty
                      the next. The pinnacle of the bell curve of players has passed by this once enjoyable zone
                      and on to another. I do not believe that has to be the case. </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">The majority of players use a zone to either gain experience or
                      gain items or money. Very few players role-play. The game simply is not built to be a
                      role-play game no matter how many people praise its virtues. You cannot progress through
                      the game by role-playing. Role-playing can enhance the game, but it is not the underlying
                      reason for playing. I personally wish it had more affect on the game. </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Since people are using a zone to either gain experience or items
                      would it not make sense to give them more zones of like quality to do this? The logjam of
                      players was foreseeable. I believe the Verant staff while conducting their Infected Paw
                      changes has even mentioned it. It is not easy to guess what players will enjoy in a zone.
                      However, it becomes brutally evident when they flood to one zone and shun another. Why
                      were more zones changes not made? There may be a very good reason. Profitability is one
                      understandable reason. Perhaps it is simply too expensive to continually change the way
                      zones are setup.</font></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">I believe that overcrowding could actually be fixed, to a certain
                      extent, without new servers by directing the flow of players throughout the current world.
                      </font></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Older servers like Fennin Ro will in all likelihood always have
                      more players than the new servers. EverQuest is addictive and few people seem to be
                      quitting. Those that started on Fennin Ro are still playing there. Some new players are
                      choosing Fennin Ro. The numbers can only go up until a critical mass is reached and the
                      game is unplayable on that server. Some say that it has already reached that point. How
                      can this be overcome?</font></p>
                      <p></font><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">One suggestion was a server cap of X
                      number of players allowed on the server at one time. I do not feel this can work. What
                      happens when my friend who just bought the game cannot play it with me because my server
                      is already at its cap? The social aspect of the game is every bit as important to its
                      success as the hack and slash aspect. </font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Verant has stated that they will be splitting the server. This
                      allows the hack and slash aspect of the game to flourish once again, but hurts the social
                      aspect of the game. There is little possibility that all friends will end up on the same
                      server. Circles of friends overlap. One circle may choose Fennin Ro server #1. Another
                      circle may choose Fennin Ro server #2. Which server should I choose? How do I tell who
                      chose server #1 and who chose server #2?</font></p>
                      <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Can I play on either server if I choose to on any given night? On
                      Mondays I like to play with my circle of guild friends on server #1. On Wednesdays I play
                      with my friends from work on server #2. I do not believe that this is currently possible
                      in EverQuest. I believe that it should be. New servers could be added and players would
                      not be forced to give up hours of gameplay to join them and start over from scratch. I may
                      be wrong, but I believe that Verant&#146;s argument is that the economy would be ruined on
                      the new servers. I argue that there is no true economy on the servers in their current
                      state. Tradeskills were poorly implemented and vendor pricing is unbalanced. The economy
                      is going to be ruined in short order whether or not players are allowed to move to the new
                      server. Postponing the problem is not solving it. Let the players have fun until you can
                      come up with a solution to the economy or lack thereof. </font></p>

                        an expert when it comes to programming or to encryption, but some things seem obvious.
                        Verant has not recognized ShowEQ publicly. It seems probable that choice was made to
                        lessen the number of people using it. Why not just fix the problem? ShowEQ sniffs packets
                        on a local network to produce a map of the zone which the player is in, including all mobs
                        in that zone. It is cheating. It is a bannable offense. I agree with Verant that it should
                        be dealt with swiftly and with extreme prejudice. Verant can never eliminate all cheating
                        or hacking. All they can do is make it incredibly hard and incredibly annoying for the
                        cheaters and hackers. I am not a programmer and I am not a hacker. I do not use ShowEQ. I
                        cannot from experience give a solution to this problem. It is likely that by using a
                        method of encryption the data stream could be made virtually unreadable. Make it so the
                        cheaters cannot get the information passively from the network. They must take it actively
                        from memory. I am confident that is much more difficult to steal the information from
                        memory than it is from the network. It is likely that there are ways to detect attempts to
                        do this. Most of the cheaters would just leave it alone. Make it annoying for these
                        miscreants and they will find something else to do. &nbsp;</font><font FACE="Arial"

                    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">I have been deliberately vague in this article. I could literally
                    write 50 pages on how the server setup could be more efficient and how game design could
                    be changed to help with overcrowding. Give Verant credit for the fact that there is an
                    incredible depth to gameplay in EverQuest. You cannot simply change one portion of the
                    game without affecting many other balance issues. If this editorial receives a reasonable
                    amount of valuable response I will take it deeper. I fear that I may be wasting my time on
                    deaf ears.&nbsp;</font></p>
