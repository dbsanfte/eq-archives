<i>The following was submitted by a reader of MaximumEQ.  No editing has
been done to it.</i><BR><BR>

Friends, tanks, fellow Norrathians, lend me your ears.  Today, I find it
within my heart that we must discuss manners.  You know, those pesky things
that our mothers always told us to watch, the things that Emily Post seems
to have an innate feel for.  I write this not only for all of the clerics
out there, but also for the druids, wizards, shaman, and enchanters.<BR>
<BR>
You called us greedy.  You called us selfish.  You called us any number of
profane names which are not used in polite society.  Why?  Simply because
we told you that we were unable or unwilling to respond to you when you
begged.   It mattered not what you asked for; a clarity, a res, a
&quot;sow&quot;.  The simple fact of the matter is we were busy with
something else, and not in a position to respond to your demand of
&quot;XXX me d00d&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
You dare to call us greedy, you level 10 in full quest armor wielding
weapons we could only dream about our tanks having back when we were all
level 40.  You dare call us selfish for wanting to put the people we are
grouped with (or heaven forbid, ourselves since we are soloing) ahead of
your needs.  You dare spout profanity in our general direction when we
answered your rude request with a simple &quot;No, sorry, I can't right
now&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
You are the person who sends us tells out of the blue asking us to babysit
you for the length of your gaming session, the person who calls us a
&quot;biaytch&quot; for refusing to do so.  You are the person who insisted
we share the specters we were soloing for experience with you, then
pestered us for buffs and heals so that they wouldn't kill you.  You are
the person who expected us to catch the boat to come res you on another
continent, then was indignant when we refused.  You are the newbie who
takes one look at our shiny armor, and assumes that we must have a spare
set that we are just waiting to give to someone.  You are the greedy beggar
who sees the number 50 as our level, and proceeds to pester us for
&quot;just enough plat to buy my spells [for the next 5 spell
levels]&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
You are also the group member who complains that we are greedy when we ask
for a share of the platinum, yet demands to always have the best symbol
buff cast on you.  You are the person we grouped with once, who then
assumes that we are willing to teleport you anywhere for the remainder of
your gaming career.  You are the level 10 mage who can't live without a
clarity and a swift for your pet.  You are the person who can't run across
a single zone without Spirit of Wolf (either that, or without having a
female pig stuck under your arm - that's &quot;sow&quot; too).  You are the
warrior who doesn't want to group, but wants heals anyway, to reduce
downtime.  You are the secondary character who's wearing armor better than
our primaries.<BR>
<BR>
Well, it is time for all of &quot;you&quot; to learn some consideration for
your fellow citizens.  We, the clerics, enchanters, druids, and shaman may
very well be support classes when we group.  However, we are not, and we
refuse to be, support characters for the entire gaming community.  It
matters not one bit what we choose to do with our time - no means no.  The
time you beg us for is time that we pay for, just like the rest of you.
We, the &quot;support&quot; classes of this game, would like you to do us
all a few favors:<BR>
<ul>
<li>If we aren't standing right in front of you, don't ask us to cast
anything
on you.</li>

<li> If you don't know us, don't demand anything of us.  You are free to
request something of us - as long as you offer compensation in return.</li>

<li> Learn to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer, without making snide
comments in return.</li>

<li> Don't expect us to use our time to make your time easier or more
enjoyable.  This applies to people who want to solo all the time, but would
like free buffs and heals as well.  If you want our spells, group with
us.</li>

<li> Don't ever use words like &quot;d00d&quot;, &quot;plz&quot; or
&quot;u&quot; when speaking to us.  Don't use all caps - it really doesn't
make us think your request is any more urgent than the other 10 people we
just turned down.</li>

<li> Keep in mind that your time is no more valuable to you than our time
is to us.</li>

<li> Don't tell us that your level 50 XXX &quot;always&quot; does what we
just told you we wouldn't.  It's great if you run around doing charity work
- not everyone wants to, or is able to.</li>

<li> Don't ever call us names simply for saying &quot;no&quot;.  We were
polite enough to respond to you; do us a small favor of being polite in
return.</li>
</ul>

There are more aspects to &quot;Playing Nice&quot; than Verant codified as
policy.  We, the &quot;support&quot; class of Norrath are not employees of
Verant, therefor, we owe you nothing.  We don't owe you an answer, we don't
owe you an explanation, and we certainly don't owe you any of our time.
Just as you hate it when the telemarketers call during dinner, we hate it
when you interrupt our recreation time.  If you feel that your needs are
still more important than our own, we here at Support Classes of Norrath
gladly accept Visa, but we don't take American Express<BR>
