<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="More damage bonus explained">More damage bonus explained</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 09/21/00 12:35 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>The damage bonus is kind of confusing.  Gordon posted a good explaination about why slow weapons have more of a damage bonus now.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Here's the deal:<BR>
Every weapon in a primary weapons slot gets a damage bonus depending on level. Without this damage bonus, all weapons of equivalent ratio do the same damage over time. That means that a 20/40, a 10/20, and a 5/10 weapon would all do the same damage. <BR>
<BR>
Now lets factor in the damage bonus. If someone was using the 20/40 weapon, the damage bonus would be applied ONCE in a 4 second period. If they were using the 10/20 weapon, it would be applied TWICE in the same period. With the 5/10 weapon it would be applied FOUR times in that same 4 second period.<BR>
<BR>
It was this damage bonus which makes weapons that are very fast for their type better than those that are slower. The change we implemented merely flattened out the damage curve a bit.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why has verrent taken out the possiblity of a class wanting to use a bow as his main attack<BR>
It's not that we took it out, but that we specifically designed it so that it wouldn't be a "main" or "primary" form of attack. Spells have mana as a control mechanism that controls how much damage someone can do. Archery has no such control mechanism. Perhaps if we had included another "resource pool" of sorts, or tied it to stamina and reduced stamina regen, we could have done it, but we decided that spells would be the only primary form of ranged attack in the game. <BR>
