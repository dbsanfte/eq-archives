He would have killed me easily, but saved by the SOW I had got earlier. Ran to Unrest calling for some help. A friendly druid cured me and helped with finishing him off. Now I have a Reed Belt ! Bilge must be 34 or so, but is real nasty. Luckily I was on dry land. Off to see what people will offer me for it :)<BR>

He drops REED belt as a common or rare Pearl Kedge Totem.<BR>
I beat him with a bit of a tussle as a 40 Ranger...and would<BR>
not like to meet him without full health and mana.<BR>
<BR>
I have never found him in the same place or traveling in the same direction.  His spawn times have been quite random<BR>
with an occassional propensity to spawn the following day at about the same time(i've seen this twice and heard about<BR>
it once).  <BR>
<BR>
The other Goblin with the cleric item is Dwigus Lowater and<BR>
I can't beat him....but is blue to me.  The other rare<BR>
spawns are easy(Squallslither, Baracle Bones, Flotsam, and<BR>
Jetsam).<BR>
<BR>
I have traded a REED for Ykesha Short Sword....  :)<BR>

If you camp him....bring bat wings for levitate and plenty of bait for your fishing skill(+/- some beverages).<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Wow.  People sure raped that Neo guy.  I've never really camped the reed belt or care about it.  Just not one to actively camp rare stuff.  However it seems to have brought good luck.  In the last year and a half I've killed Bilge about 20 to 25 times.  Has had the Reed Belt about 90% of the time.  Usually trade it for 10k plat value in trade.  Never sold one yet.  So far I've only SEEN him spawn 2 times.  Both times a little ways from the Goblin Camp and both times I didn't have my character to kill him as I was camping goblin lords and such for xp.  Other times just happened across him on the way to Kedge and Unrest.  I'm guessing he probably spawns most anywhere.  I have lost him from target and tracking 5 or 6 times.  He seems to like running out to that middle island.  And I think the Dwarven Plate guy there woops his butt.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Bah, dont camp...pleh, i camped poor ol' Bilge and his buddy for 13 or 14 hours today on Bertoxxulous.  Dwigus conned yellow to me at 34 as a druid, yet i whupped him 3 or 4 times. Then FINALLY Bilge spawned.  I was downstairs getting a drink, and i knew i had competition out there so i hightailed it following him on tracking.  Anyways, both Dwigus and Bilge seem to have set points to run around and sit down. Lots of times, underwater, and they criss-cross the lake a lot. Best thing i did was root and DOT, and walk away. BTW he was a blue con to me. Anyways, so i come back, and i see a lvl 58 druid sitting there about to take him from me, so i pop 1 DD on him and she took him out.  Oddly enough, dont ask me how unless Bilge is a wuss on HP's, but i got the kill and the Belt, so i was happy. Funny thing was, as usual, i was accused as a KSer...i said look at the lvl's, and the conversation w/ that person quickly ended.  Anyways, he can be camped, you just need a massive ammount of patience...my brain is throbbing right now, so i must go :(</font></td></tr></table>
