NOT under the torch or you will agro all the Froggies behind the green curtain.  Oh yeah....the hidden Froggies LOL.  4 of them ready and waiting for you to stick your head past the curtain..so don't.  We held it easy with a 28 Pally, 35 Druid, and a 38 Wizard.  Others showed up later and helped making it even easier.  Not hard camp..just time consuming.   PLan to take the next few days off to recover from it LOL.  Best of luck.  Oh BTW He did heal himself in the fight,,,,but we timed it right so he never got to use his LoH.  Gotta love a wizard with a 400 point DD spell LOL.  Good luck</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>My last post here... hehe... I GOT ONE!<BR>
<BR>
The camp was easy.  If you are on a pvp server like I am, you may get run out of there a time or two, but the darkies don't have any reason to go back to the Shin Lord's room, so once you get in you're usually pretty safe.  <BR>
<BR>
At lvl 25, take a full group (and maybe a few others who wanna help you) if they are near your level.  you'll need a nicely rounded group, no matter how you do it.  At 30 the camp was pretty easy with me (pally) a druid and a warrior.  The shin lord is lvl 30.  <BR>
<BR>
Once you are in there, it's a matter of time and luck.  The first time we went, 6 hours and no GB.  the second time we went the darkies ran us out.  The third time we went, I got my GB in an hour and a half, and we ported the heck outta there.<BR>
<BR>
I must say, though, that this weapon is worth all the heartache I went thru to get it.  I had forgotten how good Bash was.  with GB I'm doing almost as much dmg as I was with my GZ, AND I get to use a shield (NICE AC bonus, plus stats from the shield) and bash.  <BR>

And let me say this all you young pallys need to get one of these, but i would not evern thing about trying unless you were lvl 28+.  When i camped it i had a lvl 33 warrior a lvl 45 shaman a lvl 37 pally and me lvl 23 at the time and we nearly died a few times.  Shin loard spawned twice, i was lucky first time he dropped bracer second he had the GB.  Shin loard is not sissy either he hits for nearly 100 with the weapon and is a pally so that mean he has loh so you have to kill him twice inless you can nuke him when he is low on life.  When we killed him i quickly looted gb and all of a sudden we had about 15 frogs on us.  (oh yeah we had a lvl 33 wiz ther too)  Luckly the wiz was able to evac us all to North karana, if not we would have all died.

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>For those saying this camp is easy for a mid-lvl group of 20s, it is not.  I camped this weapon from lvl 30 til 34, and just got it.  The place is crawling with froggies, obviously =), and they will aggro in a heart-beat.  YES, you can make it to the room beside the Lord's room (the one with the single spawn) while invis, but you can't pull anything from the yard "one at a time" unless you have a person who is high lvl enough to pull them (i.e., lvl 35 or so).  ONLY then, will you get single pulls, BUT even then the froggies run the risk of aggroing the surrounding 2 on his way in OR running a lap around the curtain room AND Lord room on his way to you.  An ENC can help with that kind of mess, but it can still get ugly VERY fast.  There again, if the ENC is below lvl 28+ you run the risk of being resisted (this applies to everything, as they do it alot) and then that really would be NASTY.<BR>
<BR>
I suggest a well-balanced group of high 20s, preferably 30s (28+, as stated in earlier posts) consisting of:  PALs, (obviously, it's our sword, hehe), RNG, ENC, CLE and some arcane back-up (WIZ, MAG, NEC).  Watch the pets, however, so that in the event the surrounding rooms have popped, they don't pull something you aren't ready for by accident.  Set you assist key to your main tank before you even work your way down, too.  Know the way to the zone in the event of a train or bad pull, casters can gate, WE can't.  It will save your life.  I've been turned around there too many times, it's not fun.<BR>
<BR>
I suggest if you're in one of these low lvl groups, to FIGHT your way down, IF you don't have a person high-lvl enough to single pull.  Invis down to the hall just past the warden room, and begin with the 2 Ton Warriors by the plank bridge, you should have no problems, and then the spawn will be broken by the time you get to the Lord room, is VERY helpful.  Keep it clear!<BR>
<BR>
I did this with a group consisting of:  37 PAL, 34 PAL (me), and another mid-lvl PAL.  We were able to fight our way in using SINGLE pulls (the 37 was pulling with stun), and killing all the way, ALL rooms, except for the Lord's, his was last.  It also helped we were using Mithril 2-handers, me and the 37, so the dmg dealt was enough to counteract the dmg taken, we'd med up and kill some more.  With plenty of time in between.  Be advised, SPREAD THE SPAWN in the Lord room, or when he does pop, and the 2 others along with him, usually a Ton Knight and a Shin Warrior, trying to kill a Shin Lord, with those other 2 beating on your back, WHILE he's hitting for 60-70, LOHing and spam healing when low, is NOT fun.  I had to LOH at lvl 34, the last time I fought him, if he takes a liking to you, taunting won't help - the lvl 37 was.  Might be a good idea to bring a shield to bash, to interrupt his spells.  The 37 had to switch mid-fight while I stunned so he'd die.<BR>
<BR>
Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST.  You guys who are high lvls who come to solo the Lord, (i.e., casters, warriors, SKs), I understand that you get it for other players, but don't sit and occupy the camp when a PAL comes prepped and ready for a Ghoulbane (grouped included), let the people who can use it, not SELL it or TWINK characters, have a chance.  And be patient, guys, depending on your luck (if it's like mine), you may be here awhile.  And don't buy one from someone, if you really want, CAMP it.  There's no feeling like reading, "You have looted a Ghoulbane"!!!<BR>

Hope this helps.  Be well =)<BR>

You can  go straight to hell if you don't like it cuz, I got the camp, 8).  If ya try to steal it, I'll let you die, 8)  If you get a GM to make me share it, then we gonna share, you gonna get HALF the exp, and I'll just read a book while waiting for my turn, 8)  And if all goes bad, I am not responsible if my pet trains lots of stuff that is blue to you to you, 8)  I'll just feign death, you can take 'em for me, 8)<BR>
<BR>
I'll camp what I want.  If you don't like it, that is your problem.  That thing sells for good money, and I could use some O that, 8)<BR>
<BR>
And if you are gonna give me some crap about "go camp your own stuff", umm...name a lvl 35 mob that I can kill for a Necromancer item or another item that is worth up to 10kpp (the highest quoted value I've seen for it), that I should rather camp.  <BR>
<BR>
If I'm there first, I ain't gonna move for a pally, damned if I care WHAT class you are.  If you got the camp, you have the camp, period.  Regardless of your reasoning for it, its urs until you leave.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>this room is not easy. i am a 51 mage and i can take all the spawns around him and all the spawns in that area almost at the same time. but sometimes i get screwed when i go to summon a pet and i get trained. they hit for upwards of 54 and shin lord can hit for nearly 70 double attack. i guess with a group of 5 lvl 29 characters hed be fairly easy but when all 3 spawns are up and you dont have an enchanter youd better have a druid to tp you</font></td></tr></table>
