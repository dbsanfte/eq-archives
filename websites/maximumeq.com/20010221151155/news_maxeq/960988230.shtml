<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
There are a few issues that are on the boards in multiple threads, so I thought I'd address them in one post:<BR>
<BR>
-TZ/VZ Moves-<BR>
<BR>
We'll be opening the /movelog command on TZ and VZ this Friday and leaving it open through Monday for move mid next week between those two servers. Specific's will be posted in the patch message tomorrow morning. If you can point out any issues that you think should be covered in the patch, please follow up in this thread.<BR>
<BR>
In regards to possible moves or looting changes for RZ, none are planed or likely. RZ was created at a different time than the two other servers, and has maintained its ruleset since release. Though we tried out the loot idea on TZ, our desire is to keep Rallos as it is at present. <BR>
<BR>
-Shrink Potion-<BR>
<BR>
We'll be giving the shrink potion (created via alchemy) the ability to shrink the user anywhere in the near future. It will be announced in the patch message when it goes in. I can't say for certain whether this will be tomorrow or whether it will be held off until the next item patch at the moment.<BR>
<BR>
-Spell Drop Rates-<BR>
<BR>
We'll be increasing them, but do want to maintain a rate at which they are still desired drops, and not loot that you just destroy because it's taking up space in your backpack.<BR>
<BR>
-Alchemy Prices-<BR>
<BR>
We'll be adjusting these, making alchemy less expensive. It won't be in tomorrow's patch, but probably in the one after that.<BR>
<BR>
-Poison-<BR>
<BR>
Still looking good for an end-of-june implementation.<BR>
<BR>
-Clipping Plane-<BR>
<BR>
Several months ago some people complained that they were no longer able to adjust the clipping plane out as far as they had been. We've gone through all of the zone headers and put the "Maximum Clip" out as far as the data export would allow. This has been live for a while and we've been unable to find any other problems.<BR>

Abashi explains why.<BR><BR>

Take the advice of this wise cleric.  Just don't die :)</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Experience loss is calculated as a percentage of total experience, not the experience required for a current level. The number of bubbles that are lost really doesn't matter. This is just the way that the math works out. You don't lose a higher percentage of total experience, it just happens to be a higher percentage of experience required for the current level.<BR><BR>

For those looking for a good challenge, Trakanon looks like it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
Well we were exploring in sebilis last night, and were a few hours in. We came to a big huge open room, then we see "Soando shivers and shakes" then right in front of me I see Trakanon! The lvl 60 with us conned him...red. Then he agroed. First aoe wave, 10dead...second aoe wave, 10more. Then his guardians came, hitting for 300+. He himself hit for dual 650's I heard from my groupmate. What I want to know, is do you think he is fair and "doable" in his current state? Yeah I agree he should be very hard, but an AoE dot that had to be at least 300dmg a tick and an AoE DD that was 800 or more damage...along with his guards bashing for 300...clerics arent gonna keep up with that.<BR>
Anyway abashi, would you tell me if that sounds right to you? It doesnt seem so...and if it is...I fear veeshan =)<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Players have always surprised us with their ability to easily overcome situations that we first thought were undoable, so I don't think it will be too long before some, somewhere, show's Trakanon whats what. It just takes a little while to refine the strategy. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Skill increases while duelling">Skill increases while duelling</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/04/00 12:20 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This makes sense really.  My "defence coach" from a skill of 191 to 200 was a plaguebone skeleton in Dreadlands with my cleric.  There are other ways, but nothing was as fun as seeing a lot of people run by me and wonder just what is going on :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Skills are meant to be increased by fighting creatures that actually intend to kill you, thus imparting *risk* in exchange for the *reward* of a skill increase. Allowing people to skill up while dueling would allow someone to neglect a particular weapons skill all the way up to the high levels, then build it up from nothing without risk.<BR><BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="MaxEQ: Double slot items">MaxEQ: Double slot items</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/03/00 02:29 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>When I say "double slot item", I'm referring to items that go into more than one slot.  For example, Totem of the Warrior spirit, which can be weilded in the off hand, or ranged slot.  Also, the Aegis of Life, which is both a shield and a back slot item.<BR><BR>

When I designed the database for MaxEQ, the only items that could fit in more than one slot were ranged weapons.  They were easy to show in both, because ranged weapons have a range (although, I don't think I implemented that very well either). However, with the introduction of Kunark, a lot of items can fit in more than one slot.<BR><BR>

I do have plans to modify the site to display these items in a better fashion, but it is going to take time.  Almost all the scripts have to be changed to reflect this.  I do not have an ETA for this change, as other things are planned to be completed before then.<BR><BR>

Thanks everyone who have asked for this change.  I didn't think it was as important to people as it is.</font></p>
