Gordon had this response:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Bypassing the recast time of a spell by zoning was a bug. The fact that we fixed it should have been listed in the patch message, and I apologize that it wasn't. Apparently we had to spend time on the reset-on-zone issue in order to implement some of the cooler spells and disciplines for post-50 play.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Alot of people seem upset about the last patch, in regard to the paladin spawns that were fixed. It seems that for the most part, some servers have had success, while others lack. All servers seem to be having a consistant problem with the Sentry and Undead Cyclops Spawns<BR>
Please keep in mind that though the spawns were fixed, it doesn't mean that they are always around, just that they spawn at the rate at which they are intended. The Undead Cyclops spawn was one of those that we looked at when reviewing all of the spawn times, it was spawning improperly and should be working appropriately now. We also made changes to the Netmasters, Cooks, Clockworks, and Plague sharks. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Game Enhancement Questions">Game Enhancement Questions</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/13/00 06:31 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Some good questions and answers about some enhancements for EQ</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;When you target and NPC and hit 'h', you say 'Hail Whoever'. Why can this not also be so when hailing players? <BR>
That's always bugged me too. I'll ask the guys about it tomorrow. Thanks for reminding me  <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;More communication of what's going on to those around you, or at least in your group. I'd like my casters to be able to see me taunting away, and I'd like to see the damage they're doing or not doing with their spells. This would promote trust within the group I'd think<BR>
<BR>
We like the idea that people learn to trust that those in their group will do their jobs (such as a warrior taunting), but we also have a technological bias here. Any time we broadcast a message to everyone in a group, that uses bandwidth. Though the amount of bandwidth in use might seem inconsequential, when we take a very frequent occurance like taunting, and multiply it by 50K+ people online at one time, it *really* adds up. <BR>
<BR>
The group loot messages, which is the last thing we added a group broadcast for, occur far less frequently than something like a taunt would, definitely uses a good chunk of bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;A kind of "/who all zone" command, that would either list, or at least give a count of the players in a specific zone (without one being in that zone). In an overcrowded environment, it would save casual players a great deal of time if they could look to find a less-used zone to hunt in without having to travel to it first.<BR>
<BR>
We're still looking into the possibility of this. We like the idea and think it would enhance gameplay for those that choose to find greener pastures.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Be able to buy large quantity items without having to click my mouse button 40 times. A slider bar is good<BR>
<BR>
Good idea. I know we have this on the wish-list, but no definite short-term plans for it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;An option that allows other players inspecting you to see the stats of the equipment you're wearing.<BR>
<BR>
This probably won't happen. I think that it opens a nice avenue for communication. It also gives people the option of keeping the stats on an item secret. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;When SOW, invisible, etc wears off the text should be flashing in multiple colors. A lot better than the hard-to-see blue text<BR>
<BR>
We're still looking into options to help out in these cases, and also in the cases where people are color-blind. I'm blue-black colorblind myself.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Wrong Diety Displayed">Wrong Diety Displayed</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/13/00 06:20 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Apparently once upon a time, EQ would display your diety incorrectly.  Abashi had this to say about it:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;My enchanter started out in the beginning as a worshipper of Erolissi Marr. Another person that I was traveling with at the time, a wizard, started out worshipping Solusek Ro. Around the same time (level 24 I believe), both of our religions were changed to Tunare. We petitioned then and the guide told us they'd log it as a bug, but that there was nothing they could do.<BR>
There was a bug a while back that would cause the deity name to change spontaneously, but this was just a display bug. It didn't change what deity you actually have selected, because that is based upon a faction that is created at character creation. As for the Deity that is displayed, the GMs were correct in that they do not have the ability to change that. <BR>
<BR>
In other words, should a deity-specific item be implemented, it will take into account your original deity, not the one that is displayed now were you affected by that bug. <BR>

Here is Gordon's response to the thread involving this weapon.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Yeah that 150dmg 15 delay sword was our fault. We wanted Inte to be carrying a flaming sword, and one of the game designers figured that no one would ever be able to kill him and made the sword a little unruly. We did have the forethought to make it NORENT though, and changed the stats in the item database to something a little less nasty, but we went so long without patching items that someone actually managed to kill Inte two days before the patch. <BR>
That'll teach us to go around calling NPCs unkillable <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;It has occurred to me that with the new deity restriction on items that spells are scrolls before they get memorised. Maybe there can be deity only spells?<BR>
Wow, you certainly put a lot of work into this list. Though we have no plans at present to implement deity-restricted spells, it's something we can keep in mind for the future.<BR>

The problem with the loud footsteps was indeed something that we implemented today.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Here is a suggestion that has some merit. To reduce the idiotic amount of KSing, to promote some semblance of balance between the classes who wish to compete for quest items for themselves and those who Camp and Farm items for profit and ebay....remove Rare NPCs from tracking.<BR>
It has long been our stance that the ability to track down rare spawns is a benefit of having tracking. Removing rare spawns from the tracking list as you request would negate that benefit.<BR>

No plans for this. We really don't see it making sense in the grand scheme of things. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;With the addition of religion-based items, hopefully Verant will consider giving a player the option of changing their current religion status. I would find it disturbing to not be able to use a newly introduced item (ever) simply because I chose no particular religion at the start of the game.<BR>
<BR>
No plans for this either. It's really no different than someone being unable to wield/wear an item due to their selection of race or class.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I was just wondering what will happen to people that have a full experience bar in 50, will they automatically become 51 when they launch RoK or will the exp bar be reset?<BR>
We won't be subtracting any experience points from anyone. The only *possible* thing that could happen is that we make an adjustement to the experience curve for level 50 prior to the release of Kunark which might make it appear that you have less experience. It is very unlikely at this point that we will do that. <BR>
<BR>
We expect that when Kunark goes live that there will be many people who are but a kill or two away from level 51.<BR>

<BR>
***Patch Day***<BR>
<BR>
The following is a list of changes that were implemented on the Live EverQuest servers today:<BR>
<BR>
*Spells*<BR>
<BR>
- You will now receive a message when attempting to mesmerize a creature that is immune to that type of spell.<BR>
- You can now right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what instrument skill is used by the spell.<BR>
- Dyn's Dizzying Draught has had its casting time lowered significantly.<BR>
- Corrected a bug in the Druid root+damage spells (Enveloping roots series) that caused the spell's damage to have a chance of breaking the spell.  They work much better now.<BR>
- The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<BR>
- The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from "Outdoor only" to "Night only".  It may now be cast in dungeons.<BR>
- Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians to inscribe the Malosi spell.  It was not intended for magicians under level 50.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*General Changes/Fixes*<BR>
<BR>
- Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity.  If a deity restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you right-click-and-hold on the item.<BR>
- The AC on the mid-level cleric quest armor has been increased.<BR>
- The Terror Mask will now cast "Fear" instead of "Call of Bones" as previously announced.  The "Call of Bones" effect was placed on this item by mistake.<BR>
- The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<BR>
- The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<BR>
- Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<BR>
- Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of Ro (Paladin) quests.  They have been fixed and Paladins should have a much easier time of obtaining their armor.<BR>
- Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.<BR>
- Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate action of the spell.  Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell line-up.<BR>
- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the instrument in use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Kerra Ridge*<BR>
<BR>
Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped.  The target level-range for the zone has been slightly increased.  In addition, many new quests have been added to the zone.  The faction for Kerrans has been changed so that those who killed them indiscriminately before today's update can take part.  Be warned that the Kerrans still do not like everyone.<BR>
<BR>
*Paw*<BR>
<BR>
Paw has received another minor difficulty adjustment.  In addition, item drop percentages have been increased.<BR>
<BR>
*The Plane of Hate*<BR>
<BR>
The Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp.  Take care in your exploration of this zone as many things have changed.<BR>

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Random Spawn Times">Random Spawn Times</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/11/00 04:00 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This is some good news.  I know that uber-guilds camping rare spawns was becoming a problem on several servers.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I know that camping spawns is (now) a normal part of this game BUT on MM a guild has begun to camp the rear spawns like Phinigel, Tranix, and yes even Naggy, Lady Vox and the plains buy camping out RIGHT next to the spawn or close enough that they can clam the rights to the spawn when they log back in on mass at a predetermined time and taking the spawn that they have timed… <BR>
I really don't think that this is possible any longer. Some time ago we put in code that added a random component to the spawn timer for the longer spawns. Though I can't specifically announce the size of the random component, I can say that the window for a dragon-type spawn is in excess of 24 hours. That means that even if they had it timed before we did this, they'd have to sit around a LONG time.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;There are no items that drop that can only be used by worshippers of God X. Why not? <BR>
Actually we just implemented the ability to restrict item use by deity. You should see items of this nature start appearing in-game in the near future. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;When I started my dark elf enchanter I decided to choose a God (Innoruuk). To add insult to injury, I'm KOS by my own God and his minions!<BR>
<BR>
He's the God of Hate. He really doesn't like anybody. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Wolves are ok, but not dark elves?!?! <BR>
<BR>
I believe that everyone is KOS in Hate now, regardless of illusion.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Reward the folks that have the guts to pick a deity! Pleas make religion matter! It's such an easy way to add flavor to a game that really needs it. <BR>
<BR>
Religion does matter, for instance, there are quests in the game that you can only get if you are of the appropriate faction, and faction is in part controlled by the deity that you worship. <BR>
<BR>
As for additional reward, as I mentioned above, items restricted by deity are going to enter the game soon.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>There will definitely be areas that you fight in and explore. We're starting an entirely new race over there, so lower level areas were a must. The new lands aren't exclusively high level.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;URGENT Rogues can be banned for pickpocketing<BR>
No, they can't. I discussed this issue with the customer service team today, and they are in the process of getting the word out to the GMs and Guides to be sure that everyone is clear. <BR>
<BR>
What rogues (or anyone for that matter) could be banned for is being anti-social and trying to cause problems, though these actions have to be judged at the time that they are committed. <BR>
<BR>
For instance, there's no problem with you pickpocketing MobX. However if you chose to following around a group emoting "/em steals 3 platinum from a_gnoll_scout00", while taunting them in /say with "Haha, I'm stealing all your money", thus trying to ruin their gameplay experience, it could be considered harassment. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have noticed that when i wear "robe of the keeper", a red robe, then turn into a wood elf it appears similar to a rubicite breast plate. Then when i wear a "GSD", a green robe, and turn into a wood elf, it looks like green platemail. Both of these little graphics are pretty cool. One question i have is why doesn't this same thing work with an FBR, a black robe? I think it should look like a black breast plate. Please answer this and hopefully fix it.<BR>
The plate-look that you get when you switch to the wood-elf race is due to the engine trying to account for the fact that there is no graphic for the requested item on the new race. In this case, wood elves cannot wear robes, so the client chooses to display the robe as a like-colored metal chest piece. <BR>
<BR>
As for the FBR, I'm not quite sure why it isn't showing itself as a black chestplate, but it sounds as if the alternate texture set might not be specified. How does the FBR appear when you illusion to a wood elf? <BR>

Below is a response from Abashi on the General Gameplay forum regarding the Paw of Oppolla quest.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I am concerned with the changes to that zone, I have not seen High Priestess Mitty since the zone was changed, and the preistess that spawns where she was drops nothing so far. What I want to know is whether or not the Gold Ring for the Paw of Opalla still drops? Is the Paw still atainable? It should be noted that I play on Test, and I have no idea if this change has hit the production servers.<BR>
The revamp of Kerra will be going to the live servers tomorrow morning. There have been quite a few new things done with this zone. As for your specific questions, we prefer to leave them up to the players to figure out. I will say that we didn't overlook anything in regards to the Paw of Opalla, but I can't say whether or not it will still be obtainable after the zone goes live.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;wow, i mean a no mana cost once per day ability to annihiate one undead mob at later levels. <BR>
Well we won't have this in the form that you ask, but there is a pretty nifty anti-undead spell that clerics can look forward to at later levels. I apologize, but as it is part of the expansion, I can't really comment on it quite yet.<BR>
