<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I am so tired of hearing people who DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THE EBS calling it a train puller. This sword is great. It does more dam per sec than the SSoM, and that calculation is just off of the dam/dly ratio. The Ensnaring Roots is BONUS damage and roots the monster too. For us real gamers out there, who like to actually THINK and STRATEGIZE and utilize our weapons, spells, etc for maximum return, this sword beats the SSoM (the most common alternative to the EBS at certain levels) hands down. If a party says they don't want you because you're using them, screw em. You'll definitely find a party that appreciates this weapon, especially if you know how to use it.</font></td></tr></table>

Instead of taking the time to wine in that last post, you could have always went to everlore and found out that the patriarch is probably between lvl 35 and 45, and lower guk is a 34+ zone for clerics, enchanters and bards, and probably 38+ for everyone else.  Yes, his info did help.  As a rule of thumb, if the zone is pre-kunark, and you don't know what it is, you probably are not high enough level to go there in the first place.  The use of all those punctuation marks doesn't help, it just annoys people like me.<BR>

I am a level 32 Ranger, and I am thinking about trying to get one of these blades after I gain another few levels. Could someone who has actually gotten the sword please post about where to find the Mino Patriarch, what level he is, around what he hits for (any spells he uses?) and other such information that would be helpful to a group that is planning to camp him.

As for dungeon fights, I've been in mistmoore and splitpaw with it and have yet to cause a train. But I do warn all I group with of its proc of ensnaring roots. a pull of 3 Tech Mas Gnolls hasn't killed me or my group members. Rangers, ALWAYS ask what the groups game plan is and invite a good druid in your group, as well as an enchanter! Make sure the <BR>
warriors you group with have an excellent Taunt. This should be common sense in ANY dungeon where SOW cannot be cast. <BR>
<BR>
Another trick, Have a Necromancer stand in back of the group near the most likely avenue of escape for your prey.<BR>
Have him/her fear the creature as it tries to run, it will<BR>
run back to your melee types, be killed and viola potential problem solved, by good planning. <BR>
<BR>
Keep this sword! At least until you can get a Ykesha. <BR>
Its a free spell and, despite its detractors comments, can be very handy when things need kiting. 90% of the area in the game is outdoors, and good dungeon plans prevent trains.<BR>

I use it in my off-hand with an icy blade in my primary hand (if anyone thinks I should switch the placement of these two weaps comments would be greatly appreciated).  The weap hasnt caused any trains so far, however, before going into battle I let my group know and if anyone has any problems with it I switch to my SSoM.  My dex is 124 (w/o buffs) and the weap procs nicely for approx mid 30s dmg(albeit less than the icy blade).<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>You shouldn't try to use these inside.  Some people on here say "you just need to change your style and some people aren't willing to do it"  Well there is a darn good reason people don't do it.  The reason being it can easily get you killed.  What happens when the mob starts to run and snare is resisted?  Those weapons aren't worth dying or even having to zone.  They don't do THAT much more damage.  When you have to whole fight to get snare to stick you are going to get it.  But when you have 10 seconds before it gets a couple of it's friends on you then you are risking everybody's lives.  So if you walk around underground weilding these don't go whining on the ranger board saying "Rangers suck, people never invite me into a group"  The chances are that you'll kill the group more than you'll help it with a little extra DD.  These are great weapons but keep back up ones that you can use for ALL situations.</font></td></tr></table>
