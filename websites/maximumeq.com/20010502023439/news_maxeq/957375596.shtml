<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The factions in Kunark are pretty complex, but it is as intended. The stronghold in the Overthere is filled with NPCs loyal to the same NPCs as those in Karnor. Players should seriously consider where they want to be faction-wise prior to killing anything that moves.<BR>

I've had roots break instantly lately, and roots last entire fights while I was nuking something.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe its just that i can see the message when it break. However, it just seems all of my immobilize spells are being broken VERY fast...MUSH faster than before..inspite of usage of DD.<BR>
There haven't been any negative changes to the root line in a long time (over six months). The only change that was made recently was to reverse the order in which the root effect and damage effects are applied from the druid root line, which should make it break less.<BR>

- Each number costs 5pp.<BR>
- An individual may purchase as many numbers as he/she wants.<BR>
- Numbers will be handed out sequentially, and when the lotto numbers are all given out, a public Random will be held to determine the 1st and 2nd<BR>

made.<BR>
<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello All,<BR>
Many of you have been wondering why the EverQuest Store isn't up right now, so I'd like to take a moment to address this issue.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously things didn't go smoothly in regards to the shipping to many people who bought Kunark. We're very sorry for the problems we have had. <BR>
<BR>
We felt that until we have completely straightened out the problems with this process that it isn't fair to put it back up. We don't want to throw gasoline onto a fire.<BR>
<BR>
We're taking the time to correct the back-end problems that caused this in the first place. Until we're satisfied that this process is completely smooth we won't be putting it back up.<BR>
<BR>
As of now we don't have an ETA, but once we feel confident that we can deliver orders in a timely and efficent manner we will put it up. We will make sure to keep you all informed as to our progress towards this goal.<BR>
<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Iksar faction change -- Important">Iksar faction change -- Important</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/28/00 10:09 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>If you have an Iksar character, take note!<BR><BR>

It was probably supposed to be this way from the start, and is what Abashi meant a while ago by Iksar having certain disadvantages.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
The faction information on the live servers in reference to Iksar and how they interact with other factions outside Kunark is incorrect. Corrections will be going in tomorrow, making the Iksar KOS (Kill on Sight) to pretty much everything on the other continents. We normally wouldn't announce something like this, however we want to give Iksar who may have bound next to or near something that is liable to become KOS to them tomorrow a chance to get away.<BR>
<BR>
This announcement is not meant to be a free license to go exploring the mainland with your Iksar tonight, and our plans to pre-announce issues such as this in the future hinge on players not taking advantage of the information. We appreciate everyone's cooperation. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;My character casts all his spells the same way (the same animation for casting). Since we have all these new emotes around, would it be possible to integrate that into the spells?<BR>
</font>
Funny that you should mention that. Keep an eye on the gestures made by some of the higher level casters <BR>

That should help stop farmers.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Actually I just looked and it appears that there are about 1500 less auctions than there were a month ago. I'm happy to see some voluntary compliance out there with the rules against doing this.<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Can't they just call Ebay and tell them they have banned the sale of items and to not allow it? If it is against their policy and these items are copywritten, why isnt this possible?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
There are other issues involved that I can't go into at present. Something like this should happen in the not-too-far-off future though.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Kunark performance">Kunark performance</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/28/00 09:58 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>It has been said since Ruins of Kunark was announced that they would be pushing the EQ engine harder than before, and raising the system requirements.  That usually means slower performance, but more eye candy.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>As Brad mentioned in another thread, the swaying trees really have nothing to do with the framerates that people are getting. What is probably more responsible is the fact that the zones are very large and that we allow you to push your clipping plane out quite far.<BR>
The beautifully crafted landscapes of Kunark push the abilities of your graphics card and CPU further than the lands shipped with EQ proper. The outdoor zones are also densily populated with NPCs.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing your clipping plane further in should help the framerate issues. We are also looking into seeing if we can make any further performance tweaks, but the issue is primarily caused by there being so much more to see on Kunark.<BR>

They more than make up for it with their spells though.  Just my opinion though...</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Though I don't wish to get too deep into this at this time, I would like to explain a few things. More is taken into account than skills. A level 60 hybrid with a 2HS skill of X is better with his sword than a level 40 warrior with the same skill value. In fact, all of the hybrids will be better at melee at level 60 than a level 50 warrior. They of course will not be as good as a level 60 warrior, but this should be understandable. <BR>

At any rate, Abashi has more to say about it:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I then thought about that. Once I reach L60, if I were to have my body with all the items I had gained over the last 100+ days of playing time, how would I feel. Then I asked myself why would they make a zone like this? I dont know, it doesnt sound like fun in any sense.<BR>
Well I'm sure no one would be happy about losing a corpse, however if they are of the level and in a guild capable of doing that zone, there are probably a good number of spares running around that would make reequipping fairly painless.<BR>

Some players are complaining that it takes too long to level after you reach level 51 and above.<BR><BR>

Last time I checked, this wasn't LevelQuest.  Enjoy the game.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I saw a ranger on Veeshan Tuesday evening who was 53. The level curve from 50 to 60 does get progressively steeper, but there are far more things to kill that give experience, so its certainly reasonable.<BR>
