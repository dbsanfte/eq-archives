Last night, Scaevola Fallenangel, 37th rank monk and guildleader of the Ironfists (the monk-only guild on Bertoxxulous), had finally gained all of the items he needed for one of our best robes, the Robe of the Lost Circle. It receives an upgrade via a quest in Kunark. I've seen perhaps a handful of monks with this robe. He placed all of the items into his large sewing kit and, as instructed by the quest NPC, he hit Combine.<BR>
And he failed, even though the item was easily trivial at his skill level.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
I agree that the skill check is a pain. Let me see what I can do.<BR>

I'm kinda upset with this. The shamans waited for weeks after Kunark opened looking for this thing and then they finally put it in (without even admitting that it was left out). And now it it is in, but it is the same quest that is in Firiona Vie. You need Clay, Bonechips, Crushed Dread Diamonds, and Shaman powder. The thing that makes me mad is you guys put this quest in without even checking it because it is BROKEN! It's been weeks now and STILL no one has found those Crushed Dread Diamonds. There have been rumours that they drop off of Pirates but that has not been confirmed. There have also been crystals foraged in the Dreadlands, but these are identified as Frost Crystals. What the heck is going on with this quest!? Please..at least check to see quests work when you implement them.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
I haven't checked it personally, but the designer that put the quest in checked it out yesterday. Someone just has to figure out where to get those things. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>This morning I was handed a list of spell changes that didn't make it into the patch message. I'll put up an addendum later today, but here's the list for review:<BR>
* Banshee Aura has had its duration increased.<BR>
* Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still cancel the spell.<BR>
* Shaman can now cast Charm Animal<BR>
* Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana costs altered.<BR>
* Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their mana cost lowered.<BR>
* Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work properly.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Locked door exploit/work around">Locked door exploit/work around</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/07/00 12:40 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>There is another way to open locked doors, by using AoE spells.  However, as my guild found out, this can meet with dire consequences :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
There are currently three ways to open a locked door without lockpicking it:<BR>
1) Sense dead (for dead mob) or sense summoned (for a pet), then send a pet in. Pet will teleport through door without opening it, but when it aggros mob inside, the mob will run back and will open the door.<BR>
<BR>
2) Eye of Zomm/Stalking Probes. If you summon an eye while standing directly next to door and facing it, the eye will appear on other side. Then you fly him in and aggro a mob who kindly opens a door for you.<BR>
<BR>
3) Fear. Not always possible due to pathing, but in some cases, you can cast fear on a mob, and he will run into door and open it.<BR>
<BR>
What is the position of GMs on it? Is it allowed? Or is it a bannable offense?<BR>
<BR>

Level 51 Rogue, E'ci<BR>
Sacrament of Chaos<BR>
</font>
It's not considered illegal at present, but more of a design consequence. In any case, I don't think that it is as reliable as having a rogue there to open the door for you.<BR>
<BR>
We've been considering a few different options to eliminate this issue. One would be for all NPCs to walk through doors without opening them, like it was in beta. This looks bad though. We've got a couple other ideas that we are thinking about as well.<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone feel that this is an issue that needs attention? In other words, do you feel that these are reliable enough options as to decrease the importance of rogues?<BR>
<BR>
