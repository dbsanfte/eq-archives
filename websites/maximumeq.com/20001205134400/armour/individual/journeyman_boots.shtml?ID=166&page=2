<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I got my jboots on Vallon zek at level 23 doing the quest,<BR>
with much help from friends, I managed to come up with the<BR>
items (including the ring) and turned it all in and got the <BR>
boots.<BR>
<BR>
Here is the trick to get hasten to spawn,<BR>
If you get to Rath and wait for him with the items and<BR>
happen to see brother zephyl run by, dont wait for him to<BR>
die, petition that it is interfering with the quest, A GM<BR>
might have some doubt about doing it (the gm I spoke with<BR>
did) but they should eventually make zephyl kill himself.<BR>
Hastens only place holders are drakes (level 23 - 26) and <BR>
Brother Zephyl (level 53+)<BR>
I waited about 4 days to finally see the AC in oot and got<BR>
the ring from a friend, same day I got the ring I spent<BR>
2 hours in rath waiting for Hasten, and sure enough from the<BR>
directions above I followed and He spawned. (considering I <BR>
had hard enough time sittin in the zone with 325p while<BR>
evils fill the zone, me being a dwarf I had to hide with<BR>
camo from a friend who was camping him with me)<BR>
<BR>
When hasten came by, he is very quick, make a hotkey to say<BR>
'what journeymen boots?', Hail does not work, I tryed it <BR>
although it may have been the lag :P.<BR>
My druid buddy had to snare hasten and run to zone with him<BR>
for me to get him (frantically ran giving him the items, did<BR>
not even bother asking bout the journeyman boots)<BR>
sure enough I droped the items several times but all in all<BR>
it was a fun quest.<BR>
I was level 23 at the time and I got bout 1/2 bub experience <BR>
with a 37 druid in the group after I turned in the items.<BR>

If you read the post above, the man states that<BR>

he carried on him 325plat to do the quest.<BR>
<BR>
bs.. cause Hasten wants gold.. 3250g<BR>
<BR>
Next he spouts that he drops the items a few times..<BR>
except for the gold, everything else is nodrop.. so how he droped them i dont. know..<BR>
<BR>
please dont lie.. it hurts people actually trying to do the quest.  Can you imagine if someone actually gave Hasten plat instead of gold and it said thank you.  I would go out of my mind.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>A few works on Jboots....  1st word is LUCK.  I spent 3 weeks in SR when i was playing my 36 mage waiting for the AC to spawn.  If I didn't feel like camping the AC, would play another charecter.  One night I woke in the middle of the night sick.  Thought I would jump on to see what was what.  My mage was in SR (as usual).  Made a pet and ran to the top of the first dune.  To my amazement, there was the Anciant Cyclops walking along as pretty as you please.  He was not running so I knew no one had seen him yet.  I started following.  I checked to see who all was in the zone.  (If there are high level Wizzies you may as well hang it up)  There were only a few people my level or higher, a druid and a couple warriors.  I continued following the AC till I had my pet buffed (berzerk and inferno shield).  Just as I sent in my pet for the first attack, someone shouted that the AC was up.  Well here came the warriors and a few others.  I started nuking (spike spells as he resists flame based) and this time I did the most damage.  I struck the first blow and the last.  No doubt the others landed a few of their own.  The AC dropped the ring.  Looked more like a leather belt and could only wear on wrist. Good stats too, ac+6 and INT +5.  Very good for a mage.  Note: he was blue to me at 36 and felt like about a level 30 mob.  Anyway, I immediatly went to SK zone and asked if anyone was hunting Shadowed men.  There was a group there and they let me join.  The third round of fighting yielded the shadowed rapier i sought.  I was off to the bank to collect the gold.  Encumbered with 3,500 gold pieces,(he only requires 3,250 but I couldn't remember for sure and wasn't gonna take any chances) and 100 Plat, I gated back to Rathe Mountians.  Upon my entry, I /ooc if anyone had seen Hasten.  Got a report he was seen 20 minutes ago.  Did a /shout to announce a reward of 100 plat for anyone who found, hailed, and gave me the loc of Hasten.  15 minutes or so later I got the message.  I FINALLY had my Jboots.<BR>
<BR>
Last word on Jboots..... Are they worth the quest???  In my humble opinion, YES !!  <BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I got my JBoots when i was around lvl 32.  I was running from Oggok to Freeport when the Ancient Cyclops atacked me in south ro.  If i remember correctly he was blue to me, or maybe white, i dont remember.  I had a druid the same lvl with me, the druid kept getting resisted, so he sowed me and i bellowed if for 20 minutes till it died.  I went and got a shdow rapier from the commons, and went to rathe mts.  That damn monk was up and i want to get some sleep, so I dueled my buddy and lost on purpose. i left the shadow rapier on my corpse and logged for the nigh.  I came back the next morning and hasten was up, a kind ranger stopped him for me, and I looted my rapier and went to deliver the goods to Hasten.  I just wanted you all to know that the rapier, unless it was patched, wont disapear on a corpse, so you dont need to wait ungodly amounts of time for hasten, you can log and goto bed. or work or what ev<BR>

<BR>
Anyway, Got my Jboots today.  What a great feeling, 24/7 SoW.  Now I am feeling greedy and want the pegasus cloak.  Heheh.  I neevr killed the ancient either.  I had a friend that had transferred from Fennin to Druzzil with me, and one night, after a long and wonderful episode in Unrest, Zapsum goes like, "Got JBoots yet?"  I was like, hahahhaha, hell no.  He said, "Well, we'll just have to get you a pair."<BR>
<BR>
I was like, "huh?"  He then stated that he had already gotten a pair and one pair for another friend, and has the ring again.  All I have to do is get the Shadowed Rapier and the gold, and we'll do the quest.  I went with a good SK friend of mine, and killed Shadowed men for 30 min, and got one.  Found out they disappear when you log and proceeded to curse alot.  I left my computer on and connected overnight.  Got up to find Zap on again and informed him that I had the other parts.<BR>
<BR>
Then I call my favorite druid, Jarlax, and we are off to Feerrott.  Go LD through the port, and believe it or not, didn't lose the rapier.  Get there and find that monk doing circles on the rock.  I had heard about this and immediately petition.  In about 45 min, Gm 32k's the punk.  Tell Zap that GM took out the monk, and he come and we sit in the cove place past the first left from Feerrott.  Good place.  Kill some Cycs while we wait and Jar picks up Bootstrutter on tracking.  Hell yeah... <BR>
<BR>
He does this funky little run a bit, stop, turn around, full throttle the other way, turn around, run farther this time dance... And he is fast as hell when you have 3250 gp on you....  even with str buff and SoW.  Caught the little bugger and Zap handed the ring, and he said, well that's great, but where is the rapier and the 3250 gold? or something to that effect.  Handed over my share, and BANG, boots.<BR>
<BR>
Got my boots, and let me tell you, worth every penny.  And trust me, need it the most being a cleric.  hehe.  Just makes me a better field medic now...<BR>

Does that rally work?  Could I find someone with the ring and have them turn the ring in and me just turn in the money and the rapier?  I would think that would not work, it sounds kinda like a glitch oh well.  Hopefully someone answers my question.</font></td></tr></table>
