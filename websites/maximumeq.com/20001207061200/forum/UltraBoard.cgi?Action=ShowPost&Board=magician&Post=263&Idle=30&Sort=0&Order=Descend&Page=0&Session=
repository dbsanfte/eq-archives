Have no more then one Earth elemental in a group, but one is nessary if you don't have a druid to bind your enemies.<br>
They cast earth bind spells and have the most health.<p>

Water is great for soloing.<br>
They cause nice damage and are all around good fighters. They cast Ice spells.<br>
Great for desert or lava areas where mobs do not have any resistance against cold.<p>

Fire cause the most damage, great for groups with at least one earth elemental or druid. They are nice to use, but lacks health. Great for the north where mobs (gnolls and orcs) lack resistance against fire. I think they cast both fire shield and flame bolt. Note rain and snow may cause your spells to fizzle  more often, at least that is what I have experience.<p>

Air is great for surprise. They cast invisiblity on themselves. It looks like you don't have a pet at first. Great for large groups where pets might get in the way. They would be great for group dungeon play if you can see them.<br>
I am close to 16th lvl, I should be able to test it, with see invis or accumen spells.<br>
Most agile of the pets and hardest to hit.<p>

Get "Burn Out" when you get a chance. It really enhances your pet for a long time 15 min.<p>

Well I hope it helps!<p>

Earth are great for soloing, they cast root to keep the mob off you while you blast it away. Downfall is they have low agility and get hit a lot more than the other elementals, but there massive amount of hitpoints more than make up for that.<p>

Water are the perfect group and kiting pet, there ice spell does nice damage, they have good AGI and STR and they have the fastest Hitpoint Regen of all the pets.<p>

Air are also nice in certain situations, like dungeons, they have invisability to keep them out of trouble and they cast Stun and have high agility, but there low hitpoints hold them back from being a worthwhile pet.<p>

Fire.....Positivly useless, now let me explain, they do NOT do more damage than all the other pets. They do out damage earth and air with there fire spell but do the same damage as water. The only reason they are called the pet that does the most damage is because of there built in Fire Shield, thats the ONLY reason that they are considered the highest damage dealing pet. Now i have heard you can stack your damage shield on top of this pets but it still makes very little difference, with there EXTREMELY LOW hitpoints this pet is the worst of all.<p>

All in all I use Earth and Water mainly, i do keep Air on hand for when i go deep into dungeons with a small group, but thats a rarity<p>

Earth pets - good for soloing.  If you are in a group with someone who can snare (or snare and fear), bonds of force, or any spells that slow the mob down then kill your earth pet and use a different one such as air or water (fire would be useless unless it is being hit).  When a mob is rooted, they can attack.  When they are snared and running away from you or below 25% hit points left, then they will not attack you.<p>

Water pets are resistant to poison.  This makes them valuable if you are fighting poison based mobs such as Crag Spiders, Heart Spiders, Black Widows, etc.  <p>

Air pets do cast stun which will interrupt casters. This is important early on and to some extent as you travel in higher level dungeons (in full groups).  <p>

However, their invisibility is only effective up to a certain point.  Many dungeons are filled with casters and most casters see through invis.  By the time you visit Sol Dungeon you will find that EVERYTHING in that dungeon sees through invis so the benefit of any "surprise" doesn't exist.  <p>

Also as you rise in levels you will find that where you may have been able to summon a yellow or possibly even a red pet at level 8, you will be hard pressed to summon a pet 5 or more levels below you at mid to higher levels.  Since you will be going into these dungeons at these levels, you will find that your pet will agro mobs that you wouldn't if you were travelling without the pet.  Now some dungeons the mobs agro on everything anyway, so it may be a moot point, but one to consider.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

A) they have a dmg shield so i don't have to waste mana casting one.<p>

B) they nuke which is sweet.<p>

C) i don't seem to notice a big difference between HP's at lower lvls (probly will change when i get higher).<p>

I play a pally as my main char and a mage and monk as my alts.  The monk i quit playing but the mage kicks a$$.  I know that when i group with a mage and they are using an earth pet, when i have a druid, ranger, me, cleric, warrior and the mage that he really sucks and is an idiot.  It bugs me that they don't know what the hell they are doing.  Then when they finally destroy their pet after me asking them to for 30 mins, they don't make a new one.  Why not? you tell me, maybe they don't wanna waste mana?<br>
Not saying that all mages suck, just the ones in my group :( but i do love them for summoning me CS's /arrows, quite handy :)<p>

heres the answer you have been looking for EARTH ELEMENTAL! <br>
dont waist time with fire, damage shield blows.<br>
dont waist time with air, stun only lasts a sec.<br>
dont waist time with water, ice isnt half as good as root.<br>
EARTH: pet roots, have it back off, start casting.  when mob is freed, send pet in again to root, then have it back off. you and you pet will have all your HPs for melee if necessary (oom). <br>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">The responses by Melk and Jay are pretty right on as far as my experience goes, the rest of these posts hardly make any sense at all.  First off, there are 4 elemental types and there is a good use for each one.  Anyone telling you not to bother with a certain kind is probably just unwilling to learn to use it properly.  Earth and water are the best for soloing in my opinion.  Fire isn't a bad soloer either if you've got Renew Elements and a fairly decent alteration skill.  The trick is to keep an eye out on your pet's heath with either /pet report health or by using F1/F8 to toggle targeting between the pet and the mob.  If your fire pet has less HP than the mob, heal it.  Otherwise sit there and med.  You should RARELY nuke when soloing with a pet.  The guy who said to burn all your mana while your earth pet roots is wasting his time.  You shouldn't care if your pet takes a beating, he'll heal faster than you can regain all that mana.  In fact, alot of times when I solo, I don't nuke at all.  If my pet needs assistance with the mob, I'll tank myself!  Yep you heard me correctly...hehe.  This way, I'm conserving mana and taking the heat off my pet so he can finish the mob off.  Oh and one more thing, we cant cast invisibility on our pets anymore.  So air is the best when you don't want your pet running off to make friends in those zones with bad pathing.<p>

  About the pets,I always use earth in soloing.  Its root is the only way to protect you from being hit. In lower lvls,you can tank with your pet,and it is very easy. You can hold a staff which hit 15 dmg or so each time. But when your lvl becomer higher,it is USELESS at all. When LV 16,Shock of Flame does 9x dmg ,and if you still want to tank ,you must be CRAZY. All blue mobs can kill you very fast,and if you are hunting yellow or red,the pet wont be alive for a long time ,either. What you can do is nuke and nuke to make mob die eariler than you and your pet. But big nuke makes mob angry and face to you,so you need earth pet to root it. Dont forget to cast Malise if you are trying yellow .<br>
  And about kitting,use earth pet's root to kite is not good. You kite because you want to keep pet's health,but if mob be rooted,it will still attack your pet. So I dont suggest anyone to kite if you dont have SOW or JBoot. If you have ,then use WATER pet to kite. It has the best dmg of the 4 pets(Notice that fire doesnt do better if DS no work). Nuke mob,then start to run in a circle and let pet go. Press F9 to change a sight so that you can see your back,your pet,and the mob. When mob give up you and start to fight with pet,cast DD again. Dont forget to TURN OFF pet taunt. When mob gets angry and run after you again,run. It is the best way for mag to solo,but needs a large space,and SOW or JBoot.<br>
  Never use fire or air to solo. But if you are hunting green or lower blue mob,fire is worthy trying... it can save much time.<br>
  P.S. About the regan speed.when you use higher earth pet,like lv 24 which has 700 hp or more,it regans slower than you med to full. <br>
  Good luck to you.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr bgcolor="DDDDDD">

"Kiting" is running the mob around.  Water is awesome for kiting.  Get SoW or Jboots, and set pet to no-taunt.  You nuke Mob, pet attacks mob, mob chases you around while pet hacks at it (and remember, pets are computer controlled and chase better than any person).  As soon as Mob gives up chasing you and attacks pet, stop and nuke it again, repeat.  At level 34 I would partner with a druid (snares, Sow) and kill Hill Giants this way and rarely get hurt.<p>

To the lower levels who can "jump in and tank for my pet", it gets rather difficult later when the mobs hit for 60+ damage, double attack, have huge AC, etc.  Trust me, you will want to Nuke at that point unless you are in a full group and doing blues.<p>

In order of HP-<p>

Earth, often a must have for soloing, root and high HP can save your life.  I don't use it much in groups as we usually have someone that can Snare.<br>
Water, great pet for kiting, also immune to poison (used it all the time while soloing Crags).  Nice DD spell.<br>
Air, used often in melee heavy groups where keeping the MoB stunned for a moment will keep the tanks from getting hit (especially if you don't have a dedicated healer).  Also good for traveling.<br>
Fire, use to kill greenies (yardtrash) very quickly.  Damage shield and DD makes it a killing machine, but very low HP.<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Well this was good advice for me, I'll be sure to try kiting it once I have Jboots, or if I happen to group with someone that can SOW.  I've never asked for a SOW, and have only had it cast on me when I was travelling with a druid.<p>

My comment about tanking myself was completely based on my own experience, and wasn't meant to say it would work for every level.  It does help though if you're worried about your pet dying, I know we can't take a whole lot of damage.<p>

I'm still sticking with my strategy of healing the fire pet, while using him as the main tank when soloing or in a small group.  A druid friend of mine also level 13 fought the peg-leg camp in BB.  There were 3 blue bandits, 1 green, and peg-leg who was white to us.  I had my fire pet go after peg leg, and used the first half of my mana bar to heal him.  That fire shield works excellent...by the time peg leg fell and I switched my targeting, I saw the other 4 bandits were all almost dead just from trying to hit my pet!  I used the rest of my mana to burn the other mobs down.  So my point here is just that (in my experience) a fire pet works great when you have a multitude of weaker mobs attacking him.  All you have to do is keep him alive and that fire shield will really make a big difference.  This strategy has also worked very well against death beetles in unrest.  Not bad experience for me (they're still blue to me, hehe), and with my fire pet we can take 2 or 3 at a time solo.<p>

Well,FunkyGnome,I didnt say you are wrong. Acturally, fire is very good to hunt blue and green, especially when there are more than one. <p>

But lets see: in lv 24(Sorry I am just in it, so I always take it as a example),mobs hit 50-60 dmg each time, and fire pet's DS does about 20 dmg each being hit( Still much better than mag's 10 dmg).<br>
lv 20 spell Renew Summoning heal about 150 hps and cost 100 mana. So you can exchange 100 mana for about 60-80 dmg...I must say that I'd like to cast Shock of Spike to make 161 dmg by 110 mana. Renews spell dont cast fast, and trust me, heal pet cant often save you and your pet,cast DD to let mob die is better. But I still use renew summoning often--not in battle,but after it end.<p>

I think your sicuation is that mag's lower lv DD is suck,so you must always depend on your pet's attack. (I think LV 12 dont have DD,and lv 8--bolt 48 dmg,shock 37 dmg...not much) But after LV 16,mag's DD will be better and better. You will like to use them.<p>

By the way,when mob hit more hard, your pet can taunt it or not(including ROOT) is very important. You cant be hit and be interuppted casting. So use EARTH pet to solo is better (YOu can still use your favorite fire when grouping).<p>

That's all. Good luck firends.<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Okay...i am level 35 and here are my experiances with pets thus far in the game...<p>

Earth: Great for soloing.  Mine right now has about 1400hp.  Down side is very low agility.  Up side is very high hp, VERY high str (about the same as an ogre).  The low agi makes them get hit more, which is a plus if you are using one of your damage shields.  NEVER use one of these when grouping with a necro / druid / ranger!  Root will break snare / darkness.<p>

Water: Nice group pet.  High str (about that of a Troll), extremely fast regen.  Down side is no way to keep the mob off you for soloing.  Positive side is regen factor.  Direct damage (i believe it is called WaterElementalAttack_01) is ice based.  Damage of the DD is (level of pet) + 1.  so if you summon a level 29 pet, dd will be 30.  doesn't seem like much, but it casts it every 6 seconds :)<p>

Air: Good group pet, especially when fighting casters.  GREAT agility.  Rarely gets hit, and when it does, it is usually for low damage.  Also a good dueling pet when dueling another caster.  Casts invis, which I find useless.  Casts stun instead of DD / Root.<p>

Fire: I dont care what you guys are saying, Fire is a really nice pet.  Maybe you should level past level 29 to see its uses.  The damage shield is (level of pet) + 1.  So if i summon  a level 29 pet, thats a 30 point damage shield (better than all damage shields in the game exept the level 58 druid / mage ones, and that is a level 29 pet!).  DD is a fire based nuke that is (level of pet) + 1.  Down side is they have low hp.  They have pretty good agility and str, though (agility is roughly the same of an elf, str is about the same as a barbarian).<p>

The focuses wont work until level 34, but then they are a must!  I dont really see how anyone could live without them.  By the way, pets only take experiance from you if they do more than 50% damage.  Other wise, they take no exp.<p>

Good hunting to you all, and I hope this helps.<p>

hehe<p>

Ok Im gonna agree with what Mags said there... she's VERY right about it.  First off.. I will say this though ..once you hit 39th, screw worrying about regen rates and which heals faster.  ALL the lvl 39 pets have an EXTREMELY high regen rate.  something like 3% every 3ticks... I may be slightly off on that.<p>

<br>
It's not uncommon for a burned out and dmg shielded pet at 39 to trip for 40, bash/kick/slam for another 20-25 and do an extra 20 or so dmg from the dmg shield... meaning roughly 150-170dmg PER round.<p>

They take on a bit different roles at higher levels though, as Ive found with the 44th pets.<p>

The earth pet still is the best for soloing, the root sticks and sticks hard... playing around with Proon in EK no matter how hard I nuked him he still didn't break root.  Also it's conceivable for the earth pet to start being a tank while you just sit and heal it.  Not very effective I might add.. but if you aren't fighting a heavy hitter, aka Proon or Griffons.. it's pretty damn good.<p>

however the water pet is now starting to equal it in power easily.  Their now hit very nearly as hard as earth pets, 5-15dmg diff per strike per round.  Vast improvement over 39 where they were hitting for 15-20dmg per strike difference.  Their regen rate has also been upped... close to 3% every 2 ticks.  It's conceivable to just sit and heal the pet during a fight.. .I tried this with Droon just in amusement... it worked.. pet came out of it with half life and I came out with just under half mana.  Tried it out with Proon and resulsts were slightly less pleasing, but I never had to cast on Proon, just healed pet.<p>

The air pet however &lt;sighs&gt; is still useless except for dueling casters.  The high agility of it makes it a good interrupter &lt;don't believe it, try giving a lvl 24 or higher air pet two tentacle whips and sit back and enjoy the laugh&gt;<p>

The fire pet is by far the best group pet if you have a rooter of any type.  At 44th this pet is doing insane amount of dmg.. somewhere around the ability of doing 250+dmg in ONE round.  That's the best Ive seen so far.  However it still has the drawback that, like water pets, it'll go chasing off after mobs like no tomorrow.  Good party killer still.<p>

<br>
Anyhow.. that's just my two coppers on it<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">A lot of you have valid points, good opinions, and others I disagree with.  Rather than argue, I will simply post my feelings on the subject of pets.<p>

I am a 31st level magician.  Here is the lowdown on pets, as I have observed, at higher levels (24+)<p>

Earth - at my level, I rarely use earth anymore.  The only time I use earth is when dueling, to keep my opponent away from me while I blast.  Earth pet is great don't get me wrong, but I will tell you why I prefer other ones.  It has the highest strength, but the lowest agi and dex.  This means when it hits, it will hit hard, but due to low dex it will not hit as often as a fire, water, or air pet.  Since the agi is so low, it tanks poorly even though it has the highest hitpoints.  It gets hit hard over and over and I have had many earth pets run out of HPS on me in the thick of battle.<p>

Water - I also do not use water unless fighting a poisonous opponent.  Someone stated before that water and fire pets nuke does the same damage, this is not true.  Water pet's WaterElementalAttack spell damage is calculated with this formula: (lvl*2).  For instance, a pet that is level 24 (cons 24, not lvl 24 spell) would do 48 damage per cast.  Water is helpful in some situations, when at a fast spawn or fighting poisonous creatures.  It does have the best regen of all the pets, and well rounded stats.  However I find that there is usually another pet better suited to what I am trying to accomplish.<p>

Fire - The best group pet, assuming you have good tanks.  Reasons why:  First of all, you can keep your pet from taking too much damage by using /pet no taunt.  This will keep it from taunting the mob, therefore causing less damage to itself and having the tanks of the group take the main damage.  Secondly, the fire pet does the most damage, period.  It has the highest agi and dex, and its strength is second to only the earth pet.  Since the earth pet has low dex, it doesn't connect nearly as much so the fire pet does more melee damage.  The high agi means it can evade the most hits, and given sword of runes (which procs 40 damage) will do even more damage (thanks to it's high dex).  Then you add its damage shield, which is figured with this formula: (lvl/2)  For instance, a level 27 fire pet (cons 27, from a lvl 29 spell) will have a damage shield of approximately 13 dmg.  Fire does have the least hps, so it is not well suited for soloing.  However they are outstanding in groups and the mobs fall quickly.<p>

Air - My favorite pet at my level for soloing.  This is why: first of all, it has high agi and dex.  Give it sword of runes, and it will proc for 40dd, and evade lots of hits.  It also attacks the fastest of all pets, having about a 15% faster delay than the rest.  It ALSO has a stun spell, which generally lasts about 3-5 seconds.  This is how I solo with air pet.  I buff pet, giving him burnout II and med up until full again, then I cast inferno shield (13 pt DS) on him.  Next I malise the mob, lowering all his resists and making him much less likely to resist my pets stun.  At this point the mob is running towards me.  I back up and once the mob is good and close I send pet on him.  (This strategy requires jboots or sow btw)  I have pet taunt turned off, so mob will come after me.  I nuke mob, mob chases me while pet is at his heels whacking away and procing like mad.  Every time my pet uses stun spell on the mob, I stop running and nuke it.  I keep running in a circle as my pet follows the mob around beating it into submission.  The pet doesn't take much damage, and I don't take any.  I end up using about 50% of my mana, and this method has not failed for me yet.  Air pets are not great at low levels, but at about 24 and higher they start to come into their own.<p>

In closing, your mileage may vary.  Everyone's play style requires different tactics, and the way I learned to use pets effectively was with trial and error.  Overall have fun, and do what best suits you.  EQ is, after all, a game.  If ya don't have fun, what's the point!?<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">Actually, Air has the highest agi.  I never really experimented with dex, but all the different kinds of pets seem to proc at about the same rate.  Dex does not effect chance to hit, Verrant has officially stated this.  Water pet has more strenght than Air, and its dd is not twice the level of the pet.  That would make a level 45 water pet (possible with the staff of elemental mastery: water, so I hear) do 90 damage each round in just dd.  Fire pet's damage shield is (level of pet) + 1, as of August 25, 2000.  I did some tests in arena with this.  My level 29 pet (yellow to my friend at 27) had a 30 point fire based damage shield (the only reason I say fire based is because it was saying 'XXX is burned', so it couldn't have been the druid there who was like 53 dmg shielding my pet).  The water pet's dd was doing 30, and it was also a level 29 pet.  Fire pet will *always* have a better damage shield than you can cast, which is why it says 'Your spell does not take hold' when you try to dmg shield a fire pet.  Well, thats all I have to say on this subject.  I am not insulting you, Kjata, I am just saying that your test results differ from mine, and everyone who I have talked to's.<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">I honestly have no idea what most of you are smoking...sure Earth can be nice..but on many higher level mobs it CAN get you killed because it doesnt matter how many extra HPS it has or how well it roots when its gettin hit for 100+ damage a hit..its going to die and you cant heal fast enough.  Personally i love water pet for one reason...pure damage output without getting hit and well..earth pets at almost every spell level do 2 less damage a hit than Water, fire, and air which is totally crap.  And yes 2 points of damage is a big difference when your pet is quad hitting for 48 instead of 46...all you have to do is learn how to work with the Water pet and you will learn that it is MUCH more mana efficient than any other pet...ive learned that Nuke, heal, nuke, heal this works much better than just nuking like mad, and the water pet heals up 2x as fast as any other pet(natural regen) so you dont have to waste mana before starting a fight making sure your pets at 100%..anyway thats what i think =)<p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">In response to air being "totally crap", try using one against a casting mob. Count the number of times they get a spell off compared to when using a different pet.  Now I haven't been through very many dungeons, but using an air pet in blackburrow allowed my group and I to move through the green mobs with no trouble.  Any other choice would bring the whole place down on us.<p>

Although your "level 47" signature sounds impressive, I remember reading from another post that you powerleveled your mage in 18 played days or something like that.  Although I'm only level 16, I've been grouping and fighting in many different areas and in a variety of different situations.  I've also been playing him for about 2 months now, and having a great time!  This isn't meant to be a flame, just wanted to let you know I don't really respect those types of players authority on pet strategy and tactics.  Soloing the same 5 or 6 mobs over and over for your entire career isn't exactly what I call versitile experience.  But to each their own!  <p>

<td valign="MIDDLE"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="000000">This thread is a few weeks old, but I thought I'd add my own thoughts on it.  Have a level 24 mage, but been playing since July '99 (so, yes, have had lots of other characters as well).  Since the thread started with an evaluation of pets, went into Kiting, and covered some other areas, I've strayed some in this message to cover all those areas.  Remeber, these are just My Own Humble Opinions.  You're milage may vary, simply due to the way you like to melee, cast, or evac.<p>

First, Pet Delay.  The delay of attack on all pets is the same now -- 30.  Has been for months.  Used to be different, and unfortunately there's lots of old info on the Internet.  But all hit the same now.  So, decide which to use by their unique capabilities, not because you think one is going to get an attack in quicker than another.<p>

Second, Pet Spells.  While they look cool, pet spells are actually bad for you.  People have asked in the past for a "no spellcast" option, like the "no taunt" option.  Were told by official Verant rep (Gordon Wrinn) that this would never happen, it would unbalance things.  Originally, pets didn't cast spells; they just meleed.  But other classes complained about pets being too strong, so the casting was added.  Testing shows pet spells pretty reliably at (level+1), not any (level*2) as some keep mentioning for the water pet.  Why this is bad:  take for example a pet you create post-lvl 29.  It's going to dual-wield, bash, I think kick and dual-hit as well.  Give it two of your summoned swords, and you get proc's as well.  Every round of combat your pet casts, it's going to do substanially less damage than if it had been allowed to fight instead.  <p>

Three, Experience.  Decide if you want to level quickly or safely.  The Difference?  The 50%+ experience penalty if the pet does more damage to the MOB than you do.  If you want to level, then expect to use up mana nuking down the MOB.  The pet is just a distraction, trying to keep the MOB from getting to you.  MOBs have short memories.  You can burn them down, doing more than 50% damage, without them aggroing onto you.  The key is to do smaller burns spread throughout the fight, rather than 2 or 3 massive burns right at the beginning.  That just gets their attention way too early.<p>

Four, Focus Items.  Focus items are said to work only at lvl 34 and above, but tests show this not to be true.  There's a pet stat enhancement effect which seems to work on *any* level pet summoning.  And there's a change to the pet visible model that makes the pet appear larger when summoned while holding a Focus Item.  It's this that doesn't show till level 34.  So, if you get a chance at the focus items, regardless of level, grab'em.<p>

Five, Melee.  Melee the MOBs some if you can, even if your pet is not in danger (in fact, better if they aren't in danger).  The reason?  What the ATK and AC values shown in the Persona page don't tell you is the big difference the unshown stats do:  offense, defense, and especially dodge.  These are listed in with the "skills" section, because they rise in level thru use, and cap at values dependent upon your level.  But these values are used in the computation of how much damage you take.  Have a high dodge value, for example, and when some MOB someday surprises you, you'll plain-and-simply get hit *less* than if your dodge value was low.  Same with defense, which mitigates the damage the hits do, and with offense when you try to fight back.  Now, these values are capped far lower than any melee players, and once you reach the max cap, there's no point to continue trying to improve them.  I'm not suggesting you pretend to be a Warrior.  But at least try to get these stats up to max.<p>

Six, Fireshields.  It's said that the Mage cast damage shields, when struck by a Mob, cause the damage done to be attributed to the damage shield itself, not the player wearing the shield.  It's like the damage shield is a player unto itself.  This seems to be due to some shortcuts Verant took in the programming of how shields work.  Why is this important?  Because when soloing, if your pet or yourself is meleeing and wearing a damageshield, it's that much damage that the Pet won't need to deal before the Mob is dead, and so the better the chance the Pet won't take 50% of the experience.  Because Verant has shown several areas where they've taken shortcuts like this, my own guess is that the Fire Pet fireshield works in exactly the same way as the player cast shields.  And because it does more damage than the Mage cast shield,  you get an even greater margin of safety.  This gives the Fire pet an added edge, I think.  Plus, the Fire pet's shield seems to last much longer than the Mage cast shields.  (Used to be mage fire shields cast on pets would last 10-15 minutes, even though it would only last a minute or so on players.  This was a bug fixed several months back, and now the mage cast shields fade as quickly off of pets as they do players.)<p>

Seven, Kiting.  Most of the posts here dealt with Kiting Mobs, and which pet would be best for this.  Here are my thoughts.  <p>

(1) How often are you soloing Mobs that you actually have SoW on?  Personally, very rarely.  Journeyman Boots are just not going to happen for me, because i don't belong to a guild and don't have the level or camping time to acquire them.  So, I need a Kiting stratagy that applies for a normal, non-speedy Mage.<p>

(2) Remember point 3 above.  You really don't want to be kiting if you're looking for experience.  Send in the pet, to get the Mob's attention, and then burn the best way you can till till the Mob's dead.  In these cases, I'd suggest using the Earth pet.  Attack with the earth pet till the Mob is rooted, pull the earth pet back, then nuke the Mob till it's done.  Send in the earth pet if the root breaks during the battle, or once you're satisfied you've done enough damage.  The pet acts as a shield, and you're basically using the Wizard stratagy of root-and-nuke.  Good if you have Clarity or Breeze cast on you (which happens to me about as often as SoW).  Also good if there isn't room to do much running around.<p>

(3) OK, you want to conserve mana.  You want to somehow burn up the major portion of the Mobs health, and have the rest taken care of by the Pet.  Realize that for kiting to work you have to: get the Mob's attention, have it chase you around while the pet is dealing damage to it, that at some point the Mob may  turn back and fight the pet, and that you then have to regain the Mob's interest and startup the chase.  My call there is to use the Fire pet.   Nuke the Mob heavy first, to get it chasing you.  Have the pet attack.  If the Mob stops to fight the pet, nuke it some more till it follows again, then keep running.  If you have a lead, most things in the non-Kunark lands won't catch up too quickly, giving the pet time to beat on it.  Why use a Fire pet? Well, while the Mob is chasing you, any one of the pets would do about as much damage with their melee attacks.  But the Air and Earth spell attacks don't do any damage; in fact they interfere with the point of kiting, which is to keep the Mob unsuccessfully chasing *you* while the pet deals damage from behind. Water and Fire, on the other hand, will be doing damage with spells, so the time they waste casting isn't nearly as useless (point 2 above).  When that Mob takes a moment to turn back and beat up on the pet again, the Fire pet has its (relatively) great Fireshield to add another source of damage.  I also think the Fire pet has better agility than the Water pet, so it won't get hit as often and will last longer.  My own feeling: since you're Kiting, your pet should never be in danger of running out of hitpoints.  Therefore, Earth or Water having more hitpoints than Fire doesn't really matter.  If you're counting on the hitpoints to save the pet, then the pet is getting hit way too often and, really by definition, you're not actually kiting.<p>

(4) If you have SoW on, or Journeyman boots, I'd still suggest using the Fire, or even Water, pet.  For the same reasons as given in the point above -- the more the Mob is hitting your pet instead of chasing you, the *less* you're actually kiting. And, most likely, the less the damage you've done to the Mob (so you're in danger of losing 50% of the experience as well).<p>

Eight, Pet Armor.  Pets can wear armor, and most people don't seem to realize this.  Work on your tailoring skill, and carry around tailoring patterns of the 3 or 4 highest AC items (tunic, pants, boots, sleeves is what i carry).  When you find a ruined pelt, or have one left over from that last annoying lion attack, make up patchwork armor to give your pet.  Give it a heatstone as well.  All totaled, you're going to give your pet a rise of 20 AC (that's from ACs of 6 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3) -- how hard have you worked to get much smaller rises than that?  It appears to me to make a difference; try it for yourself and see.  Doesn't seem to matter whether the ruined pelts are wolf, cat, or bear; all seem to work.  I think NPCs are neutral on class and size restrictions, which is why you'll often see NPCs carrying non-class-allowed weapons other players have given them as jokes.  (Remember, the system treats Pets as NPCs, which is why they can go berserk, outlive their masters and go on killing sprees of player characters; and why the summoned sword proc works for them on everything, not just summoned Mobs.)<p>

<br>
Well, that's enough. Long-winded, but i hope it's all useful info.  See what you think, and I'll 'Cya on the Planes one day!<p>
