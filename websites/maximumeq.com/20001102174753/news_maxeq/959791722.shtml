Alright, so I reached level 54.<BR>
Sat down, mezzed my two new spells ( which unfortunately, did not include clarity 2 ).<BR>
<BR>
One is our new single target mez - Glamour of Kintaz.<BR>
<BR>
So I take it out and check the stats.<BR>
<BR>
Costs 350 mana. Ok, that's quite a bit for a mez. Dazzle, our level 49 single target mez is 125, exactly half. [ed. a third would be more accurate, but still not correct]<BR>
<BR>
So I target myself and cast.<BR>
<BR>
You resist Glamour of Kintaz!<BR>
<BR>
I check my MR, it's 48.<BR>
<BR>
Alright, so I try again. And hit /time<BR>
<BR>
30 seconds later..<BR>
<BR>
You are unstunned.<BR>
<BR>
30 SECONDS.<BR>
<BR>
30 SECONDS for 350 MANA. Our level 16 spell that costs 50 mana lasts for 30 seconds.<BR>
<BR>
Ok. So this spell is resistable, it lasts for 30 seconds and it costs 350 mana.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe it's a 100% mem blur. So I target a near by guard that cons indifferent.<BR>
<BR>
Cast. Mezzed.<BR>
<BR>
Cons scowling and ready to kick my butt to the zone.<BR>
<BR>
So can someone at Verant KINDLY explain what the heck you were thinking when you put this spell into the game?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Assuming that all of this information is correct, it does sound like there may be a problem. I'll get with GZ tomorrow and find out exactly what it is that this spell is supposed to do.<BR>

I wasn't aware of this bug (I don't play a melee class).</font></p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I realy hope this is a bug and not intentional, if it is intentional, what possible purpose does it serve? It is very frustrating to have crutial phrases like "heal me", "mez zealot!", "assist Nuggin!" and "we are screwed, zone!" constantly dissapearing mid-way through typing due to weapon proc.<BR>
</font>
It probably wouldn't be right to call it a bug, but rather an unintentional design consequence. I'll ask around to see if this is something that could be easily changed or whether it is something that's too far in to change at this point. It's something that I've found annoying as well, along with text editing on the text bar.<BR>

The item, comment and price update pull downs now all have the items in them sorted into cateogories (1H Blunt, Arms, etc) to easier find what is important to you.<BR><BR>

Let me know if you like this change, or perfer the old way of doing it.</font></p>
