&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm wondering if we are supposed to get a confirmation email or something from Kunarkrefund@verant.com. <BR>
</font>
You will indeed receive a confirmation when your request is processed. We ask that everyone who's getting one hang tight, much of it has to be done manually since the request is filed through email.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Melee skills">Melee skills</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/29/00 11:53 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>More questions about melee skill caps.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Seems that the skill cap increases for our primary skills (HTH , 1HB, Offense, Defense, etc)have run into a hard cap of 252. I know this must be a programming issue, but it has had the effect of weakening us relative to our melee brethren (ie, Warrior offense increase from 200 to 240 - Monk offense increase from 240 to 252.)<BR>
</font>
Not really. We've accounted for any data-type mandated caps in code. Though you may stop skilling due to reaching 252, you'll still get better as you level. The gap may close a little bit, but not by any great extent. <BR>
<BR>
Please keep in mind that a classes power relative to another class changes as they level up. It's not something that is fixed in stone. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Is it still Verant's vision that Monks be the "kings of melee?" <BR>
</font>
<BR>
We're beginning to dislike the "King of..." and "Master of.." titles that have been floating around. It gives classes the impression that all classes should be the master of "something", where "something" must be something that "matters". The only real important thing here is that some classes must be better and worse at some things than other classes. One class need not be the master of something. Maybe instead they are second-best at a few things. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, monks will still do more melee damage in a toe-to-toe fight than the others.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Hey Abashi - How are Spectre Pets gonna Duel Wield? Just wondering, all the screenies I have seen show them with the standard scythe<BR>
</font>
The standard scythe is actually part of the character model, not an indication that they are actually wielding the weapon. To my knowledge, this is the only model that this was done with. Anyway, I'm not willing to comment on the dual wield issue beyond saying that we haven't overlooked anything.<BR>
<BR>
It's my intent not to talk about the spells until at least a few people actually have them.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Shouldn't they be animals? They sure look very much alive.<BR>
Just checked into this. They are indeed meant to be undead. The other live apes in the land are a little too evolved to be considered animals in EQ. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;AT NO TIME SHOULD A PLAYER RUN THE RISK OF LOSEING EVERYTHING THEY OWN PERIOD. I can understand a risk of getting killed and loseing Exps if they want to do something make deaths in these zones no res so its a permant exp loss and they have to earn it back or put a delay in the cropse recovery time so that after 24 real hours your corpse will pop back to the zone line or to a safe room. <BR>
</font>
A little bit of fear is a good thing. It keeps things exciting. If the thought of losing what's on your corpse is not palatable, the simplest suggestion would be to not put yourself in a situation where that could happen. This isn't a case where you risk everything you own, just everything that you choose to carry with you. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;There is NO FUN in loseing a corpse<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Perhaps not, however there is great fun being in a situation where you know that you could lose your corpse, and prevail. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Am I the only one that noticed that Mobs on Kunark are way too tough for their lvl and give way too little exp? there are lvl 40 mobs there that do 120-130 damage and take forever to kill, and give horrible exp. I hunted for 20 hours in Kunark and gained half a bub into 51, I then went to Lower guk for about 3-4 hours and gained half a bub, that is just sad. I fear when the newness and coolness wears off Lower guk and Sol B are gonna go back to their usual crowded state. <BR>
</font>
The amount of experience they give when killed is no less than the experience given anywhere else. But yes, things there are harder for their level.<BR>
