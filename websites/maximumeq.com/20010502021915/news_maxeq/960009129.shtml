<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We've put up a brand new issue of our <a
href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo column</a> here on Everlore.
This week Milo talks about his character preferences in EQ, the (in)famous
website, staying in shape, and of course how to tame and ride a Dragon.
=)<P>

 Great read as always, here's a snip from one of the questions.


    <blockquote>
    Quick question:<P>

    Does it make you sick to your stomach or roll your eyes with every other
question starting off with how they are a graphics     artist too, or
starting to learn?<P>

    One would think people could at least just ask the question and not give
some long winded explaination of what they do. Of     course, I guess
everyone wants their 15 seconds of fame.

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Concordance of Research fix">Concordance of Research fix</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/23/00 02:40 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Looks like the concordance of research will finally work for all your robed ones out there :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color="white">
1) Apprentice Rune Azia requires Bixie Wings and Froklock Eyes. Well as anyone who is a Magi class level 21 or above can attested to, there is no drop of the Bixie Wings in the Game. GM's have confirmed that they don't believe the Bixie Wings are in the Game. Also with this Rune, no one seems to be able to fine Froglock Eyes, but can find Froglock Tadpole Eyes. What this effectively means is that if you use concordance, you have to use a 3rd Level Practice Rune to go from skill level 21 upto skill level 62. Using 3rd level will result in skill increases but a lot of failures, with no completed runes being produced until high 30's or low 40's<BR>
<BR>
2) Training Rune Beza has a minor issue that according to the Research Volumes, you should be able to use any raw hide Cap, Mask, Gorget, Tunic, Shoulder Pads or Cloak. Well from my experience, using Cloaks failed 100% of the time for me, but all other items were fine.<BR>
<BR>
3) Study Rune Azia has a similar issue to (1). The Giant Batwings and Giant Scarab Eyes dont appear to be dropped by the mobs which would logically drop these. This means you have to use the Expert Runes to get from Skill Level 95 through to Skill Level 130<BR>
<BR>
4) Master Rune Beza (I say this based upon information gatered from forums and sites) Does not appear to combine to form the Beza Rune. This means using the Magi Rune to get through 2 levels of concordance (from Expert to Magi)<BR>
<BR>
5) Magi Rune Beza has been described as being able to be created using FS Piercing or Blunt Weapons. But the Blunt weapons do not work to create this rune, but the piercing does.<BR>
<BR>
This lists all the issues as I have been able to find/experience. GZ has/had been messaging with <BR>
Zehnman From Mythiran Tower in February in order for the Concordance Research to be looked at. Since then nothing has been heard.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
The issues noted in the original post have been fixed on the Test Server. Most of it will go live on Monday as we patch zones, some of it requires an update to items, which will probably happen next week.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Abashi are Clerics a Plate wearing class? If yes then why cant we wear any of the following armor items, none of them are "class specific" and in some case's non-plate wearing class's can wear.<BR>
</font>
Being a plate-wearing class isn't supposed to mean that you can wear every piece of plate armor out there. There are still items that are restricted to the melee classes (and yes I'm including the bard in this description, though they're really in a class all their own). You'll notice that even though Shamans can wear chain, they aren't able to wear every piece of chain that rangers or rogues can wear.<BR>

Mana was put on there by mistake. It will be correct in the next item patch. We'll probably change it to hitpoints.<BR>
