My group and I were camping the throne room last night - Warrior, Druid, Shaman, Cleric, Necro, and of course an Enchanter  :)    We were all lvl 30-34, and had no problems at all holding the throne spawn, as well as pulling from surrounding areas.  I being the Enchanter was pretty busy with the crowd control, however, and I could see where this might get ugly unless you have a means of controlling extra mobs that tend to pop in the middle of combat.  <BR>
<BR>
At lvl 30, most stuff was high blue, with an occasional white or yellow, but again, we have a good group, well balanced, and everyone knows their job, so it was rare that we were in any real danger.   We would sit on the throne, and pull to the platform.  On the few instances where I was being pounded on, they were double attacking in the 50's, so for the casters, meaning you have to be able to sustain 100 points of damage per round until someone can taunt it off of you.   Enchanters have a lovely AE stun, which is nice for getting out of such situations.  <BR>
<BR>
The one trick we found was when the diviner would pop at the base of the throne platform instead of on the throne.  If you try to fight him where he pops, there is a Lizzy Herald or Page that will heal him thru the wall / ceiling / floor / where that dang thing was.    It is in a distant room, but can heal thru the walls, because it took a while for it to find us, although it eventually did.    So make sure you pull the Diviner up to the throne, where you can at least see and deal with any healers trying to help.<BR>
<BR>
I think that a full group of high 20's could do it, maybe mid 20's, but with great difficulty, and a good Enchanter would be an absolute must, as well as a good cleric and tank.  Also, snaring comes in extremely handy, as with the lizzies running earlier now, you have a serious possibility of being trained if you don't hold your pulls. <BR>
<BR>
Spawning right on the throne are 2 gorillas, one or two Lizzies, as well as one down the hall and three in the entry way that will rush to help, all lvl 26-31, approximately, plus a moving sentry that wanders thru every once in a while.  Breaking in and spreading the spawns out is perhaps the hardest part of not dying here.<BR>
<BR>
OK, good luck all, hope this helps.  We got a couple mantles and cloaks, (none for me, I lost all rolls :P ) and it was great xp.<BR>

Doh…  Correction to the post above….<BR>
<BR>
OK, it turns out that the mysterious Lizzy healer wasn’t a Lizzy at all.<BR>
<BR>
My Druid friend admitted last night that he was CHARMED by the diviner, and that he was the one who kept healing the darn thing.   Heh heh… we all thought that the page that came running around the corner after we had killed the Diviner was the culprit.  Turns out our Druid also was the one that DOTed a couple of our group members, myself not included.    Generally, as our group’s Enchanter, I do crowd control, but I also have a rapid cast AE stun that interrupts spells, so whenever we’re fighting casting mobs, I slide into the fray and wait for the mob to cast and continually interrupt it, so I was puzzled as to how it was being healed.   Ah, well.   So you can disregard my above comments on the puzzling mystery healer.  :P<BR>
<BR>
On a different note, watch out for the Diviner’s ability to Charm :)   I am glad that the lizzy chose to charm our Druid, and not our huge Oger tank, who would have killed us all.    And if you are charmed, I’d suggest spamming your teammates so they know for sure you are out to get them.    If you have a group here, have at least TWO of the casters keep cancel magic (or one of those line of spells) up, as it will nulify Charm.  If you plan to buff all up, you may want to cast a removable buff first, buff up, then remove the first placeholder, so that the casters don't have to remove all of the buffs to get to the charm.   I say two, obviously, so that if your tank gets charmed and starts knocking the one silly, the other caster can start cancelling. Also, if you only have one caster with it up, chances are he'll get charmed, and you'll have to kill your wizzard before he kills you.<BR>
<BR>
Best thing to do is keep an Enchanter with you, since he/she can mez your charmed buddy out of combat until the charm breaks.  Course, i'm biased.<BR>
<BR>
I've often wondered... since you can cast on your buddies when they're charmed (they're considered NPC's), could an Enchanter recharm them?  heh heh.  I imagine not, but it'd be fun to charm your buddy, and keep him working for your side.  That, and you could make him say, “yes, oh splendid one…”<BR>
<BR>
OK, enough pandering.   Be safe, and good luck.  This spawn is great XP.<BR>
