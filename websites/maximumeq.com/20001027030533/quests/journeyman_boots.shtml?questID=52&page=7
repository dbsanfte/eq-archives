<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I would just like to add a few comments from a lot of experience in SRO.<BR>
<BR>
First off, if your server follows first come, first serve rules for static spawns, this is really not the place for you to be killing the AC.  Instead, it is more of a desperate second chance at a free-for-all for those who find that they can't get into a camp in OOT, with whole *guilds* clammering and fighting each other for camping rights there.  The problem in OOT these days, is you pretty much have to be in a big guild that doesn't mind bullying and badgering people to get items, the probelm in SRO is that while everyone has a chance, the chances are very good that there will be multiple pairs of high level (45 plus) nukes (usually from large guilds) camping in shifts, nuking the crap out of the AC when it spawns.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly, speaking as someone who has played multiple chars through their 12 to 17 levels, or thereabouts in SRO (because it used to be a nice quiet alternative to Oasis, having about 6-10 people on average as opposed to 80 to 120 in oasis), I have been in this zone a LOT.  As for ALL of the bs about placeholders, if you get nothing out of this post get this:  The AC is a rare spawn.  How rare?  Generally 8-12 hours, somtimes less than 8 somtimes more than 12.  What is placeholder?  The SGs.  It's painfully simple.  I can say that absolutely, without a doubt, that everything else anyone says is BS.  I have sat and watched, with my own eyes, and the eyes of a close friend over the course of a week in just ONE instance watching the AC around the clock that with some people swearing that if you kill this, it will spawn, some swearing that unless you kill nothing it won't spawn, that the one thing that gets killed consistently are the SGs.  SAME RESULT.  Reports are of seeing usually one or two ACs per day, sometimes as many as three.  NEVER EVER heard a realiable account of more than three in one day.<BR>
<BR>
This is another of the sadly increasing number of items in the game that are so time consuming and frustrating, so contentious and awed, that myths begin to spread about their relative ease of aquisition.  The truth is, if you want these boots, be prepared to spend about a week (on average) of very unhappy, boring 8 to 12 hour EQ camping shifts (could be less, could get lucky, hope you do), for an item that anyone would want.  Verant pooched this quest, but not for the reasons you might think...<BR>
<BR>
Plain and simple there were too many items that got camped in Najena, increasingly by people who were too high in level to get exp there, and some of the tactics used to monopolize camps were not PnP friendly at all.  Some of us remember the early to mid days when these were campable in Najena, it went from bad to REALLY bad on these.  Verants solution sucks, just for different reasons.<BR>
<BR>
I would invite anyone who completes this quest, particularly those who remember this and MANY early quests/items/pre-nerfs to send a letter to Verant to complain.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>A note to the above post --<BR>
<BR>
One of the primary reasons you would WANT to complain about this quest (do it you'll see others) is that, particularly if you are camping in SRO for the AC (ring portion of quest) you are going to see that he has a life expectancy of about 10 to 15 seconds, with multiple high level casters unloading on the poor level 29-30 thing at once.  Unless you are a high level nuke, or have some way unknown to me to outdamage two or three (or more) high level nukes, you don't have a chance with this guy, so even if you do see him in your 8 to 12 gruelling hours in the desert, it will probably fall to someone else.  Also, watch the number of people in the zone before the AC spawns, and then check it about 30 to 45 seconds after he dies.  The zone will generally triple in population (on my server this is as close to a rule as you'll get).  It's the effect of having a high level guildmember or two assigned to camp it (while waiting on lists in Guk, or like some guilds on my server having lists of assigned spawns that everyone in a guild has to spend time on for the purpose of distributing rare items to its members), then sending a gsay, waiting for members to camp, relog their twinks who hope to loot.  Kind of sickening to me to see this happen every time and know how often this thing gets harvested by people who, themselves, don't even need it.  Not to mention the ring has some halfway decent stats that some players like it to just *have*.  This quest really made me take some time to think about how much any of this game is worth to me in terms of time.  Time wasted not just goofing off and having a good time, but time just *wasted*.</font></td></tr></table>
