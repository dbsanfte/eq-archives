&gt;&gt;&gt;PermaFrost Re-Itemization?<BR>
</font>
It's possible that we may look into a revamp of this zone at some time in the future. First however we'll be concentrating on some other zones, one of which is Najena. <BR>
<BR>
We'll see what happens after then.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Spell stacking, and more">Spell stacking, and more</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/20/00 14:06 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Some good questions and answers.  The problem with the slow spells is that they are listed not as a percentage to remove from the attack speed, but an overall percentage.

A low level slow spell may read as 80%, which means 80% of normal attack speed.  A high level slow spell may read as 30%, or 30% of normal attack speed.  Because 80 > 30, the low level spells over-ride.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;The high level slowing spells (Togors, Turgurs, chanter spells) are still being overwritten by the weaker slow spells. It seems that spell stacking for the slow spells are reversed, that the weakest spells override the stronger spells.<BR>
This problem is known and on the list. It occurs because the "attack speed slowing" spells are the only ones where a lower number in the database is "better". We're going to give the programmers a little more time to address this. We also have an idea for a work-around that would make it work correctly. We'll keep you informed.<BR>
</font>

<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;The Howling Harpoon has a proc of Memory Blur, however when this weapon procs Mem Blur it procs on the wielder of the weapon...<BR>
</font>
<BR>
That's not right then. I'll mention it to the live team. A fix should go live in the next item patch. <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just hand the Harpoon to the NPC before you attack, then loot it off him when you are done.<BR></font>
<BR>
ROFL. I'd have to recommend against that <BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually these things need fixed as well as others.<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The hate list bug where the mobs tend to remember the healers upon their repop. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
Actually they aren't *remembering* anyone, they are "catching" the hate list from another NPC somewhere, and the healer just happens to be at the top. The team is looking into this.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;There is also a pet bug that I've noticed where (I play on a PvP teams server) my pet will end up attacking people in my group (even those on my team which I should NEVER be able to hit).<BR>
</font>
<BR>
I've seen pets attack people in PvP situations who they should normally be able to attack after someone uses an AoE spell or something, but not as you describe. Any more info you can provide would be helpful.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;How about fixing some of the quests like Canabalize II?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
"Fix" wouldn't be the correct term. "Put in in the first place" would be. The quest is done and is just waiting for a zone-data patch (doesn't require a full server outage) to go in.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also, for us Barbarians, when is Verant going to remove the banker in Hallas from being part of the Rogue faction? Though I believe that a lot of bankers are crooks in real life, can you imagine that the good people of Hallas would settle for that? I do not.<BR>
<BR>
</font>
I've spoken with the faction guy about this. We're considering it, but in the mean time we'd recommend that players doing quests in Halas work to keep their factions balanced by performing quests for both guilds.<BR>

<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;No, I don't mean class abilities and such. Dungeons, items/loot, quests, that kinda thing. Like are any other dungeons going to get redone any time soon? Like Runnyeye maybe? Will there be any new items attainable by mid-levels? Quests...?<BR>
</font>
Absolutely. The next dungeon up for a bit of a revamp is Najena. As for quests, items, etc., those go in all the time and will continue to go in. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Though the majority of the posters here are in the 50+ club, the majority of the subscribers are not.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
You are very correct. We are definitely concerned about the satisfaction of the lower-level players as well, it's just that the higher level stuff is getting a lot of attention right now. Keep in mind that it is generally the higher level folk that feel that they were running out of content, which is why they are probably more vocal than the rest. <BR>

Hey Verant, yes you, did you know that Monks have a weight limit of 14?<BR>
<BR>
Stupid Verant. Making a Monk only 2h blunt weapon with substandard stats which might only be good with raising skill 10.0 weight?!<BR>
</font>
<BR>
I referred many of the weight issues, including the monk staves, to the live team yesterday. It looks as if a standard equipment template was used when creating the items, which explains why the same weight problem is present across a number of them. <BR>
