Hopefully it will help.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Most bugs that would result in a resurrection leave some sort of signature that would allow the GM or Guide to verify the incident and make the correct decision. For instance, falling for 10K damage leaves a line of text that can be /reported in order to provide "proof".<BR>
The particular incident that you are mentioning however is not a bug. Centaurs by their nature are ornery critters, and have a very small percent chance of just going wild on someone. Of course this can be very inconvenient when there are other centaurs around, as their anger is contagious. <BR>
<BR>
I think that one of the reasons people think that this is a bug is that this NPC personality trait isn't widely used in game. <BR>
