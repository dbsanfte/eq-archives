<font color=white>
Is there any plans in the near future or not at all to have the Shaman feel a little better about there pets at 55. They seem to be a waist and I know many Shaman have felt, why cast the pet if it is going to die within the first 10 minutes against any high mob. A little incentive would be nice. I understand we are not the pet type class but why gives us a pet when we accomplish absolutely nothing.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Guys, the wolf is meant to be more of a companion than a pet. It's certainly not meant to be a major factor of how the class stacks up from a balance perspective. Shaman pets will never be near mage or necro pets in power. <BR>
I'll look into the mana requirement, but pet strength sounds proper.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="The Vision explained">The Vision explained</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 07/24/00 13:54 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Just what The Vision is, is something of a mystery to almost every player.  Gordon (aka Abashi) attempts to explain it with it this post:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
I've answered dozens of questions entitled "what is the vision". Why is it that these keep coming up with people assuming that it is some tangible thing that can be put up on a website for all to view? Have you ever said to anyone, "That wasn't really what I had in mind..."? What you are saying is that it doesn't agree with your vision. <BR>
There is not some all-encompassing document that I can post somewhere for everyone to read, because it's an ever-growing and ever-changing concept. When something new comes up, we sit down and ask, "Is this what we had in mind?" A discussion follows at which time we decide whether or not it is. The vision is every email exchanged by every member of the dev team. It's the original design document for EverQuest (which will not be posted). It's the understanding that comes out of formal meetings in the conference room and the informal ones around the watercooler. It's every hope that everyone here had and has for EverQuest. <BR>
<BR>
Do you want to know the vision? Read our web site, read our posts, play the game, and ask yourself honestly what we had in mind, or, ask me. I answer questions every day here that consist basically of, "Why did you do XXX?" The answer to that question is the vision. But please, don't expect me to be able to lay out anything and everything that everyone ever had in mind about everything to do with the game. It's not that simple.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I dislike playing a game where 95% of the important information is hidden from the consumer's eyes. <BR>
</font>
That 95% of that information is meant to be discovered by you while you play the game. If you choose to go to spoiler sites to find out as much as you can, that is your choice, but we won't be divulging the mystery of the game. We feel that mystery is important in the game and that no one should know with certainty everything that there is to know. That's our vision.<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The only thing I know is what the VISION isn't. It isn't kiting, it isn't FD pulling, it isn't having good stuff, it isn't a lot of things.<BR>
<BR>
There's tons of good stuff out there. Now if you mean unbalancing stuff, then yes, it's not that. It's our vision that classes, items, conditions, concepts, quests, encounters, etc., all be balanced. <BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;We did agree to a contract with you Verant, when we bought the game, and now it would appear that we are getting less for our money than we once did.<BR>
</font>
We provide a service to you conditioned upon certain guidelines, and you agree to pay us a monthly fee. That's the extent of our "contract". We can't guarantee that you agree with everything that we do and every decision that we make. I really wish it were possible to keep well over 250K people constantly happy. I wish it were possible to make all 250K happy with every change that we make. However every change is likely to both please and upset people who are playing the game. The only way to avoid this would be to not make any more changes, and how long would people enjoy themselves then? Sure, the easy solution that people quote is that we should only make "positive" changes. The list of changes that *everyone* will agree with is exceedingly short.<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;. Show me the VISION. Show me what your plans are for EQ. Show me that what you are doing is enhancing the game play, and not destroying what you have created. <BR>
</font>
No problem. As I mentioned above, play the game. Read the boards. Check out the news sites, including our web site. I make hundreds of informational posts here per month. If you want a complete inflexible document for everything that will ever happen in EQ, I can't give you that. Plans change, and we release what we can when we can. <BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Gordon, here is some business information that you may have forgotten: One unhappy customer will cost you 12 - 15 new customers, while one happy customer will bring in only 3 new customers.<BR>
</font>
The numbers are a little off but the ratio is close. What you've forgotten here is that things done to make one customer happy often directly impact another. Sometimes, something done to please one unhappy customer can upset 10 previously happy customers. Given your and my numbers being true, do we risk letting one unhappy customer cost us 15 new customers, or do we turn 10 happy customers into unhappy ones costing us 150? <BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;By the way, the patch that introduced the doors that a rogue must lockpick in order to get into a dungeon are more risky than I care to accept. Simple example: I am in a group with a rogue in one of these dungeons, suddenly without warning, either the rogue or I go link dead<BR>
</font>
The simple answer to your situation here is that if the risk of you or the rogue going linkdead and you losing your way out is too great for the reward that comes from fighting in the dugeon areas where rogues are required, don't fight there. Or perhaps you can get a backup rogue. Or you could have a wizard or druid in your group who can get you out. That's 4 possible solutions to the problem.<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought both Abashi and Aradune responded to what, exactly, the Vision(tm) is. It's just what you think it is...nothing with line-numbers and graphs...it's just an idea of how they thought Everquest would and could be played. Abstract, yes, but "Vision" has not illusion of being an equation somewhere.<BR>
</font>
Thanks thraash, that's perhaps better than I explained it above. I'm feeling a bit animated today  <BR>
<BR>
I think that people often confuse a "corporate vision statement" from "our vision for the game". On a very high level, our "vision statement" for the game would be something along the lines of us wanting to provide customers with a fun game that will provide an extended duration of entertainment, that will lead to them remembering the game fondly once they decide to leave. Of course that's far from being the low-level explanation of every facet of what we want for EQ that some would like to see. I really do wish that it were so simple that we *could* just put something on a web page, but it's not like that. <BR>

It appears if you looted it, you get to keep it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Rolling back the clock is always a very sensitive issue. <BR><BR>
The problem was found very quickly, limiting its impact in game. In addition, the loot that was turning up was loot that was otherwise available within the zone, not just random in nature. It's not like level 60 gear was showing up on large rats or anything, people actually had to be in a zone where the equipment was found normally. 
<BR><BR>
In this case, after weighing additional downtime necessary to do a rollback, the inconvenience to those who earned items during that time, and the loss of experinece and play time, we've decided not to pursue it further. 
<BR><BR>
We wish to extend our sincere apologies to everyone over the entire issue.

I particularly like the comment about "get it to work".  Nothing like level 59 spell that doesn't do anything.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>This is actually a regen spell, so yes it would be affected. I think that this spell is probably hit harder than any of the others in the mix. I might suggest changing it or seeing if we can hardcode this particular spell to work.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
We apologize for this evenings outage. We've located the problem and the operations team is working to resolve it now. A problem with the patch was causing inappropriate items to drop across many servers and zones, and also caused some high end loot to be gotten via the forage skill.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of this outage, we are currently repatching. This puts us about 2 to 4 hours before the servers will be back up. <BR>
<BR>
As part of this repatch, spells will be redone thus fixing the Jolt spell which had reverted to its old casting time, and the Howling Harpoon will be fixed as it was procing Dragon Breath. Furthermore, a bug with haste items, which caused the highest-end ones (from the Plane of Sky) to be only as good as your average dragon loot. Finally, the bug that causes you to lose invisibility (even though it appears to still be up) when someone casts a beneficial spell upon you has been fixed.<BR>
<BR>
Again, I apologize for the outage and thank you for your understanding.<BR>
<BR>
