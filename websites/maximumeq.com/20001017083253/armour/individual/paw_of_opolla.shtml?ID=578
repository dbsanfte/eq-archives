<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok I'll write a little guide here to help out everyone that wants this amazing little item:<BR>
<BR>
First off, dont attempt this item before level 27, I will explain this later on.<BR>
<BR>
To start, you need to get the severed paw.  This is the paw you have to put the four rings on to get the Paw of Opolla.  The paw can be found in the sewers in North Qeynos.  It is a drop off a level 24 beggar guy named Vin Moltar.  You take a faction hit against Qeynos for killing him but who really cares about just one.  If he is not there, it is annoying because he spawns only once every six hours.  If you really want to dodge the faction hit, give him a rat meat pie.  I just blew his sorry ass up.<BR>
<BR>
Next, you want the silver ring.  Go to blackburrow.  When you first walk in, theres that big pit with all the razorgills at the bottom.  Go camo (they attack no matter what your level is) and take a leap of faith.  The ring is at the bottom of their pool, and its not directly in the middle so search around for a while.  When you get it, put it in the paw (which is a four slot container) and hop the boat to Edruine.<BR>
<BR>
When you get to Edruine, go to tox forest and head to the docks.  If you dont know how to get to the docks, head stright out of Edruine and when you hit the water take a left.  Cant miss it.  Hop the boat or swim over to Kerra isle.  If you go stright out from the docks, the entrance will be on your left, so run that way.  Its a big thing, your not gonna miss that one either.<BR>
<BR>
In Kerra isle (fairly small zone) is High Priestess Mitty (Not Princess Mitty as everyone calls her).  She is fairly easy to find, just look around for a while.  When you do find her, either pull her back to the zone and kill her, or kill all the priestess around her so they wont heal.  The reason you need to be 27+ is so these cats wont train on you.  Mitty will drop the copper ring one out of about 20 times, the silver ring about the same, and the gold ring is VERY rare, 1 out of 100 would be my guess.  She has a spawn rate of twenty miniutes.  <BR>
<BR>
After you kill her and get your copper and gold ring, head to Befallen.  Right when you get in, you will pretty much be standing on where Gynok spawns.  Gynok drops the plat ring.  He drops it at about the same rate as the copper ring, but he is rare as hell, and he wont always spawn.  Things that can spawn in his place are Ice Bone Skele's, Large Rats, Putrid Skele's, Skele's, Ghouls and Dread Bones.  To get Gynok to spawn, kill the things that spawn instead of him.  If you come in and want to start, just sit at the entrance.  Only ONE creature in the entire doungen will be walking around, and that is his place holder.  It will walk down to the third level, then back to the spawn point.  The spawn rate at his point is about half an hour.  When he does spawn, he will be a mummy that is level 22.  Kill him and hopefully get your plat ring.<BR>
<BR>
Hit combine and viola!  Paw of Opolla.  Be prepared to put 60-100 hours into this quest, thats  about the avarage amount of time it will take to do the entire thing unless you get really lucky.</font></td></tr></table>

I don't believe this is related to the Paw.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Oddly, this was not a very hard quest to do. In fact the hardest ring for me to get was the silver.<BR>
I never really wanted a Paw but was in befallen at level 24 sitting by the entrance helping a friend when he came running back with an ice boned skeleton, I killed him and continued helping my friend. I was sitting there medding right by entrance when some named mummy hit me, stood up, rooted him, slapped a Envenomed Breath on him, sat back down, he started hitting me again. Killed him he has a plat ring on him. I did an ooc asking what is was for and judging by how many tells I got asking for it I knew it was valuable. Did a little research, decided to do quest. I got a TP to Tox, and spent 6 hours camping Mitty, In the 6 hours she dropped 2 copper rings, and 1 gold ring. Ran to Blackburrow and after 3 hours of auctioning some newbie at Qeynos bank had a silver ring for sale for 4 plat. Ran down, gave Vin a rat pie and 3 kalish, got the container and had my paw. Seeing as I use a 2 handed weapon I traded it to a druid for a chyrsberyl talisman, 2 mith runed bracers, a plat ruby veil, and a totemic helm. <BR>
Not too shabby for level 24.<BR>
BTW at 24 I never had any of the priestess's around Mitty train on me, they did heal her, but I would just pull her away from them.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>All i can say is that i got extremely lucky on this one. After getting the container and the silver ring, i was almost ready to give up the quest until i saw the plat ring on auction for 1000pp.  I immediately got the plat ring and decided to camp Mitty to get the other two rings.  I went to the temple where mitty spawns and killed her. GOLD RING!. i camped mitty for another 3 hours hoping to get the copper ring when a fellow guildmate offered me his copper ring at no charge. I put all four ring in the container and VOILA my very own paw of opolla.<BR>
<BR>
P.S. I liked this quest so much that i look forward to spending another 60-100 hours on it again<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>If you ever have trouble getting the gold ring to spawn on High Princess Mitty, this is how I went about improving the odds.(a lvl 10 pally named Alldar helped me on this one)<BR>
<BR>
High Princess's that guard Mitty often drop the Kerran Doll. So I collected about 10 of these and placed them around in a circle on Mitty's spawn point hoping for a voodoo miracle. Low and behold, a gold ring dropped the next spawn. I suggest trying this method, as it as worked for me. (maybe I was going out of my mind after sitting in that room for 9 hours, who knows?)<BR>
