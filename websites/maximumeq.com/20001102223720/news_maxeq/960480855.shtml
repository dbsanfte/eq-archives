<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Monk's hand damage">Monk's hand damage</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/01/00 13:03 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>A lot of people have been concerned that a bare-fisted monk is going to be worthless, with all the monk weapons showing up now.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;All we want to know is the damage and delay of our fists from 50-60 so that we know if we can even come close to doing our best damage with our bare fists- not an unreasonable request, I must say, considering the fact that all other melee types get to knw their damage and delay with any given weapon.<BR>
</font>
Ok, I guess I can buy that. I think that it would be fair to say that assuming that a monk has maxed out all related skills, that an armed monk, wielding looted weapons appropriate for their level will generally be better off than an unarmed monk, but not to the extent that an unarmed monk is "useless". Human monks hands will cap at 14/28 at 60th level, with Iksar monks being slightly slower. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>It's close, but still late.
The good news is that it's pretty much done from a world building standpoint -- the geometry is there, the textures placed, as well as the objects, and I'm pretty sure almost done being lit.
<BR><BR>
The EQ Live will start populating it soon and I'd expect to see it on the Test server in a couple of weeks.
<BR><BR>
Sorry for the delay.

However, it appears that froglok eyes are still not dropping.  If you have or haven't seen them, reply to the original thread (not me via e-mail, link is at bottom of the news item.).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I'd like to give this a little while longer before getting too deep into it to give them a chance to turn up. Froglok eye's were one of the things in my list as being fixed, but it is possible that they are so rare that they aren't popping up. Can anyone here confirm froglok eye drops?<BR><BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We've updated the <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo column</a> here on Everlore. Just in case you're wondering who Milo is, he's the 3D Character artist at Verant. Most of those well designed characters we're brought into 3D by this man, and now he let's us bug him with questions which we post here on a weekly basis.<P>
 
 Anyway, this week Milo covers the latest barrage of questions ranging from which RPG's the EQ team used to play, to why Halas Barbarians run like they're constipated. Funny and informative as always, here's a snip from the page.

    Just wondering if you or the other programmers were RPG players before you went to work for EQ? I have notice the Mobs look     allot the RPG pictures given in monster manuals for almost all RPGs. Is this due to those visual conceptions of those original         artist or your bosses lack of creativity? Or are you just constrained to the RPG players conceptions of the mobs in their minds?     Do you get to free-lance any of the graphics for mobs? The armors and such have some great details and originality; so I                 assume you guys are the creative wizards for EQ.
