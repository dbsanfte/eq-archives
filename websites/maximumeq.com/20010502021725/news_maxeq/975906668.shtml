<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Gordon answers some magician questions">Gordon answers some magician questions</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 11/23/00 13:46 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Gordon responded to some magician concerns on the Official Forums</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>It looks like half the threads on the first page are about mage issues of one kind or another. Let me see if I can clear up a few of the rumors going around, and please try to keep the number of threads down. 
<br>
<br>Though it might seem that this many threads are necessary to properly express the feelings that some are having, all that will happen is that we'll have to start closing threads. 
<br>
<br>Call of the Hero: No intentional change was made to the way that this works. However, there were some changes made to the way intra-zone teleports are handled (to actually make them work better), so it is possible that it might have had an unintended effect on Call of the Hero. 
<br>
<br>Pets: No changes were made to pet stats. The only change that was made in regard to pets is that they now proc all-target procs as if they were a player character. They proc special-target procs half as often as if they were a player. The next patch will make it so that special-target procs are proced just as often as the others, but will only work on the intended target type.
<br>
<br>This change does NOT affect what we call a "contact innate" (e.g. A spell that procs directly off of an NPC such as the necro lifetap procs on 44th and 49th) or "spell innate" (casted spells such as that done by mage pets). 
<br>
<br>We will MOST LIKELY be scaling the dexterity of pets with their level so that the higher level ones will proc carried weapons more often, nearly as much so as before. We will also look into creating new summoned special-target proc weapons for mages.
<br>
<br>All of the other things that we should have fixed instead: Every time we make a change considered negative to a particular class, the boards are filled with complaints that we should have fixed something else instead of spending time on this. While I appreciate everyone's thoughts, we're not going to exclusively stick to making changes that everyone will like at the expense of the overall detrement to the game. To use an analogy (which you all know I like to use), complaining that the officer should be out catching real criminals instead of writing you up for speeding is not going to make him say, "You're right", and stop writing your ticket. There are things that need to be done. Things that upset the balance of the game (typically by making it too easy thus trivializing aspects of it by removing the challenge) will get priority over other things that don't have this type of impact. It's the way it works and the way we need to do things to keep the game interesting.

*Patch Day*<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last week's big patch.  The following changes were made:<BR>
<BR>
- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below the minimum.<BR>
- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<BR>
- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the volume slider was moved.<BR>
- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association with mipmapping.<BR>
- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.<BR>
- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried by dwarves. <BR>
- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience in slight disagreement with the server.<BR>
- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.<BR>
- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.  <BR>
<BR>
In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following the patch today.  Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune.  We would have named the new server under its full name if not for an attempt to avoid confusion between the existing "Bristlebane" server (named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<BR>
