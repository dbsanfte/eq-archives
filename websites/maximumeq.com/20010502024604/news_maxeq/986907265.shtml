Absor posted regarding the new split server.  It will be named Zebuxuruk.  His comments are below, along with a link to the discussion.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The new server will be named after the evil demi-god Zebuxuruk. Little is known about this god. The best way that I can describe him is that he is enshrouded in mystery.<p>
The new server will be coming up on Wednesday the 21st. I'll let you know when I know what time on Wednesday this will be happening.
<p>
We have over 4,000 players registered to move. Unfortunately the move will also require that we take down the Rathe and E'ci for a while as well.<p>
