<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Verant needs you help with SoV FAQ">Verant needs you help with SoV FAQ</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 11/17/00 16:37 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Verant is looking for your input in creating their Scars of Verious FAQ.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>It is now time to start writing the official EverQuest: The Scars of Velious FAQ. But, I need your help to do this. In order to create a FAQ that answers your questions, we need your input. The veliousfaq@station.sony.com email address is now open. If you believe you have a question that would benefit an official FAQ, please send it in. If your question in chosen for inclusion in the EverQuest: The Scars of Velious FAQ, you will be given credit. This credit will be granted by a "submitted by" byline, just like this example: (Disclaimer: The following example is used only to show how chosen submissions will receive credit and not the style of the question.)
<br>
<br>I will close the veliousfaq@station.sony.com email address this Monday afternoon, November 20 at 4pm PST. Due to the number of submissions expected, I will not be responding to any email sent to this address. FAQ submissions sent to any other address will be discarded. 
<br>
<br>When submitting a FAQ question, please put "Velious FAQ" in the subject header and supply your character name and server in case your question is chosen for inclusion. 
<br>
<br>Thank you everyone! 
<br>
<br>Oh yeah. I am sure a couple people will be excited to post their FAQ question to this thread, but please, try to refrain from doing that. Took me a whole 2 minutes to establish the veliousfaq@station.sony.com, and I don't want to feel I wasted all of that time. =)
