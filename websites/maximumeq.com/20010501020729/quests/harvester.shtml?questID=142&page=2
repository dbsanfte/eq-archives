1) Talk to Vurgo in the Temple of Solusek Ro and ask him 'What Harvester'  He will tell you to give him a Shadowed Scythe.<BR>
<BR>
2) You can obtain a Shadows Scythe from Shadowed Men in various parts of Norrath.  <BR>
<BR>
3) Give Vurgo the Shadowed Scyth, he will give you xp, faction, and a NO DROP note.  He will then tell you of the other items you need.<BR>
<BR>
4) Get the Fungus Eye by going to Unrest and killing the Mortuary Fungus.<BR>
<BR>
5) Then go to the Ocean of Tears (yes, take the ancient ship of doom...) and go to the island just across from Sister Island.  Near a monolith (like the one in Nektulos) will spawn the Goblin Headmaster.  As his rare drop, he drops the Shadowed Knife needed for this quest:  The knife does not vanish when you log like other shadowed items.<BR>
<BR>
6) Finally, go back to the temple of Ro and purchase a Fire Opal from Genni for 550 gp (must be gold).<BR>
<BR>
7) Give these items and the note to Vurgo and you'll get the Harvester.</div>

I have not done the fungus yet but was told that he is around lvl 27, also that he was in a secret wall. If you can get someone to cast share wolf form on you, you will no longer be kos inside unrest and can loot the eye  if someone is killing him and gives you permission.    hope this helps.<BR>

Get a druid to cast Harmony for you so you can pull them one at a time. Also, have a good group of 30ish people to take them, or be around 35 or so to do it solo. The stuff in Unrest is no drop and useless to anybody else, so find a time with a group camping the Dwarven Work Boots as they will be killing both the mobs that you need drops from (the Werebat Wing for the Robe of Enshroudment drops there too!) and just ask them to let you know when they see what you want to loot. The Shadowed Knife isn't that bad of a camp. They're typical upper 20's goblins, but the trouble is that it's a rare drop. Camped it for 3 hours and went home empty handed. Oh well, tomorrow I'll head back there and kill some more goblins, maybe this time I'll get the silly knife.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Just adding a little comment about the shadowed men and the faction.<BR>
Shadowed men are lvl 24 to 27 exactly I "attempted" to hunt them at 30 in a full group. Now this is over 6 hours we had 9 evacs to NK btw we hunted shadowed men in SK.) This is mostly due to the fact that the shadowed men are darn near impossible to pull solo until you are 35 btw rangers have harmony too or get a cleric or pally to cast soothe on them. It is very difficult to deal with the mobs mostly because of the necro shadowed peeps. They will fear half your group everyone gets disoriented as the puller is now running halfway across the karanas the wizard is nuking and rooting every mob it sees the cleric is trying to heal ppl then they run out of range the tanks get on one mob start getting their asses kicked as the pets and 2 other shadowed men are attacking and a cleric shadowed man is making it near impossible to kill just one. True story now and that happened about 5 times and other times one or two members died once had a clops run up on us etc. (bad day to be hunting shadowed men me thinks) Its better to be near 40 have a 35+ person who can soothe or harmonize.<BR>
Now for the faction the easiest and best way to get it without dying 50times from shadowed men is to go to MM and give the flower to Ssynthi. I did this for about 3 hours and had good enough faction to get all quests from Sol Temple and try to do it when GY is camped makes it alot easier then having to kill every mob go get the flower turn it in over and over then the mobs respawn and start over.<BR>
Just a bit of advice for you peeps out there who need Sol Temple faction or want to get a harvester or some other item for a quest. ~_^ </font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white> i usually dont post comments but i do know what i am talking about here and there has been false info nukuk above that has been reported to you.<BR>
i grouped for these in SK with me 28druid, the thing about harmony (soothe spell) is that it seems to not work on shadowmen. nukuk said this and laughed. and he/she is partially right. dont try and harmonize shadow'd in SK. it WILL NOT work.  :)<BR>
but this isnt always the case. the reason harmony doesnt work is because the spell harmony "greatly decreases agro range of creatures. and it happens that it doesnt decrease to 0. so if a mob like shadomen are very very close together then they cant be pulled one by one. harmony works on them but they are too close. this is not the case for all shadowmen, there are many places where shadowmen are and some can be pulled by one. usually not though. and after spawn is broken you can then sometimes harmony because they are seperated and keep the spawns about. so if you have high lvl to break spawn for you and you have smart druid like me "karlean" then you will do fine.<BR>

 karlean-druid<BR>
BTW<BR>
 i could not run out a shadow'd man with spirit of cheetah on. its much faster then sow. so your best bet is to not run.  :)</font></td></tr></table>
