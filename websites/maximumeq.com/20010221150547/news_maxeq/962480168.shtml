<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Locked doors and MOBs">Locked doors and MOBs</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/22/00 00:25 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Verant is considering changing the way that MOBs interact with locked doors.  Currently, if you can somehow damage a MOB on the other side of a locked door (AoE spell, etc) it will open the door and come at you.  This will then allow you to run through.  Verant wants to change it so that MOBs run <b>through</b> locked doors, and not open them.<BR><BR>

The player that posted this comment has a very valid point.  It's going to be a huge problem with MOBs running away through locked doors.</font></p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;You are killing a mob, it walks through a door you can't open, now you get a huge train. <BR>
</font>
Yes, you are correct. A rogue, a key, a root, a mez, and a stun, can all address this issue quite nicely.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;However, it's stupid to REQUIRE a locked door to be passed to get to major parts of the game. That's nothing but affirmative action for rogues. <BR>
</font>
<BR>
Heh, perhaps. Of course I think the main resistance to this idea is the fact that it's something new. Had this been around since the game launched (as it probably should have been), it wouldn't be such an issue, but rather just how the game is played. <BR>
<BR>
I do however look forward to seeing more people experiencing how good rogues are for the group. Most people I have heard from, who have experience grouping with rogues, agree that a well-played rogue is a wonderful addition. However, there are a lot of people resistant to the idea of grouping with them based upon anecdotal evidence when the game was first released. They just think that "rogues suck" and aren't open to other possibilities. <BR>
<BR>
It will be nice when people see how valuable they really are, even when a door doesn't need to be opened.<BR>
