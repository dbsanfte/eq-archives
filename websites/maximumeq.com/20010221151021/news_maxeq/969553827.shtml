&gt;&gt;&gt;I find the constant posting of patches in either PDT, EST, PST ? its all lost on me. I’m sure a lot of us out there would appreciate this.<BR>
</font>
We're GMT-8, meaning that it's 8 hours later in Greenwich. As far as posting it, we want to try and confuse the smallest number of people possible. For part of the world, we don't even get the date right as it is <BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;its unfair to a HUGE amount of players who potentially after upwards of a years play will just be approaching the level required to encounter Gods<BR>
</font>

I understand your feelings on this. Frankly, could it be avoided we would. From an RP perspective, across many fantasy worlds created in novels and such, the power of a deity is based upon the number or strength of their followers. That's basically what's happening in Norrath, a combination of both.<BR>
<BR>
From a loot perspective, we will indeed be moving thier current loot down to creatures powered similarly to what the deities are now. The deities will be populated with level 60 loot and become an appropriate encounter for a large group in that level range. Indeed, this will raise the bar for encountering a deity, however killing deities is supposed to be the pinnacle of success in EverQuest. So is encountering dragons, however in that case we decided to place the level cap on the old dragons to keep them within reach.<BR>
