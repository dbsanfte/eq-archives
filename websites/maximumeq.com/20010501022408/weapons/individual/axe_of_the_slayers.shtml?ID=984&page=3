<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Just so you know Soluus there is at least one Axe of the Salyers present on the Prexus Server. I acquired it totally by accident helping a level 45 paladin friend of mine. We tripped over him in the dark at the crossroads near the Feerott zone. I have tried the exe axe and compared it to the Axe of the Slayers and prefer the Axe..the invunerability shield is a great help. Also the Rampage proc stat adjustments increase by one per level starting at level 30 when the Axe starts to proc. So the starting proc is +25 str -15 agil, strenght will increas and agility will decrease. The duration of the proc seems to be random though and will either wipe out any other strength buff or the proc will be stopped by a higher level strength buff. Good hunting to all who are after it.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok well now we have all gotten a belly full undead. They have nothing to do with our lil orc meaning the (all undead) statemeant above. First of Grazhak the Berserker is a Wanderer/Roamer. I am currently on my  15th hour of awakeness and takin notes on combo's of killin PH'ers. The wandering Orc Priest is a definite tie to him seeing as they share the same wandering path. Also the Priest isn't the only thing that POP's early this morning and late  last night after takin a day to completely scout the zone, to learn it visually so i could translate placement of things I officially pitched ye ol tent. It seems wandering Orc Warriors share Grazhak's place, after killin the Priest a few times 2 popped simultaneously (very much similar to Paw gnolls) thereafter I got 3 single warriors(1 of which popped simultaneously with the Priest). The spawn cycle trips out when you kill just the Priest and lizard Man Mystic. Thinking that since I am after a priest that wanders and the Lizzie man mystic wanders there maybe a link. This triggers Giant skeletons and decaying ones that also wander. What I and other players mean by wander is they in the general LOC of -437.86, 1543.92, 15.98 . Let it also be known that the priest has no designated spawning point, He pops all about the base of the large Rock Hill along with the wandering warriors. Back to the tript up spawn it triggers the skeletons as stated above, Obsidian Drakes which also wander, Brown Bears, and Fire Beetles(all of which wander). Now if there are more details and I am sure there are since my final analysis of this mythical orc who does exist, Simply becuz if you travel to the Unkempt Druid Ring a named Halfling Druid; Tinner Emberee(something to that affect) will give the quest of grazhak and warns you.I have been here for 15 hours currentlyand yet to see our lil orc, I am not giving up someone plz help me .<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Doh, It seems I have posted wrong info. The LOC i gave above is -437.86,  -1543.92, 15.98. I am sorry for to inconvience those who might have been pursuing this weapon. Also additional info I have begun killin all spawns in this area and it increases the POP of the priest and warriors above mentioned. I also reread in fo yesterday on Everlore about how to get this item, there is speculation that points to the Paladin camp and the Undead. Both of these are wrong. Kill only the decayin and skele's along with the Giant skele whom POP at the locale. That is all I have at the time. I hope it helps a lil more. Still campin<BR>

He did not have the axe but had the girdle, which i would like to know the stats, someone in my group ( Bigalow ) ninjaed the item.

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>ye about that if not more, it is an awesome belt! Rare item on most servors. I would keep it I am sure some 30-50 warrior wants it. Wow I wish Torv had the POP's you guys get!!! I camped that foo for 1 week and a half and nothing. I am seriously intrigued by both items and by the the fact he has never been seen on Torv, and if he has noone has ever killed him! Well at any rate I do believe I am about to pick the camp up again, seein as how I have soloed a couple of HG's now. I am mentally prepared once again. Well I hope any info I post about the LOC and any of the other things are help. I have tried waiting at Paly camp for him, I am beginning to believe he is like mummie in befallen I am not familiar with the mummy. I am familiar with this after that mummies' PH'er has been slain there is only like a 3% chance he will POP 8( I hope this isn't true and once again ask you people of the other servors since I have created characters just to speak with you and get info plz post something useful. The seekers of Grazhak are few most do not know even then most are not interested It is not like people look at the weapons list and say hey I want a AOS.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Okay to get this mystery orc, you will need a tracker.A ranger would be best, the items he drops are best suited for a warrior and they both sell for big loot. The belt is by far the better item in my opinon. Ghrazak is a level 35 orc. Use your tracker to track orc priests, the ones that wander. You have to track and kill alot to make hime spawn. Just like Crookstinger in LesserFay(kill wasps to make him spawn) but keep in mind you have to kill alot and he doesn't like to spawn(hence the RARE spawn). Anyhoo, have fun and dont waste too much time looking, remember you are supposed to be having fun =)</font></td></tr></table>
