&gt;&gt;&gt;Will EQ be adding new faces? As the game has expanded diversity in appearance has begun to thin out. There are numerous great NPC faces that would seem to make great PC faces. Since they are already constructed and in the game, I don't know that it would be a problem for EQ to give players a few new options for their character faces. Maybe 2 or 3 more faces for men and women of each race. <BR>
Brad posted last week that new faces may be something that we'll pursue going forward.<BR>

We just won't seem them come into fruition for several years at least :(</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>A truly and realistically dynamic world is one of the MMORPG 'holy grails.'<BR>
I expect we'll 'get there' some day, but it will be a while. On the road there, however, you'll see incremental advancements. Second generation MMORPGs will be more dynamic than first, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Personally, I'd like to see a huge, detailed world that changed according to what players and GMs wanted/did. BUT, the changes need to make sense, they need to retain context. <BR>
<BR>
One short term way to achieve a 'dynamic world' is to randomly generate and scramble content, whether it be quests, world geometry, or whatever. I think we'll see more experiments into this realm in the future because it is a much easier route to a 'dynamic world.' You don't need hordes of game designers and world builders... you don't need incredibly sophisticated world and NPC AI that reacts and changes based on events... rather, you just need lots of variables and a good random number generator.<BR>
<BR>
This approach, however, at least for a player and designer such as myself, leaves me wanting. One day I'd like to see a huge, detailed world with every alleyway having a story behind it, a world so vast that it might take several years for a player to have explored everywhere (if it were even possible for one player to do so!). A world that changes but makes sense... perhaps a war ravages several villages, or perhaps a volcano erupts creating new mountain or island (and you SAW it erupt!)... perhaps a group of players went on a daring quest and, barely surviving, triumphed -- and the nobles of the land talked about your accomplishment and treated you differently for some time...<BR>
<BR>
Anyways, we have a long road ahead of us in terms of MMORPG development and I'm glad to be part of a company who is committed to reaching those goals <BR>
