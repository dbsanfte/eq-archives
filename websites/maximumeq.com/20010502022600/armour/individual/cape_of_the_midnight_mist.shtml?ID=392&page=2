In fact about half of my earnings have gne to him. So, careful what you say. And I am sorry you don't have any true friends. Maybe these folk that boast about how much coin they have should be handing it around instead of letting it sit in their banks. This IS, after all, a Fantasy Game. This looks like a real nice item. <BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Hum, no friend gives that much money to a friend?  =)  Well one of my friends said he'd give me 10kpp to come back to EQ.  After 6 long months of kicking the habit, I couldn't refuse.  He gave me 5kpp and then they nerfed the dwarfs loot.  Needless to say, 5kpp still made me happy and I'm not even so concerned at the other 5kpp he didn't pass onto me.  After all, how many friends do you know that'll let you use their 51 druid when they're not on?  That alone is worth the other 5kpp, especially since I used him to get a GBS!!!<BR>

Now for the point of my post I sold this item for 8pp.  I thought that was a lot and for a lev.7 clerc it is.  But what makes me made is that no one told me what this was worth, no one made any suggestions to what it was worth.  Now i am not trying to complain to much I just wish that some of the other people in the game would be a little more helpful and not just be out for them selves.  I have incountered many very nice people but today all i can think about is how that one person did me wrong, and I know it was my own falt, so I am not blaming anyone I just wish I had this knowlege earlyer today.  To the guy I sold it to enjoy, and to any new people let me give you one pice of advice i learend to "/auctiin" and take some offers before you sell.

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Well I wasn't to sure about getting this item for my bard since the AC is so low.  But I figure he will need the extra strength to carry the heavy FS plate and/or Lambent armor someday (he only has 98 strength).<BR>
So putting a bit of extra strength in the non-visable slot made some sense.  Wouldn't pay too much for it though because of the low AC.<BR>
<BR>
And to the last post-- I'm sorry you were "ripped off" on your sale.  But also, you got it for free by doing a good deed.  So anything you got for it is a profit, and you still have the goodwill of the one you helped.<BR>
<BR>
That's why you should always visit this site to take a look at prices first before you sell ;)<BR>

...there you go.  The Butler is in the castle of mistmoore, he's a lv 30something mob, and he's rare.  You'll see people camping the "maid & butler" quite a bit for their fangs.  The cape is a common drop on the Butler... (nightshade wreath is a common drop on the Maid).<BR>
