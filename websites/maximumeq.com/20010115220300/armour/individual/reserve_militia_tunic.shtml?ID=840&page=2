Then i hunted roughly 40 orcs pawns. I only had to give thrice the 4 pick trick to Vallon. the 8 derv rings were harvested the same way. Mixed with bronze armor for the other parts it gives your character a very nice and unique look. try and be patient you will succeed in the end.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>For those that would like to raise FP Militia faction without bothering with the time-consuming camping of the orcs (who wants to hunt something that grunts, anyway?) there is a very simple and quick way to raise FP Mitilia faction, and as of now, it is not done very much so you will likely be the only one there.  (Those that are KoS in Freeport can also do this, since the quest is in Erudin).<BR>
<BR>
Hop on the boat and go to Erudin.  Upstairs (third floor) by the entrance to the magician's guild in the Erudin castle, there is an NPC named Toresian something.  You must be amiable to him to get the quest.  (That is easily done by going out to Toxx forest and bashing a named necro (Elial or something like that by the docks to Kerra).  Kill him 20 or so times, and your faction will shoot up with anything Erudite.  (The Heretics will hate you when this is through, but who cares?)  Once you're amiable to Toresian, go back to him and say the phrase "I wish to assist Toresian".  He'll give you a bottle to take down to the bottom floor, to Vials of Vitality, to give to someone named Slansin.  Slansin is a spy or something like that.  Give him the bottle, and your faction with FP Militia, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and a few other useful faction hits will be given.  Nothing goes down. This is perfect for paladins.  Stick in Erudin for a little while and just run up and down the stairs with the bottles.  You get no xp, but the faction raises too quickly to care.  I went from dubious to amiable in about four hours of running this.<BR>
<BR>
(Note:  If someone has killed Slansin, he will take FOREVER to respawn.)<BR>
<BR>
Take a peek at the exact spoiler notes for this at www.allakhazam.com in the Erudin Quest section.  That's where I found it.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Unless you really want a red chest and back or need to raise Militia faction anyway, I wouldn't bother with this quest. (or the pvp, no-drop thing) You can buy banded for 15 plat or less and have an ac of 15. When I removed my banded and put this on I actually lost 10ac.<BR>
Going from dubious to amiable I had to turn in 36 picks and 36 belts. I hunted for some, bought some, buffed for some. It ended up costing me close to 20pp. Took me about 11 hours, went from 14 1/2 to 15 1/3 in level. I already had the Derv rings from hunting in South Ro. I'm a Barb with a buffed charisma of 76. You need to be AMIABLE.<BR>
AFTER I get the thing the armorer tells me not to go to North Freeport. That's where the bank is. Am I going to be KOS there? I'm also wondering where else i'm going to run into trouble because of this. Maybe I can attack a guard to set things right again. Of course I don't want to be KOS with them either.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>First off, I have to agree with the guy who said that this a<BR>
realatively easy quest. In fact, the most difficult element<BR>
involved is running back and forth from WC's to the FP militia<BR>
house. <BR>
 To set the record straight, orc pawn pick's -assuming you are'nt going to <BR>
hunt for them- can be purchased from a merchant who sells<BR>
his wares in one of the first hut's you come to shortly after you <BR>
enter the EC zone.<BR>
The ring's you can buy (usually cheap, as first time derv camper's<BR>
usually have them in HUGE supply -I know I did).<BR>
 Finally, to answer the question as to wether you're faction drop's in N.FP.<BR>
-it does'nt. In fact, my faction in N.FP is "kindly". Go figure.<BR>
 In any event, it is a pretty cool item, and definitely one that get's the<BR>
occasional looksee.<BR>
Bottom line, the belt's and ring's are EASY to come by. The pick's are also<BR>
equally easy to get. The guy who said it took him 11 hour's to do, must have have been AFK<BR>
for most of that time, because when all was said and done<BR>
the total time spent (by me, that is) perfforming this quest might have have<BR>
topped out at 40 minutes.<BR>
 Check it out, though. It's pretty neat.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>This quest is easiest to do when you are an 11th level bard.<BR>
<BR>
Go out to the toll booth, put your flute in your hand and play Cinda's Charismatic Carrillon. This will typically raise your faction with Gaurd Valon two levels. I went from apprehensive to amiable. Then just say "I will hunt the dervish cutthroats." (Or it might be cutthroat dervishes, I don't remember which.) And voila. He'll give you the bag.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, by the time you get to 11th level, you probably have banded anyway. But it's nice to do. :)<BR>
