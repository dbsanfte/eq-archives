<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Here's an event my guild is hosting:<BR>
 <BR>
Back by popular demand, Sanguine Blade will be hosting another all rogue tournement open to all rogues of the Bristlebane server.<BR>
<BR>
The Time: It will be held on Sunday, July 9th at 3:00pm CST.<BR>
<BR>
The Place: Since it will be all one-on-one competition, the location of this tourny will be Najena. We will simply use /duel for each bout. A few advantages to this is that there will be no outside interference like there would be in an arena, its a fairly low populated zone, so lag should be at a minimum, and the room where the event will take place is large enough to accomidate good wide open dueling. For lower levels, higher ups will keep the mobs at bay so as not to interfere in bouts near the entry. Higher ups can use the dungeon to their benefit as they see fit in between their duels. I think it'll be more fun than just standing face to face in an arena.<BR>
<BR>
The Details: We will be setting up brackets like we did at our last tournament in Befallen by level: <BR>
<BR>
Bracket: Entrance Fee:<BR>
<BR>
Snatcher <BR>
lvl 10-15 3p <BR>
<BR>
Filcher <BR>
lvl 16-21 5p <BR>
<BR>
Burglar <BR>
lvl 22-26 10p <BR>
<BR>
Crook <BR>
lvl 27-29 15p <BR>
<BR>
Snitch <BR>
lvl 30-33 20p <BR>
<BR>
Bandit <BR>
lvl 34-37 25p <BR>
<BR>
Thief <BR>
lvl 38-41 30p <BR>
<BR>
Ring leader <BR>
lvl 42-44 35p <BR>
<BR>
Masterthief <BR>
lvl 45-47 40p <BR>
<BR>
Mastermind <BR>
lvl 48-50 50p <BR>
<BR>
And the NEW bracket:<BR>
Nightlord<BR>
lvl 51-60 65p<BR>
<BR>
Prizes will be 100% of all the entrance fees in the bracket. For the lower 5 brackets, there will be a choice of a few items out of guild inventory that can be taken as a prize in place of 50% of the purse. (Would like to offer prize instead for all brackets, but we don't really have anything in inventory that would interest a lvl 40+ rogue) <BR>
<BR>
The rules of combat are as follows: <BR>
<BR>
1. Fight naked <BR>
- allowed to wear 2 pieces of equipment per lvl difference to compensate higher ATK, HP, AC of higher lvl's of same bracket.<BR>
<BR>
2. FS weapons only <BR>
- this is to avoid exp loss with dot type proc'ing weapons, and advantanges of special weapons.<BR>
<BR>
3. Range weapons are allowed.<BR>
<BR>
4. Shield allowed: for those who prefer shield versus weapon in secondary slot.<BR>
<BR>
5. Bandages allowed <BR>
<BR>
6. No buffs <BR>
<BR>
7. No magic healing during combat. <BR>
<BR>
8. Poison - allowed to be used with the exception of DoT poisons like Snake and Putrid Bane. (Burglar bracket and up ONLY)<BR>
<BR>
These rules will ensure the winner relies on combat skills, instead of better equipment. Anyone found to be dueling outside these rules will forfeit their match.<BR>
<BR>
The guild will provide a choice of FS weapons to combatants. However, each is responsible for bringing their own bandages and range weapons should they choose to employ them.<BR>
<BR>
Pairings will be set randomly by the event organizers with winners advancing to the next round. <BR>
<BR>
This tournament is open to non-guild rogues as well. Please spread the word to your rogue friends throughout Norrath.<BR>
<BR>
<a href="mailto:kallel@mail.com">Registration for the tournement is required.</a> Simply click on the above text and send your name and what bracket you believe you will be fighting in at tourny time, to myself via e-mail. Depending on the way the individual brackets are filled, walk-ons MAY NOT be accepted into the tournement. <BR>
