Delay.. already including the +15 Strength and Wis, etcetera.. and for the warriors that were already whining, I roughly added it up(again, I may be wrong, humans DO make mistakes) and it takes  about 1.47x as much exp for a hybrid to reach 60 than a warrior.. any level 50 warrior.. how would you like to be level 34 with the same amount of played time and experience..?  actually, probably even lower, cuz ya weren't up killing the mean-ass, high-exp mobs.. Yeah, Paladins are pretty buff, they get the best weapon in the game, but do realize that all of their power comes at a MEAN price.</font></td></tr></table>

I have heard rumors of clones of vox/naggy being put in kunark from teh test servers that drop the same stuff i hope that's the case because then i might have a shot to get this sword which is by far the best sword in the game might not have best dmg/delay but those stats and procs make up more than enough imo.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I've played to lvl 29 as a paladin, and I think I know enough to say that damage, while nice, is not the tank's forte.  The best thing a tank can do is to taunt and take hits.  After a fight once, we were all sitting around comparing damage, and I was pretty proud of myself.  My new GZ had hit for 46 pts.  Unfortunately, I was the highest lvl in the group and everyone else had hit for 126 or 145 pts with their spells.  I was also the only one who had lost any life.  If I had been more concerned with taking the mob down than i was with protecting my finger wavers, it's very likely that I would have been the only one who survived...<BR>
<BR>
so why post this here?<BR>
I have a buddy who plays on Povar.  He had full crafted at 26.  Most of his crafted by 24.  I was excited, because I expected to have my Ro armor by then, right?  nope.  Most sites recommend not even starting on Ro until lvl 33, and most paladins I know of dont' have it till lvl 40 or 45.  Read a recient post somewhere about a paladin completeing her Ro armor as early as 44, and everyone was congratulating her.  so we paladins get a nice sword?  (FYI, there is only ONE person, on ANY server who has one - Musk, of the Tunare server, so it's NOT easy)  Big deal.  I will probably never wield one.  BTW, I'm still in Bronze armor.  it's the best I can get at 29.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>First off....the COF haste is more like 25 not 40, no item has 40 haste.  The highest haste is on the Sunderfury, which is 35%.  And yes, that makes the Sunderfury the more damaging weapon.  With the FA and COF the ratio ends up more like...20 ratio flat.  That plus the proc and stats still make this one fucking kick ass weapon.  The Sunderfury, however, has a 35% haste, and with that gets up to a delay of 23, making have a better ratio than the FA, but no proc. The Jade Inlaid Crecent Axe with COF is also better than the FA, but not the sunderfury...interesting no?  But yes the Rod of Annihilation blows anything away.  Funny joke Verant! You really get a kick out of pissing off a lot of people!  I am a warrior but IMHO I just want a quest sword because it would be fun, not for better stats.  I am already only planning on a Monsoon just for stats and looks (19 ratio with its haste).  I think that both Pals and Wars will agree that a quest sword for wars would be just fun to have, because Wars miss having quests at the higher levels.  And as for SKs....they Deserve the exact same damn sword because they get the shit just as much as pallys.  Warriors would have it for fun but Verant needs to stop screwing over Sks.  Rangers also now have a decent weapon off of kunark, but all in all the quests are just for fun.  Thank you  </font></td></tr></table>

He has one of these bad boys and full Valorium, and in three different places the same thing has happened to me. I was walking along in newbie and semi-newbie places like North Ro and the ruins in Queynos Hills and was a swarmed by Mummys or Dread Corpses and just as I see myself on my last sliver of health the enemys burst into flames and I see the 116 critical hits pour down on the things, the same guy is standing there Fiery Avennger in hand.
