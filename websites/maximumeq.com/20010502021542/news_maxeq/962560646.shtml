&gt;&gt;&gt;But think long term, when there are many level 60's, and you realize that those people don't mind losing the exp. They'll get it back in no time and sit with maxed exp most the time, just like when level 50 was the cap and you could not mind getting killed much because you would be maxed again soon.<BR>

Level 50 non-Kunark characters and level 60 Kunark characters cannot be sacraficed to produce the component necessary for the necro resurrection. In other words, a sacrafice requires an actual sacrafice on the part of the target character. :)<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Test pwipe to be changed to items only">Test pwipe to be changed to items only</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/22/00 00:33 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Well, at least the characters will be restored.  This makes a lot more sense, since it was the items that the players had which were the problem, not the characters themselves.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
After a good deal of discussion on the Test server status, we've decided that having the right or the ability to do something doesn't necessarily mean that we should. Our thoughts were that everyone was aware of the risks of playing on the Test Server, and always did so with the understanding that something such as a character-wipe was always a possibility. It's apparent at this point, given feedback from players on Test, that many didn't understand the risk.<BR>
<BR>
That said, we do need to restore the integrity of the testing environment in order to insure that we are able to catch and address issues prior to them going to the live servers. Test has served well in this capacity since release, however item loot issues and other factors have reduced Test's ability to do this. Given these issues, we still feel that a complete character-wipe represents the best possible solution for continued functionality of the Test server. However, this is a case where, in the interest of keeping our current testers and players satisfied, that we need to compromise on the solution. <BR>
<BR>
After our discussions today, we've decided that an item-wipe, without deleting characters, will accomplish the majority of our goal to restore the Test server as a functional testing platform. Given that, the EQLive and Operations teams are currently at work restoring all characters that were wiped yesterday, with the exception of characters known to be artificially buffed. This process should be completed later today.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, in order to allow those that did not understand the purpose or risks associated with the Test server a chance to avoid future problems of this nature, we will be allowing built-up (not buffed) characters a one-time chance to move when the next split-server comes up, sometime in the near future. As Brad mentioned in his message earlier, we do recommend that those who are on Test more for playing, and less for Testing, seriously consider moving when we open registration. The possibility of a future wipe, whether it is a player or item wipe, is not necessarily unlikely in the future.<BR>
<BR>
We hope that the players on Test will find this compromise acceptable and continue to participate in the testing process. Furthermore, we apologize for the insensitivity of our previous decision to completely wipe the server. <BR>
