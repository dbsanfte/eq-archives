Instead of listing stat enhancing armour for what we thought was important for a class, we now list all stats!<BR><BR>

So now, if your ponsy High-Elf cleric needs more strength gear for your arms slot, it's easy to find.<BR><BR>

Resistance gear is also included in the lists.  I know that this is a feature that many high level player have wanted to see for some time now, as resistance is key for dragons and other assorted MOBs and areas.</font></p>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I'm having the patch message for all of that put up now. Here's a copy though so you don't have to wait:<BR>
April 20th, 7:00pm<BR>
-------------------<BR>
<BR>
As the countdown to Kunark continues, we appreciate everyone's patience while we patch new data to the client in preparation for the opening of the new lands. Today's patch consisted of the new art necessary to allow everyone to view the Iksar and trade items from Kunark, even if they choose not to purchase the expansion. This should be the last big download required prior to the opening of the Ruins of Kunark.<BR>

Also, if you want to take a peek at the new manual that is being shipped, it's available on the Official Everquest site (<a href="http://www.everquest.com">www.everquest.com</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Seeing as how I haven't had much time to spend on the boards today, I thought I'd stop by and let you know that I am indeed working on things that are important to the customers.<BR>
As we've mentioned before, the retail box for EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark will include a new printed manual. Though this will be nice for those just starting out, it doesn't do much for the existing customers.<BR>
<BR>
You might be happy to hear that we will be placing the new manual on the EverQuest website, in PDF format, for you to download should you wish to do so. In addition, I'm currently writing a supplement to the manual that will have a few corrections, plus new information on some melee-specific abilities in the expansion. Though I'm not going to post everything here right now, I thought you might like a taste.<BR>
<BR>
Here's a description of one of the many melee disciplines included in the post-50 ability-set for pure melee characters:<BR>
<BR>
KINESTHETICS (Level 57): When using this discipline, all rolls for double attacks and dual wields will be successful, giving the rogue 4 attacks per round, guaranteed. This discipline lasts for 18 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the rogue gains additional levels.<BR>
<BR>
Of course some of that data doesn't make sense out of context, but it might give you an idea as to what we've been working on. <BR>
<BR>
In the spirit of the additional information released by GZ concerning spells, here's a taste of some of the things that melee types can look forward to:<BR>
<BR>
Warriors: Kicks with integral stuns!<BR>
Rogues: Full speed (think RUN) sneaking!<BR>
Monks: Regen HPs as if you were sitting, but while feigned!<BR>
<BR>
There's more, and to be honest those aren't the best things we've done, but we're not prepared to come clean on it all just yet. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I'm back to writing. Everything is clicking around here and we're right on track for bringing the Kunark Zones online. Shipping is looking good, and we'll announce more information as we have it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thanks!<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Here's my thoughts:<BR>
We don't need "the law" to tell us the difference between right and wrong. We have screwed up and will do right by our customers. If you don't have it by Monday, we'll be giving a free month of EverQuest (as long as it was ordered in a reasonable amount of time (i.e. someone in Taiwan that ordered it today shouldn't expect to get it by Monday).<BR>
<BR>
Believe me it's painful to watch this happen. We're not jumping for joy here watching people get pissed about this. We planned extensively (despite appearences) and to watch some unexpected glitches mess us up is quite depressing.<BR>
<BR>
All we can do is work through the problems, fix them and make it up to our customers.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Now the new Bard charm (Bravura) costs mana. How much mana?<BR>
</font>
The new song is quite a bit more powerful than the old one. I think that once people get a chance to play with it for a while they'll agree. It is powerful enough that we didn't want people to be able to cast it in perpetuity. That's why mana was added to it.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Why does everything capable of speech in Norrath speak common? Wouldn't it make more sense for NPCs in their home town to be speaking their own language?<BR>
</font>
This is something that we'd like to do sometime. Given some other outstanding issues though, it's a bit low on the list.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Clarification on 2handed weapon changes">Clarification on 2handed weapon changes</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/20/00 05:46 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>This change has rangers up in arms over yet something else now.  Abashi tries to explain why 2 handed weapons weren't working the way they should all along:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I was apprehensive to announce the change due to the complaints that might come from it. Just to be clear, damage done by 1H weapons have been correct all of this time. Damage done by 2H weapons was not. Here's a complete explanation of the problem:<BR>
Due to the problem, a 10/20 weapon was superior to a 20/40 weapon, even though they both have the same ratio. The reason for this is a damage scalar that is added to each contact at higher levels is added to the faster weapons more than it is added to a slower weapon, because they have the chance to contact more.<BR>
<BR>
(note: These numbers are arbitrary)<BR>
<BR>
For instance, suppose that the minimum damage that someone can do with the weapon in their primary hand is 11 points. This represents a 1 point hit, plus a 10 point scalar. That extra 10 points is added to every hit you make, regardless what weapon you use.<BR>
<BR>
So, given two weapons have the same ratio, they should average the same amount of damage in a given time. However, since the faster weapon (based upon the stats above) swings twice as fast, it gets that extra damage more often. <BR>
