The change on test was incorrect.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>What we *really* need is a "polearm" skill. We really don't like the idea of paladins wielding daggers or rapiers, but really wouldn't have a problem with them using lances and polearms. Unfortunately, new skills aren't technically feasible at this time.<BR>
In any case, the change to 2HS was a mistake, and it's been switched to 1HS. <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Hybrid mana pools">Hybrid mana pools</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/04/00 00:15 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I didn't realize that the manapool of hybrids was also reduced.  No wonder they are OOM so fast.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;The solution is giving hybrids a much larger mana pool.<BR>
Though I don't think that it's right to match up a mana pool versus an experience penalty, you might be right that a larger mana pool might be appropriate for Hybrids.<BR>
<BR>
Upon looking at the issue, it does appear to be a bit of a double mana-penalty, by virtue of the fact that they get less mana, and their spells also cost more. Given this, we've increased the hybrid mana-pool on the Test server to see its effect upon the environment.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Shaman gate potions">Shaman gate potions</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/03/00 15:26 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>All I can say about the "safe place" being in the shadowmen camp is ouch!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>gt;gt;gt;My beef is about the gate potions. Gate to Everfrost is at a safe point, gate to innothule swamp drops you in the shadowmen camp. It seems that for a level 49 barbarian warrior, they are low enough not to aggro. For a level 55+ iksar rogue, they are good enough to kill him!!<BR>
I don't quite understand. Are you saying that the shadowmen don't attack the barbarian but do attack the iksar? <BR>
<BR>
gt;gt;gt;In addition to this problem, there's the super long casting time of 30 seconds. If Verant wants the potion to cast longer than a similar spell, why is there a Cazic potion that casts almost instantly?<BR>
<BR>
I assume you are speaking of the lizard blood. That is an item that is adventured for, and as such, such items are typically better than those that can be crafted. The casting time on the alchemy gate spells is to ensure that they don't become an instant escape spell, but rather one used for travel. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, it's possible that we should consider reducing the time, as I imagine that few would be willing to pay for creation fo the potion merely for travel. Does anyone know off the top of their head how much those potions cost to make (best case scenario)? <BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="/role and the who list">/role and the who list</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/03/00 15:24 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I'm really looking forward to this change.  Sometimes you just want to go /role, but can't, because your guild won't know if you are on or not, without doing a /who all -playername-</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I dont know if anyone noticed, but unlike the patch msg announced, people who are in /roleplay do NOT show up on /who GUILD all. I dont want to sound offensive, but maybe you guys should double or triple check patch content to make sure everything is there?<BR>
Yeah, you have a point  I sincerely apologize for announcing a patch change that didn't take place. As it turns out, one file necessary for the /who all "guild" to work on /roleplayers wasn't included in the patch package. It will be in the next one.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why Do Paladins Get One Class Weapon In Kunark While Other Hybrids Get 9 for 50+<BR>
I think that you have some valid points, however the idea when Kunark items were being created, there was actually a shortage of weapons for the other two classes to my knowledge, and that's what was addressed. You do make a good point about the WAR/PAL 1H weapons being designed with dual wield in mind. <BR>
<BR>
That said, it is possible that things swung too far in the other direction. I'll bring the issue up with the designers.<BR>
