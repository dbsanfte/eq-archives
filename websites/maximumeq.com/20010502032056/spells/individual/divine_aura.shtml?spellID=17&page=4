<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>This spell has saved my life countless times.  I used it against Cazic Thule once and survived his pummeling for 18 seconds.  Deathtouch gets through this spell, but his quad 400s don't.  <BR>
<BR>
I keep this spell and Divine Barrier memmed always, but post-50 they only delay the inevitable, unless I am close to a zone line.  The only drawback to this spell is that I can't heal anyone while it is up, and if I have to go invulnerable, the rest of the party is probably in big trouble too.  Such is the nature of post-50 dungeon crawling.<BR>
<BR>
Advantages:<BR>
<BR>
1) Invulnerable for 18 seconds.  Keeps you alive for the run to the zone or to guards, or buys time for the tanks to taunt something off you, or they might just kill it before you become vulnerable again.<BR>
2) De-taunts the MOB if you are in a group, unless you are very low in health.<BR>
3) Buys you some time to think of a way out of a situation.<BR>
4) Allows you plenty of time to change your memorized spells while under attack.<BR>
5) An excellent aid during dueling, for you can put it up and watch that wizard mana-dump on you to no effect.<BR>
6) The party can become aware you are in trouble in 18 seconds, and form a plan to save you (Lay Hands, for instance).<BR>
7) While the MOB is trying to kill you, the rest of the party is taking no damage.  18 seconds of uber-tanking, if necessary.  (I was once summoned by Nagafen, went invulnerable, and just walked away.)<BR>
8) You can fall any distance (within 18 seconds) and suffer no damage at all.<BR>
9) If you want to heroically die for your party, throw an area of effect blast and then go invulnerable.  The party will be able to escape easily.  They will toast your memory.<BR>
<BR>
Disadvantages:<BR>
1) No one can heal you or evac you, so you MUST let the party know you are invulnerable.  It is a bit sickening to watch your entire party evac out, leaving you to the tender mercies of the MOBs left behind.<BR>
2) You can be stunned.  Verant put this feature in intentionally, so it will never change.<BR>
3) You can't help anyone else while this is up.  In 18 seconds post-50 you can watch in horror as your entire party dies.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>nice conclusion ya got up there. tho a lvl55 pally gets a lvl1 cleric spell, yikes!!!  i mean YIKES!  rarely see the clerics using this spell, they must don't realize how USEFUL this spell is.  imagine a cleric soloing a yellow or red con a lvl30.  don't laugh, i belive it can be done easily if you know how to use this spell efficiently.  first root, caste the spell on yourself, tank, back up, caste again tank, tank, root again... and so on.  takes a bit longer to kill it, though there is very little chance that you get killed.  casting time is ONLY 1sec and i don't think you are unlucky enough to be interupted when casting it.  when running, caste it, root, then run :)<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>For those who don't think this spell is worth the mana to cast, a word of warning - As a melee type, trying to pull a mob off ya sure would be a lot easier if they couldn't hit ya. It is a sad fact that sometime, somewhere, somehow, something WILL go wrong. At that time it would be so much easier if the cleric was hiding behind this spell so the other group members could try and save him/her from death. For whatever reason I have had a mob take a serious liking in my cleric buddy and no matter how much damage I was dishing out they were just so dang focused on killing the little bugger until I could finally show them to their own grave. Please rethink the use of this spell. </font></td></tr></table>
