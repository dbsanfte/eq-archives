Hopefully this breif highlights segment by Abashi this week will mean that he will begin doing this every week.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
I thought I'd bring a quick list of some things decided in today's tuning meeting. There's not much information here besides what I'll list, but please feel free to comment:<BR><BR>

<ul>
<li> Concerning Nagafen and Vox: We're looking into a way to keep Nagafen and Vox as reasonable encounters for the high-30s-50s characters without having the high 50s+ killing them constantly with little opposition. 
<li> We'll be extending the "Rez-for-XP" window from 2 hours to 3 hours in light of size and difficulty of some of the new zones.
<li> VZ/TZ move: See other thread.
<li> We're looking at a way to stop players from bypassing the need for a rogue by using an NPC to open pickable doors. In other words, make friends with your local rogue  
<li> Poison update is expected on Test next week.
<li> "Jolt" will have its casting time lowered.
<li> The Hole is expected to go live this week.
</ul>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Donal's vambraces of mourning nerf">Donal's vambraces of mourning nerf</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/20/00 10:44 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>For those who don't know (probably because it's a fairly rare item), the casting time on the vambraces was doubled.<BR><BR>

As a cleric, I never would have found this useful (many clerics use resolution as a replacement for Greater Heal when they reach level 44), mainly because there is always someone in the party that has a higher level HP/AC buff that screws the whole works up :).</font></p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd like to know why the cleric arms from the Ostiary in the library in Sebilis were nerfed, without any warning. These arms had the effect of Valor, which could be cast every 6 seconds. After the patch last week, they now take twice as long to cast, which in essence has rendered them useless, since Remedy and Superior Heal can be cast much faster with great hp return, even tho they cost mana and the arms do not. These were one of the nicest cleric pieces in the game, and like everything else that proves useful to a class, wound up getting nerfed and made useless without warning or explanation.<BR>
</font>
First, I apologize for the fact that this wasn't listed in the patch message.<BR>
<BR>
As for why they were changed, as you mentioned, use of the arms for the purpose of healing rather than for the "buff" that it gave was the primary motivation. The fact that that whole series increases current hitpoints in addition to max hitpoints was based on it being balanced by mana usage. Since the arms do not use mana, the casting-time becomes the entire cost. A cost of six seconds was too low for what it granted.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Friends list to get no increase">Friends list to get no increase</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/20/00 10:41 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I'm curious to know just what this "technical" reason is.  The only plausible reason I can think of is that more than 20 would put too great a strain on the world server for each "server" as each friend is probably an individual "/ all friendname" command.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;20 friends just isn't enough for a happy-go-lucky flesh-pressing baby-kissing ogre warrior like myself. What is the status on increasing the size of the /friend list?<BR>
</font>
We've had to back-burner (postpone indefinitely) any plans to due this due to some technical issues. If we take it up actively again in the future I'll be sure to let everyone know.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Caster loot or the lack thereof">Caster loot or the lack thereof</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 06/20/00 10:34 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I've always thought EQ could use a lot more variety of equipment that are all at the same level.  It would at least give individuality.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>I guess that one of the situations is that things that are considered "good" caster loot aren't very diverse. Int casters want int, and that's it. Wis casters want wis, and that's it. Now, since the int/wis softcaps weren't changed in regards to Kunark, a lot of people are running around right up against 200 points. There's only so much more that can be done with them. <BR>
Melee characters on the other hand need weapons, AC, and every other stat they can get. As a caster, I really don't care about AC items that I can get, since if I get hit I'm dead anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Basically, one of the cool things about being a melee class is that more options are open to you in regards to equipment. I think that casters will always be at a disadvantage in this area.<BR>
