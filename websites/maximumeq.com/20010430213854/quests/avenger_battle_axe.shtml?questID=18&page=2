Its a pain and will take 200 bandages but that is what ya do.  Slaythe is tough, i think tougher than faldor in the fight.  The problem of this whole quest is faldor.  Expect a LONG wait for his spawn. I have been lucky, walked in and killed him, and not so lucky, sat there 5 hours with nothing to do but learn to cook and work on heading sense... 8) <BR>

Its a good weapon until you can get a LoW.  <BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>i'm aeroth (no last name yet) of the mithanial marr server, here with a few words about the avenger battle axe quest.<BR>
frist i'll start witht he beno problem with him telling you to kill the rats don't waste your time they are a fairly slow one at a time spawn and it'll take several tries to even get the clockwork rat to sawn anyway.<BR>
beno also tells you to do somthing for the master. this sia good thing as t took me only one try through it to get beno to talk about the quest and it only took me about 10 maybe 15 minutes to do it however i can't remember what he told me to do, sorry.<BR>
once beno gives you the letter take it to the jail clerk in HK and just give it to her she'll in turn give you the cracked emerald container.<BR>
now coms the bronin problem. bronin is a punk and hard to have good enough faction with him to get the trigger, however if you are grouped with an enchanter then you wil more than  likely be able to get the enchanter to trigger his spawn. if your faction is only indifferent then you will not trigger the spawn HOWEVER you can turn the frogleg in to bronin once you get slaythe killed and he WILL giv eyou the key to take to the HK banker. and the banker WILL give you the shard half.  if for some reason bronin tells you to kill the goblins just go to the goblin camps and kill them for a while.<BR>
this brings you faldor.<BR>
i tried last night to camp faldor henrys in qeynos.  so far as the triggering his spawn goes there is now triggering his spawn it's a simple matter of sit in the room at the table and wait for him. in the mean time you might do like i did and work on your fletching or other skills that don't require moving around much, tunare knows you'll be thinking about the snickers comercials.

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Hey gang.  I did this quest with my level 20 Druid last night.  I did the quest to get the axe for my level 10 warrior.  I had no real problems with the quest.  The whole thing took me about 5 hours or so.  Everything was pretty easy.  I had to give almost 300 bandages to Joogl Honeybugger to get my faction high enough to get Bronin to activiate the spawn of Slaythe.  I found a lvl 30 druid for back up which was good cause Slaythe was white.  I could have kited him and killed him alone but it was much easier with someone healing me.<BR>
<BR>
I sat in Qeynos for several hours until I got a guild member in Dagnor's Cauldron to talk to Elmion, Faldor's brother.  Faldor spawned about 45 minutes later.  (Coincidence?  I dont' know.)  This time I had  a level 12 Ranger with me.  He beat on Faldor (who was high blue to me) while I blasted him.  I gave the Ranger a Shiny Brass Shield for helping.  It was a long wait but felt great when I finally got the shield.<BR>
<BR>
I gave it to my warrior who is hitting for 29 with it.  I was hitting for 24 with a dwarven 2 hander which I gave to a level 5 paladin.  She was a high elf and looked nice so I figured what the heck!  I plan on using this axe until I can get my hands on an Executioner's Axe which should be quite some time down the road.  I think this axe will be great up into my 20's.<BR>
<BR>
If any warriors who are to young to do this quest and play on Karana, give me a tell or e-mail me (akazanar@yahoo.com).  We can agree on a price and I'll do the quest for you.<BR>
