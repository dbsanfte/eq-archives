<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>I just want to say having completed this quest.... it is a really well made quest.  It doesn't require any killing. It doesn't require long camps.  It requires stealth and cunning.  And it definately possible for anyone in their 20's!  All I have to say is this.... be prepared to die! LOL!<BR>
<BR>
I have a few tips based on some of the hard parts of the quest.  <BR>
<BR>
In Lower Guk, I tried that invis vs undead potion thing, and it didnt work for me.  There are live monsters in there too.... and if one of those live monsters see's you and hits you, the invis vs undead will go away, and you'll have a train on you in seconds... this happpened to me, and I had a corpse in the middle of lower guk with no way to get to it.  So here is what I did.  I recommend this to anyone:  There are a lot of VERY high lvl people in there that know the level pretty well.  I asked someone to drag my corpse to the hand room and get me a rez.  The hand room is almost always camped.  And all high level groups have a cleric (unless they are crazy.. hehe).<BR>
<BR>
Anyway... so i would recommend enlisting the help of a nice person right when you go into Lower Guk.  If you get it, just simply kill yourself and have them drag your corpse to the hand room and get a exp rez.  Pick up the rod and gate out.<BR>
<BR>
I also had some trouble getting the rods in Oasis and Lake rathe.  Its wierd... sometimes the aqua-gobs can see through INVIS... sometimes no.  Honestly, i was able to find no way to to infiltrate the underwater towers without getting caught by those goblins.  The towers are two stories high, with 2 gobs on the bottom and 2 on the top floor.  They cast spells and hit REALLY hard.  I found that the easist way to do it was the suidcide mission way.  Just rush in and put the rod in your inventory before they kill you in three seconds.  Then just go and drag your corpse out of there from a distance.  When i had invis on, they saw right through it. =(  I would reccomend getting a water stone, and scoping out the tower.  Use your gaze spell to see if you can locate the rod from a distance.  Just kick back from a distance and watch the gobs and get a feel for the surroundings.... and once you are totally sure you know the location of the rod, and you are comfortable with your surroundings... rush in and take what is yours (and prepare to die in the process).  As far as I am concerned, death is unavoidable on this part of the quest (at least at lv 27 it is).<BR>
<BR>
Aside from these three parts, the rest of the quest should be pretty easy.  Refer to the walk through on Graffe.com for the shark part in Erud's Crossing. </font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Just finished the quest tonight. Started it at about 6pm ended at about 2am. Hardest part of quest is deffinatly the rod located in hand room of L Guk. I had never hardly been in guk. Had a 49 ranger in U Guk show me how to get to L Guk. Then had a 51 SK invis vs Undead and show me how to get there while a mob of 50's killed the hand. I swam up the shaft to an empty room and there it was. As far as everyone hype around the rod located in Erud's Crossing. I brought my bestest friend Hilen "36 shammy" with me he got me all buffed up and ready to die =)well i casted invis and levitate went out to the location of th rod that is posted on www.gaffe.com "great walk through by the way" swam down picked it up and boom it was that easy. now i dont know if i was just lucky or what but thats what happened for me. And as far as the goblins in Oasis and Lake rathe THEY DO NOT SEE INVIS!! you will need enduring breath for lake rathe AND  Everfrost!!! one thing on Gaffe.com said you may not need enduring breath for the one in everfrost. Trust me my swimming is at 163 YOU NEED IT!! the only time i died during the entire quest is while gasping for air thinking oh i can make it!! Anyways after you gt to the little house all 3 of the goblins in there were very green to me at 36 so i just let them bounce off my steelskin while i too k the rod and gated out. the rest of the quest is very easy if you know your way around. just takes time, patience and a little or a lot of luck =) sorry if my spelling is horrid its like 3:30am and time for beddy.. GOOD LUCK YOU CAN DO IT!!<BR>
