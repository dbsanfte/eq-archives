So I'm looking through all the nice items new items found in the hole and i began to wonder. Was this zone designed intentionally for pure spellcasters? As it seems that just about everything coming out of the hole would appeal to purecasters and those wanting to twink pure casters. Bah- just a thought, but i say this is some really nice spellcaster armor. INT will now be Very easy to breech 200...and most the Loam items add mana also...hey those Necro playing people at Verant didnt have anything to do with this did they???<BR>

Back to reason i am posting this.<BR>
<BR>
1. This cloak blows goats i have a kunzar cloak which is from kunark and is ac7 +2int +2wis +5fire resist and i would MUCH rather have it then this piece of crap<BR>
<BR>
2. maybe the reason the hole is all caster loot is to make up for the VAST amount of tank loot in kunark. i mean you guys get another full set of armor and weapons that drop off of almost every monster. we get 5 or 6 items that are any good. i mean i have been hunting in kunark for 5 levels and i have so many giant and sarnak weapons i could scream. i mean come on let us have the hole.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>In response to Speel's comment earlier that the Amice is the only Loam piece clearly worth getting:<BR>
<BR>
How can you possibly arrive at this conclusion?  Let's evaluate for a moment.  Obviously the most important stat for all pure casters is INT.  However.. the second most important stat is clearly AGI (except for Enchanters which need CHA).<BR>
AGI is the stat that inherently increases your AC and improves the effectiveness of your defensive skills (Dodge, Defense, etc.)  Virtually all of the Loam armor pieces give major bonuses to AGI, as well as decent bonuses to INT, and even more importantly mana.<BR>
Not to mention the huge bonuses you get to CHA for most of the pieces, which makes them even more beneficial to Enchanters.  After checking the stats on this armor and comparing it to other available pieces, I have come up with the following:<BR>
<BR>
The Amice, and Leggings are clearly the best available period for pure casters. (and this includes all planes gear.. etc)<BR>
The Arms are the best available except for planes gear.<BR>
The Cloak is best available for Enchanters, and probably the second best for all other casters (after the quested Mystic cloak).<BR>
The Shoes are arguably best available for enchanters, and probably second only to cryosilk (planes shoes), and GE boots for the other classes.<BR>
The Cap is second only to planes gear for enchanters, and second to planes gear and the runed cowl for the other classes.<BR>
The veil granted is sub par at best.. there are much better veils.  And the bracers are only fairly useful to enchanters (although golden chitten is likely still better even for them).<BR>
<BR>
Clearly, this armor kicks butt and should demand very high premiums in trade and sale for those that can't use it.</font></td></tr></table>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Ok nowhere in my post did i say that the amice was the only piece that was any good. What i said was : the only piece "I" would want.<BR>
i also stated that "I" would not want this piece of crap.<BR>
<BR>
You said agil helps AC are you out of you skull i am a goddamn magician i have a pet which has all the ac i need and besides i give up two ac from putting this thing on.<BR>
<BR>
i never sadi that the other peices were not better then the existing things but by your own admission they would require a hefty trade or price which i cannot afford at this time. i could however make a nice trade for the only piece i really want and thats the amice. <BR>
<BR>
sorry if my OPINIONS contradict yours but you tried to attack me with facts which had no relation to anything. you cannot attack a persons opinion with facts. if i say this thing IMO sucks, what right do you have to tell me i am wrong?<BR>
<BR>
sure the sleeves would be nice but i have gator and don't feel like investing a large amount of money for them when gator sleeves are not much worse. the legs? Bah i care not for legs silversilk gives me agil remember your precious agil?<BR>
<BR>
Here is a concrete fact you can argue with me till you are blue in the face the ONLY piece worth BUYING is the amice.<BR>
the other s are nice if you can loot them but who has the money to upgrade to loam which isn't much better? and if they have the money to BUY all of the pieces they are probly in the planes and getting cryosilk which IS better. <BR>
<BR>
Damn that was long<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Just a quick comparison here for everyone:<BR>
<BR>
"Legs, bah who needs legs, I have silversilk", "by the time you could get them you'll be able to get Cryosilk on the planes which is better."<BR>
<BR>
Let's see here.. Cryosilk legs -- Don't Exist!<BR>
There are 4 different pairs of leggings available on the planes, one for each caster class.  The stats and names follow:<BR>
<BR>
Magician - Apothic Kilt - ac 5 / 5 str / 10 sv cold / 25 hps<BR>
Necro - Blighted Trousers - ac 5 / 3 str / 4 dex / 10 sv cold / 10 hps<BR>
Enchanter - Insideous Pantaloons - ac 5 / 3 str / 3 cha / 10 sv cold / 15 hps<BR>
Wizard - Carmine Pants - ac 5 / 3 str / 3 sta / 10 sv cold / 15 hps<BR>
<BR>
and the already mentioned Silversilk.. probably the only other piece worth mentioning<BR>
ac 4 / 4 agi / 12 hps<BR>
<BR>
Now then, we have Loam Encrusted Pantaloons:<BR>
ac 5 / 8 agi / 3 int / 10 sv disease / 10 hps / 5 mana<BR>
<BR>
I think it's pretty obvious here which is best.. by a long shot.  Even considering what's available on the planes.<BR>
<BR>
Granted, wheather or not they are worth paying for I guess all depends on individual preference and available resourses.  But that doesn't change the fact that Loam is the best.</font></td></tr></table>
