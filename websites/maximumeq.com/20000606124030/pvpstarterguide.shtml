                    person who plays on a Player vs Player server sent us in this PvP Starter Guide.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy!</font><u><b><p></b><strong><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Rallos
                    Zek</font></strong></u></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">This is intended as a guide to players new to the
                    Rallos Zek server. Although I&#146;m a newbie to Everquest my character is now approaching
                    8<sup>th</sup> level and I suspect I&#146;m no longer quite as easy a target as I used to
                    be ! The primary reason for writing this was that having read much of the advice from
                    experienced Everquest players it strikes me that a lot of that advice was less useful on
                    Rallos Zek.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Rallos Zek is a player versus player server. Therein
                    lies the problem. There aren&#146;t that many places where you are really safe from attack
                    by another player. Despite this there are a number of methods that help you survive . </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Firstly as a newbie get to know your way around your
                    hometown and as normal establish yourself with a Guild if possible. This is no different
                    to normal play but getting used to the locations in the City is more important than usual.
                    Pay close attention to where the Guards are located and don&#146;t anger them. When all
                    else fails they may be your only friends. For that reason I try to keep my faction fairly
                    high with them. Always remember that the most dangerous creatures out there are other
                    players.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Once you are ready for a spot of adventuring make
                    your way to one of the City Gates. I tend now to approach these with some care. Use of the
                    Who button will at least get you familiar with those who are online. As you get to know
                    people you will be able to better discriminate who are player killers . That might not be
                    obvious at first but you should get better informed as you become more experienced.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">You will see from the Who button that virtually
                    no-one is listed as anything other than Anonymous. The only exceptions to this are those
                    who want to advertise they are very powerful indeed , and those who don&#146;t know how to
                    change it with the General button. Make sure you don&#146;t advertise your class, level
                    etc otherwise you will definitely attract some company.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Make sure you have selected Run rather than Walk. I
                    can&#146;t see any slow moving newbies lasting long to be truthful. It also advertises
                    that you don&#146;t know what you are doing .</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">It is also worth looking around and seeing who is
                    out there. More particularly see what they are up to. Those hunting are probably less of a
                    threat to you ( maybe ). Anyone loitering around for no apparent reason might be more of a
                    threat. Even at this early stage I would pay attention to what Guilds players belong to.
                    You should be able to recognise player killer Guilds soon enough. Just as importantly you
                    should soon be able to recognise those Guilds that are Anti Player Killers. It is well
                    worth talking to those who are from Anti Player Killer Guilds . ( Make sure its by way of
                    telling ) Some will be happy to hunt player killers down, others might reward you with
                    items or buffs . </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">I would advise soon getting into the habit of
                    considering most of those around you . At first they will likely all consider red. However
                    it is good practice to establish as soon as possible who is a real threat to you.
                    Admittedly at first that is everyone . </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Those who are newbies too are worth talking to. At
                    later levels they may be your friends . establishing at an early stage who to trust is
                    important.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">At later levels you should also keep an eye on what
                    people are hunting . That sometimes helps differentiate their level and class. Usually by
                    now someone will have been over to check what you&#146;re equipped with. You will be
                    warned that they are doing this. It is worth knowing that the typical reason behind this
                    inspection will be to establish what loot they will get for killing you !</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">On occasions though it will be so a high level
                    player can pass you something they don&#146;t want.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Whatever it is you do want it even if only to sell
                    it !</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The subject of what to carry is a difficult one. At
                    first you are so easy to kill that even if someone just wanted your Guild tunic you
                    wouldn&#146;t last long. My advice would be not to go out adventuring carrying anything
                    much , and expect to lose whatever you are carrying. To that end the bank is well worth
                    using to store items you want to preserve. Later on you&#146;ll be better able to protect
                    them. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">As soon as you can , invest in a bag. Basically
                    anything contained in a bag can&#146;t be looted from your corpse. Your normal line of
                    defence when under attack should be to run towards the Guards as soon as possible. If that
                    should fail then bag up whatever you want to keep before you die. This tactic tends to
                    work better when you can afford a bag ( obviously ) and when your character can stand
                    combat for more than a few hits. Bagging items in combat isn&#146;t easy so I would
                    recommend practicing it.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">If you really feel threatened I&#146;d recommend
                    bagging items just as a precaution.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">The running whenever attacked seems to work for me
                    and I have to confess to never having been player killed. However there are methods of
                    making it more effective. For a start get really used to your surroundings. This is
                    obvious advice but if you get lost on your way back you will never make it back. I tend to
                    look fully round before attacking anything. It gives you an idea of what other creatures
                    will be on their way to assist the one you are attacking . It lets you know who is
                    stalking you , but most important of all it familiarises you with your escape route. The
                    weather and visibility can change almost instantly. Knowing your exact surroundings will
                    help you get back when the rain hits. Times when running won&#146;t work are if you get
                    caught by a root spell ( in which case you&#146;ll need that bag ) or if you get cornered.
                    Oddly enough most of the Inns etc found outside the main Towns are especially dangerous.
                    The Guards and occupants don&#146;t often help out while there is usually only one way
                    out&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">As usual consider everything before attacking it ,
                    even the same type of creature can vary a good deal in strength. If you get into trouble
                    my advice would still be to run at an early stage. If you wait and win chances are another
                    player will finish off an easy target. This is the complete opposite of how you might play
                    on another server , but is sound advice. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Once you have made your first kill it&#146;s
                    tempting to immediately loot , again I&#146;d still advise at least looking around first.
                    In more difficult areas I have to admit to not looting at all , just getting back to a
                    safe area as soon as possible. If visibility is poor for whatever reason, or you
                    don&#146;t have night vision it is sometimes worth not looting in any case . Fire Beetles
                    in particular will remain as Navigation Beacons if left unlooted. Any strategy that helps
                    you return to base after hunting is worth adopting.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Once you have repeated this enough times you should
                    fairly rapidly gain in levels. That doesn&#146;t mean that the methods that worked for you
                    as a newbie don&#146;t work now. There will always be more powerful player killers out
                    there . As a higher level target they would also assume that you will be carrying more
                    valuables and even magic items. As you venture further out my advice would be to remain
                    cautious still . Rather than running for the Guards ( there probably won&#146;t be any )
                    make sure you know how to reach the nearest zone. From that zone of course you will need
                    to know how to reach those Guards if your attacker is persistent. Player Killers are more
                    likely to succeed if you panic under attack. Having an escape route already planned will
                    help you flee without panic.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">At higher levels it also often pays to group.
                    However you will invariably be better off grouping with anyone you know and trust,
                    preferably someone you recognise from those early forays when you should have been noting
                    who wasn&#146;t a player killer. Groups offer some protection from player killers but
                    should not relax their guard. If low on mana and health after tackling a difficult target
                    they are still vulnerable to attack. Although for best efficiency you might want a smaller
                    group the larger one&#146;s are much less vulnerable to attack by another player. Again
                    this is contrary to how you might play on a standard server.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">There will inevitably be times when an all out war
                    is raging at the city gates. That advice to approach the gates with care still remains .
                    Even now I see players stroll out into a major conflict without realising what they have
                    got into. A major conflict or a very aggressive local guild might seem to threaten your
                    enjoyment of the game. However if you cater for that eventuality it is at least less
                    frustrating. For a start I would recommend investing in some trade skill or other as soon
                    as possible. Basically find something useful to do without going outside at all. If it
                    really isn&#146;t safe to venture out practice swimming or fishing , its safer and one day
                    you&#146;ll find them useful. A trade skill allows you to also make some money. There is
                    even the faint possibility that you might enhance your popularity. After all will you be
                    player killed by the character you earlier brewed some mead for ? Using a trade skill to
                    make friends is no bad thing. Other skills such as tailoring are useful for armour etc .
                    When someone loots your patchwork armour you can then at the least easily replace it. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">At an early stage get used to bandaging yourself (
                    F1 to target self ) and invest in bandages. It reduces downtime and you should bear in
                    mind that the periods where you may be able to hunt without interference are limited. If
                    you aren&#146;t equipped with bandages go shopping when it isn&#146;t safe to go out.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">I can&#146;t help the feeling that using all
                    available skills is more useful on Rallos Zek than normal. Most fighting skills don&#146;t
                    need a lot of investment as they automatically increase with combat. The one&#146;s worth
                    thinking about are those oft neglected one&#146;s. Take missile /throwing skills. At
                    higher levels these are recommended to bait a creature that can&#146;t be easily reached
                    for some reason . But on Rallos Zek you can easily get into the situation where it is
                    unsafe to venture far if you have attendant player killers. ( To disrupt you hunting they
                    don&#146;t even need to be that high level )</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">With a missile weapon you should be able to choose
                    the ground you will draw a creature to. Being just a little nearer the Guards can allow
                    you to continue hunting while avoiding too much interference.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Sooner or later you are going to upset a higher
                    level character than your own. The best way to do so is to wade in and support a character
                    who is under attack . Best of all is to kill the player killer to make yourself really
                    popular with the locals. Unfortunately it pays to decide whether its actually worth
                    defending someone who is being attacked . If it attracts unwanted attention to you , and
                    they aren&#146;t really all that bothered where does that leave you ?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">If you do become a target life is going to get
                    interesting . For a start I would immediately assume you will at some stage get killed. A
                    more powerful character will easily do so especially if they pick their moment. You cannot
                    always defend against a really persistent attacker. I tend to bank or bag my valuables
                    just in case. I also try to note at what times that player tends to be online . They can
                    be easily avoided if you know what times they&#146;ll be around. Remember they may even be
                    in a totally different time zone so its worth considering. You can of course move areas
                    completely , which actually isn&#146;t such a bad thing anyway. Make sure you bank
                    everything first and bind yourself to the new area as soon as you get there . If your home
                    town has more than one entrance it is also worth simply trying the other end of town.
                    Usually one area will be quieter than the other.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">Sooner or later you will come up with your own
                    methods and strategies. I have no doubt that the methods I have used will not suit all .
                    However when you are at the stage where you are adopting your own techniques I would argue
                    you are no longer a Newbie.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">As a good example of me remaining cautious I&#146;ll
                    sign off without my character name ! ( I&#146;d be a definite target otherwise )</font></p>
