Giving cleric's the ability to temporarily "bless" an item would be nifty as well, but you know we will never see it.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>If we had a way to allow temporary enchantments to be placed upon specific items, this might be a direction we could go. However we'd have to be espicially careful that enchanters were supplied with similar abilities. While enchantments of a permanent nature, applied via jewelry or through tradeskills with the use of the "thicken mana" series, I think that "blessing" would have to be more of a temporary thing.<BR>
We *could* do blessings of a more permanent nature, less powerful than through enchantments, if we limited the product to someone of the same deity as the cleric. <BR>
<BR>
This is all "wishlist" stuff right now, but we appreciate the ideas.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Abashi said the militia guards were changed from 6 minute spawns to 15 minute spawns in order to allow dungeon grouping to be a viable alternative, so shouldn't the same apply to the Millers?<BR>
They were originally set this low since they are quest NPCs. Of course, since I'm in a "replying to nerf requests" mood today, I'll talk to the guys about either making the Millers a lot tougher, or increasing their spawn time.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Financing alchemy">Financing alchemy</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 07/27/00 14:01 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>A player recently asked why merchants buy back potions created with the alchemy skill for such a low price.  Abashi had this response:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Alchemy is a skill that we want to see financed by dealing with players, not NPCs, which is why NPCs have little use for the fruits of the effort. It's kind of the same situation as with fine-steel, which no one buys off of merchants since they charge so much for it. <BR><BR>
It's one of those things in game to encourage people to deal with each other.

*Chat and Login*<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch contains some new features for the EverQuest chat and login servers.  In addition, it enables support for some international keyboard layouts.  <BR>
<BR>
- Tab again switches between fields in login and registration.<BR>
- #time will display a time/date stamp.<BR>
- #reply will send a private message to the last person to message you.<BR>
- Tab will cycle through the last few people to send you a private message.<BR>
- Rooms may now be closed by staff members. These rooms are in gray, and no one will be able to enter them until a staff member opens them. Attempting to enter a closed room will display a message.<BR>
- EverQuest, including Chat and Login, now supports some international keyboard layouts. Information can be found at http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_keyboard.html. <BR>

<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Item-Reimbursement Policy revisited">Item-Reimbursement Policy revisited</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 07/26/00 10:37 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Just a nice clarification on the new policy.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all, <BR>
I'm sure that most everyone is aware of the new item-reimbursement policy for loss due to bugs. For those that aren't, here's a quick recap:<BR>
<BR>
Our intention is to handle all claims in a timely manner. Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation. Our customers diserve courteous and prompt service, and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive it.<BR>
<BR>
One thing that we should have made clear in the announcement is that unfortunately, this policy is not retroactive, meaning that those who experienced loss prior to the time that the policy was announced (7/18/2000) would not be covered by the new policy. <BR>
<BR>
As mentioned above, we do need to perform due diligence when investigating the claims, and though we will make reimbursements any time that we lack proof of any misconduct, we still need to have that information (backups, logs, etc.) present to perform the search. <BR>
<BR>
