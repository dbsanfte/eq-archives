thanks for looking at the previous post on this issue. But there are still problems here. We worked out from Master Rinmark's (post-itemization speech) what to do next. BUT NOW, it requires Iksar Monks to go talk to the NOW KOS Ogre "The Great Oogwomp" (level 34ish), give him 5gp to summon a Pet, then talk to the Pet. The Ogres are KoS since the Timorous Deep itemization and are apparently Venril Sathir Faction.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Thanks for the heads-up. Oogwamp should be off of that faction in the next patch. I would continue, however, to be wary of his compatriots.<BR>

Tonight, as my group and I were on our way to Dalnir, we decided to take a short cut through Cabilis. So we invised ourselves and strolled past the guards. I was killed lickity-split, while my pals weren't. Wondering why the guards saw through my invis and not the others, we tried a few experiments to find out. Well we found the answer.<BR>
Seems if you invis or camo yourself, then someone else tries to overwrite your invis with one of their own, you are now visible, though the icon remains.<BR>
<BR>
This brings up all sorts of issues (intentional PKing?). I'd like to know if Verant is aware of this bug or not?<BR>
</font><BR>
This is a bug that we are aware of. If anyone casts a buff of any kind on you while you are invis, you are then visible to NPCs even though the icon remains. <BR>
Thank you for bringing it up though, I'll see if I can find out where it is on the to-do list.<BR>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Abashi- Take ten minutes to fix Alchemy prices.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Abashi... ye promised TWICE that ye would get alchemy prices dropped. Please dont put it off AGAIN.<BR>
</font>
Please don't read promises into situations where they haven't been made. I said that we'd *look into* the prices to see if they needed to be lowered, I did not say that they *would* be lowered. <BR>
<BR>
It's still on the plate, and I hope to have an ETA in a few days. And just a note, it's definitely more than a 10 minute process.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The resist rates for the spell is the same as other magic-based spells such as fear, or root. Targets to not get dual saving throws for the spell. It certainly lands more than half the time on low greens assuming that the target isn't immune to magic.<BR>
Personally, I didn't use the spell regularly until the high 30s due to the resists and mana costs. After that it became quite reliable and economical, and I rarely get a resist on a non-immune blue.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Hello all,<BR>
Today we've been brainstorming about what has become known as the PermaMez bug present on the PvP-teams servers. Without going into specifics on how the bug is used, basically, a player can use the interaction between illusions and the mesmerize spell to cause an opponent to be permanently mesmerized. If you play on the PvP Teams servers, you are probably somewhat familiar with this issue.<BR>
<BR>
The issue that makes the bug possible is deeply woven into the fabric of how illusions work, making it something that cannot be addressed directly. Initial ideas (ruled unacceptable) on how to fix this issue included:<BR>
<BR>
1. Turning off illusions entirely on the PvP Teams servers.<BR>
2. Making stun and mez spells invalid in PvP combat.<BR>
3. Making an illusion cause a team-switch. In other words, if a dark elf cast "Illusion: Human", they would become a human in all senses, able to attack and be attacked by people not on the human team.<BR>
4. Making an illusion cause a team-switch, but only for the purpose of Mez and Stun spells. This idea would lead to situations where one person could attack someone who couldn't attack them in return. <BR>
<BR>
The final solution that we've arrived at is the best method that we've thought of to address the issue, and the one that will most likely go live unless someone here can bring something to our attention that we've overlooked. The solution is:<BR>
<BR>
On PvP Teams servers, casting a *non-beneficial spell* upon another *player-character* will result in any active illusion upon the caster, even illusions that have other effects, being canceled. <BR>
<BR>
"Illusion" in this case is defined as any spell effect that makes you look like something different than you actually are. This would include all of the enchanter illusions, as well as spells such as treeform, wolf form, the Call of Bones series, and Item-activated illusions such as the Guise of the Deceiver, etc.<BR>
<BR>
If anyone has any questions or comments on this change, or can think of any issues that make the solution worse than the problem it solves, please post follow-ups in this thread.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks,<BR>
<BR>
