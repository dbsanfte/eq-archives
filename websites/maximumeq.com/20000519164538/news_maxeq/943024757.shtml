<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Feign Death Info. Update">Feign Death Info. Update</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:john@maximumgaming.com">John</a> - 11/17/99 08:36 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>This directly from the patch server.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>Feign Death was recently changed by the Tuning Team to reflect evolving gameplay issues. Since two of the three classes that get Feign Death get it through spells, I thought this might be a good place to explain the changes.<p>

Previously, when you used Feign Death (and assuming you cast the spell successfully or, in the case of the Monk, made your skill roll) hostile monsters would decided that you were dead and wander off. When you later got up, they would still remember that they were angry with you. If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you. If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later. The only way to be absolutely sure that a monster had forgotten about you was to zone.<p>

With our new changes, about a third of the time that you successfully Feign Death, the monster will immediately forget about you, similar to an Enchanter casting Memory Blur. If they do NOT forget about you, they will immediately come after you when you stand up. No more monsters coming back at irregular amounts of time - it should be immediate or not at all.<p>

This is a change - the old way, if you Feigned Death a SINGLE TIME, the monster would ALWAYS remember you. This way, they remember you about two-thirds of the time.
<p>
Using the old Feign Death, you could Feign Death multiple times to try to confuse the monster. After about seven or eight times doing this, most monsters would eventually forget they were mad at you. <p>

With the new Feign Death, if you Feign Death once the monster has about a 65 percent chance of remembering you. Twice and the monster has about a 50 percent chance of remembering you. Four times means about 20 percent, and six times means about 8 percent. This is very similar to the old Feign Death.
<p>
Another addition to the new Feign Death involves a monster "going home." When you Feign Death, most monsters will return to where they were before the fight. If a monster returns to its initial location, it will immediately forget about you greater then 90 percent of the time. Therefore, if you Feign Death and stay down long enough for a monster to "go home," you should be safe when you stand up a majority of the time. If the monster IS still mad at you, it will return immediately, rather then wandering back later at some irregular interval.
<p>
*FEIGN DEATH UPDATE* 
<p>
After further testing and watching these changes on the Live verses the Test Server, we will bechanging Feign Death again on the next patch. 
<p>
New changes will make it so that if the creature is less than level 35, the monster will always forget about you. If the creature greater then level 35, then the monster will use the changes detailed above.

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="EverQuest Breaks The Record">EverQuest Breaks The Record</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:jay@maximumgaming.com">Jay</a> - 10/20/99 23:46 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=1>Verant announced that EverQuest (the massively multiplayer epic game created by <a href="http://www.989studios.com/">989 Studios</a>) has sold more copies than any other online role-playing game.  In just six short months that game has sold more than 225,000 copies!</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=1>989 Studios™, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, announced today that its top-selling online PC title EverQuest® has broken all subscription-based online gaming sales records. 

In only six months, EverQuest has sold more games than any other online role-playing game ever released, with 225,000 units sold and an active subscriber base of more than 150,000 players. 

''EverQuest has changed the traditional lifecycle and sales curve of entertainment software,'' said Kelly Flock, president, 989 Studios. ''What is most impressive is the fact that EverQuest's sales and subscriptions numbers are continuing to grow by the thousands week after week. Frankly, EverQuest is performing more like a blockbuster movie than the usual online computer game.'' 

The allure of EverQuest, which released in February 1999 – and was developed by 989 Studios' PC division, the predecessor of Verant Interactive – involves the game's multitude of expansive adventures and detailed quests that provide a unique interactive storyline that evolves according to a player's decision. Players can choose to begin the game in any of three continents, with more than 70 adventure zones and 12 cities. Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, alliances and politics. 

''EverQuest is way ahead of its time, both technologically and conceptually,'' added Flock. ''Its continual popularity can be attributed to its uniqueness and addictive gameplay, which differs from any other form of personal entertainment, be it books, movies or even videogames. Simply, by transporting the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands of people playing online simultaneously, EverQuest offers gamers an unparalleled immersive social experience.'' 

During peak periods, EverQuest adventurers and dragon slayers can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously. The active global EverQuest subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries throughout the ''real'' world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi Arabia, France and New Zealand. 

<a href="http://www.station.sony.com/">The Station@sony.com</a> is the official provider of EverQuest, with software updates and news about the game, message boards and other community features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for EverQuest's monthly subscription fee of $9.89. </font></p>
