<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Ranger upgrade">Ranger upgrade</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 09/12/00 12:12 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>We'll see just how effective this is in helping rangers, but it will help none the less.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>After a LOT of internal testing, interacting with the community, and major debate, we've decided to upgrade Rangers as follows:<BR>
We will be upping their dodge and parry to near Warrior levels. I don't want to get into specifics yet because we are still fine tuning, but the end result is that a Ranger should be significantly more survivable. <BR>
<BR>
I'm personally happy with the solution because, rather than just increasing defense and making them more Warrior-like, we've upped skills that are more traditionally associated with Rangers (the view that they are nimble, chain-wearing fighters who often avoid attacks).<BR>
<BR>
I'd also like to pre-announce a future goal and policy change:<BR>
<BR>
Soon (we'll announce a date in the future), we're going to completely stop adjusting game balance as it relates to tweaking classes. Recently, we've made more changes than usual due to the level limits being raised from 50 to 60. Soon, however, we're going to come to a point where it stops. <BR>
<BR>
We'll continue to add content (i.e. items, spells, etc.) and game balance will still be tweaked (and will continue to be tweaked as long as we do add content). But class balance changes as a whole will cease.<BR>
<BR>
The Ranger upgrade is part of this. I'd say that hopefullly by early 2001 we'll be done.<BR>
<BR>
Abashi or I will post more on this as we work out the plan in detail internally.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Risk vs. reward in Kunark">Risk vs. reward in Kunark</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 09/12/00 12:10 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Brad posted that the risk vs. reward in Kunark is slighly skewed.  It will be interesting to see where everything ends up.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>As promised, I brought the issue up at the tuning meeting.<BR>
After some discussion, we agreed that risk vs. reward as it relates to quite a few Kunark high level items is not as intended.<BR>
<BR>
The solution will be to move items around, making sure the encounter and difficulty reaching the encounter is more in line with the quality/power of the item(s) obtained.<BR>
<BR>
The solution will NOT be a retroactive upgrade of existing items due to our desire to avoid MUDflation whenever possible.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>FYI, as we are in another rapid growth period (we've never stopped growing, but sometimes it seems to go in spurts), we've put 2 more servers on order.<BR>
At least one will be a split server, possibly both. I don't have launch dates yet, nor will we announce which servers will be split until we get closer to launch.<BR>
<BR>
We'll keep you informed as we get closer to their launch.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your patience,<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Yes, registering Velious will also allow you to exceed level 50 even if you didn't purchase/register Kunark.
