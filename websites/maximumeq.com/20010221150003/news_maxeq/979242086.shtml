<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>I am proud to announce that the first annual Spirit Bound grand auction and trade fair will take place on the Rathe Server this coming Saturday (6th Jan). We have plummed the depths of our collective bank vaults to bring a veritable cornacopia of items for sale to the highest bidder. Bidding prices will start way below the average EC tunnel prices, so come along and you may pick up a bargain!
<br>Items range the mundane, such as banded and bronze armour, to the fantastic such as the Sharkbone Warhammer. Our craft masters will also be available to make wares to order for just the cost of the raw materials, as well as our spell masters who will be available for buffing and healing.
<br>
<br>The event will start at 1PM CST in front of Kaladim in Butcherblock Mountains, and then moving on to the Qeynos Hills at about 3PM CST.
<br>
<br>For more information check out our website (http://spiritbound.cjb.net) or contact myself, Maldari, or Serique in game.
<br>
<br>Come along, share a beer and above all - have fun.

Archery inadvertently changed</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:geoff@go2themax.com">Geoff</a> - 01/03/01 15:40 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Alan mentioned that Archery was mistakenly changed. It will be fixed in the next patch.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>I have noticed that no matter what bow you use or what arrows, you cannot hit for over 90 non-melee damage, non-crit, non-disc/trueshot, non-snared/rooted/moving mobs. This used to NOT be the case, but in the last few days (since the last patch i think) I cannot hit for more than 90 double damage, when I used to be able to hit for more.
<br>
<br>Yes, bow damage was unintentionally capped recently. We'll be changing it back when we patch next.
<br>
<br>The reasoning behind it this mistake is pretty complicated. Basically, there was a damage cap already in place, but it wasn't being used. When we were setting up stuff for the new discipline we activated that cap (that's how it was intended to work when first designed, I guess).
<br>
<br>Basically, we'll be putting it back as it was soon. I'm sorry about the mistake.

<br>
<br>The Plane of Mischief is indeed in place and accessible. It just seems that nobody has found the entrance yet.

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><br>Hello all I'm glad to announce that the Master Elite of Norrath will be hosting a Duel Event on the 25th of January, at 7pm Central 5pm Pacific, at the Arena in Lake Rathe. All persons wishing to compete will have to enter by the 22nd of January. Fee is 15pp per fighter which will be due on the date of the Event at the Entrance of the PvP area at the Arena. The lvl Divisions will be from lvl's 15-19 20-24 25-29 and 30-35 and prize to the winner of each division will be 300pp. And please note this will be a Open Class Fight. And just to clear things up from before. All persons who have entered into the contest and don't pay but wish to fight with others who have entered the contest will be KOS. Others such as Viewers pay nothing..and others that just come to fight others not within the Tourny will be fine. Just if possible please try and stay back a distance from the Fighters in the Contest. Don't want anyone to get mixed up and accidently attacking someone they didn't wish to attack. But if you wish to enter please send either Myself(Miroh), Sanvil, or Hachsell a tell before the 22nd or if you wish to send me an email is fine as well. Good luck all and hope it turns out well.

Read below for the info.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The war was over, but the world of Norrath was scarred. Remains of the vile deeds of the Dark Elves were visible, some a bit more than others... The leader of the Freeport Milita, Sir Lucan D'lere, was converted to a spy, and thus, a minion of Innoruuk. Thursday, when the clock strikes noon, we will have our revenge, and it will be sweet. Let the preparations begin!
<br>OOC: Thursday 4th of Januari, at noon CST, members of "The order of the Black Sun" and "The order of the Black Rose" will take revenge on Sir Lucan. Everyone is invited to join, although 45+ is recommended. If you are a paladin, and wish to acquire your Quest item from him, E-mail me at bart.m@wanadoo.be as soon as you can, and I will put you on the waiting list. But, even if you are NOT a paladin, you are always more than welcome to join. Fun will be had and liquor will flow =) More info: bart.m@wanadoo.be
