<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Hail Fellow Adventurers!<BR>
<BR>
    I have personally retrieved the shard from the portion of the question concerning Slaythe (The Froglok Assasin).  He is on average between levels 19-22 and is of a Monk Type Class.  (He uses some inate ability which encases you in fire.  Area effect also.)  As a level 23 warrior I was able to easily slay him and retrieve the leg to return to Bronin.  I am currently camping Faldor Hendrys in Qeynos and will fill you in on those details later.<BR>
<BR>
    Some of what the above information doesn't tell you is the following:<BR>
<BR>
Bronin is in the southernmost tower along the wall that seperates Misty.  You must have good faction with Deeppockets guild in order for him to cooperate.  If you wish to increase your faction with him without hurting your faction with anyone else...then purchase about 100-200 bandages and (as you are looking away from the zone to RV) follow the wall to the left.  In the corner is a small hut with a guy named Rangl Honeybugger (Or something like that) He claims he was attacked by a swarm of Bixies and needs bandages.  Give him 1 at a time to increase your faction with Deeppockets as well as the city merchants and guards.<BR>
<BR>
After you ask Bronin, "What Small Favor?"  He will tell you that a Froglok assasin has been hired to kill him.  The assasin spawns 20 seconds after you ask Bronin that question.  Simply get down from the tower and run through the gate to the other side of the wall and head for the northernmost corner of the wall.  Right next to the last big tree stump you will see Slaythe.  (I actually did this quest, but I also "Force Spawned" him to help me level hehe)<BR>
<BR>
I hope this helps....take care!<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>The best way to get Faldor to spawn is this. First go to Crow's and camp in the back room. make another char in Kaladim. with this new char go to Dagnor's Cauldorn and find the little camp with the four NPC's. you will find Faldor's Brother there. just pop the question. "Where is Faldor Hendry?". He will tell you where he is but pay no attention to this. Log off and back on with your real char at Qey. I timed it and he spawned within 25 mins. you know the rest. He is around 24 lvl. easy kill for a lvl 27.<BR>

It's a pretty easy quest for a 23 bard, although I've spent many hours waiting for faldor hendrys.  I have made several characters and sent them to Dagnors Cauldron and talked to his brother, then camped and relogged with my bard and waited and waited.  The first time he spawned it took 8 hours, and he still has yet to spawn a second time.  I have spent over 5 hours on 4 seperate occasions waiting for his next spawn, and still nothing (I already sold the first axe).  I did talk to a GM one night when I was extremely frustrated and he said that Faldor was a rare spawn, and didn't have a triggered spawn.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Okay, quick notes for those that haven't done it yet.<BR>
<BR>
1. Beno is in the Dwarven Warrior's guild, in the door, up the stairs to the right. Stormguard faction has to be at least amiable. The Cleaner VII is not needed, just need amiable or better.<BR>
<BR>
2. Slaythe is about 20-22, I didn't fight him, a mage was camping him for the exp, he just let me loot the leg. You don't need good faction to turn in the leg, but he won't spawn if your faction isn't good enough to get Bronin to talk. See the notes before mine for great tips on Bronin and faction. (Gonna try those myself!)<BR>
<BR>
3. Faldor spawns in the back room of Crow's place, next to the secret door to the Rogue's Guild (Oops, wasn't supposed to tell!)  He was high blue to my 26 Druid, but has lousy magic resistance, so he went down surprisingly fast. Oh, don't let him get behind you, he backstabbed me for 85 as I was trying to pull him outta Crow's.  Took me 2 days to find him, he spawned early one morning.<BR>
<BR>
4. The guy looking for the Jailer and Banker, just hand the stuff to 'em.  Make sure you've got the right items, and hand them over.  See the quest description.<BR>
<BR>
5. The Axe is pretty cool, and acts as a lightsource, about equal to a regular lightstone.<BR>
<BR>
Good luck guys.</font></td></tr></table>
