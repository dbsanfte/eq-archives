Getting sit-med at level 35 got rid of this problem, but it was still highly annoying.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font colr="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm just curious about the fact that pressing the keyboard shortcut for a hotkey doesn't work while medding. Is this a bug? You can press the hotkey button with the mouse and that works fine. Is there any chance this could be fixed? My carpal tunnel syndrome is getting worse because of this 8-).<BR>
</font>
Since we allow the buttons to be pressed with the mouse, I'll check with the client programmer to see if we can also allow the key to be pressed as well.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Masterlooters and /autosplit">Masterlooters and /autosplit</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/03/00 13:50 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>I've never completely understood how /autosplit and /split figure out how to give what to whom.<BR><BR></font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;Every day, I get into groups with greedy master looters. When I master, I split after every battle and sometimes short myself just so the group gets an even split (i.e. if I loot 5 pp 4 gp in a group of 6 I /split 6). I just think it's fair.<BR>
</font>
We did the loot items due to the number of complaints about the ninjalooting of rare and expensive items. Coin really doesn't fit this description, so the best suggestion that I can offer is that you only master-loot with people that you trust.<BR>
<BR>
<font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;And yes, /autosplit is terrible. If you have 6 people, and the MOB drops 5 plat, 5 gold, 5 silver, and 5 copper, guess what happens? The looter gets 5 plat, 5 gold, 5 silver, and 5 copper, the other 5 players get NADA (because 5 coins of each type can't be evenly distributed among 6 members).<BR>
</font>
<BR>
This was actually done based upon numerous requests from people playing the game in beta. They got tired of ending up with tons of heavy coin due to the magical splitting of it. If you are masterlooting, autosplit can work very well providing the person doing the final /split is aware that coins are not automatically reduced to even the split. If you are not masterlooting, an extra coin here, one coin less there, isn't a big deal and evens out in the long run.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Level 51+ buffs and twinking">Level 51+ buffs and twinking</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 05/03/00 13:47 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Verant added a way to prevent people from buffing players below level 39 with level 51+ buffs.  Gordon explains why:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>One of the limiting factors on what spells could do before was based upon what it would do if used as a twinking mechanism. The level 49 spells put us right up against this ceiling. When we created the new buffs, we decided to put the cut-off. You can still use your level 49 series on people a ways below you in level.<BR>

Gobaner usually thinks he can solo that red (to him) giant in a multi-mob pull.  Those ultra blob killing thingys don't have the biggest brain pans going :).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><font color="white">
&gt;&gt;&gt;As any seasoned healer will tell you, the F1-F8 keys are a neccessity. Targeting your players with these keys are a must. Since we can heal pets i was wondering if it were possible for clerics to hit the Fkeys twice to target a mage's(or any pet class)pet. I also play a magician and i am able to target myself with F1 and then press F1 again and it targets my pet. I dont think this is to unreasonable a request. It would just make it alot easier to monitor the health of a pet in a group situation. =)<BR>
</font>
It's a good idea, and I'll mention it, but I imagine that this might be a bit difficult to implement at this time. What the F-keys do is client-side, and the client really doesn't know who's pet is who's. <BR>
