<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Oh, quit yer whining. Ye said it yerself, yer a "BACKUP" healer. It's not enough that yer the only folks that can buff movement speed AS WELL AS travel spells. You get offensive spells that clerics cannot (and shouldn't) compete with, you get damage shields, snare, etc etc etc. All of which are extremely useful to a group in a dungeon (if they've got any sense.) Need I go on?<BR>
<BR>
I've played a cleric since Beta 1, and I know my limitations and what I can and can't do. Clerics have one job (unless it's undead) and that's to heal. They don't nuke except under extreme circumstances (ie. nukers OOM and runner is getting away). The can't DOT, they can't snare, they can't DD, and they can't evac. Which are some of the best things to have in a dungeon. Clerics are only needed in those places, yet you can see that druids are just as handy. That's the beauty of having a druid in the party, and I would say that more often than not I group with one for those reasons. My job is to keep the tanks alive and buffed, the druids job is to speed up the process of killing the creatures via damage shields, DOT and DD, control runners with snare, and to get us the hell out of dodge in a pinch.<BR>
<BR>
This it not to mention that druids are designed to be at their strongest in outdoor zones. No, yer not the best dungeon crawler, if ye wanted to solo and do dungeons ye should have been a necro.<BR>
<BR>
To be honest, clerics could have been better rounded post-50. They should have gotten at least a heal slightly better than superior, say 700-800 hp, but with either reduced mana cost or reduced casting time. Why? Because *THATS THEIR SPECIALTY*. Remedy  makes an excellent replacement for greater healing, but I would have though at 59 or 60 we would have gotten a replacement for Superior. The group-heals aren't bad, but the mega-taunt factor makes them a bitch.<BR>
<BR>
Notice the above line of complaints. While I may feel that there is something that would have been better that I could have gotten, I'm not going to sit here and claim that I'm "useless" because I don't have them. Ye gads, I never thought I'd see a class envy post pointed at clerics who are acknowledged as one of, if not the worst solo'ers in the game, and ESPECIALLY not from druids.<BR>
<BR>
Bah, and people wonder why people consider druids the biggest whiners in Norrath. Druids (the bitchy ones, which thankfully I've only encountered and never known) think that because they can do ALMOST everything, that anytime they can't do something that they are screwed. Ye probably think ye should be wearing plate too, don't ye?<BR>
<BR>
Bah, I've babbled enough. Go play yer game and yer class and take advantage of your strengths instead of whining about yer (few) weaknesses.<BR>

I may not like the fact that I suck in dungeons but oh well. I'm the master of the outdoors. and I take full advantage of that. As for clerics not being a solo'ers my 34th Cleric friend sure is able to solo outdoors just fine. You just need to know what you can and can't hunt.<BR>

<td colspan=2 bgcolor="#0000AF"><font color=white>Wow. You guys are pretty off the wall. Its a game. and i think any class in this game can solo if they hunt the right thing. some do it better then others. but if u are a Cleric and want to Solo. Then dont go after a Hill Giant. Go after an Undead Cyclops. =). No one can put a hurting to the Undead like a cleric can. And a Wizard ofcourse and some other casters. but we all know that. And Druids. well the only real advantage i see them having is SoW. Otherwise.., there life isn't easy either. I like Druids and feel that they have some Helpful things they can do indoors. But i also Agree with the fact that they are not damaged. if anything they are probably the one class along with Necros that if they stick outdoors. Can solo for a lifetime. in anycase. lets keep the peace and all Get along.<BR>
