<br><strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Overwritten Buffs">Overwritten Buffs</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/10/00 18:26 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>A cleric recently asked why the druid's buff overwrote his.  Here is the explaination:</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have to tell them NOT to cast SLS while I'm in the group, or they will be hurting, not helping. Shouldn't SLS be cancelled by bravery? Or is there a component of SLS that I don't know that causes it to be stronger? (damage absorption, duration, some non-obvious number, because clearly SLS is inferior when comparing to bravery in hit points).<BR>
The spell hierarchy compares all of the effects of the spell to determine the cases where one spell overwrites another. In this particular case, it sounds like the duration of Skin Like Steel is causing it to overwrite Bravery. <BR>
<BR>
That said, it's not unusual to have to educate other classes that you group with on the capabilities of your class. My character, a necromancer, is sure to remind druids to avoid snare and other casters to refrain from root. Enchanters frequently have to remind all of their party members not to attack the mezed critters. In this case, you may have to remind druids above your level to forget SLS while in your group.<BR>

Personally, what was said is what I thought the EQ community ever wanted to know.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general information as to what the stats do.<BR>
I'm going to post them here.<BR>
<BR>
This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds.<BR>
<BR>
That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than others. <BR>
<BR>
We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, here you go:<BR>
<BR>
DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows<BR>
<BR>
STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills<BR>
<BR>
STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath<BR>
<BR>
INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights<BR>
<BR>
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT.<BR>
<BR>
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular)<BR>
<BR>
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit<BR>

This should make the dungeons a lot more challenging, since not every frog and dog in LGuk and SolB (speaking for the high levels here...) will be dead the second it spawns.  Of course, the same will be true for lowever levels as well :).</font></p>

Brad explained why the price is so high for non-US residents.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>The intent was to give international players an option to get RoK quickly, preferably on or before the 24th, so they could play right away.<BR>
In the past international players have had to wait quite some time to get EQ. <BR>
<BR>
We wanted to give them the option (buy directly, albeit at a high price due to the quick method of shipping, or wait for the boxes to get to the various countries).<BR>
<BR>
The prices are 'high' for two reasons:<BR>
<BR>
1. The shipping is fast so you get it on or around the 24th.<BR>
<BR>
2. We don't do a ton of international shipping and therefore don't have access to big discounts you might find at amazon.com or some such. We basically had to use dhl/ups type methods.<BR>
<BR>
I think we should have been a lot more clear about this, and I apologize for not explaining this stuff and our intent beforehand.<BR>

Yes, this is by design. It is one of the advantages of their large size that offsets the disadvantages. I think that it could be arguable that they should be stunnable while shrunk, but it might be too late to see that if it isn't there already.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Why Are There Zones?">Why Are There Zones?</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 04/08/00 22:45 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>A player recently asked why there are zones in EQ, while there aren't in Asheron's Call.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Massively Multiplayer RPGs have a long development cycle compared to other games, and the graphics engine is the first thing that is designed. Back when development started on EQ, the development team had several goal for operation of the game. For example, they wanted to minimize the effect of internet latency. They also wanted to have each "area" have its own look-and-feel, with its own set of appropriatly placed NPCs. <BR>
At the time, the "Zone" technology was the best technology available to meet the goals of the development team. Of course since then, new technologies have been developed, and though it makes sense that we would take advantage of them in future products, EQ will always have zones. You just can't change graphics engines on the fly post-production.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Who is Verant's fulfillment house?<BR>
We're using a company named Zomax. Their web site is www.zomax.com.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you think the majority of US customers who ordered the expansion yesterday, and chose UPS ground, will receive their update prior to the 24th of April?<BR>
<BR>
All of them should. We've been assured by Zomax that shipping anywhere in the world will take no longer than two weeks.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Why do some people (like myself) not have the "Store" button on the server select screen?<BR>
<BR>
We'll have an email address up soon for those without "Store" buttons. Assuming the email address in your profile is current, you'll most-likely be contacted prior to that.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1- Why dont you put a quantity box that would let you ship more then one expansion at a time (I cant believe zomax couldnt handle that simple thing)?<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunatly that wasn't an option for this product, and we are exploring options for the future, though that doesn't help people right now.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2- Will there be a cheaper, painless way of shipping in the future, like USPS? (even if it would mean people getting the expansion after april 24th)<BR>
<BR>
No other shipping methods are planned for the Expansion product.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Another question: Will the retail box be released to vendors prior to the go-live date?<BR>
<BR>
Retailers will not be able to sell the retail box prior to the launch date.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;The only difference is instead of a city/state, APO is used for the city and AP is used for the state. Currently, I cannot change my billing information to reflect this properly, since only the 50 state abbreviations are listed as a drop down choice. Could you please add AA, AE, and AP to that list?<BR>
<BR>
We can't get anything added to the list at this point, however you can specify an APO/FPO address in the shipping options, and Zomax will handle those by hand.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Will we be able to enter the new zones as soon as we get the CD? Or will the new zones go live on the 24th when the CDs are on the shelf.<BR>
<BR>
You will not be able to access Kunark-related content until they go live on the 24th.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;ok I currently have an active everquest account, but due to certain reasons I can't play the game till may 17th. This means I can't even log in to order the expansion. Will the expansion ordering be available at that date also? Or will I have to buy the full version after a certain date? Also which company is doing the shipping (ups, fed ex...) thanks.<BR>
<BR>
Currently we have no plans of shutting down the ability to order the expansion, however it makes sense that at some time we will. We'll most likely post a patch message at that time to warn people, though I think you'll be fine through mid-May.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;What is the cost of the "RETAIL" package? In the US will I be expected to pay $40 USD or is the "RETAIL" package going to be $16.95 as well?<BR>
<BR>
The cost of the retail package will vary depending on the distributor. I do believe that a couple of web-based distributors are taking pre-orders at present. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I have purchased the expansion, but do not meet the minimum requirement for the computer...yet(come on tax check ). Should I wait to install the expasion? Could I install it but not go to the new continent, or would this crash my game?<BR>
<BR>
You can feel free to execute the registration procedure and do the installation prior to your upgrade, but I'm not able to comment on what will happen should you try to visit the new lands. Bad framerates and graphics problems would probably be likely.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;What I don't understand is *When* we will actually be able to go into kunark?<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Will it be when we get the CD's?<BR>
<BR>
You'll be able to visit Kunark when the zones are opened on the servers. This is scheduled for 4/24.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Just wondering about how many days it will take it to reach Sweden<BR>
<BR>
Zomax assures us that shipping will take no longer than two weeks to reach anywhere.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Would it be at all possible to allow somoene going to the store, buying the full $40 game, no S&H costs or anything, using that code to upgrade the account they already have and keep (or activate if they want) a non-kunark newbie account good for transfering items or whatever? <BR>
<BR>
If you buy the retail version, you can either use the account key to upgrade your current account OR use the account key to create a new Kunark enabled account. Not both.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Also this new account would have the 1 month free that comes with the game. The guide told me this was possible, you seem to be saying its not...if this is the case would it be at all possible to allow it?<BR>
<BR>
Should you choose to use the retail box account key to upgrade your existing account, you would not be eligible for a free month. You will only get a free month of play if you use the retail box account key to create a new account, of course this would leave your current account unable to access Kunark.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;This afternoon, 2 of my guildmates were trading equipment and money, and this guy named Gondain jumped right up between them, and basically STOLE the trade.

He was reported, and the incident was petitioned, not that there is much they can(or will)do about it.....<BR>
We would definitely recommend that everyone verify the name in the trade window to insure that they haven't clicked on the wrong person, as issues like these are pretty much impossible to deal with in code.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>Shadowknights weren't originally slated to get lifetaps. When we decided to enable lifetaps for them, they were too powerful. The increased mana cost was put in at that time. Don't forget that not only are you damaging the target, you are also healing yourself. So if you want to compare the lifetaps to the spells of the ranger and paladin, you have to take both healing and damage into account.<BR>
Lastly, I noticed that you doubled the native listed mana compared to the necro as the SKs cost. The ratio for the SK gets better with each spell. It's not just doubled.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;this may be a pointless topic, but how can clerics ressurect themselfs after they died? its like having your own corpse ressurect you while your dead. anyone agree?<BR>
From a fairness standpoint, we decided to allow this. If we didn't, in single cleric parties, the cleric would be the only one subject to full XP loss on death. <BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is it that when you are inside a cottage, house or building creatures can attack you through the wall even though you cant see them. This basically means in places like East Karana you cant take refuge almost anywhere. Why shouldnt you be able to get in a house and hide w/o a lion invisibly attacking you through the wall? this applies to griffins and other creatures as well. Other buildings in other zones too!<BR>
Not really a bug. In order to reduce the amount of "lag" that can happen due to internet latency, then engine handles object collisions client-side. Most houses and such are objects (rather than world geometry) and are subject to this.<BR>
<BR>
It also has the benefit of eliminating a good number of issues that would have to be dealt with in order to limit possible exploitation. For instance, if this wasn't the case, someone could sit inside a house and cast upon a creature that couldn't fit through the open door.<BR>

Someone asked why they couldn't just download it... Gordon sums up why not well.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a cable modem, and I'm in Canada. Purchasing from you at a reasonable price still puts the cost at almost $40 CDN and I won't get the update for several days after (if not weeks, if it stays at customs). Why can't I pay and get the option to download the client? <BR>
The Ruins of Kunark upgrade is huge. The problem isn't necessarily a problem with *you* downloading it, it's you and the 50K other people that would want to  <BR>
<BR>
Though the amount of bandwidth that we have is immense, it is nonetheless finite.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Thanks for looking into phantom armor. Would it be possible to change the name to "summonedleather/chain/plate" for role playing sake when you rework it? [it would be wonderfull if it wasmade conj as well, butI know it won't happen] <BR>
We still like the 'Phantom' name. The regen component that we are adding to the spells might not fit 'Phantom' too well, but at least it sounds cool.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2) Voicegraft, please? It's a RP spell plain and simple and wouldn't affect balance at all.<BR>
<BR>
I'll mention it to GZ <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;3) The spear of warding / sword of runes lost there procs sometime in jan. Was this intentinal? Any plans to be fixed/replaced?<BR>
<BR>
Talking to one of the item guys about it now. Does it just "not proc", or does it say something like "Item is out of charges"?<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;4) At some point there was a silent change in that damage shields cast on pets do not last 3x as long as on people anymore(which hurts your mana-efficenticy a bit when soloing). I had allways thought that the effect was a bug [as damage shields last forever on most mobs], but a silent nerf like this is still a bit disheartning. Was that the case?<BR>
<BR>
NPCs were treating buff spells differently than PCs. The point was to keep NPCs in cities from constantly casting buffs on everyone and everything. Though this part of the code was maintained, special code was put in so that buffs would wear off of pets at the proper time. We probably should have announced this. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;5) GZ once said that summoned items are no-rent because you don't want them to have unlimited effect with a 1 time mana investment, and that if there was some limit on how much say a sword of runes could be used it would be rentable. Then could all consumable summoned items loose the no-rent flag? Waterstones, ammo, food/water & the ring of flight, come to mind. Pockets, weapons coldstones ect are all fine as no-rent.<BR>
<BR>
We don't have a way to put a time-limit on items, beyond either making them NORENT for the term of a login session, or until you zone, so changing this really isn't an option at this point. It does have the added benefit of requiring that people seek out someone to summon their items every time they log in. Take the dimensional pouch as an example.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;6) Could invis to undead be added to the air elemenatl's invisibilty spell? <BR>
<BR>
I'm sorry, but the ability to be invis to both the living and the dead is and will remain a rogue-only ability.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Best solution : "Voice of Zomm" - Allows a mage to dirrectly order his elementals moves for a period of 30 seconds, just like the eye, only works *only* with an elemental. [Yes, that's a long rant about one insignificant spell. Give a mage 3 ways to cast a spell and they start to think it should be usefull/fun]<BR>
<BR>
Good point, I'll mention it to GZ. I'm not sure if this would be possible with limited coding however.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;8) At what level do focus items begin to affect your elementals?<BR>
<BR>
We leave things like this to the players to figure out. <BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;9) Whas making all the pets delay uniform [after the duel wield patch] intentionial or a bug? Will this be changed?<BR>
<BR>
When we finally allowed them to start dual-wielding, we had to reevaluate the differing attack speeds. We found them to be too powerful overall. Rest assured that your pets are more powerful than they were before since they dual-wield now.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;10) Known bug - Burning out or fire-shielding an invisible elemental often results in it becomeing *permentily* invis.<BR>
<BR>
This must be a real pain for PvP. I'll send this one to the test team to be sure that it is in the database.<BR>

Follow up:<BR>
We found the problem with the Sword of Runes, and it should be fixed the next time we do data. As for the spear of warding, it doesn't have a proc and never has according to our records.<BR>

<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>&gt;&gt;&gt; OK they fixed the melatite problem, so the quests are theoretically doable, but several of the molds are still nigh-impossible to get due mainly to 6 hour + spawns. (undead cyclops and ancille cooks come to mind right now.) Just wondering when they will be fixed, if ever. Thanks! <BR>
There are several spawn-problems associated with the armor of Ro quests. These are scheduled to be patched when we do data next, which I'm hoping (*kneels*, *pleads*) will be early next week.<BR>

I'm very glad that Verant realized that what they were doing was wrong, to spite what the player base said in a poll.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>***ANNOUNCEMENT***<BR>
<BR>
Ok. We put the poll in, and with roughly 15,000 people participating the poll came up with 83% of the people being fine with us running the check for cheating.<BR>
<BR>
DESPITE THIS POLL we have decided that it's the wrong thing to do. Enough people have convinced us that it's chipping away a little too much at people's privacy EVEN if they do consent for us to implement this policy.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, the change to the EULA will read as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Solely for the purpose of patching and updating the Game, you hereby grant us permission to (i) upload Game file information from the Everquest directory and (ii) download Game files to you.<BR>
<BR>
Now, before anyone wonders exactly what this is, let me explain. Technically speaking we probably should have had this language in there from day one for you to consent us to even download new game files to you in the first place. We apologize for not realizing that we should have gotten this consent, but live and learn.<BR>
<BR>
We can admit when we make mistakes, and I believe this is a case where we owe an apology to our Playerbase. In our haste to try and thwart people from damaging the game we went overboard.<BR>
<BR>
There will be absolutely no scanning of anyones computer for any reason other than the normal patching process (which won't do any sort of checking on what you have running).<BR>

Here is some of what we received:

<blockquote>
As a player who has a Ranger as his primary, bravo to Jull, even as a hybrid
I get begs all the time and I see them even more, they disgust me. Can you
post some feedback like mine saying that good players, even those normally
who need to depend on the "support classes" sympathize.
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
I'm not sure if this it the place to send this, but I had something to say on Juul's editorial on courtesy to the support classes.<BR>
<BR>
I play a 16th level warrior on Nameless, and have a few basic rules I live<BR>
by when it comes to getting spells from the "support" classes.<BR><BR>

1) When asking for a spell, be polite, be kind, and make full use of emotes. I also find complete sentences seem to have an increased success rate. No "sow plz" for me.<BR><BR>
2) Always be willing to pay. I have discovered that most often my offer is refused, but it has been made, and made in good faith.
<BR><BR>
3) If you're soloing, make sure you can do it unbuffed. If you NEED a buff to take on a given mob, group.<BR><BR>
4) If the spell has a consumable material component, provide it (or multiple) yourself. Bat wings and fish scales, for example, are not hard to come by. I normally keep a stack around, and if I need a spell, exchange the stack for a casting. In this case, many casters have offered to re-cast for me if I need it.<BR><BR>
5) Always, always, always thank the caster. They have taken time out of their game to assist you. Recognise this. Again, make full use of emotes.<BR>
<BR>
I have found that these rules have allowed me to get pretty much whatever buff I want, and many, many offers of "come back when it wears off." Tanks who simply make demands on their casters give the rest of us a bad name. <BR>
