This is part of a series of questions that originated on the Gameplay forum
on the Official EverQuest web site directed at Brad McQuaid on Sunday April
2, 2000.  Brad offered to try and answer as many of them as he
could.<BR><BR>

<font color=white>What is the high-level view of the current state of the
player run economy: specifically trade skills and their usefulness, and the
affects of twinking on the economy?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Trade skills, by their nature, need to be updated periodically in a
deflationary player run economy (and it is our intent to do those updates).
Twinking is also part of the economy and it accelerates the deflation, but
can still be controlled by adding more to the game (better weapons, harder
monsters, etc.). It can also be controlled to a point with no-drop
items.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What are the current efforts to deal with bug reporting?
I think a bug tracking system with a web front end would go a long way to
easing some tension in the player community. Flaming on the message boards
is out of hand because it is perceived that this is the best conduit for
feedback. I would suggest a bug tracking system that deals with technical
*and* gameplay bugs. (for an example of a similar system see:<BR>
http://bugreport.apple.com)</font><BR>
<BR>
**The combination of the /bug feature as well as in-game player feedback
and feedback from message boards has proved to be very effective in terms
of us finding out about bugs. It's certainly more of a challenge to isolate
and get them all fixed than it is often to identify them.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>If you have been involved in the rogue tuning meetings,
can you comment on poison being added as a one time proc per poison vial
(or whatever form it is going to take) in DD or DoT form, or something
completely different?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I cannot yet announce the inner-workings of our poison upgrade because
we're not done with it.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why do paladins get a quality non planar 1hs weapon
(ghoulbane) mid to low level, and sk's do not? Not enough people playing
sk's to waste the time creating the item? I have heard that a 1hs is going
to be put in for sk's that is of similar quality to gb any eta on
that?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'm not going to address that specifically, but rather just say that all
sorts of class specific weapons are on their way into the game, especially
via the Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>About EverQuest the game. If you had to do it all over
again and start with a clean sheet of paper knowing what you know now, what
would you do differently?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Wow. No way I could answer that in just a few sentences, sorry. I'll say
this - the game is certainly not without its flaws and we plan on making EQ
better and better in the future, whether it be in the form of expansions or
sequels.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I've heard a rumor about a dynamic quest team being
implemented to only run dynamic quests.<BR>
Any truth and if so what type of time frame do you see them
starting?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We already have a team similar to what you describe, and we plan on
adding more people to that team. We definitely want to see more dynamic
quests and events and know our players do to.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are player concerns on Wizards dismissed out of hand?
(too long to go into detail but there are posts 300+ messages
long)</font><BR>
<BR>
**They're not - we've posted several times in regards to those issues, and
even announced that GZ would run some tests after he was done with the
Expansion spell implementation and testing.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>How do you expect Rogues to be a viable class in EQ when
they come with such a horrible group unfriendly skills like PP? </font><BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. They are already a viable class in our opinion. As for
PP, Rogues are Rogues… they're thieves, they're assassins… earning
trust from other players as a Rogue is supposed to be more challenging.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is a "second loot pool" feature for rogue's PP a viable
idea in the future?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, no plans to do that.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is it a bug or a feature that hybrids get less mana per
wis/int from wis/int items than they do from their base wis/int?</font>
<BR>
<BR>
**Don't know - I'll ask Abashi to look into it.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Also, why is it that hybrids get less mana than stated
from mana items? ( i.e., 0-10 mana from a +25 mana item)</font><BR>
<BR>
**See Above.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What do you think of the idea of allowing Shaman to
forage for the herbs used in alchemy instead of purchasing them from a
vendor? Would be a more realistic idea from a role-play standpoint as I
don't think any self respecting Shaman ever bought their herbs at the local
quickie mart.......</font><BR>
<BR>
**Kind of a neat idea - we'll toss it around.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there any plans to make more "crafted" items from the
trade skills needed to complete quests? <BR>
Much like banded is already required for totemic armor, could there be a
quest out there that needs a forged weapon? </font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, but no short term plans.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Druid quests... can we get more? We kind of get tired of
doing class armor quests for the other classes (two edged question there
sorry)</font><BR>
<BR>
**I think you'll see more and more class specific quests in general in the
future.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will hate and fear planes ever be changed to something
more along the lines of air plane or killing the fire giants to allow high
level groups to progress a certain amount based on the time they have
available or will new areas in the expansion be structured in a similar
fashion? examples: safe zone in points, removing roamers from hate so
everything is on the same spawn to allow an even progression through the
zone. After all, almost no-one ever really gets to see or enjoy the zone
except for pullers or scouts. </font><BR>
<BR>
**The planes are supposed to have a different feel and difficulty level
relative to most zones. They are also supposed to often require more of a
time investment from the players.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why is it the stats of the guards throughout Norrath have
not changed to either <BR>
a. more like Paineel guards to stop the High level farming of guard
exp.<BR>
b. guards are made to be casters like clerics and shamans. I would think
twice before I would attack something that could heal and cast blindness
and/or a dot...</font><BR>
<BR>
**We've slowly but surely been upgrading guards for the very reasons you
state.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why is that a lose of equipment due to a hardware
malfunction... i.e. a Crash of the server cause people to wait for weeks to
hope to get the item back and be required to /petition at least 3 times a
week...</font><BR>
<BR>
**It often takes time to verify item loss and to search the logs that we do
have. That said, it shouldn't take as long as you describe and I hope we
can increase the responsiveness of our customer service team in the future
by adding more people.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why is it after spending 1 week in hate (7 days) one
piece of enchanter gear was dropped yet several pieces for the other
classes, yes in the teens. And, how is this fair to even the loot being
dropped per class.</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'm pretty sure we've made some adjustments to Hate recently and that
players on the Test server are reporting things are much better.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I know that every person wants "enhancements" for their
primary class, and this is not regarding any particular class 8o), but why
is it that certain spells do not work in the planes for certain
classes?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Planes are special places, and supposed to offer special challenges as
well as some unique tactics to conquer. We reserve the right to have all
sorts of spells either not work or do strange things in the alternate
planes.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Have we all driven you mad yet with our
inquiries?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'm getting there, thanks J<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can you speak on the possibility of Rallos Zek adopting
the Vallon Zek or Tallon Zek PvP loot rules?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No plans at this point to do that, no.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why do hybrids get an xp penalty if they are balanced
without it?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Hybrids are generally more flexible classes, able to melee as well as
cast spells. In order to maintain balance, we decided to compensate for
their extra flexibility and often power by requiring them more experience
points in order to level.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What are the general pros and cons you have seen with the
implemented EverQuest class system?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I have been and continue to be a huge believer in class systems for
MMORPGs. They encourage interdependence, which leads to a more social
environment - people are heavily encouraged to work together and often
forge friendships and alliances over time. The only con that comes to mind
is that some players appear to be eternally envious of the fact that they
can do some things with their class, but not everything. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>It seems like the good majority of complaints fed to
Verant are related to player's beliefs of perceived class imbalances. Has
it ever made you consider a different way to handle how characters are
defined? Perhaps a more complex method that gives the players more control
over their character while still maintaining game balance?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Perhaps. More flexibility in general is a good thing, but you'll never
play an EverQuest that doesn't have some sort of class based system.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are there so many broken quests in a game called
EverQuest?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. I don't think there are that many. There are some, and
we try to fix them. But we are also constantly adding new content and
quests. With human error, that means we will inevitably add more broken
quests as the game evolves.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why not run 4 dynamic quests all at the same time in 4
remote locations. They would go a lot smoother =P</font><BR>
<BR>
**Great idea. It just requires more manpower (here's hoping that, over
time, given such a successful game, we'll get more).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Good Lord! -- Why are you working on a
Sunday?!?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Heh, good question. I think that even though I know that the vast
majority of players love EQ and that the number of people who bitterly post
on these boards is very small, that it still bugs me to hear false claims
and allegations about Verant and our game. Some people say we don't care,
or that we don't listen, or that we don't respect our customers. I've
always been a person that is bothered by people believing things that
aren't true about me (or my company, whom I represent). I also know that
for every poster there are probably 10 or even 100 'lurkers' who just read
boards, and I know that they appreciate when we post. Heck, whenever I do I
see new names either post or email me, thanking me for the extra info. So I
do what I can, and today it occurred to me to try to answer as many
questions about the game as I could.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Whenever your inventory is full, and you have a stackable
item in there, and you go to loot another stackable item of the same type,
it says your inventory is full. So you have to manually pick it up and
place it there. This is really quite annoying. Any chance of getting it
fixed?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No short term plans, no, but I'd love to see that addressed one day.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why does it take 2 months to patch data? Why is the time
interval in-between data patches (whatever that means) take over a month.
Why is it when a response like "next patch it will be done" really means
"next DATA patch" and not clearly stated "which will happen in over a
month"</font><BR>
<BR>
**It doesn't always, but it certainly does take some time. Patching data
can often be the most dangerous type of patch, because it's so easy to miss
bugs, exploits, and other similar problems. So whenever we add a bunch of
data to the game, we try to test it for a longer period of time. Also,
moving data over from our test environment to the live servers takes more
time than just moving code. Sometimes, when we've had a decent amount of
downtime, for whatever reason, we are hesitant to move data over and have
delayed the process in the past.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Can you give wood elves the /lapdance emotes (yes with
animation)?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Hehe, no comment <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>A Rogue cannot evade when the only other thing attacking
the creature is a pet. Is this intentional? Why isn't the creature
considering the pet a valid target to attack if a Rogue evades?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'm not positive, but I think the skill was intended to work in a group
situation, and that we assume there are other characters attacking the
target.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why aren't most items that have charged effects
rechargeable?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Because having items with charged effects allow us to place items into
the game that would be too powerful were the charges infinite and/or
rechargeable. That said, it does indeed make sense to have some charged
effects items rechargeable and I think you'll see more in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are you ever going to reimplement fear and charm back
into PVP? If not, why?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I sincerely doubt it - the problems both of those spells caused became
such a customer service nightmare that we took them out. And when we
thought long and hard as to how we could re-implement them without creating
additional problems, we couldn't think of a way.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>When will we expect to see new improvements to Tinkering?
Right now there are only a handful of marginally useful items to be made
with it.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Tinkering has a planned upgrade after we get the Poison upgrade in.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will the new zones that you are creating post-ROK look
like the new and improved graphics or will they have to be compatible with
the old graphics engine.</font><BR>
<BR>
**They will have the new and improved graphics.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will the old areas ever be redrawn to take advantage of
better graphics cards.</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, we won't be doing this. We'd have to recreate the old zones from
scratch in order to do this effectively, and we'd rather allocate those
resources (game designers/world builders) to creating new content.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What is being done to stop showeq users and does
Verant/Sony consider using it a violation of copyright laws or any other
laws?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We are occasionally introducing problems for showeq, breaking it with
patches. This typically slows down the distribution of the program, but
we've yet to devise a way to eliminate the program. Overall, it's not
really that detrimental of an advantage to run the program.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Heheh... wonder if Brad is regretting this idea
yet=)</font><BR>
<BR>
**Getting a bit tired, yeah J<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Religion... currently all its good for is getting oneself
killed. Are there any plans to ever give people a benefit to having a
religion? Say, quests limited to people only of a certain religion, for
instance.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Not quests, but we're thinking about making it such that certain items
may only be wielded/used by characters who follow certain god(s).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Does EQ Dev team feel that Magician class is fairly well
balanced in levels 50 - 60? What's magicians role in EQ?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, we feel the Magician is in pretty good shape. For a good description
of the class, please see www.everquest.com<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What is the underlying policy behind a nerf or
enhancement to a class? Is it the "power" of the class? The desirability of
the class (e.g. As expressed by player population)? The dependencies of the
class?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We nerf when we feel it's the best way to address something that isn't
balanced and/or that's not working out the way we'd planned. We don't like
doing nerfs, and realize it is upsetting to some of our players.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>My main concern now is with dependencies. Is it Verant's
intention to balance classes with respect to dependencies? It's good to
have classes that each need each other, but if there are classes that need
others that don't need them, would that be cause for tuning?</font><BR>
<BR>
**In a sense, yes. Interdependence is key to EverQuest and has always been.
Classes should need each other, and some classes should need other classes
more than others (i.e. some race/class combos are better for soloing than
others). This is all by design.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What use does minor illusion have on a non-pvp server
where most mobs see right through it? (don't get me started on how sneaky
and useful it is on a pvp server)</font><BR>
<BR>
**This is probably something GZ should answer.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why doesn't the tree illusion give the same regen effect
that tree form gives to druids?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Another GZ question.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why is it that monks wearing magic gloves can hit magical
creates but a spell caster wearing magical gloves gets the INVULNERABLE
message(this may apply to all other classes...just don't know)?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Monks, being reliant on their fists, are able to use the magic in the
gloves to their advantage.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why can't stealthy classes with high enough sneak
ability, sneak anywhere? Don't we remember that historical Halfling that
burgled a cup from a dragon?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Actually, you could get pretty much anywhere in beta with
sneaking/hiding/invis. We changed it because it was simply unbalanced -
players could map out dangerous areas without risk. I also think the One
Ring that allowed Bilbo to recon Smaug's Lair was probably an artifact
level item J<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is there a possibility of Battle-Mage class or Ogre
Mages(there is an ogre paladin in East Freeport)?</font><BR>
<BR>
**No plans for additional classes, no.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Any chance that ALL ae spells can be given the NON-PARTY
effect like bard songs?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Doubt it, but that's probably one for GZ.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is Verant trying to find a way to adjust the clipping
plane for spells that are suppose to increase sight range? In their current
state these spells are rarely used.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Turns out we'd rather just let everyone see farther if their machines can
handle it.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is Verant considering making Wizards more group friendly.
When I am making a group level 20 and above Wizards are my last pick.
</font><BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. I think Wizards are group friendly.<BR>
<BR>
Will Enchanters get an Illusion Iksar? I hope so.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Can't say, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I know you are sick of this one. Any idea how the Iksar
will fit in on Tallon or Vallon yet?</font><BR>
<BR>
**On the Troll, Ogre, Dark Elf team, those evil bastards! J<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>In your vision, what are Bards supposed to be the masters
of? </font><BR>
<BR>
**Song and dance.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will reported broken quests be repaired? (some have been
broken for months and have been /bug, petition and email
reported)</font><BR>
<BR>
**I certainly hope so, eventually. We fix them all the time.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>To whom do I report game bugs (broken
programming)?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Please use the /bug command.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will reported game bugs be repaired? (some have been
broken since beta and have been /bug, /petition and email
reported)</font><BR>
<BR>
**I certainly hope so, eventually. We fix them all the time.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What will you do to help Melee classes in the expansion?
Items are nice but with all the caster classes getting 20 spells or so do
you think Maybe they will give some new Combat skills or abilities more
than maybe just the 2 that the rumor is. </font><BR>
<BR>
**I can't answer specifically yet, sorry, but we've got some pretty cool
things planned (and in testing now).<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>How much do you plan to have pathing improved for EQ?
Will we ever see a situation where mobs take the most direct route between
point a and point b in an open area rather than zigzagging? If not, will we
see drastically improved pathing in EQ 2.0?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We continue to enhance pathing here and there (we've hopefully fixed one
of the bugs related to disappearing mobs recently). That said, the way
pathing works in general isn't like to change in this incarnation of
EQ.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is it possible to make a command like /bag head arm chest
ect. for pvp servers, this would make it harder of naked pk's to make a
profit pk'ing when people can hotekey all their armor.</font><BR>
<BR>
**We've heard this idea several times, and like it in general. It would,
however, require quite a bit of work to implement and we don't plan on it
short term.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there "legendary item" (aka fiery avenger) yet to be
found via quest?</font><BR>
<BR>
**The Fiery Avenger has been found. There are currently no other FA-type
items in the game for the other classes, but it is our intent to add them
over time.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are some quests only initiated if you hail or talk to a
NPC in his native or non-common languages?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I don't think so, no, but I certainly think that would be cool.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Are there plans to put in Player controlled NPC's for
quests/storyline enhancement? Perhaps they could be attained through a
"guide-like" application system and follow a ongoing script written by
Verant's quest/ history developers. Not guides as they are too busy with
customer complaints.</font><BR>
<BR>
**No plans, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Is anything in the works to explain better the history of
Norrath other than picking up bits and piece's in quests, both on the God
level and within the day-to-day goings-on of Norrath. UO's town criers and
GM controlled in game news boards come to mind.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Those are great ideas, and we hope to do something like that in the
future, time and resources permitting.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Noticing a lot of people are complaining of lag and Zone
disconnects, is it possible this is due to the security elements you have
put in place since you are changing things around often to keep programs
like ShowEQ from working. Seems a lot of these complaints peaked after you
started thwarting programs like ShowEQ and other hack programs.</font><BR>
<BR>
**No, no relationship at all. We wouldn't do anything to stop showeq that
would jeopardize our playerbase.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>When is the next new non-split server going to come up?
</font><BR>
<BR>
**We hope before the Expansion launches - that's the plan, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Kunark: What are you and the team generally shooting for
when you're thinking of moving characters from being able to level from 50
to 60? I.e. comparative power to famous mobs? Would this be considered a
"crowning" level with a very powerful new ability for each, or just an
upgrade of 10 levels?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Probably somewhere in-between. A level 60 player is certainly more
powerful than a level 50 player, so much so that we feel it will be very
attractive to keep playing beyond 50. That said, level 60 players are still
going to get beat on pretty hard in the depths of higher level
dungeons.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>You're going to revamp existing unused dungeons
(Runneyeye, Kerra ridge) so people will go there - what is the basic scheme
in which you plan to go about this?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Primarily more and better loot, some of which may come from existing
dungeons, and some of which might be new.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>I'm concerned that by playing on an older server I'm
going to eventually reach a level where there's nothing I can fight because
everything is camped solid. What is being done about this?</font><BR>
<BR>
**We're launching the Expansion which will increase the size of the world
by over 33%. We are revamping existing dungeons to make them more
attractive. And we intend to keep expanding the world after the
Expansion.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>How's Star Wars Online shaping up? (I suspect we'll be
unable to play Jedi or own/use ships. Any comment?)</font><BR>
<BR>
**Can't say much other than it's going to be an incredible, ground-breaking
game.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will tracking ever be made more useful, and will rangers
ever be able to track better than druids/bards (they currently
cannot)</font><BR>
<BR>
**Yes, but I don't have a time frame.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Will rangers ever become the best at archery, because
currently warriors are better (not including strange new ranger only bows,
but trueshot and raincaller dmg ration is outdone by DW)</font><BR>
<BR>
**I'm not sure this is accurate, but if it is, I think we'd rather that
Rangers be better at archery than other classes, yes.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why do so many quests involve CAMPING for a specific
item? Wouldn't it be easier to make larger quests involving the gathering
of more items, from a wider area with slightly easier drops. That is in the
one to two hour range. Not everyone can play in minimum 8 hour
blocks.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Totally agreed, and that is something we've come to learn over time. Our
plan is to still have rare items in the future, but have obtaining those
items require smaller and more blocks of time.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why can someone do the same quest over 100 times if they
want and still get the item or XP.</font><BR>
<BR>
**Because it slows down the absolute consumption of content, which is very
important for MMORPGs where people plan on playing them for months, even
years, as opposed to just a few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are city guards allowed to be killed, session after
session?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Because they are NPCs, like any other. We have upgraded them recently,
and will continue to do so if necessary, as a deterrent to people farming
them and interfering with newbies.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why are there many people outside of PAW and so few
inside PAW?</font><BR>
<BR>
**I think Paw needs more work, and we will return to it after we revamp
more zones. <BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>What is your stance on TWINKING?</font><BR>
<BR>
**It's both good and bad, sort of a necessary evil. It upsets some players,
yet it increases the replayability of the game significantly. This is one
of those topics, btw, that I could write an essay on - I don't think I can
accurately explain with just a few sentences, sorry.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>Why do casters upon death have access to their SPELLBOOK
and yet a melee does not even get a rusty weapon?</font><BR>
<BR>
**So they can help themselves and other players, both casters and melees,
with corpse retrievals.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>One year after release why are rogue skills STILL so
lacking?</font><BR>
<BR>
**Loaded question. It is our opinion that after we revamp poison that
Rogues will be in pretty good shape. We made numerous enhancements to
Rogues over the last year.<BR>
