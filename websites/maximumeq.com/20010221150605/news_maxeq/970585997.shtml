<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="Short Q&A for rangers">Short Q&A for rangers</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 09/13/00 12:03 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>Someone asked a bunch of questions, mainly ranger related, that Gordon answered.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr width=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1) With the update of parry and dodge for rangers being in 'fine tuning' when can we reasonably expect for it to go live?<BR>
Friday. We postponed the patch for this and a couple of the other issues that we wanted to get in.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2) With the lowering of cast time on jolt to go down, when can we reasonably expect it to go live? Also will it still maintain its high resist rate?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Should be this Friday as well.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;3) How will the implementation of the upgrade to parry and dodge be introduced? I.E. will it just be allowed to progress from its current level or will it be maxed out to your current level? i.e. im level 55 and say dodge is increased to 225 would i expect it to be maxed at 220 for my level or would it begin to work up from its current level.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
The increase in the cap will give you the opportunity to build it naturally. No skills will be auto-accelerated to the cap.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;4) The UI tweaks. Will we have to wait till velious to see them go live?<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Some yes, others no. It turns out that one of the stunning changes that I alluded to earlier this week is one on the Velious plate, so it won't be going live tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;7) Regarding trade skills, would it be possible to actually have a new title at skill 200 such as grandmaster? (seems this would be pretty easy and quick but not of high importance, but im quite sure many of us would appreciate having a title other than master just for self gratification)<BR>
</font>
<BR>
Only if it fits into Rowyl's new UI issues. This is more related to art than "vision".<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;8) Can we get all the gms together and make a rock solid rule regarding some pvp issues that are affecting Rallos Zek server such as what defines corpse camping, bind camping, and when it is allowable to engage a person after killing them.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
If the GMs are going to intervene in these matters at all, I doubt that any rule could be "rock solid". It's all highly subjective in nature.<BR>
<BR>
I'll check into the questions I didn't answer.<BR>
<BR>
