<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>We've just put up a new issue of <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo">Ask Milo</a> here at Everlore. This weeks responses deal with the lack of clothing on some of EQ's female models, bad english skills, suggestions for new models, and many other things discussed. Interesting and entertaining read as always, here's a snip.

    I found it rather interesting that you didn't even bother to comment on the lack of clothing on EverQuest characters. You did             mention that it was in fact a female who pushed for characters to have tight, hard bodies and healthy endowments, but failed to     notice and or comment that it is possible for beautiful people to wear clothing and still be beautiful. I am just a little tired of all the     male teenagers, who obviously have never gotten within ten feet of a real woman, constantly making comments about my             barbarian's *healthy endowment*.<P>
