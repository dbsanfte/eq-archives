Hopefully it gets fixed ASAP.</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2>First off, I apoligize that the /book and /meditate commands are not working properly with this patch. I will try to make sure these things get tested better in the future.<BR>
I fixed the /book command today so that it draws the pages correctly, and takes 1 to 50 instead of 1 to 25 and brings up the proper page.<BR>
<BR>
We deiced to just make it so that when you bring up the book (using /book or the spells button) you will meditate automagically if you have the skill. So I removed the /meditate command.<BR>
<BR>
Regaurding the delays when switch between fullview and normal mode (like when you go to inventory while in fullview), it's related to the new text wrapping stuff and I spoke with the programmer who implemented this stuff about the delays. He is going to check into it. In the long run, this will become a moot point because I am going to change things so you don't switch out of fullview for inventory, right clicks, etc.<BR>

<strong><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2><a name="More on pet names">More on pet names</a></font></strong><br><font face=Arial color=#C0C0C0 size=1>by <a href="mailto:chris@maximumeq.com">Chris</a> - 08/23/00 11:48 EST</font></a><br><font color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana size=2>There are some other tidbits in there too (other than pet names).</font></p>
<p><font face=Arial color=#A0A0A0 size=2><hr wdith=60%>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;1. Why not make all pets be named after the character? NPCs have pets named after the owner. So, if your character name was Merlin and you summoned a pet, the pet would be called Merlin's Pet. It would be MUCH easier to buff player's pets if you knew which pet in the group was theirs.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
There's a little more flavor in this implementation, not to mention, the conversation between people to determine who's pet belongs to whom isn't necessarily a bad thing. Not to mention, it's been this way since release and has worked well. I doubt that we'll change this.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Why do pets owned by PCs (not charmed but summoned) show up on tracking? There is no usefulness to this and they should be filtered out. I know they are treated as NPCs, but that still does not answer my question. Even when you filter out players with "/trackerplayers off" they still show up. I would rather track players than player's pets. PLEASE remove them from tracking and make rangers, bards and druids happy!<BR>
</font>
<BR>
They show up because they are NPCs. Regarding your suggestion of a filter, it's possible that we may implement something like that in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;3. The solution to making the tracking window more efficient is to simply add a scroll bar. A lot of people have said this for quite some time. Filters are not necessary.. just add a scroll bar that will show everything that is in the tracking range of the player.<BR>
</font>
<BR>
We have some things in mind already for tracking, but thanks for the suggestion.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;4. When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes song), chains (level 23 non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target mes song) be fixed? <BR>
</font><BR>
Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we've had some other things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding chains, it's working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is that it doesn't work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn't necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we've determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;5. Why are players allowed to remove coins from the trade window?<BR>
</font><BR>
This is on the list. It amazes me the lengths that people will go through to scam each other. The sheer number of the reports of scams of this nature is astounding. GMs litterally spend 3/4ths of their day dealing with scams.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;7. The Play Nice Policies state that killing green mobs is "Not Playing Nice." <BR>
</font><BR>
No they don't. Check the copy attached to the rules of conduct.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;8. While I do not play very often on a PVP server, I have been really wanting to lately. Perhaps its the fact that the BLUE servers are so crowded and more people are being less friendly. In any case, the one thing that keeps me from playing PVP now is the same thing that always has. There is no penalty for killing another player. There is a penalty for dying though. <BR>
</font><BR>
Play on Teams server (VZ or TZ). Both servers sport faction penalties for killing other players. They are pretty severe. Usually within 4 or 5 kills you'll be KOS to the hometown of the target.<BR>
<BR>
<font color=white>
&gt;&gt;&gt;My suggestion is to allow players to turn DROPPABLE items into NO DROP items through an NPC and make them unsellable<BR>
</font><BR>
The way items work in EQ would not support this. The items are not objects in and of themselves, but rather a reference (by number) to a central database. That means that we can't set attributes such as nodrop on a per-item basis.<BR>

*Level 1 Character Purge*<BR>
<BR>
We've decided to postpone the previously announced purging of level 1 characters that had not been played in the past 30 days.  Should we reschedule this process in the future, we will again give fair warning prior to implementing the purge.<BR>
<BR>
*Today's Changes*<BR>
<BR>
Today's patch consists mostly of content changes within EverQuest, such as new quests, corrections to existing NPC texts, and adjustments to spawn times associated with quest NPCs and other NPCs in general.  <BR>
<BR>
- /help will now display emotes, guild commands, and normal commands separately.<BR>
- /sit will cause your character to sit.  "/sit off" will cause your character to stand.<BR>
- "/cast #" (where # is 1 to 8) will cast the spell memorized in the corresponding slot.<BR>
- "/book #" (where # is the even displayed page number divided by 2) will take you to the corresponding page of your spell book. For instance, to flip to page 27/28, type "/book 14".<BR>
- "/doability #" (where # is 1 to 10) will fire the specified ability.  Abilities 1-6 are those that are set on the "Abilities" page; Numbers 7-10 represent those that are set on the "Combat Skills" page.<BR>
- /whotarget can be typed to do a /who on the targeted PC.<BR>
- "/language #" (where # is a number corresponding to the desired language) selects the chat language to use in general communication.<BR>
- "/language help" displays a list of available languages and their corresponding number.  "/language" alone displays the current language.<BR>
- /meditate causes you to sit down, open your spellbook, and begin meditation.<BR>
- In "HUD" mode, the Chat Box will now take advantage of higher resolutions to display more text before wrapping down to the next line.<BR>
- Fixed a bug that allowed users to /quit out of the game immediately without penalty.  Normal operation is supposed to cause /quit to leave the character in-game and linkdead for a period of time to discourage this action.<BR>
- Again changed the functionality of the "U" ("use") key.  It will no longer inspect players or loot corpses.  All other changes implemented in the last patch stand.<BR>
- Added new customizable color options to the EQCLIENT.INI.  The working documentation for this is below.<BR>
- Corrected a bug that caused items that ran out of charges to "disappear" when the last charge was used.  The item never really disappeared, and would reappear after re-logging.  It no longer appears to disappear.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<BR>
<BR>
If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<BR>
<BR>
The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
RunMode    - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<BR>
