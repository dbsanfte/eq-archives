<!--BODY OF NEWS-->
<p><b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042635.html">Verant Knows Best</a></b></p><p>
<p>Who are you to decide what's best for the game?</p><p>
I think the people should decide what's best for EQ.  If melee want to bind themselves in the city. Let them.  If people feel that classes are unbalanced ask them why and make those changes.</p><p> 
It is the people that make the game. Isn't it?   Or you may not see people sign-up for Star Wars or EQ2 later.</p><p><b> 

Frankly Brian, as the designers of the game, we are the ones with personal and financial stakes in its success. Someone (or some entity) has to be the final arbiter of what is good or not good for the game, and it this case it is those people on the EQ tuning team. The people, those who choose to voice their opinion, whether on the boards, through email or feedback, or with their monthly subscription and the people they refer, do have say in this process, and we have implemented TONS of features and changes based upon opinions coming directly from the players. </p><p>

This doesn't mean however that we can implement every suggestion we receive, or even every suggestion that the people at-large feel is a good idea. We are in the business of keeping our customers, all 217K+ of them, happy, given their multinational origin, separate desires and expectations, even when those desires, expectations, and needs are in direct conflict with those of another customer. This "direct conflict" is best illustrated by the class-envy posts, emails, and feedbacks we regularly receive. </p><p>

Keep in mind that for every class that is absolutely sure that they deserve some new upgrade, enhancement, or feature, there is another class that will feel that they are equally deserving of an upgrade, enhancement, or feature if the first class gets their way. People who have been on this board for a while will be able to attest to this, given that "nerfs" have historically caused less problems than enhancements. This is because when we "nerf" something, only the users of the "nerfed" aspect become upset, whereas when we enhance something, we often start receiving complaints from multiple other sources. A good example of this is when the hitpoints were upped on Paladins and SKs. This action spawned complaints from warriors, rogues, monks, rangers, and bards. </p><p>

In the end, we provide a service offering, and if people like that offering they choose to buy our product. If they continue to like our offering from month to month, they choose to continue buying our product through the monthly subscription fees. We'll always strive to encourage you to make this choice, and will continue to listen to the opinions and suggestions expressed in this and other forums to do everything we can that is good for the game as a whole.</p><p> 

By "good for the game as a whole", I speak of customer retention. Since customer retention is directly tied to customer satisfaction, that is the focus of every decision we make. We believe firmly that people want a game that is challenging and provides some sort of reward for playing, which is why we are so firmly against suggestions that make the game too easy, or reduce the rewards such as by making powerful items extremely commonplace. This is a delicate balance, and though I am sure that we could make a number of people happy in the short term if we made the game easier, made advancement quicker, made classes more powerful, or made items more plentiful, the end result would be that people would become bored much quicker, and leave the game at a greater pace. </p><p>

As for our customer retention, an excess of 70% after 14 months is unheard of in the industry, and therefore we are very proud of it. Certainly it could be better and we will continue to aim towards doing more things in game that helps keep people interested in the game. Given though that our customer have very different needs and desires as mentioned above, its very possible that some of the things we do along these lines will upset some customers while encouraging others to stay with us longer. For instance, a good number of people wanted zones that were much more difficult, being far more challenging than those in old EQ. A good number of the Kunark dungeons were built with this in mind. Of course, by doing what one group of customer wanted in this case most certainly has made another group unhappy. Only time will tell what the right decision was in this case, but we continue to believe that challenging and intriguing content is the best strategy to follow.</p><p>

<b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042829.html">Hasten Fixed</a></p><p>
We've figured out the problem with these two NPCs not popping/depopping. It's being updated on Test now, and will go to production when next we patch zone data, which will probably happen in a day or two, as a complete server outage isn't required. </p><p>

<b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042604.html">Symphonic Sabre Bug</a></b></p><p>
The Tranquil Staff was fixed, now how about fixing the Symphonic Sabre 
This bard weapons has the same "Item is out of charges" problem that the tranquil staff had.</p><p>

I've /bug'd it, /petitioned, posted her numerous times, and even sent an email to Abashi. All with no acknowledgment whatsoever.  Nice that the monk weapon got fixed, what do we have to do to have the Symphonic Sabre fixed too?</p><p>

Its very frustrating knowing that you have legitimate bug concerns (which the bard class is full of btw) and not having any avenue whatsoever to have them looked at.</p><p>
<b>
The guys just fixed this in the database. It will go live the next time that we patch items. People who already have this item will need to trade it out for a new one with the GMs once items go live. </p><p>

<b><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042832.html">Casual Gamers Neglected?</a></b></p><p>
Abashi</p><p>
So... "Is screw the casual player" the policy at Verant? </p><p>

Some of these armor/wepaon quests are ridiculous. I mean really now. Come on. I could rant for pages... and pages. I know others have and are. I have read them. I am sure you have seen your fair share of whining and serious commentary, but please consider the following. </p><p>

When we (my company) markets a product we figure out who our target market (buyer) is and we "cater" to them to make our product likeable, easy to use, and desireable to the demographic. </p><p>

I ask you.. "What is the target Market for EverQuest"? </p><p>

I see you often say that "X and Y consideration is made for the casual gamer.. but is this really the case? Does EQ meet any criteria for the casual player to be successful and say complete any real quests (like the armor or weapon quests)?</p><p> 

I had given in to the notion that the answer was "NO", but occasionally I see you hint that you think your comapny is. Could you make a clear mission statement on this topic?</p><p> 

Lets discuss a few things about the "casual" gamer... whom I count myself among . For example, I am 34, a professional and play EQ about 3 to 4 hours 2 or 3 nights a week with one pig out 8 to 12 hour session on the weekend (permitting my girl friend allows me to or I can distract her with projects, she is working etc...) . In summary - I play an average of 20 hours a week. By most standards this is an INTENSE player or Hobbyist of any catagory of lieasure, but for EQ I believe (I could be wrong) but this is a "casual" player. </p><p>

Once when I first started - I was an intense player. (7 to 10 hours a day and 20 to 30 on weekends) However, real life crept in after a few months and the "gleem" and "shine" of EQ wore off becuase I realized I could not compete with the "School age" and "College Age" crowd. So, I just figured this was the way you wanted it. </p><p>

The quests I pursued were by my experiece from reading other site posts and talking to successful adventureres about in the range of 6 to 8 hours. In summary, basically unattainable for me... IF I wanted to play and make levels, be in a guild or do anything else. So, I began to settle down and after hours of therapy and counselling I am to a "manageable" play scheduele in concordance with my real life responsabilities and such. I gave up on the quests.</p><p> 

Now in a recent post You claim the spawns are 72 mins? Get real. I had assumed Verant decided to market its products to kids and wants to alientate the older "casual" player. But I see you under a delusion that you think you are marekting to the casual player. I fear the quest management staff are fundementally wrong if you think this is so. </p><p>

Consider your quest for the "Bracer" of the Clerical Armor quest. </p><p>

You placed the spawn in north Karanas in the Northern sector in the kill zone of a band of "Lycanthrope (werewolf?) Hunters". A Band of NPCs who kill anything in their path. I must protest. I camped that for 5 nights and 1 weekend (yes I mean I sat at the spawn point for sum total of some 72 hours watching movies and TV) to finally catch the damn thing! YEAH. I see it - It is in mid air it drops... yes it is "Regis the Reverent" and I have it. I start fighting it ,...... guess what..... the "Lycanthrope" Hunters came and kill it WHEN I WAS FIGHTING IT and bascially stole the kill (ks'd) it from me.</p><p> 

I gave up at that point. Why bother. </p><p>

I could go on, but I am certain others could too. </p><p>

Please give us a mission statement on the quests and who is EverQuest Marketed to? </p><p>

Is this a game for the casual gamer?</p><p><b>

I said that a 72 minute spawn on a particular NPC that the person talking about didn't seem out of line. In any case, I think a common misconception that people have is that everyone should be able to get every item. This isn't the way it works. There are things that drop in game once every few weeks, and are truly not meant to be common equipment for everyone. Certianly there is an element of luck involved (right place at right time). </p><p>

Does this mean that people who play more have the opportunity to get more things? Yes. Is that something that should be changed? No. Everyone can't get every item. If that were the case, there'd be nothing special about getting a very nice item, and at that point we might as well sell everything on vendors. Players need to decide what items are important to them, and put in the time that they feel that that item is worth. No one forces anyone to spend 8 hours camping an item. People spend 8 hours camping an item because they feel that it is worth it.</p><p> 

The addition of some random loot tables in some areas of Kunark helps the "casual" player that you speak of even more. No longer do they have to track down one particular NPC, but only be fighting in that dungeon or area to have as good a chance of getting a particular item as anyone else fighting in the area.</p><p> 

Back to my point, there is no magic shot to make everything "fair" for the casual gamer, because you can always find someone who's more "casual" than the last guy. There's no way to make things equal in every respect whether people play an hour per week or 20 hours per week, and we probably wouldn't want to pursue it even if there was, as it would probably make the game boring. 
</p><p>
The best advice I could offer to people in your prediciment would be to play the game first, and see what items you get, rather than deciding what items you want, and then playing the game to that end. Discover the items through your normal travels rather than scheduling your travels around items you want. You might find this path a bit more rewarding. </p><p>

I have several acts on Lanys, most are a derivative of the name Khan, (Hey its my RL middle name) Like Xkhanx, Khanx and Xkhan, is there a way to say delete one of the names and have a GM change my Primary Char's name to the one deleted? I'd much rather it be Xkhan and not have to explain to everyone who asks that the X's are place holders... </p><p><b>
As a matter of promoting community, having a characters acts and demeanor recognizable, and having their in-game reputation follow them where they go, we don't change the first name of established characters unless they violate the naming policy.</p><p>

Where is Cannibalize II?  Why haven't you gotten back to us like promised Abashi?</p><p><b>

Because I was just able to get the info today. There will be a quest going in the next time we patch data that will allow Shaman's to obtain this spell.</p><p>

Abashi, ever since the patch a few weeks ago that had elephants and lions dropping FS weapons and Black Pearls, Grimrot's spawn frequency has taken a drastic turn for the worse.</p><p>

Spawn times on place holders were on par with regular dungeon spawns prior to this patch; now, nothing. Neither has been spawning at any discernable rate.</p><p> 

There have been reports that perhaps all spawns are despawning very shortly after they pop, but this is speculation on my part as I have not witnessed this.</p><p> 

Something is wrong.</p><p><b>

Grimrot is spawning, he's just got a fairly long spawn time. I believe this was adjusted a few patches ago because he was spawning too frequently.</p><p>
