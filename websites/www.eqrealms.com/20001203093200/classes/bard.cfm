Ah, the life of a bard. Singing, dancing, and drinking, and even the occasional monster killing. If you think this is the life for you, read on and learn some of the details of the most versatile class in EverQuest.
<BR><BR>
Before we get to what a bard can do, let's outline some of the things they can't. First off, bards will never deal the big damage that a warrior will. They will never be able to strike down a foe by waving their arms around like a wizard can. And they'll never be able to stop the brunt of an attack single-handedly like a decked out ogre can. Once you get past the initial rat and snake killing levels, you'll barely be able to stand toe to toe with a monster near your level. So with all these negative traits of a bard, why does every group want one?
<BR><BR>
A bard's strength is in making others perform their job better. A well played bard can let the warrior concentrate on giving and taking damage, let the casters sit back and sling their spells around, and let the healers have an easy time keeping everyone in full fighting form. A bard can make a well-balanced group into a dungeon-terrorizing group. Every class can benefit from what a bard can offer. Let's take a look at some of the ways this is true.
<BR><BR>
Bards are the masters of “sing and dance”. The class is based around magical songs, which provide effects such as healing, buffing, and mana regeneration, as well as other utilities such as underwater breathing, invisibility, and charm. Whereas a caster has to wait a certain number of levels to get their next group of spells, a bard can add a new song to their book every level.  Most of the songs are quite useful in various situations, and after the mid levels it becomes a challenge to decide upon only eight songs to have on tap.
<BR><BR>
The three songs bards are best known for are the healing song, the mana song, and the speed song. Both the healing and the mana songs are gained at low levels (5 and 6), while you have to wait until 32 to get the mana song. Every other class is jealous of the abilities these three songs give the bard class. But there are many other songs, which are equally useful as well. A faction song will get you better prices and allow you to go places you normally couldn't. The lulling songs allow you to break a tough camp and also lull multiple monsters to sleep while your party concentrates on them one at a time. The invisibility song also adds a see invisible component, which saves your casters from having to cast two different spells on each person in the party. The buffing songs can raise your resistances, as well as various attributes during a fight, allowing your entire group to take less damage while dealing out more of it. The charm song will turn a hostile monster into another party member under your control. The list goes on and on…
<BR><BR>
Let's take a moment to discuss how songs work, so that you can make better use of them. When you start the song, there is a one round delay (about 3 seconds) before its effects begin. After the initial delay, most songs will last another two rounds on their own even if you aren't still playing them. This allows you to “twist” up to three songs together at once, and get the benefits of all three at the same time. This is done by starting one song and waiting until its effect message is displayed, then immediately stop it and start the next song. Wait for the second song to take effect and then stop it and immediately start the third song. After it takes effect, go back the first song again and repeat. With a good connection and good timing, you can keep three songs going at once. For example, during a battle you can twist Anthem de Arms, Guardian Rhythms, and Psalm of Warmth together at the same time. Anthem will increase your parties strength and attack rate, Guardian will protect your party  from magical attacks and raise armor class, and Warmth will protect against cold attacks as well as giving each party member a heat based damage shield. The possibilities are endless, and a good bard will adapt his or her singing to the situation at hand. It should be noted that not all songs will stack with each other, and certain songs require dedicated playing so you can't twist them. Also, most of the songs do not require mana. You can sing all day and laugh at your caster friends while the spend most of their time medding. Or you can always help them out by singing the mana song.
<BR><BR>
One of the disadvantages of all this song and dance is the attention you'll get from the monsters. They know who is buffing the entire party and causing them grief, so given a chance they will come after the bard first. Luckily bards can wear plate armor, but they will never be able to tank like a warrior type class is able to. A smart bard knows when to play what, and not attract undue attention. A poorly played bard will require a dedicated healer just to keep them alive. Perhaps to offset this uncanny ability to get themselves killed, bards seem to have a pretty forgiving experience penalty for dying. 
<BR><BR>
No one race stands out as the best choice for a bard. Humans, elves, and half elves can be bards, and all three are seen throughout the lands of Norrath. There is also no overriding primary stat that a bard relies on. High charisma will help your will bending songs, agility, stamina, and dexterity will help you sing and fight better, and a high strength will allow you to lug around that plate armor and nice weapons without becoming so weighed down. Wisdom and intelligence are the two least needed stats, although they have benefits as well. When creating your bard, try to keep everything balanced, and have a goal in mind as to how you want to play your bard. Focus more on fighting stats if you want to get in the front lines. Go for the charisma if that aspect appeals to you. You can always tailor your stats in the game by choosing certain items and jewelry to raise stats you feel would benefit you and your style of play.
<BR><BR>
Bards can use shields and most one handed or piercing weapons. Bards get duel wield, but not double attack. They get many rogue skills such as pick locks, hide, and sneak. At higher levels they can track monsters almost as well as a ranger. Most bards concentrate on slashing weapons, but blunt and piercing weapons are also a viable alternative. Of course many bards forgo the use of weapons and use instruments to increase the effects of their songs. There are magical instruments scattered throughout the lands, as well as the more mundane drums and lutes. No matter if the bard is swinging and singing, or sitting back and strumming, the group will do better with the bards help.
<BR><BR>
The initial levels in a bard's life are just like any other class. You can still stand up to most monsters in your level range, and grouping is beneficial but not necessary. As you rise in levels, you will become much more reliant on a good group, and may find yourself in a leadership role more often than not. Bards have a very good background for group leading because the bard class has many of the elements of the other classes. This allows you to direct your members into a well functioning group. 
<BR><BR>
Many other classes have complaints of becoming boring at higher levels. A bard always has a new skill or song to look forward to. This keeps the game interesting and fresh. After playing a bard for awhile, you'll have a hard time going back to another class because they all seem so limited in what they can do. A bard is definitely the jack of all trades, but also the master of their own.

Ability to bandage up your wounds if you have bandages.<BR><BR>
<B>Hand to Hand (Level 1)</B><BR>

on. Some songs also require no instrument for full effects.<BR><BR>
<B>Throwing (Level 1)</B><BR>
The use of throwing weapons.<BR><BR>
<B>Percussion (Level 5)</B><BR>
This skill will allow you to equip a drum and increase the effects of any song which uses the percussion skill. Used
for many buffing and speed related songs.<BR><BR>
<B>String (Level 8)</B><BR>
This skill allows you to equip a string instrument such as a lute, which increases the effects of songs based on

This allows you to avoid damage by dodging the
incoming attacks.<BR><BR>

Allows you to increase the effects of brass
songs by equipping a horn of some sort. Used for many offensive songs.<BR><BR>

skill. Allows you to forage food and water from the land.<BR><BR>
<B>Wind (Level 14)</B><BR>

damage when you race over sand dunes and other hilly terrain.<BR><BR>
<B>Hide (Level 25)</B><BR>
You can hide while not moving and avoid being attacked. Not
always successful and there is no real way to tell if you are hidden or not. Elves get this skill at level 1.<BR><BR>
