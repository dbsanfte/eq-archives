  I am quitting Everquest, and would like to offer up for sale the bristlebane.com domain name.

Since July of 2001, when I started keeping track, there have been nearly 1million hits to the bristlebane.com domain - That averages out to about 83000 per month.

Email me at tulaz@bristlebane.com if you would like to make an offer on this domain.

  Last Friday began with a corrupted file system.  Over the weekend, the data from the trashed file system was recovered, and for kicks the machine bristlebane.com runs on was replaced - unfortunately, there seems to be a new problem, one that causes the server to freeze up every few hours.  Until this problem is resolved, all bristlebane.com services will be discontinued, with the exception of this website.  IRC will not be available until the server is stable enough to be trusted.

Server: Bristlebane

Title: Naked Drunken Newbie Dash
Date/Time: Saturday, June 1st at 5pm Central US time.

This is a 100% FREE Race.  Prizes WILL be awarded for various categories.
The race will begin and the first point of the relay will be named.  When
you reach the first checkpoint, you will be instructed to /HUG the referee
standing there before you are allowed to continue. The Referee will /shout
<yourname> has had a hug today... or something similar indicating to you
and the zone that you are clear to move to the next point in the race which
will be /tell <yourname> to you upon receiving the hug. - Keep in mind, /tell
with the next relay point may or may not be the same as your other racers
- it may vary slightly!  You will also be given any additional instructions.
There are multiple destinations but everyone will have the same final
destination.  There are rules and notices posted at both of the following
sites (I suggest you check/read and sign up at both locations).
