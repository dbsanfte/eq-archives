I guess for this to work, you would have to have the ability to do a massive software change without downing the server.  If you can do that, then here is my suggestion:  Have major events like huricanes or stampedes or a thunderstorm or something that will change the landscape somehow, just ever so slightly.  Like hurricane that blows down trees in WC, and smaller tree grow in its place.  Lakes dry up or hail falls.  Something different and random that adds a little realism to the unchanging landscape.<br><small></small>

That's a great idea :)<br><br>Problem is the suggestions would be for the website here, not for the game itself.  We aren't associated with Verant or Sony, this board is player run, mostly a resource center for finding things related to EQ and the bristlebane server.  Only reason there's a bulletin board is because I'm too lazy/busy to keep posting news items. =P<br><small><br>The Tool</small>

Ah.  I understand.  Alright.  Here's more of a question than a suggestion.  Can you explain to me how the left frame works?  Every server on the left has a 101/101.  That doesn't make sense.  There are only 101 players playing on a server at a time? Or only 101 users logged into those web site?  Everything else about the board, Main, builds, etc seem to be well designed and efficient.<br><br>One more thing.  It seems to be that posting sometimes causes errors:  I keep getting a: <br>Software error:<br>Can't open user file for user -1: No such file or directory at psunami_users.pl line 219. <br>For help, please send mail to the webmaster (root@dragonsdawn.net), giving this error message and the time and date of the error. <br><br><br>Which is probably why nobody is posting anything.<br><small></small>

Actually, it posts, you just get that error if you post not logged in.  I could make that go away by not allowing unregistered users to post, but I've always found websites that force you to register annoying as hell.<br><br>Supposedly that bug is due to be fixed in the next software release, we'll see if that happens.<br><small><br>The Tool</small>
