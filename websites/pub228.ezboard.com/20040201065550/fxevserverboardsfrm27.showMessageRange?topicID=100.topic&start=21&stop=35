I'm wasn't ignoring you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What our intention is to do (although it's not been fully worked out yet) is to treat each individual case as it comes, which as you say hasn't really, and probably won't happen that often.<br>
<br>
That being said, we're kinda working through some basic guidelines of how to handle a person / incident from start to finish. The purpose of this, is so while the time it takes to progress from each step to the next (or even progress at all) may differ from person to person, the steps won't change that much.<br>
<br>
The reason we pretty much skipped to the extreme end with crylin and kwip, is because they have demonstrated being a problem for so long, and so much that starting off saying 'please could you not do that quite as much, I'm not limiting you doing anything, but politley requiest that you tone it down a little' really doesn't make too much sense.<br>
<br>
The reason Crylin and Kwip were treated pretty much the same, is that while crylin didn't disrupt quite as much, he did so intentionally, and all of the time. Whereas Kwip at his worst probably was more disruptive, but he didn't do some of it intentionally, and didn't do it all of the time (this is primarily why he wasn't banned out right ).<br>
<br>
The reason Crylin got banned before Kwip, is primarily because asside from being highly agitated here on one post (like many others it seems), he has used his post pretty much identically to any other member.<br>
<br>
I'll honestly say though, I wasn't around as often during Kwips second chance (when he was discovered as Serant Vuks), and to be honest, I wasn't aware that he did anything major asside from being a little irritating. I can appreciate if I am mistaken, but that was part of the reason which made me lean towards letting him stay.<br>
<br>
The problem now though is, I'd probably lean towards banning him if I was (it seems likely) mistaken about the events surrounding his second chance. While it pains me to say it, I still am not totally convinced it's all intentional. Because of that, I'm still kinda in two minds whether or not it's fair to tell him it's his final warning then say 'actually no, your banned'.<br>
<br>
I totally see all of your points about 'he was banned, he should be again', don't get me wrong, but my feelings on the matter are a bit up in the air.<br>
<br>
That being said the couple of paragraphs above, are all my own opinion, and not the moderators, if all the mods asside from me decide he needs to go, he's gone. I'm just the PR guy when it comes to explaining why <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You gave him a second chance.  He threatened the board (intentional) and he spammed every visible thread in rants in under 10 mins(intentional)  Now after that, he was given the final warning, a post limit etc.  To which he used  a shadow account. <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>actually i was trying to under mind your whole 10 post scheme by showing you how stupid it is to be pissed off about someone posting crap on teh inta web.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now this is after his final warning, one ban and two other chances.  I don't see this as his final chance being yanked away from him, he had his final chance and he basically said screw you, what you want is stupid so Ill do whatever I want anyways.  He has a history of disruption and threats and no matter how hard he tries to be good, he ultimately falls back to his old ways.<br>
<br>
This probably should have been under Kwips post but you mentioned it here <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elrynia>elrynia</A> at: 12/5/03 11:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ramshutu>ramshutu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PR Guy</span><br>  Posts: 1283<br> <font color=#330000>(12/5/03 11:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.johnsrealmonline.com/classicnick/bananaman/Image33.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: [Mod Announcement] : Crylin</span><hr size=1> Okay El <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

*the following is my opinion only, and not the moderators*<br>
<br>
I replied to your IM, with a slight elaboration here.<br>
<br>
However, it seems that our differing opinions stem from having a different take on exactly what happened. I'm not by any means saying your right and I'm wrong, I'm just saying that this is where the differing opinion comes from.<br>
<br>
If you can bear with me, I'll re-look through all the posts (to be honest, I only paid a cursorary glance to a few things you're mentioning) and try and come up with a bit of a 'dossier' so to speak.<br>
<br>
If it's okay with you what I'll post will be a list of 'incidents' kwip has been responsible for, and posts after this incident has taken place, then I'l go through them, and try and point out exactly how I came to the opinion I have.<br>
<br>
If at any point, I find I've blatantly missed something out, or not taken something into account I shouldn't have, I'll put my hands up and claim ignorance.<br>
<br>
I'll post it in the Kwip thread, to be honest, I'm not sure when I will be able to post on it, but I'll work on it as much as I can this weekend.<br>
<br>
This may however be moot anyways as we are kinda discussing stuff about kwip as we speak.<br>

<br>
This is the point I take exception with.  The first time yes it is the person with the sticks fault.<br>
<br>
The 5th time it is the person doing the hitting, because they chose to still sit by the person with the stick.<br>
<br>

<br>
Again the only reason the thread becomes hi-jacked is because others allow it.  They play right into his hands, knowing perfectly well, his modis-operandi (sp?).  So he is being banned for being the person he has created for these boards because other people cannot control themselves.  It is very possible that other people are responding to see how long he can keep the character up. (much like I was doing with Tib in the Sleeper thread)<br>
