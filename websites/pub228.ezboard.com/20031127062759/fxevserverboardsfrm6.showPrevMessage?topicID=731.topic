8-13-3<br>
<br>
I think the vast differences in compensation between victims of the September 11 casualty and those who die or have died serving the country in Uniform are profound. No one is really talking about it either, because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11. Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country. If you lost a family member in the September 11 attack, you're going to get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000, all the way up to $4.7 million. <br>
<br>
If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, the first check you get is a $6,000 direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get $833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt. <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that some of the people who are getting an average of $1.185 million up to $4.7 million are complaining that it's not enough. Their deaths were tragic, but for most, they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. Soldiers put themselves in harms way FOR ALL OF US, and they and their families know the dangers. <br>
<br>
We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the September 11 families are getting. In addition to that, some of the families of those bombed in the embassies are now asking for compensation as well. <br>
<br>
You see where this is going, don't you? Folks, this is part and parcel of over 50 years of entitlement politics in this country. It's just really sad. Every time a pay raise comes up for the military, they usually receive next to nothing of a raise. Now the green machine is in combat in the Middle East while their families have to survive on food stamps and live in low-rent housing. Make sense? <br>
<br>
However, our own U.S. Congress just voted themselves a raise, and many of you don't know that they only have to be in Congress one time to receive a pension that is more than $15,000 per month, and most are now equal to being millionaires plus. They also do not receive Social Security on retirement because they didn't have to pay into the system. <br>
<br>
If some of the military people stay in for 20 years and get out as an E-7, you may receive a pension of $1,000 per month, and the very people who placed you in harm's way receive a pension of $15,000 per month. I would like to see our elected officials pick up a weapon and join ranks before they start cutting out benefits and lowering pay for our sons and daughters who are now fighting. <br>
<br>
&quot;When do we finally do something about this?&quot; <br>
<br>
This MUST be a campaign issue in 2004. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=karadax>Karadax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#330000>(8/14/03 1:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=944.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Discuss!</span><hr size=1> The Government tries hard to increase the standard of living for its military, however each and everytime they dish out more money so their troops can afford a decent place to live.. guess what happens?

I agree, something needs to be done about the &quot;giving outselves a pay raise&quot; crap that happens in congress.. they get free food and stuff anyways just for being critical members of the government - why the fuck do you need more money ?!<br>

When you are in the military, especialy combat, you know there's a chance of death on the job.  You hope and pray and do all you can to avoid it, but it's a risk of the career that's known going in.  I don't mean to look at military deaths and loss lightly, but the deaths from 911 were far more tragic in the sense that is was so unexpected and &quot;unavoidable&quot;.  I understand what they were trying to do, making it so that the families would not have to undergo financial strife on top of loss of a loved ones based on the income of those lost, thus minimizing the blow.  And while I agree to that and don't mind my tax dollars going to that cause, it believe the amounts to to be a bit much.  And even though all the rescue workers fit in the same &quot;death is a risk of the career&quot; category as the military, they are heros of the day and certainly can't be left out (I'm assuming all 911 victims got the same farmula of compensation, however I did not research the fact).  Of course, all of the people in our military are heros too, but we simply can't afford to guarantee military families the same financial compensation shown to 911 families of over a million dollars on average.  I hate to say it, but imagine the fraud possibilites accociated with that.  But I definately agree that military families should have better benefits that the ones Rush stated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alysterweedgrowwer>Alyster Weedgrowwer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grows Weed</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#330000>(8/14/03 2:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=944.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Discuss!</span><hr size=1> First off, I commend any one who has served our country and they have my utmost respect, but they signed up to serve.

<br>
I grew up in the military, I know I've mentioned that before. And I remember the good things about it all. The medical benefits, dental, eyeglasses, paid housing, paid electric bill, paid water, trash pick up, all those things that cost so damned much nowdays. <br>
<br>
The only thing we had to pay for was groceries (reduced prices, and tax free if you bought them from the base commissary), telephone, cable, and all the other &quot;extras.&quot; Granted, the cost of living wasn't as high as it is nowdays, when I first started smoking, I paid $0.40 for a pack of smokes if they were bought on base, and $0.80 if I bought them off base. (I know how much this dates me! LOL) And groceries were never as expensive as they are now. My mom was a great shopper, everything name brand, (of course, generics weren't as prevalent then as now), and what I pay for a month's worth of food nowdays for myself and two daughters, my mother could have fed her, my father, and myself for 4 months. <br>
<br>
Dad spent 20 years in the military, and retired as an E7, and he's been retired for 20 years now. Over the course of the last 5 or so  years that he was in, and definitely over the past 20 that he's been out, I've watched his benefits get reduced more and more. Where before, even retirees could have all of their medical taken care of on base, at the closest base, no matter where they lived, it now is more like a HMO, you have a co-pay, and a primary care doc who isn't military (of course, this is probably a good thing), and not on base, you can take your prescriptions to the pharmacy on base and have them filled for free, or you can use your &quot;HMO&quot; type benefits and pay a co-pay for the meds you need. Dad no longer has a &quot;housing allowance,&quot; nor the &quot;extra&quot; money that the military paid him for living off base to cover expenses. I lived in alot of trailers while I was growing up, but we also spent alot of time living on base, in military housing. And in spite of the raise in the cost of living, dads retirement has remained the same. <br>
<br>
The folks who died on 9-11, died tragically. I won't deny that. But do I feel that they deserve $1million+ as a settlement for their loss? Sure they do. However, since it was Osama's fault, let HIM pay the bill. Yeah, I know that's unrealistic. <br>
<br>
But it's about as unrealistic as what our men and women in the Armed Forces are forced to live on nowdays.<br>

So its not totally coming from tax dollars, or even the majority for that matter.  Also, if you're in the military and going into combat without life insurance, you need to get a clue.  Anyway, no amount of money is ever going compensate for the loss. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=212429" target="top">Hunter Tast</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
