I assure that it is.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone will believe the total out-right arrogance of the Blood Cult leadership as demonstrated in this thread.  Perhaps after reading you dissagree, but I could not believe that Blood Cult would chose to conduct it's affairs in this manner - especially to a person who they know damn well always has logging on.<br>
<br>
With no word of a /tell, and knowing full well that the character was being botted by a friend on that afternoon Blood Cult just guild removed Darcamen.<br>
<br>
I'd never done it before but Darc had always said I could use his cleric if I needed - afterall it'd be free xp for him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Today I had everything I needed for a blast with some friends except a healer, so I logged on Darcamen.  A long time RL friend (from before the game) and a member of Blood Cult since the days of Blood Cult Clan.<br>
<br>
I wasn't really listening to guild chatter, I had not even set up the chat windows and there was a lot of spam but when I saw this - knowing Darcamen was a 52nd cleric - I felt it prudent to mention why I couldn't attend.<br>
<br>
Shelston tells the guild, 'naggy is up and all we really need is a cleric to do it, channel is bcnaggy'<br>
You say to your guild, 'you dont want me'<br>
...short pause: You have healed Flabello for 1857 points of damage.<br>
You say to your guild, 'because i'm being botted by Pneumatic.'<br>
<br>
That was all there was too it, until after the group I turned off anon and went to tell the /gu that I was now leaving and they could start talking about that horrible Pneumatic person. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You are not a member of any guild.<br>
<br>
Players in EverQuest:<br>
---------------------------<br>
[52 Vicar] Darcamen (Dark Elf)  ZONE: dreadlands  <br>
There is 1 player in EverQuest.<br>
<br>
Darcamen had been removed from the guild without even a /tell to explain the situation.  Fearing that it was because I was botting him I felt it prudent to explain to Nogi (guild leader of Blood Cult) that it was a one-off and that Darcamen is normally himself.<br>
<br>
You told nogi '[queued], You know I was just borrowing Darcamen for the afternoon dont you ?'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'no. dint know and it appears darcamen does not play anymore anyway'<br>
You told Nogi, 'Is this the message you would like me to pass to him when he logs on ?'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'he can ask me if he likes or any officer'<br>
You told Nogi, 'I just feel a bit guilty for causing his guild removal just for borrowing him a few hours.'<br>
<br>
Nogi tells you, 'well. why he needs bloodcult as his guild?'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'he has ghost status anyway'<br>
You told Nogi, 'I would ask you to speak to him about that.  I feel terrible, he's going to log on and wonder why he's deguilded.'<br>
<br>
Nogi tells you, 'he never speaks anyway'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'no postings, nothing'<br>
You told Nogi, 'this is really a conversation you should have had with him before guild removing him.'<br>
<br>
You told Nogi, 'I feel terrible'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'i know what i have to do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>
You told Nogi, 'i'm sorry I dont understand what you meen by that, perhaps a translation error - could you rephrase please'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'i meant i know what i have to do as guildleaer, ie, wehn to remove ppl and when to talk to them'<br>
<br>
You told Nogi, 'I see you need clerics at the moment.  Maybe if you chatted with Darcamen about his life and the way BC fits you could have had him at a few raids.  Instead you loose him, and you further distance yourself from a few good clerics who might have guest raided if you'd asked - you are a strange man Nogi, I don't think i'll ever understand you.'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'he can reapply'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'he contributes zero to BC atm and not even posts something'<br>
<br>
You told Nogi, 'great, i'll go tell him I borrowed his character, explained in /gu that I was borrowing the toon and they guild removed him.'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'as i said, he can reapply if he is back to the game'<br>
You told Nogi, 'As for his guild contribution, I think you'll find he doesn't ask anything either, he's a different level to the rest of you but he's slowly working his way up.  Never mind though.  I will send him the log.'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'doesnt matter. guildlife is at board also'<br>
You told Nogi, 'Guild life.  Remember Darcamen has been with BC since the days of Blood Cult Clan.  You left him behind in levels, but slowly he's catching up.  I will let him speak to you about it, from me though - personally - I think you just reminded me why I left BC'<br>
Nogi tells you, 'your choice. help the guild and the guild helps you'<br>
<br>
<br>
I hereby officially revoke my offer to guest raid with you (not that you ever asked me anyway - worried your pride would get dented or something, even though you needed clerics) and I present this log to the Xevserver community as a demonstration of what as asshole you are.<br>
<br>
Thankyou Nogi, for continue to colour the world of Norrath with that other type of person.  Without you the world would be unbalanced, and somewhat nicer to live in.<br>

What I mean by that is no one outside the guild botting a toon inside the guild?<br>
<br>
It wouldn't surprise me if that's why they did it.  All you did was put a sign on your neck that reads:<br>
<br>
&quot;Hi Everyone, look at me.  I'm someone that's not in your guild, but I'm reading all of your private guild chat.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'll be perfectly honest with you....There's no way in hell I would ever want Pneumatic in my guildchat either.  I personally wouldn't like it if someone in my guild was letting non-guilded people use his toon.<br>
<br>
I understand it's impossible to police (unless someone puts a sign on their neck), and I also understand that ultimately it's everyone's personal choice as to whether they share their toon.  I never would.<br>

Where in your little explanation does it explain why he didn't come out and say 'We don't like bots botted by outside member.' or 'we don't want you in our guildchat'.<br>
<br>
Or even why saying that isn't acceptable?<br>

I didn't even rant at BC when I had some bloody good cause too a year and a half ago, I just guild removed and got on with it - even though I am active in xev server rants, I have up until now never ranted at Blood Cult.<br>

It was after all a one-off, and something that benefitted Darcamen - his member - in terms of levels and gear.<br>

Where in your little explanation does it explain why he didn't come out and say 'We don't like bots botted by outside member.' or 'we don't want you in our guildchat'.<br>
Or even why saying that isn't acceptable?<br>

Ram, don't be silly.  Why should the GL explain anything to Pneumatic?  Blood Cult doesn't owe ANY explanation to Pneumatic.  The fact that Pneumatic got his buddy guildremoved is irrellevant, and doesn't automatically mean that Pneumatic deserves an explanation.  Pneumatic, in fact, doesn't deserve a single godddamned (rev jack forgive me) thing from BC or its officers.<br>
<br>
You see, the point, that apparantly you (but not I) missed is:<br>
1)  Pneumatic isn't in BC<br>
2)  Pneumatic didn't agree with the &quot;rules&quot; (whatever they are) of being a member of BC<br>
3)  Pneumatic cannot claim any rights to an explanation.<br>
<br>
In the logs, the GL says that the toon owner is more than welcome to contact him or any other officer.  All he's saying to Pneumatic is that &quot;hey, you're not in my guild, have the toon owner contact me.&quot;<br>
<br>
They did nothing wrong.<br>
<br>
The toon and Pneumatic did something (apparantly) wrong.<br>
<br>
But that's okay because ultimately, I was only trying to suggest one possibility for it.  I'll take note of the fact that you think it was something different.  It will change my life forever I'm sure. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=322851"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www3.telus.net/hayzeus/SnowBunny4.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=<br>

I would have de-guilded darcamen aswell if I had been an officer and seeing you where botting him. You are just trouble and we dont need you around our guild.<br>
<br>
My guess is that you have never even been thought of as a guest on our raids, mostly because of the fact that you, as I already stated, is trouble.<br>
<br>
Personally I have been in BC for 2 years and I have not seen Darcamen on many occasions during these 2 years and I am pretty sure I have never seen him on a raid.<br>
<br>
By letting you, a person who takes every chance to badmouth BC, bot him is disrespectful to us as a guild and my guess is if he can give a valid explanation to this he would be granted to come back in the guild again. But as stated by you aswell as Nogi(if you havent tampered with the loggs that is), the guild might not have been the one best suited for him due to his playtimes and the guild being a raiding guild. <br>

If I was on the other side of the fence so would I, but I would have sent a /tell first to explain and give the chance for the botter to leave, if I felt the guild was more important than his friend *boggle* I would have asked him never to do it again or I would have found a temporary solution: De-guild, and come back when your done for invite.<br>

<br>
I would boot him as well if I were in his place, possibly a bit more tactfully, possibly not.  I wouldnt do it because it was Pneu in particular botting him(got nothin against pneu), but because Darc was allowing an unguilded person to gain access to the guild and to what they were up to(ie. spawns they were tracking or heading to).  BC accepted Darc to be a representative of their guild, not Pneu/bot.   I'm assuming this is BC policy as it is in most higher end guilds, please correct me if I'm wrong.  When you belong to a guild, you agree to abide by the rules set forth, period.<br>
<br>
I might send him a tell at a later point explaining why, if I happened to see him on, but it wouldnt really be a priority.  If the guy truly is a ghost and never plays or visits the boards, then sending him a tell may be a highly difficult task.  Maybe e-mail him if I had his addy.<br>
