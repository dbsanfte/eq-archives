What if their goal was to kill all 4 warders and wake the sleeper, seeing that game lore proves that waking him is basically the equivalent of finishing the game.<br>
<br>
What if they were all about to quit and just decided they wanted to &quot;finish the game&quot; and that was their goal.<br>
<br>
It's not selfish to think that way, it's jsut being open-minded enuff to realize that when it comes to things like this, you sometimes have to just say fuck everyone else and do what you wanna do.  I don't think it's anyone's goal to play this game and be liked.<br>
<br>
Given Enchanters/Necromancers/Magicians can actually charm 600DPS pets and camp mini-bosses in the planes, I don't see anyone /rant'ing on this board about that, and that's the reason why they nerfed those spells.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't get my spell because overpowered Enc.'s are camping all the turnins and selling them for high prices&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's unfair because they can get an AA point every 20 minutes&quot;<br>
<br>
You wanna know what kind of stuff is really worth ranting about?<br>
<br>
Think about how you would feel if your guild leader Ebay'ed and sold the guild's bank account with his character.  How would you feel then?  You actually invested the time to get all those uber drops from VT and he sells it all for a mere $200.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, even though I may be blunt and stuck to reality, I can somewhat feel your *pain*, but you have to realize that you aren't the only ones in the game with *goals*, no matter how many you have behind you, whether it's one person or 99.999999999999999999999999999999% of the server.  And some people's goals may very well end your very chance at achieving yours.  I've been playing this game for a very long time (have numerous deleted 50+ char; 50 was max level in the *early* days of the game) and for many, dying to this unkillable mob is the epitome of the game.<br>
<br>
That action itself is a goal obtained and the only reason why guilds refuse to do it is because they have pity for the up and coming.  News flash, You really don't mean anything to anyone in this game.  You are just another way for them to achieve their goals, and it's the same for everyone, even me.<br>
<br>
Sad, yes, but true.  The only way to go about dealing with these things is to say &quot;so fucking what&quot; and deal with it.  Yes, you can blacklist them.  You can ban them.  You can deny them service and harrass them with every word that you can come up in your petty little head (refer to www.dictionary.com plz <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), but it won't change anything.<br>
<br>
Sleeper is not sleeping anymore, and he won't go back to sleep anymore, so wasting your time bitching about it won't change anything.  Any by outcasting them, you've pretty much fucked yourself because now they will make it a mission to do everything they can to provoke a /rant out of you =/<br>

I don't play this game as much as I used to, but you people are lucky these days.  You can go 1-50 in 2 days played as opposed to the 2 months it took of hard core playing *back in the days.*<br>
<br>
I can't knock them for doing what they did, because some one would have done it at some point in time anyways.<br>
<br>
What if everyone in the game started a new character on Xev because they wanted to see the sleeper sleeping, is that grounds to pretty much *order* guilds to not wake him?  I think not.<br>
<br>
That is my point.  We choose the server we play on, and if we don't like it, we leave and start on another one.  If people don't like that, they too bad.  It's the truth and nothing can change that.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, there is a thing called Character Transfer for all the people who want to see the sleeper sleep.  Move to Kane Bayle.  It's FFA and wayyyyyyyyyy too underpopulated.  Your entire guild can move there and they'll still have room for 10 more.  The people are willing to share there.  In fact, here is a post from our board about this board and what you people are saying about Hawkethorne, I'll even post the link to the page so you don't think I'm lying, and no I didn't post it.  My name is the same across all these EZBoards...<br>

I didn't get some of the &quot;easy tracks&quot; a lot of the newer players get now.<br>
<br>
Second of all, there are a lot of other things higher end guilds can schedule in order to keep their memebers happy. Waking the sleeper was pointless. There was nothing to gain from it other than ruining other gamers' experience and seeing 15 mins of a script that will never happen again.<br>
<br>
It's fucking bullshit. And there's a 60 page thread with people who agree with me. If they wanted the sleeper awake so damn bad, why not move their fucking happy holes over to one of the other servers? That argument could go both ways.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is, they made it so that goal can never be reached by the majority. I'd hate to quote Star Trek in this but &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.&quot;<br>
<br>
They're fucking selfish with a capital &quot;S&quot; and I'm not the only one that thinks so. It was really classless what they did. There was an agreement made by all the other guilds to keep him asleep and HS thought they were special enough to bypass that agreement and did it anyway.<br>
<br>
There are higher end guilds that HATE one another, yet, they can come together on this agreement to let him sleep. Why was it SO hard for HS to comply with this? What makes them better than the rest? Just because you have the ability to wake him doesn't mean you should. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">Mysidia Drakkenbane</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

I think I've said it before that it was selfish.  Would you say letting medallions for Seb keys rot selfish, becuase people do it all the time when people are /ooc'ing for them in the zone to eliminate competition.

Like I said before, you're huffing over something you can't even control.  It's lame and it's totally not worth it.  You're making yourself look stupid and if you've read the posts that the HS members have posted, you would see just how stupid you all look bitching about it.  It's truly sad.<br>

Take a five second break, Kaldien, because you're a moron. The fact that you're blowing smoke up HS's ass has lost your entire credibility here. Your selfish nature, asshole tendencies, and your brash treatment to others around you will get you no where. I could post a huge response, and believe me, I have one, but I won't. The fact that you need a proctologist to remove your head from your ass, speaks leaps and bounds here. <br>

Lemme guess.... You're on the Bandwagon from Hell with HS and you're an honorary member... Gee... didn't see that one coming. <br>
<br>
I don't LIVE in a game. I haven't touched the damn thing for nearly six months now. But I have friends that play, and my friends that do are severely scorned and pissed off about this. HS may think they can do whatever they please, but their apathy is infecting rage into the people around them like a plague and it will backfire...sooner or later.

But when people do things that are just plain uncontrollable, it's best to 1.) move servers or 2.) start playing your alts on a different server.  That's why I have characters spread on 3 different servers.  When a guild pops up that totally sucks and starts camping all the good spots, then it's time for a break.<br>
<br>
Believe me, it actually kinda sucks at the really high levels (60+).  There's basically nothing more in the game to do other than raid, and that's pretty sad.  No more quests, since better gear drops on a daily basis.  It's sad but true, and look at the result of it.  1 group of people *fucking it up* for everyone else.  That's what makes this game sucks, but keeps some of us coming back everyday for more.<br>
<br>
These boards are just a way to have fun.  Really, I would never stand in anyone's face and tell them the things that I write on this board.  The only reason why people write them is because some people seem to take it a bit too seriously and react just the way others want them too.<br>
<br>
Like I said, if you really wanna see the sleeper, transfer to KB.  The sleeper there is still sleeping and even though there are the occassional assholes, everyone knows who they are because the population is so small.  If you do transfer, you shouldn't have a problem fitting yourself into full Elysian gear, especially if you meet me.  I'm tired of PoP exp anyways and despite what my image on these rant boards may be, I'm quite the giving type.<br>
<br>
Hell, I gave away over 20k gear to a level 1 enchanter the other day just becuase I didn't feel like logging to transfer it to my main from my level 33 mage alt there.<br>

The first &quot;unspoken rule&quot; of this forum is that you don't take what said her seriously. Ask anyone who's played with me. I'm not like that.<br>
<br>
When the assholes began to overrun the game, and I kept getting pissed, I had to ask myself why I kept playing a game I hate. When I couldn't come up with a viable answer, I left it.<br>
<br>
The easiest thing is just to turn it off...but for those who still find enjoyment in it, some of it has now been tainted because of this and that ain't right.<br>
<br>
Monsters respawn. Quests can be redone. This cannot. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">Mysidia Drakkenbane</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
