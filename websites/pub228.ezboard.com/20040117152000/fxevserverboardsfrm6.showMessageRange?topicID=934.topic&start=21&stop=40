One says to the others, &quot;Ya know, I think I'm gonna call the Guinness Book of World Records people.  I am SURE I have the smallest hands in the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other two nod.  That's a good idea.  The second leprechaun says, &quot;I think I'll talk to them too.  I'm CERTAIN I have the smallest feet in the world.&quot;  They others take a look and agree, he probably does.<br>
<br>
The third leprechaun says, &quot;While you're at it, I'll talk to them too.  I bet I have the smallest dick in the world!&quot;  The other two figure they'll take his word for it...<br>
<br>
<br>
Later, they go to the Guiness Book of World Records office together.  The first leprechaun goes in, gets measured, and comes out.  &quot;Good news!  It turns out I *DO* have the smallest hands in the world!&quot;  <br>
<br>
The other two congratulate him heartily, and the second leprechaun goes in.  A few minutes later he comes out with a huge grin.  &quot;Good news, I am also in the book, I have the smallest feet in the world!&quot;  <br>
<br>
After much congratulations, the third leprechaun goes into the office.  Some time passes, then he comes out with a confused look on his face.<br>

<br>
One woman in particular loses it. Screaming, she stands up in the front of the plane. 'I'm too young to die!' she wails. Then she yells, 'Well, if I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on Earth to be memorable! I've had plenty of sex in my life, but no one has ever made me really feel like a woman! Well I've had it! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a WOMAN??'  <br>
<br>
For a moment there is silence.  <br>
<br>
Everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate creature in the front of the plane.  <br>
<br>
Then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane. 'I can make you feel like a woman,' he says.  <br>
<br>
He's gorgeous. Tall, well built, with long flowing black hair and jet black eyes, he starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt, one button at a time.  <br>
<br>
No one moves.  <br>
<br>
The woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the strange man approaches.  <br>
<br>
He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest.  <br>
<br>
As he reaches her, and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, he whispers:  <br>
<br>
'Iron this.'<br>

A woman gets home, screeches her car into the driveway, runs into the house,slams the door and shouts at the top of her lungs, &quot;Honey, pack your bags. I won the lottery!&quot; <br>
<br>
The husband says, &quot;Oh my God! What should I pack, beach stuff or mountain stuff?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Doesn't matter,&quot; she says. &quot;Just get the hell out.&quot; <br>

<br>
According to today's regulators and bureaucrats, those of us who were kids in the 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's or even the early 80's, probably shouldn't have survived. <br>
<br>
Our baby cribs were covered with bright colored lead-based paint and we cut our first teeth on that paint. <br>
<br>
We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets, and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. (Not to mention the risks we took hitchhiking.) <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
As children, we would ride in cars with no seat belts or air bags and we stood in the front seat behind our parent's right arm so that the arm could hold us safely in a quick stop. <br>
<br>
Riding in the back of a pickup truck on a warm day was always a special treat. <br>
<br>
We drank water from the garden hose and not from a bottle. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We ate cupcakes, bread and butter, and drank soda pop with sugar in it, but we were never overweight because we were always outside playing. <br>
<br>
We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle, and no one actually died from this. <br>
<br>
We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then rode down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem. <br>
<br>
We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came on. <br>
<br>
No one was able to reach us all day. No cell phones or pagers. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We did not have Playstations, Nintendo 64, X-Boxes, no video games at all, no 99 channels on cable, videotape movies, surround sound, personal cell phones, personal computers, or Internet chat rooms. <br>
<br>
Those of us who grew up in the 30's and 40's didn't have television.. <br>
<br>
We had friends! We went outside and found them. <br>
<br>
We played kick the can, Olley-Olley-Ox-In-Free, Hide-N-Seek, street hockey, dodge ball, and sometimes, the ball would really hurt. <br>
<br>
We fell out of trees, got cut and broke bones and teeth, and there were no lawsuits from these accidents. They were accidents. No one was to blame but us. Remember accidents? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
We had fights and punched each other and got black and blue and learned to get over it. <br>
<br>
We made up games with sticks and tennis balls and ate worms, and although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes, nor did the worms live inside us forever. <br>
<br>
We rode bikes or walked to a friend's home and knocked on the door, or rang the bell or just walked in and talked to them. <br>
<br>
Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. Some students weren't as smart as others, so they failed a grade and were held back to repeat the same grade. Horrors! Tests were not adjusted for any reason. <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Our actions were our own. Consequences were expected, one to hide behind. The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke a law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law. Imagine that! <br>
<br>
Heaven forbid that we should get into trouble at school. Worse consequences were waiting at home when our parents found out about it. <br>
<br>
This generation has produced some of the best risk-takers and problem solvers and inventors, ever. <br>
<br>
The past 70 years have been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned how to deal with it all. <br>
<br>
And you're one of them. Congratulations!<br>

<br>
I went to the store the other day, and I was in there for only about 5 minutes. When I came out there was a motorcycle cop writing a parking ticket.<br>
<br>
So, I went up to him and said, &quot;Come on, buddy, how about giving a guy a break?&quot;<br>
<br>
He ignored me and continued writing the ticket. So I called him a pencil-necked Nazi.<br>
<br>
He glared at me and started writing another ticket for worn tires! So I called him a piece of horse shit. He finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first.<br>
<br>
Then he started writing a third ticket! This went on for about 20 minutes... the more I abused him, the more tickets he wrote.<br>
<br>
<br>
I didn't care. <br>
<br>
My car was parked around the corner. I try to have a little fun each day. It's important.<br>

The study took two years and cost over $1.2 million. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. <br>
<br>
After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study was incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of $2 million, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. <br>
<br>
When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didnt really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around $75.00 ( 3 cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead!<br>

In the window display she saw a pair of shoes she wouldn't mind owning. The lady goes into the store, and is greeted by a salesman, and she explains that she would like to try on the shoes she saw in the window. The salesman asks her shoe size, goes to the back room, and momentarily returns with the shoes. <br>
<br>
Being an old fashioned shoe store, the salesman sits down in front of the woman, and places the shoes on her feet. Well, the lady, being rather typical and not being able to make up her mind decided she'd rather try on a different pair of shoes, so the salesman returns to the backroom, and again sits down in front of the lady to try the shoes on her. As he sits down this time, he notices that the woman is not wearing any underwear.  <br>
<br>
As I said, she is a typical woman, and simply cannot make up her mind, so she tries on several pairs of shoes, each time with the salesman trying them on her feet. After several pairs of shoes the salesman is getting a bit hot and bothered, and tells the woman &quot;You know what I'd like to do to you? I'd like to put ice cream on your pussy and lick it all off.&quot; The woman is outraged, whacks the salesman over the head with her purse, and storms out of the store. <br>
<br>
When the womans husband gets home from work that evening, she tells him about her experience at the shoe store, and he just kinda shrugs it off. The woman, still outraged demands to know why he isn't going to do anything about it. Her husband looks at her and says &quot;well, there are 3 reasons actually.... 1) you don't need ANOTHER pair of shoes, 2) you shouldn't have been out shopping without any underwear on, and 3) no one in the world could eat THAT much ice cream!&quot;<br>

Three couples, an elderly couple, a middle-aged couple and a young newlywed couple wanted to join a church. The pastor said, &quot;We have special requirements for new parishioners. You must abstain from having sex for two weeks.&quot;<br>
<br>
The couples agreed and came back at the end of two weeks.<br>
<br>
The pastor went to the elderly couple and asked, &quot;Were you able to abstain from sex for the two weeks?&quot;<br>
<br>
The old man replied, &quot;No problem at all, Pastor.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Congratulations! Welcome to the church!&quot; said the pastor.<br>
<br>
The pastor went to the middle-aged couple and asked,<br>
&quot;Well, were you able to abstain from sex for the two weeks?&quot;<br>
<br>
The man replied, &quot;The first week was not too bad. The second week I had to sleep on the couch for a couple of nights but, yes, we made it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Congratulations! Welcome to the church!&quot; said the pastor.<br>
<br>
The pastor then went to the newlywed couple and asked, &quot;Well, were you able to abstain from sex for two weeks?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No Pastor, we were not able to go without sex for the two weeks,&quot; the young man replied sadly.<br>
<br>
&quot;What happened?&quot; inquired the pastor.<br>
<br>
&quot;My wife was reaching for a can of paint on the top shelf and dropped it. When she bent over to pick it up, I was overcome with lust and took<br>
advantage of her right there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You understand, of course, this means you will not be welcome in our church,&quot; stated the pastor.<br>
<br>
&quot;We know,&quot; said the young man,<br>
<br>
 &quot;We're not welcome at Home Depot anymore either.&quot; <p><br>

<br>
She mounts the horse unassisted and the horse immediately springs into motion. It gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, but the blonde begins to slip from the saddle. In terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot seem to get a firm grip. <br>
<br>
She tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway. The horse gallops along, seemingly impervious to its slipping rider. <br>
<br>
Finally, giving up her frail grip, she leaps away from the horse to try and throw herself to safety. Unfortunately, her foot has become entangled in the stirrup and she is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground again and again. <br>
<br>
As her head is battered against the ground, she is mere moments away from unconsciousness when...<br>

When everyone gathered, the employer, who understood the benifits of having fun, told the burnt-out staff the purpose of the meeting was to have a quick contest.<br>
<br>
The theme was Viagra advertising slogans.  The only rule was that they had to use past ad slogans, originally written for other products, that captured the essence of Viagra.  Slight variations were acceptable.<br>
<br>
About 7 minutes later, they turned in their suggestions and created a Top Ten List.  After all the laughter and camaraderie, the rest of the week went very well for everyone.<br>
<br>
The Top Ten:<br>
<br>
10.  Viagra, Whaazzzzz Up!<br>
<br>
9.  Viagra, The quicker pecker upper.<br>
<br>
8.  Viagra, Like a rock!<br>
<br>
7.  Viagra, When it absolutely, positively has to be there over night.<br>
<br>
6.  Viagra, Be all that you can be.<br>
<br>
5.  Viagra, Reach out and touch someone.<br>
<br>
4.  Viagra, Strong enough for a man, but made for a woman.<br>
<br>
3.  Viagra, Tastes great!  More filling!<br>
<br>
2.  Viagra, We bring good things to life!<br>

He runs over to the only farmhouse nearby to ask for shelter for the night. The door is opened by a grizzly old farmer and his gorgeous young wife, and they agree to let him stay over. However, the farmer tells him, &quot;we have only one bed, so you'll have to share it with me and the missus&quot;.<br>
<br>
At night, the gorgeous young wife has been making eyes at the salesman, and he finally succumbs to lust. <br>
<br>
&quot;But&quot; he asks her, &quot;how can we do this when your husband is sleeping right here beside us?&quot;<br>
&quot;Not to worry&quot; she says, &quot;I know him to be a very sound sleeper, and to prove it to you, I'm going to pluck a hair from his arse, and he will not stir&quot;.<br>
<br>
The wife does exactly that, and sure enough, the farmer hasnt twitched a muscle. So they make out and have a gala time. Half an hour later, the wife is making eyes at the salesman again. Once again, the salesman is apprehensive, but the wife pulls another hair from her husbands arse to reassure him, and they make love again. This happens half-a-dozen times during the night, when finally, after another hair has been plucked from his arse, the farmer shouts - &quot;Look, I dont mind you staying at my home, sleeping on my bed and screwing my wife, but goddamn stop using my arse as a scoreboard !&quot;<br>

The questions are NOT difficult.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  1. How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe, and close the door. This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an overly complicated way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Did you say, &quot; Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant, and close the refrigerator? &quot; (Wrong Answer) Correct Answer: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant and close the door. This tests your ability to think through the repercussions of your previous actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals attend except one. Which animal does not attend?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Correct Answer: The Elephant. The elephant is in the refrigerator. You just put him in there. This tests your memory. OK, even if you did not answer the first three questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your true abilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. There is a river you must cross but it is inhabited by crocodiles. How do you manage it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Correct Answer: You swim across. All the crocodiles are attending the Animal Meeting. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.<br>
<br>
According to Anderson Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the professionals they tested got all questions wrong. But many preschoolers got several correct answers. Anderson Consulting says this conclusively disproves the theory that most professionals have the brains of a four year old.<br>

 <br>
A man and his wife are in court getting a divorce. <br>
The problem was who should get custody of the child. <br>
The wife jumped up and said, &quot;Your Honor, I brought the child into this world with pain and labor. She should be in my custody.&quot; <br>
<br>
The judge turns to the husband and says, &quot;What do you have to say in your defense?&quot; <br>
<br>
The man sat for a while contemplating... then slowly rose. <br>
&quot;Your Honor, if I put a dollar in a vending machine and a Pepsi comes out... whose Pepsi is it...the machine's or mine?&quot;  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2002-8/44015/image4.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
