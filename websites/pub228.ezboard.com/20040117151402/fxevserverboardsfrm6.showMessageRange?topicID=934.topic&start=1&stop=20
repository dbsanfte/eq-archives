Not wanting any tan lines to show, he sunbathed in the nude.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the young man fell asleep while on the roof, and managed to get sunburned on his &quot;tool.&quot; Being very determined the young man decided not to miss his date because it was with a hot blonde. So, he put some lotion on his manhood and wrapped it in gauze, feeling this should resolve his painful situation.<br>
<br>
The blonde showed up for the date at his apartment, and the young man treated her to a home-cooked dinner, after which they went into the living room to watch a movie. During the movie, the sunburn started acting up. After several minutes of extreme discomfort he asked to be excused. A friend had told him that milk was very effective in reducing sunburn pain so he went to the kitchen, and poured a tall, cold glass of milk.<br>
<br>
He then placed his sunburned member in the milk and experienced immediate relief.<br>
<br>
The blonde, however, wondering what he was doing, wandered into the kitchen to find him with &quot;Johnson&quot; immersed in a glass of milk.<br>
<br>
With a look of understanding the blonde exclaimed, &quot;So that's how you load those things.&quot;<br>

From the State of Texas, where drinking and driving is considered a sport, comes a true story about drinking wisely. Recently a routine police patrol was parked outside a local neighborhood bar. Late in the evening the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated that he could barely walk.<br>
<br>
The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes with the officer quietly observing. After what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his own car, which he fell into. He was there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off. Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a dry night), flicked the hazard flasher on and off, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and then remained stationary for a few more minutes as more patrons left in their vehicles. At last he pulled out of the parking lot and started to drive slowly down the street. <br>
<br>
The police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a Breathalyzer test. To his amazement the Breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol at all! <br>
<br>
Dumbfounded, the officer said &quot;I'll have to ask you to accompany me to the Police station. This Breathalyzer equipment must be broken.&quot;<br>
&quot;I doubt it,&quot; said the man, &quot;Tonight I'm the designated decoy.&quot;<br>

<br>
A Husband Shopping Center has opened where a woman can go to choose a husband from among many men. It is laid out in five floors, and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the flights.<br>
<br>
There is, however, a catch. As you arrive on any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down, except to exit the building. So, a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. <br>
<br>
On the first floor the sign says:<br>
Floor 1: These men have jobs and love kids. The woman reads the sign. &quot;Well that's better than not having jobs, or not loving kids, but I wonder what's further up?&quot; So up she goes. T<br>
<br>
The second floor sign says: <br>
Floor 2: These men have high paying jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking. &quot;Hmmm, better.&quot; says the woman. &quot;But, I wonder what's further up?&quot; <br>
<br>
The third floor sign reads: <br>
Floor 3: These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, and help with the housework. &quot;Wow,&quot; says the woman, &quot;very tempting. BUT, there must be better further up!&quot; And, again, she goes up.<br>
<br>
On the fourth floor the sign reads: <br>
Floor 4: These men have high paying jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework, and have a strong romantic streak. &quot;Oh, mercy me! But just think...what must be awaiting me further on? So up to the fifth floor she goes. <br>
<br>
The sign on that door says: Floor 5: This floor is just to prove that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping and have a nice day.<br>

So the husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife didn't want to have any more children. <br>
The doctor told him there was a procedure called a vasectomy that would fix the problem but it was expensive. A less costly alternative was to go home, get a firework, light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10. <br>
<br>
The Scouser said to the doctor, &quot;I may not be the smartest guy In the world, but I don't see how putting a firework in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me.&quot; <br>
 <br>
&quot;Trust me, it will do the job&quot;, said the doctor. <br>
 <br>
So the man went home, lit a banger and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count: &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5,&quot; at which point he  paused, placed the beer can between his legs so he could continue counting on his other hand. <br>
 <br>
This procedure also works in Birmingham, Manchester, parts of Essex ,inner London, Newcastle, Norfolk and anywhere in Wales. <br>

could help her. To his shock, and utter delight, she lifts her<br>
designer dress, and points to her left inner thigh... very high up... <br>
&quot;Right here,&quot; she says, &quot; I want you to tattoo a turkey with the word <br>
'Thanksgiving' under it.&quot;<br>

Then she points to her right inner thigh... just as high up, and says, <br>
&quot;On this side, I want you to tattoo a Christmas tree, with lights and <br>
tinsel, and an angel on top,and underneath the tree I want the word <br>
'Christmas'.<br>
<br>
The tattoo artist looks at her puzzled. He says,&quot; Lady it's none of my<br>
business, but that is the most unusual request I have ever had. Why in <br>
the world would you want that?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; the lady said, &quot;I am sick and tired of my husband always <br>

26 things to do in an elevator<br>
1) When there's only one other person in the elvator, <br>
tap him/her on the shoulder and then pretend it wasn't <br>
you. <br>
<br>
2) Push the buttons and pretend they give you a shock. <br>
Smile, and go back for more. <br>
<br>
3) Ask if you can push the button for other people, <br>
but push the wrong ones. <br>
<br>
4) Call the Psychic Hotline from your cell phone and <br>
ask if they know what floor your on. <br>
<br>
5) Hold the doors open and say your waiting for a <br>
friend. After a while, let the doors close, and say, <br>
&quot;Hi Greg. How's your day been?&quot; <br>
<br>
6) Drop a pen and wait until someone goes to pick it <br>

The Italian proclaimed, &quot;I love Spaghetti, but if giving it up will grant me another chance at life, so be it!&quot;  *POOF* the Italian was back on earth.<br>

The Millionaire proclaimed, &quot;I love Money, but I would certainly rather be a poor man then a dead man.&quot; *POOF* the millionaire was back on earth.<br>

The Gay man proclaimed, &quot;I love anal sex, but I guess I could do without it for another chance at life.&quot; *POOF* the gay man was back on earth.<br>
<br>
A week later, the three friends were walking through downtown when the Italian spotted a restaurant featuring &quot;All you can eat spaghetti for $3.&quot;  This was too good a deal for the Italian to pass up, so he ran in and stuffed himself.  *POOF* the Italian was sent back to heaven.<br>

The Millionaire and the gay man, continued to walk down the street.  The Millionaire spotted a $20 bill on the sidewalk.  He bent over to pick it up, then *POOF* the gay man was sent to heaven. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tryonb>TryonB</A> at: 8/11/03 10:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jabul>Jabul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#330000>(8/12/03 12:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=934.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More jokes, just cuz..</span><hr size=1> lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :pointlaugh --><img src=http://216.40.249.192/s/contrib/blackeye/lol.gif ALT=":pointlaugh"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

after the wife went to bed.  He handed her two pills and told <br>
her, &quot;Here, take these.&quot; <br>
<br>
She asked, &quot;What are these?&quot;  <br>
<br>
He told her, &quot;They're aspirins.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;But,&quot; she said with a quizzical look, &quot;I don't have a <br>
headache.&quot;<br>
<br>
To which he replies, &quot;Good, let's fuck.&quot;<br>
<br>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
Two weeks ago was my 45th birthday and I wasn't feeling too <br>
good that morning. I went to breakfast knowing my wife would <br>
be pleasant and say, &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot;, and probably have a <br>
present for me.<br>
 <br>
As it turned out, she didn't even say good morning, let alone <br>
any happy birthday. I thought, well, that's wives for you, the <br>
children will remember..<br>
 <br>
The children came in to breakfast and didn't say a word. So <br>
when I left for the office, I was feeling pretty low and <br>
despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary Janet <br>
said, &quot;Good morning, Boss. &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. And I felt a <br>
little better that someone had remembered. I worked until noon, <br>
then Janet knocked on my door and said, &quot;You know, it's such <br>
a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go to <br>
lunch, just you and me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;By George, that's the greatest thing I've heard all <br>
day. Let's go!&quot; We went to lunch.<br>
 <br>
We didn't go where we normally go; instead we went out to a <br>
private little place. We had two martinis and enjoyed lunch <br>
tremendously.<br>
<br>
On the way back to the office, she said, &quot;You know, it's such <br>
a beautiful day. We don't need to go back to the office, do <br>
we?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I said, &quot;No, I guess not.&quot;<br>
 <br>
She said, &quot;Let's go to my apartment.&quot;<br>
 <br>
After arriving at her apartment she said, &quot;Boss, if you don't <br>
mind, I think I'll go into the bedroom and slip into something <br>
more comfortable&quot; &quot;Sure!&quot; I excitedly replied.<br>
<br>
She went into the bedroom and, in about six minutes, she came <br>
out carrying a huge birthday cake ----- followed by my wife, <br>
children, and dozens of our friends, all singing Happy <br>
Birthday.<br>
 <br>
And I just sat there ----<br>
 <br>
on the couch ----<br>
 <br>
naked.<br>

A newlywed couple had only been married for a few weeks. The <br>
husband, although very much in love, couldn't wait to get out <br>
on the town and party with his old buddies.<br>
<br>
So, he says to his new wife, &quot;Honey, I'll be right back.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you going, coochy-coo...?&quot; asked the wife. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to the bar, pretty face, to have a beer.&quot; <br>
<br>
The wife says, &quot;You want a beer, my love?&quot; She opens the door <br>
to the refrigerator and shows him 25 different brands of beers <br>
from 12 different countries. The husband didn't know what to <br>
do.<br>
<br>
The only thing that he could to say was, &quot;Yes, but at the <br>
bar...you know ...they have...frozen mugs.&quot; <br>
<br>
He didn't get to finish the sentence. The wife interrupted him, <br>
saying, &quot;You want a frozen glass, puppy face?&quot; She opened the <br>
freezer and handed him a frozen solid mug.<br>
<br>
The husband, looking a bit pale, said, &quot;Yes, tootsie roll, <br>
but at the bar they have those special hors d'oeuvres that are <br>
really delicious... won't be too long...I'll be right back...<br>
I promise. OK?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You want hors d'oeuvres, poochy poo?&quot; She opened the oven <br>
and took out 5 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: spicy <br>
chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, fried mushrooms, pork <br>
strips, cheese dip, the works. <br>
<br>
&quot;But sweetie, at the bar...you know...the guys are cussing and<br>
swearing...&quot; <br>
<br>
Before he could finish, the wife replies, &quot;You want cussing <br>
and swearing, cutie pie?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;THEN LISTEN UP, DICKHEAD! DRINK YOUR FUCKIN BEER IN THIS GODDAMN FROZEN MUG, AND EAT YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING OUT WITH YOUR SHITHEAD FRIENDS ANYMORE! YOU GOT THAT, ASSHOLE???&quot;<br>

A man is driving down a deserted highway, and notices a sign <br>
that reads...<br>
SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - 10 MILES<br>
<br>
He thinks it was a figment of his imagination and just drives <br>
on.<br>
<br>
Soon, he sees another sign which says...<br>
SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - 5 MILES<br>
<br>
Realizing these signs are for real, he drives on, and sure <br>
enough, there is a third sign...<br>
SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - NEXT RIGHT<br>
<br>
His curiosity gets the best of him, and he pulls into the <br>
driveway. On the far side of the parking lot, is a somber stone <br>
building with a sign on the door that reads...<br>
SISTERS OF MERCY HOUSE OF PROSTITUTION - WELCOME<br>
<br>
He climbs the steps, rings the bell, and the door is answered <br>
by a nun in a long black habit, who asks... &quot;What may we do <br>
for you my son?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I saw your signs along the highway, and was interested in <br>
possibly doing some business,&quot; he answers.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well, my son. Please follow me,&quot; says the nun. The nun <br>
stops at a closed door and tells the man, &quot;Please, knock on <br>
this door&quot; and leaves.<br>
<br>
The man does as he is told and this door is opened by another <br>
nun in a long black habit, holding a tin cup. This nun <br>
instructs: &quot;Please place $50.00 in the cup, then go through <br>
the large wooden door at the end of this hallway.&quot;<br>
<br>
He places the money in this nun's tin cup. He trots eagerly <br>
down the hallway, and slips through the door, pulling it shut. <br>
As the door locks behind him, he finds himself back in the <br>
parking lot, facing another small sign: <br>
<br>
&quot;Go in Peace. You have just been screwed by the Sisters of <br>
Mercy.&quot;<br>

Pa replies, &quot;There ain't nuthin wrong with the outhouse.&quot; <br>

Ma says, &quot;Ya have to stick yur head in the hole to see what to fix.&quot; <br>

So with that, Pa sticks his head in the hole, looks around and yells back, <br>
&quot;Ma!  There ain't nuthin wrong with this outhouse!&quot; <br>

Ma hollers back, &quot;Now take your head out of the hole!&quot; <br>

They <br>
turned on a night light, turned the answering machine on the phone line, <br>
covered their pet parakeet and put the cat in the backyard. <br>
<br>
<br>
They phoned the local cab company and requested a taxi. The taxi <br>
arrived and the couple opened the front door to leave their house. The cat <br>
they had put out into the yard scoots back into the house. <br>
<br>
They don't want the cat shut in the house because &quot;she&quot; always tries to eat the bird. The wife goes out to the taxi while the husband goes inside to get <br>
the cat. The cat runs upstairs, the man in hot pursuit. <br>
<br>
The wife doesn't want the driver to know the house will be empty. She explains to the taxi driver that her husband will be out soon.&quot;He's just going upstairs to say goodbye to my mother.&quot; A few minutes later, the husband gets into the cab. &quot;Sorry I took so long,&quot; he says, as they drive away. <br>
<br>
&quot;Stupid bitch was hiding under the bed. Had to poke her with a coat hanger to <br>
get her to come out! Then I had to wrap her in a blanket to keep her from scratching me. But it worked. I hauled her fat ass downstairs and threw her out into the back yard!&quot; <br>
<br>
The cabdriver hit a parked car...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=usildordhujata>Usildor Dhujata</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 367<br> <font color=#330000>(8/24/03 8:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=934.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/poeticsarcasm/images/marblemn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More jokes, just cuz..</span><hr size=1> A man and his wife are laying in bed one evening.

Wife:  Hunny...if I died, would you remarry?<br>
<br>
Husband:  (sigh of disgust)  Do we HAVE to have this conversation?<br>
<br>
Wife:  I just want to know.  Seriously, would you?<br>
