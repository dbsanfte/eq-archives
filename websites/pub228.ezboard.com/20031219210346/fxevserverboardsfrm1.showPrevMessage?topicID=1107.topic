You'd think it would be trivial nowadays, and personally, I've been in a couple of one-group Fear breaks.  In fact, I'm prepared to bet that a necromancer could probably break Fear solo.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, a Fear CR is still a nasty thing.  I think that most of us have probably spent a few hours of our lives outside that portal in the Feerrott from time to time, and I still remember my early Fear breaks when, on one occasion, we had to ask OC to come and get our corpses for us.  It's an unpleasant memory, and for that reason I tend to be sympathetic towards people with corpses lost in Fear.<br>
<br>
Well, last night, I got a tell from an ex-guildie of mine by the name of Gregadore.  He told me that Anderin, another ex-guildie, had lost a corpse in Fear and they were trying to put together a CR team, and would I mind coming to help out?<br>
<br>
I learned later that Anderin had zoned into Fear to try to scout for Cazic Thule.  Apparently he'd forgotten that you can't just zone out again.  Not the most intelligent move ever, but then, I've done a fair few stupider things myself, so let's not be too harsh on him.<br>
<br>
Anderin's in Peritus nowadays, and what with one thing and the other, I'm not exactly a big fan of Peritus as a whole.  Nevertheless, an ex-guildie is an ex-guildie and a Fear CR is a Fear CR, so I explained the situation to my LDoN group and agreed to come.<br>
<br>
My friend Genadine from BC happened to be grouped with me at the time, and she asked if I wanted a hand.  I'm rather glad she came along, what with the way things worked out.<br>
<br>
Well, we put together a force of eleven people (surely enough for a Fear break, you'd think) and zoned in.  We didn't have a mezzer or a slower or a haster, but what the heck, those mobs are light blue so we just went for it.  The force comprised me, Genadine, Ayanla and Gregadore from Sojourners Compass, a couple of other people and a bunch of Peritus.<br>
<br>
We weren't lucky with the first attempt, getting a bunch of scarelings.  Less than a minute into the break, my connection went down, leaving the raid force with Gregadore - who's not a bad player at all, but he's level 59 and he was insanely tired at the time - as the only healer.  Realizing that we were possibly going to wipe, Laralamour - our group's evaccer - apparently gated rather than evaccing.  (I was LD at the time, so here I'm relying on what I was told later).  Wipe.<br>
<br>
I logged back in as fast as possible, and Genadine was the only person alive in the zone, kiting around most of Fear.  I tried to camp, got aggro, DB'ed, and gated, so Genadine died.<br>
<br>
Fine, okay, it went badly but we'd killed a few of them and there were a pile of corpses at the ledge.  We suggested that Genadine, Laralamour and I would have another go, but Laralamour felt we didn't stand a chance and refused to help.  Okay... in order to avoid a lengthy CR (*bitter laughter*), I decided I'd try it solo. The plan was, invis up, run in, and make it to the ledge with root and pacification.<br>
<br>
This worked, up to a point.  Although invis wore off, I'd made it to the Fear ledge, but I'd left a couple of rooted mobs behind me, so I camped out the aggro.<br>
<br>
Camped back in again, rezzed Genadine, healed her up.  No aggro yet, so I tried to grab another body (it was Ayanla's).  Damn, I'd brought five.  Couldn't keep them all rooted, dead again, but Genadine camped in Fear safely.<br>
<br>
Gena rezzed me and tried to CR, ended up kiting half the plane around.  I died again to adds.<br>
<br>
At this point, my friend Kitilana (again from BC) decided that she'd come out and help us.  We all consented her and she dragged the bodies to the zone in; we put together a rescue force (i.e. a rescue force for the rescue force) and tried to break the plane at ZI.  Still no mezzer, haster, or slower, though, and a scareling got away.  Break force trained, wipe.<br>
<br>
No worries, Kiti still alive, kiting most of Fear.  Zone in was clear, I had another go at the solo CR, and crashed.  Logged back in dead.<br>
<br>
Well, I could go on like this for quite a while.  Suffice it to say that by the end of it, it was 2am in Britain.  The CR had been going on for the best part of three hours - and from the original one ranger corpse in Fear, there was now an insane amount of carnage.  Personally, I had six corpses in there; times like this you appreciate having a full exp bar in 65.  Some people had delevelled from dying so often by now.<br>
<br>
Zinblade from Peritus put together a rescue force to rescue the rescue force which had failed to rescue the rescue force for Anderin.  This new force comprised a bunch more Peritus people and some of their friends, along with an additional group from Harmonic Chaos and Yeng from Harm.<br>
<br>
2:15am.  I had to be at work in 6 hours, and I was getting fairly snippy with people.  I broke a longstanding personal rule by giving out my login details to Kitilana and camping out.<br>
<br>
Well, I don't know what happened after that.  The rescue force to rescue the rescue force for the rescue force was presumably successful, because when I checked this morning, I was fully equipped and had most of my exp back.<br>
<br>
Time for a few expressions of thanks:  THANK YOU to my friends Genadine and Kitilana for blowing most of your evening trying to help me out!  Special thanks to Kitilana for CRing my six bodies in my absence.  Thanks to all of the other rescuers, particularly Ayanla, Gregadore, Inferia, Yeng, the Harmonic Chaos people and everyone else who showed up to help out when your guild didn't have anyone who was in trouble.<br>
<br>
And a /bonk for Anderin for going into Fear without a means of escape!  Learn yer lesson, phewl.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>_________________<br>

Fear is always fun, the first 5 minutes.<br>

How can anyone with succor spells, use a gate instead of succor or at least agroup gate?<br>
<br>
With the instant succor it is possible for a druid to make a solo break in, I have no idea why a druid would want to but its doable <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=557206">Bippwinno Breedfoot</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Slight threadjack, as I have to pat my guildies on the back a bit.  Later that same night, we managed to kill Terror with just two groups.  I know that's no huge accomplishment for most of the higher powered guilds out there, but it was quite a nice milestone for our humble guild. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :gimmebeer --><img src=http://members.cox.net/skoriksis/smilies/gimmiebeer.gif ALT=":gimmebeer"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Athcaldonor (wizard) has been bound in PoF for months at a time, and has broken Fear solo so many times I've lost track.<br>

Your adventure sounds like a bit of a 'bang-your-head agsainst the well' situation. I hate having to CR or do multiple CRs when it's late at night, or you're running late for some RL thing.<br>

<br>
As far as dying in the first place, I was always told you can zone out the same way you zone in *shrug* big deal, the person who told me that repeatedly is having a load of giggles about it. I will say this though, I am sorry for the rude comments I made at the time about people's listening skills. However, in heat of the moment I was a little ticked, so yeah i was a bastard.<br>
<br>
Big thanks to Harmonic Chaos, my heros <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :yourock --><img src=http://www.gue.ca/Smilies/sign-yourock.gif ALT=":yourock"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Thanks to those who came to help out with the corpse recovery, even if it turned in a god awful mess.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rainwalkertatterheart>Rainwalker Tatterheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#330000>(12/15/03 8:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1130.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.brotherhoodunited.com/images/face/rain.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anderin's Plane of Fear adventure!</span><hr size=1> Glad we could be of help to the folks in trouble that night. We almost didn't show up, as it turns out. My son, Tuville, stopped by the Fear portal and saw all the people there. We then canceled our trip there, assuming PoF was taken for the night. He happened to talk briefly to one of the folks there, only to find out that it was a massive CR going on to retreive one dead ranger.<br>
<br>
The dead were most patient while we grouped, buffed, and broke into Fear, then worked with the BC Rogue that was there (Kitlana, I think) to get the CR rolling. I know from my own past history how much it sucks to sit outside that portal waiting for someone else to get me out.<br>
