I said people didn't have to click the thread.  They knew what we were doing, which acutally towards the end was back on topic the the HS zombie storyline, and the main point was to keep the topic line infront of people. And unlike the links, the post were not just a redirection to something else from someone that had no interest in this site.<br>
<br>
So what you would like Maus is that anytime the thread becomes two people talking basicly to each other (which many have, a lot of them one of the two people being you) and it isn't what is in the subject line we should just lock the thread, because people can't be self-reliant to not click it. <p>Wrin ~Benevolent princess of the Bouncy Grrlz

You are splitting hairs Wrin, no one had to click the thread with &quot;new&quot; next to it to find that it was a spam link (it was spam btw I was just being an asshat), just like no one had to click on the HS thread when it had &quot;new&quot; next to it.<br>

Now who's the mindreader?  Tibult wasn't trying to keep it up to preserve it.  He specifically said that he was making a joke or mockery of the thread because it annoyed him greatly.  He had NO INTENTION of keeping it to the front for others to see and WANTED to see it banned.  You too blind to see that?  You need Hooked on Phonics...or Stuck on Stupid...or something!<br>
<br>
I'm sure some people didn't click it.  But it became an annoyance to see what it was about.  So when they DID click it, and they see all this shit going on in the thread that has NOTHING to do with Hawkestone that had gone on for about what....a good....17 pages, it gave them more incentive to see the thread locked.<br>
<br>
What YOU wanted and what Tibult wanted were two entirely different things and you were going at it on a topic of no relevance for entirely different reasons.  He wasn't looking out for you, and I'm certain he'll say so to you.<br>
<br>
It's apparent that all the text is fucking with your head, hence why you only snip the first thing that stands out and reply to that.  Coming up with a /ooc &quot;ramsuck&quot; shows that there's serious strain to your brain.

Because you kept clicking of your own free will it became an annoyance?  Sorry but you do acutally have to try to take some reponisblity for your action.  The first time you clicked it after we took it over, fine.  Even the second or third, becuase you may have been double checking.  But after 10 pages it's your fucking fault that you clicked.

<br>
Ok, let’s start here<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No, you weren't just referring to Maus. Go read the stuff you posted in that thread<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Are you talking about the HS thread or this one?  If you are talking about the HS thread, I don’t even remember which time you were talking about.  Honestly, I haven’t even looked at it since Mys locked it, and have no intention of so doing.  If you are talking about times I said in THIS thread “YOU yourself asked for it to be locked” etc etc etc … then I was speaking directly to Maus at that point.  Several times since in several threads I have made mention that he and I both wanted the same thing, I just went about getting it in a more obnoxious way.  Let’s put it like this….<br>
If Maus was the kid that says “Hey mom, can I have some candy,” then I was the one that said “can I ? huh? Please? Can I? Please? Can I oh please? I been good, I deserve it , can I ? please please please?”  Was I right, HELL NO, but in the end, I go the damn thing locked.  Also, I didn’t step in and take over because I thought the idea was dumb (though I did).  I thought people should have a space to vent and even joined in when HS came off as total assholes when I tried to ask them why they did it.  It doesn’t mean I was any more right or wrong for making a joke of it later on, but I did, and that was my choice so to do. When I stepped in, people were just bumping it because they were mad about whatever.  MAUS asked for it to be locked, he was told “No” (do I have to go look up the post?), it was bumped AGAIN (NOT by me) and I decided enough was enough.  You may not agree with my actions, and I have no intention of doing it again… but it was what I chose to do.  The thread was locked, and hasn’t been back since.<br>
That’s what I wanted.<br>
I GOT my candy, and so did Maus.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They just made it worse, and you took the bait.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Not exactly.  They gave me something to run with so I could make all of you so damn sick of it that this thread would NEVER come back again.  Yes, I was risking a ban for doing this, but it was a risk I was willing to take.  Also, Mys DID warn me once to knock it off or she would ban me … and I DID stop (another incident).  In that way, I will tell Wrin she needs to back the fuck down.  Mys let this go for a LONG time before she finally (thankfully) locked it.  I made a joke of it.  I was making fun of people that were STILL trying to take this seriously.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And I am no one to criticize what they felt. Neither are you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I understand your point about a new thread … but why?  It loses its effect if I start a new thread, my point was that this was a FAR dead horse and I was tired of seeing it.  My way of showing that was to punish everyone by throwing this thread in everyone’s face for 20+ pages.<br>
Mys locked it.  I would say it worked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's their business. Their duty. Their decision to decide if they want to see it up or not. It is not yours.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
No, but I can react to it.  This is what I was doing.  You may think my reaction was unfair, but enough was enough.  I was sick of seeing this thread, and I wanted it to go away FOR GOOD.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If that's how you wanted it to live on, all I can say is...damn.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And all I can say is EXACTLY !!!  This was a joke in every way by the time I jacked it.  Ishkur, you and I almost NEVER see eye to eye (which surprises me, actually), but I did think that a server outrage over this was a bit over the top, JUST like you did.  Eventually, I turned it into a game, while most others kept crying “waaaa… they are making fun of us … waaa… make them shut up”.<br>
I want this to be remembered as the single biggest ridiculous joke on the Xev board.  To me, THAT is what it was. Sorry if you don’t see it this way, but I do.  If you want to bitch about it, FINE … do so.  But when it has all been said, SHUT UP for god’s sake.<br>
<br>
Or some obnoxious mother fucker may come jack your thread and use it to show you what a joke you are.<br>

Wrin, I wasn’t looking out for you.  The HS Zombie was because that god-damn thread would NOT DIE.  People kept replying to me even when I made it some insane joke with ridiculous post after ridiculous post.  This wasn’t to keep it at the front of people’s minds, but to illustrate how childish and stupid they were being by taking it so seriously.  The Hawkestone Zombie (a metaphor for that entire thread) was a symbol of that.<br>

I can't spoon feed it to you any more simply than that.  If you still don't get it, may I suggest you press the CTRL+ALT+DELETE buttons on your keyboard until the thread unlocks.<br>

Keep trying ... it will work eventually<br>

No, it's a bug in the EZ Board program ... your computer may reboot a few times, but eventually it will give you admin powers.<br>

I didn't and you gave me the means to do it.  You said you wouldn't post if people didn't reply to you.  So I replyed to you.  You said you wouldn't post if no one asked you a question. So I asked you questions.  If anything you didn't undersand what I was doing.  And yep I got to do it at the expense of people like Maus and Tib.  You put in the part about the HS zombie to show that you thought the thread was dead.  I used it to continue the thread in a new way.  <br>
<br>
And again....in we locked everythread that was no longer on topic and only had two people talking then most of the threads that you and Maus post to would be locked. <p>Wrin ~Benevolent princess of the Bouncy Grrlz

If that is to be the rule, then any thread that goes over 2 pages needs to be locked since they seldom stay on topic for the third page.  if you want to get right down to it, the HS thread stayed on topic for about 60 pages, buf jesus christ on a bouncing ball ... WHAT MORE NEEDED TO BE SAID?  It wasn't even new people, it was the same ones bringing up the same arguments about the same idiotic points htey had been for pages.  <br>
<br>
In a nutshell ... I reached my limit.  Instead of adding to the cry-babying everyone else was doing, (ie: Waaaa waaaaaaa..&gt; Tibult not play nice ... he make fun of me ... ban him waaa waaaa waaaaaaa /shitpants), I took action.<br>
<br>
The best part is that I made NO secret of it.  I said RIGHT up-front exactly what I was doing, and many of them STILL didn't get it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1115.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1115.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1115.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1115.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1115.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1115.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1115.topic&index=89><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1115.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.threadControl?topicID=1115.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1115.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1115.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub228.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="xevserverboardsfrm1">General Discussion<option value="xevserverboardsfrm7">Marketplace<option value="xevserverboardsfrm2">Raiding<option value="xevserverboardsfrm16">Poll Mania<option value="xevserverboardsfrm4">Epic Quests<option value="xevserverboardsfrm13">Trade Skills<option value="xevserverboardsfrm3">Tactics<option value="xevserverboardsfrm5">Questing<option value="xevserverboardsfrm9">Looking for Guild<option value="xevserverboardsfrm12">Guild Leading and Officership<option value="xevserverboardsfrm11">Guild Link Submission<option value="xevserverboardsfrm6">Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm26">Political Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm10">/ooc<option value="xevserverboardsfrm21">Rant Polls<option value="xevserverboardsfrm19">Archives<option value="xevserverboardsfrm15">Moderators Forum<option value="xevserverboardsfrm23">Über<option value="xevserverboardsfrm27">Ask the Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards>Xev Server Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6>Rants</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3e<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
