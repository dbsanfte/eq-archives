was not of a level to majorly upset any politician during that period of time. Most jews that died in the holocaust lived in Poland and the Ukraine. The mass murder tactics of the Nazis didn't start until the invasion of the USSR, and until after the US had made up their mind (1941, lend-lease, armed convoys etc).  And even then the US didn't declare war on Germany until after the Germans did so first.  Plus stopping the mass murder was never on the US agenda (the existence of extermination camps was known almost immediately, but never led to any changes in military strategy).<br>
The interesting question is then - why did the US not attack the USSR in 1941?  Stalin had murdered about 10 - 20 million of his own people by then over the last 15 years.<br>
This tells you clearly, that &quot;humanitarian&quot; concerns make a decent justification for war, but very rarely are the reason for it.<br>
To give you another example, for 50 years we have noted the violation of human rights and extermination (cultural and physical) in Tibet after the annexation by China. Nevertheless noone asks for an invasion of the area, despite the fact that China admittedly has WMDs too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260848">Shamu Whitewale</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If Hitler was in the same position as Saddam Houssein in that time and place, the world likely would have gone after him.  The point, I believe is that the world should have gone after him, not just one country.<br>
<br>
Saddam didn't pose an immediate threat to the outside world only to his own people, I agree with that.  It was becoming obvious that the world was not going to stand for it, but the US jumped the gun.  Support was long in coming, but we could not validly claim we needed to invade when we did, and the repercussions of that are becoming apparent now.<br>

<br>
Be warned it has not been totally proof read, nor does it contain everything that I haven't quite remembered.<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all, no weapons have been found.<br>
<br>
Most people seem to think this is pretty inconsequential, in fact it's very much a critical problem.<br>
<br>
It means one of the following. (by 'no weapons existed' I do not mean 'ever', I mean in the lead up to the war').<br>
<br>
1.) No weapons existed. We knew that.<br>
<br>
If this was true, it shows lack of trust in the public, they wouldn't have said because they knew we would not have supported the war. This is a bad thing, it would have shown that the truth is not what the government was really concerned with, only public opinion. <br>
<br>
2.) No weapons existed. We didn't know that.<br>
<br>
First of all, it would not have shown Iraqi compliance, as they didn't explain where it all went. It's a scary thought, that the US intelligence agencies couldn't work out where thousands of tonnes of biological and chemical weapons were, and what happened to them. If we claimed they existed, then had no evidence of where the hell they went, isn't it safe to assume that the US Intelligence is flawed in that respect. <br>
<br>
Seeing that the US intelligence was key to prooving 'threat' and 'capability' would this fact erode your confidence in those previous statements?<br>
<br>
3.) Weapons existed. We knew where they were.<br>
<br>
If we had known where the weapons were, we would have found them allready, it's relativley simple. It's kinda scary that we knew where they were, and that they could fall into the hands of the terrorists and now we don't know where the hell they are!<br>
<br>
4.) Weapons existed. We didn't know where they were.<br>
<br>
Remember, that this means the weapons 'existed' when the war started. Remember George Tennets report on Iraq Early October 2002? (I think), it claimed that Saddam hussein is most likely to give lots of weapons to Terrorists, and use those weapons if he thought it was his one of his last chances for vengance. This is the man who is head of the CIA.<br>
<br>
Do you find it scary that we ploughed in knowing he had shit loads of weapons, and that he is likely to give them to terrorists, but we thought it's not a big thing that we don't know where they are? Because I think that's a massive problem. <br>
<br>
Honestly speaking, we pretty much did know where they were. We gave lots of evidence to weapons inspectors in the attempts of catching them with their pants down. The intelligence however, came to nothing. The type of clean up operation that would have gone on in the sites that were given to inspectors, would have been so unbelievabely massive, it would have taken incompotence on behalf of the intelligence services to miss it. See point 1.)<br>
<br>
To carry on though...<br>
<br>
The Security situation was amazingly overhyped.<br>
<br>
Lets look at the details.<br>
<br>
When resolution 1441 passed, shortly after America seized on potshots taken by Iraq at aeroplanes patrolling the no-fly zone as a reason why Iraq was in material breach of the resolution. <br>
<br>
A Terrorist camp to the north was claimed to be a poisons factory used by Al`qaeda. American officials also tried to link this camps to the discovery of quantities of Ricin in the UK. UK officials laughed this off and the camp hasn't had any traces as far as I am aware of Ricin. <br>
<br>
This terrorist camp was also used as a big deal as to why Iraq was harbouring terrorist, but, neglected to mention very often that it was in the far north of Iraq near Iran's border, and has been outside the sphere of operations of the Iraqi army for the last 10 or so years.<br>
<br>
Before the war, it was reported that Saddam put WMD under the control of regional commanders. First of all, how did you know that? and second of all, why were none found if this was the case. <br>
<br>
It was claimed Iraqi scientists would spill the beans days after Saddam was toppled and lead you right to the WMD, or where they were destroyed. This has not been the case.<br>
<br>
It's difficult to beleive that with a WMD program as extensive as Iraq's was beleived to be, that no-one in Iraq would come forward to show where they were. I'm fairly sure that not all of them were hefty Baath Loyalists.<br>
<br>
The Missiles discovered a month or two before the war that exceeded the limitations impossed by something like 15%. This was siezed upon as a major demonstration of Iraqi non-compliance. Now, common sense tells me, that If they were going to design missiles that they wanted to be in excess of UN requirements, they would have done it by something useful, like 300%, as it was, the missiles only had a range that put 100 more camles in range. It was also a bit up in the air whether it was tested with a guidance system, which if you know newtons laws, would have probably been less than the required range.<br>
<br>
<br>
We all know the story of Uranium Yellow-cake from Nigeria, which is generally regarded to be untrue.<br>
<br>
There's the Aluminium tubing that was claimed to be used for the processing of Uranium. However, tests made on them showed that they tended to shatter when spun at the speeds necessary to do it.<br>
<br>
There were also the masses and masses of documents that were 'found' at a scientists home. Exactly what happened to those again? I would have thought that if it was evidence you were looking for, that would be it right there.<br>
<br>
The truck containers apparently found, that in Colin powells speach to the UN security council were described as mobile chemical labratories. But in real life, when discovered there was neither that many of them, nor were they as complex as Mr Powell had described, nor was it strikingly obvious that they were used for chemical manafacturing.<br>
<br>
6, or 12, I forget how many Chemical shells were discovered in a depot somewhere, it was claimed that it's plainly obvious that this is a complete material breach, yet it was a) 0.1 % of their supposed aresnal, and were found strewn about a munitions dump,  even if Iraq were hiding as many weapons as claimed, or that they destroyed them all, I think that it's fairly safe to assume that these were forgetton about.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not saying that there was no chance that Iraq had weapons, I'm saying that the evidence was hyped up above what it actually was.<br>
<br>
This means that the security threat, and the need to take out Saddam because of the WMD threat was not as great as claimed. Either that, or the Intelligence services were relativley incompotent or incredibly unlucky. Either way, I do not put that much confidence at all in the evidence placed in the public domain.<br>
<br>
Now, lets talk about the 'Politics behind it'<br>
<br>
I consider myself a better political analyst than the average schmoe, a lot of political speeches are aimed at people dumber than myself, which makes it slightly easier to pick up on the things that are blatantly not being said.<br>
<br>
The reasons that were mainly stated before the war, were the big three, WMD, Defying the UN, contacts with Al`qaeda. there was a little bit about him being a bastard.<br>
<br>
You can argue it any way you want to that it was all about him being a bastard, but that really wasn't stated much until the month or so before the war started, not much at all in the year before that.<br>
<br>
I'd say that you could break it down 50/25/20/5 in percentage about what was being said about those big three, seeing as it was a very political justification in that it was attempting to manipulate the public like all politics.<br>
<br>
Now, post war, the justification is 5/1/4/90. That switch is massivley important. And shows the politics of the situation. Now that the mass graves, and the horror of saddams regime is down, it's only natural politics to use that as a good side to convince people. And to be honest, I was allready convinced of that, and I think a good many people were.<br>
<br>
The politics of this is fairly straight forward, it makes it harder for the average joe to disagree with the war. It's because people generally have short term memories about politics in the media. But to explain and justify the reasons behind the war, you have to adequately explain why the speeches have shifted so massivley from one thing to another pre and post war.<br>
<br>
The thing is, if the justifications were prooven, there would not have been such a drastic change of speech content, and I think that is an absolutley critical note to point out. It shows how much the proof was highly political, attempting to shift opinions by manipulation. I'm not being conspiratorial here or anything, it's just what politics generally is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, lets talk about Al`qaeda.<br>
<br>
In the cave systems and camps that were overrun by US forces, no traces of chemical, or biological weapons have yet been found, asside from traces of Ricin, which to be honest I don't really count, as anyone with an A-level in Chemistry can make Ricin in reasonably large quantities with easily obtainable equipment.<br>
<br>
If there was a neat flow of chemical and biological weaponry, and training to al`qaeda, I would have pressumed that something more substantial had been found.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not only that, If any terrorist cells planning biological or chemical attacks had been cracked, it would have been amazingly well publicised as it would directly proove the reasoning for the war itself.<br>
<br>
Now, the Anthrax attack on the US was found to be a deadly, yet low grade form of anthrax. Anyone with an A-level in biology has the expertise to cultivate this form of anthrax, with access to the original biological samples. Proof of involvement you say? Of course! Not. Before the anthrax attacks, It wasn't actually too hard to obtain samples of Anthrax of this quality, as the controls weren't too heavy.<br>
<br>
<br>
There was a report on BBC panorama after the anthrax scare at how journalists managed to purchase quantities of the smallpox virus with ease and little to no questions.<br>
<br>
Now, the scary thing is the Ex-USSR. Have you any idea how much Weapons grade material is missing, and how much radiological material (radioactive cadmium samples) are missing?<br>
<br>
If I recall (I could be mistaken) the USSR has been unable to adequatley dispose of massive quantities of Plutonium it had stockpiled in weapons due for Treaty-based decommisioning because they were out of money (donations?). Hey presto, a few months later, organised criminals in the Former-USSR were found to be in control of large, yet not critical masses of weapons grade Plutonium. More was discovered in Turkey later.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, lets look at North Korea, which in my mind is far bigger threat.<br>
<br>
It's widely beleived (if i'm not mistaken) that North Korea has a massive stockpile of unconvential weapons, both chemical and biological (i'm not that sure thought to be honest). You have no idea what they are doing in terms of their relationship with terror.<br>
<br>
They are reprocessing Uranium, the detection of compounds of flourine have been discovered that are a tell-tale sign of this. They are beleived to have a non-trivial arsenal of nuclear weaponry at the moment. The only thing stopping them creating a nuclear weapon, is a trigger (Neutron source), this is normally another highly decaying radioactive compound (although North Korea has been known to be resourceful). This compound is detectable, but due to his extremely low half life, when you detect it, it's pretty logical to assume that a nuclear detonation is going to occour within a week, maybe two at the outside.<br>
<br>
They have missile technology which can hit some of the most highly populated cities in the world, and at a pinch, may well be able to hit mainland USA with a missile. The warheads they may be able to carry would probably be low yeild 20KT type of affairs, but enough to bring death and destruction of an unprecedented level to the US.<br>
<br>
The regime and country are currently in a downward spiral, and is highly unpredictable, and no-one can really tell whether they would seriously launch a massive attack of conventional, or non-conventional means, that could well possibly kill millions of people in a short a span as a few days provided all their other options were exhausted. One thing is certain, like Iraq, the safety of the Korean continent cannot be assured while the current Stalinist regime is in place.<br>
<br>
Not only this, they have been prooved of exporting weapons, and weapons technology to other countries, they are poor, and don't really care much for ideology of others, simply money. They have threatened (if they haven't allready done so) exporting nuclear technologies to other countries for money.<br>
<br>
It's probably safe to say that human rights in North Korea, and the lack of freedom far exceeds the abuses in Iraq, I'm not going to discern between ordering the execution of 10,000 people, and willingly letting people die of starvation but not caring, because in my mind they're pretty much the same.<br>
<br>
North Korea has also been misbehaving for the last 5 years, and the nature of the regime, makes it unlikely for them to dis-continue doing so.<br>
<br>
Now, with that in mind, you have an almost identical situation to Iraq, but arguably more likely to proliferate it's weapons for money, you have an un-godly and vastly imminent threat over Iraq, yet there is no need for a war?<br>
<br>
The main difference is two fold, firstly that North Korea can be bought off, but most people think you shouldn't give in to Nuclear blackmail. and Secondly, they are actually capable of causing harm to the US, it's allies, and it's interests.<br>
<br>
<br>
For the UN side of it, and the breaching of resolutions. I'm going to bring up the one that makes you roll your eyes. Yes Israel.<br>
<br>
Israel has far more breachs of UN resolutions than Iraq, and far more resultions going against it. Now, you may claim that it's because 'Those resolutions are bullshit, because Israel has done nothing wrong and the US knows that'. <br>
<br>
This is not the case, if it were, and the resolutions were stupid, ridiculous et al, then the US would have vetoed it, it has done before not just a couple of times either. The only reasons the US would have let those resolutions through, is because of A) International politics or B) Because it didn't think they were too bad.<br>
<br>
So, if the case was B, you are actually saying that you are agreeing with the resolution, but not upholding it for some unbeknownst reason.<br>
<br>
If it's International policitics, it's basically saying that voting in resolutions aren't really because of the substance but because of the people sitting round the table. That is a deep, and scary thought if you really think deeply about it's consequences.<br>
<br>
Now, it all stems, In my opinion from post 9/11 America. You see Threats, Terrorists, Horror, Fear in the world around you. I don't blame you to be honest.<br>
<br>
The main reason you want to solve all these 'problems' like Iraq that you see in the world, is because you don't want to repeat the problems of the past.<br>
<br>
A usual argument I hear is that 'This is a new world, we can no longer sit back and wait for things to happen, we must deal with them'.<br>
<br>
The problem is the pre-emptive action or preventative action that is your current doctrine is both mis-guided and in-adequate in regards to terrorism.<br>
<br>
Fine, you took out saddam for supposed massive links with terror, and supposed massive stockpiles in WMD and all it's breachs of UN resolutions that you arbitrarily care about.<br>
<br>
But you are repeating the main constituent causes in the world by ignoring the problems.<br>
<br>
You seem to be heading along the lines of ignoring key dictatorships / really bad human rights records and countries with problems because they are 'on your side'.<br>
<br>
How did Saddam get to the point he did?<br>
&quot;He was a Son-of-a-bitch, but he was OUR Son-of-a-bitch&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, in summary, because this has been hella long is that <br>
<br>
A) The reasons for war were over-hyped. Public Opinion was more important than truth.<br>
B) There were bigger threats in any, and all departments that Saddam was a threat with.<br>
C) In both the war on terror, and the bigger picture, you seem to be ignoring the key problems that caused this all to go on in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>
What I cannot stand are those who are strictly anti-bush, anti-war for whatever reason. I'm no pacifist, I'll certainly stand up and call for a war, and hell, i had lots of arguments with friends about the war before, and yes I was arguing for it. I'm kind of a devils advocate most of the time anyways.<br>
<br>
My problem is that while I support the 'war' itself and the troops, next to unconditionally. I feel that the big picture of evidence, and things in the public domain doesn't make enough sense to justify all the reasons that were being touted for the war. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://216.94.170.106/phpBB2/images/avatars/19834029863f67d57cdd2ec.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>

This is a report by the iraq survey group thats hunting this stuff, and what they found so far<br>
<br>
A clandestine network of biological laboratories and safehouses maintained by the Iraqi Intelligence Service. <br>
 <br>
A prison laboratory complex, possibly used for human testing of biological agents. <br>
<br>
“Reference strains” of biological organisms concealed in scientists homes, including a live strain of deadly botulinum, and new research on Brucella, Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever, ricin, and aflatoxin. <br>
<br>
Advanced design work on prohibited longer range missiles and covert capability to produce illegal SCUD missile propellant. <br>
<br>
Newly documented links between Iraq and North Korea with documents detailing Iraq’s attempt to buy equipment from North Korea to make missiles with ranges of up to 1,300 kilometers – a clear violation of the UN Resolution limiting Iraq to missiles with a range of 150 kilometers or less. <br>
<br>
Systematic efforts to sanitize or destroy documents, computers, equipment, and other materials related to WMD work<br>
<br>
   If you honestly believe the the 6 months that they knew we where coming that they didnt hide alot more then you just bashing the pres. Before the UN left Iraq there where tons of nerve agents, and other wmd. Knowing Iraq from past experiance do you honestly think that he would destroy this without any record? I took us over 9 months of going through the UN before we finally decided to go. Do you think it would be beyond him to bury it in the middle of the desert and kill everyone there to cover up the weapons? Better yet to bring them across the border to syria. <br>

I personally think it's kinda funny that you do not answer any of the points I have raised, and my particular concerns upon the subject, then feel free to dismiss it all as 'just bashing the pres'.<br>
<br>
If you had actually read my post, instead of deciding to jump in assuming I am saying 'they had no WMD' then trying to proove me wrong, it should be plainly obvious that I am not assuming, nor disassuming that Iraq had WMD.<br>
<br>
Now, Instead of rehashing points I have allready made, I'll direct you to read the relevant sections of the above post.<br>
<br>
This would be, under the first section, 1,2,3 and 4.<br>
<br>
Also, see points about North Korea, about halfish way through.<br>
<br>
Please read that, and argue about the concerns I actually have, not the concerns you think I have because you did not read them.<br>

I'm not convinced this is so. Iraq had a lot of time and a lot of sand to hide whatever they wanted.

<br>
The political football was that the U.S. had committed internally to removing Saddam, and was faced with the daunting prospect of convincing countries with vested interests in the status quo to change the status quo. <br>
<br>
Your percentages are interesting in a sense, but I don't think there was ever a point where the U.S. ever said they were taking Saddam out for one reason and one reason only. It was pretty much always a Chinese menu of reasons for regime change (the actual degree of justification those reasons implied notwithstanding).<br>

<br>
Okay, I've read it three times now. I think you were trying to make a link between Saddam using WMDs and Osama's hideouts in Afghanistan, but I'm not sure any such link has been implied, so I'm not sure what conclusions you draw from the lack of such evidence. If Al-qaeda is making WMDs, I'd think Afghanistan would be a poor short or long term choice for storage, considering the lack of relative security and infrastructure compared to, say, Iran or Saudi Arabia. <br>
<br>
More broadly, I don't think any proof of a WMD program makes Al-qaeda any more or less dangerous. They seem to do fine with commercial aircraft.<br>

Well, that's true, except that most of them would be North Koreans, as any response to unilateral aggression would be immediate regime change.

They don't have the capabilities to hurt anyone beyond about 500km from their borders, and doing anything to any of the people in that radius would result in a most unified effort to take Mr. Kim's toys away.<br>
<br>
As far as the U.N. goes, whether we're talking about Iraq or Israel or North Korea or Zimbabwe or Liberia or Kosovo or Angola or East Timor or any other location, it seems increasingly clear that the U.N. has become the de facto forum for gaining political one-upsmanship, and it's usefulness is suspect at best, since, as you correctly point out, its resolutions are so often ignored. <br>

And you're definitely not alone there. The problem is that rational discourse is being thrown out in favor of &quot;dialogue&quot; like your sig. (BTW, I think that sig comfortably fits in the &quot;Bush-bashing&quot; column). Yet, for each one that feels that Bush is just doing a massive conspiratorial snow-job, there's another that believes that Bush is completely justified in his actions, and criticism of his foreign policy is just an inherent extension of partisan politics, and so is biased beyond reasonable control. <br>
<br>
In this environment, there's little room for reasonable discourse, and that's the real shame. Polarization is bad, mmmkay?<br>

At what point did anyone (France, Germany, and Russia excepted) think that having undocumented and unaccounted weapons was &quot;not a big thing&quot;?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you actually looked into the point I am making, you'll see that points 1-4 are mutually exclusive, but one of them had to happen (logically). I stated at the beginning that these options applied to the build up for the war, not 20 years ago.<br>
Anyways, the thing I consider a 'Big Thing'<br>
<br>
1.) Saddam Hussein was most likely to give his weapons to Terrorists if they were his last chance to get back at the US (George Tennet, head of the CIA)<br>
2.) We had no clue where those weapons were (this is the assumption I have made, and I did cover all the rest)<br>
3.) We went in under the pretense of stopping them falling into the hands of the terrorists.<br>
<br>
You see where I'm going, 1 + 2 + 3 = The most likely course of action is that Saddam gives his weapons to Terrorists which we don't want to happen, and because we have no clue where they are, we have absolutley no way to stop them! Thus we are more likely to see weapons in the hands of terrorists than if we did nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'm not convinced this is so. Iraq had a lot of time and a lot of sand to hide whatever they wanted. Furthermore, if anyone in the West did have exact knowledge of where WMD were at some point, leaking some of that information would change public opinion dramatically. If your conclusion (A) were true, there would be no reason to hold this information back.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
First of all, these 'Conclusions' are again, mutually exclusive, but one of them had to happen (unless you can seriously claim that Iraq had weapons, and did not have weapons. or that we knew were some, or all of them were, and didn't know where any of them are)<br>
The point about 'Iraq being really big, it's easy to hide stuff' is a good argument, were it not for using common sense about the intelligence.<br>
Lets look at that :<br>
1.) Iraq had massive stock piles of weapons<br>
2.) It's fairly accurate to assume that the full focus of the US intelligence gathering operations was on Iraq at the time. If it wasn't, then I'll point out the 'Incompetence' bit.<br>
3.) Colin Powel presented Information at the Security council about Chemical Trailors and Telephone conversations. For this evidence to be accurate, you need effective human Sources in Iraq.<br>
4.) A Weapons program the size that Iraq allegedly possesed could not be effectivley 'Buried in  the desert without anyone knowing' it was too big. It wasn't just one barrel to bury on a sunday afternoon, we're talking thousands of tonnes of stuff at the very least. To not even be able to trace one single barrel of chemical weaponry under the microscope of a major Intelligence operation is how likely exactly? All the evidence that was gained directly on any hide operation was a sattelite image of one small bunker that had supposedly been cleaned.<br>

Actually that is incorrect as the NFZ wasn't specifically in the UN resolutions. Anyway the point I was trying to demonstrate, which you have ignored was not what Iraq had done, but that America was seizing upon everything they could to put the public on their side. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well, except when they were using it to gas the Kurds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, it's nice deflection, but missing the point. First of all, the Camp was set up after the NFZ was enforced which was after the terrible incident, and this particular sentence does nothing for the argument asside from attempting to convince yourself that this particular line of argument is meaningless, which it is not. Re-read the point about the Camp, and then demonstrate how this particular concern is unjustifed. (actually addressing the conclusion, not using a single statement which is in itself wrong to try and make it go away)<br>

Again, it ties in with the point I am trying to make =P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why?

<br>
Correct, very clever. Now. Please Elaborate this for me. Why have those documents, which were hailed as a massive find, never really been talked of since? &lt;- My Point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, but hyped up by whom? You seem to be angling toward holding only the U.S. government complicit in this regard, when the national (U.S.) and international press were just as eager to take any whiff of anything as if it were a smoking gun. You yourself do the same thing by listing everything you've read and seen through media outlets as being the only existing evidence, then concluding that it was all a cynically overhyped attempt to manipulate public opinion (unless I've misread your conclusions). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
First of all, The information on the claimed 'material breach' of 1441 came from John Negroponte, Donald Rumsfeld (DR), Ari fliecher (AF) on multiple occasions.<br>
The Terrorist 'poison camp' came multiple times from DR, AF, and Colin Powell's speech to the UN security council.<br>
The rest of my information I have used has come directly from US Administration quoted sources, or press conferences, I have deliberatley not taken information from Fox, CNN and BBC that did not come directly from US Administration sources (for instance, the supposed chemical factory south of baghdad, the 'SCUD' missiles, both of which were sources from news and did not come directly from any verified official channel) <br>
Second of all, the points I have raised were the main ones that got the most air time, and were voiced most often from the US Administration.<br>
<br>
The emphasis I have given them here has been taken from the amount they have been talked about, not by newspapers, but by the administration.<br>
<br>
I am fairly confident that you can conclude that the emphasis that these particular points were given came not from a news paper printing 'Saddam's chemical plant exposed OMG', but directly from the American Administration. They were not one liners in some tabloid newspapers.<br>
<br>
Finally, irregardless of who they were 'hyped' by (if they were hyped, I'll address if they weren't later) they were the big reasons used for justifying the war by people such as yourselves before it started. <br>
Now, if you are arguing that these points are true, and I am arguing that these points are hyped up, its conducive to creating the foundation of an argument. You have an opinion, I demonstrate matter-of-factly that the facts you have based your opinion on don't make sense. (hence, a debate) Sayiing that the media, and/or the government 'hyped' something isn't an argument, is fundamentally false.<br>
Now, If they weren't hyped up by anyone, the points I have made STILL don't make sense in the grand scheme of things, The particular avenue you should take is showing how these particular points are false, or do make sense. In which case, I'll sit back and agree with you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Except that all the conclusions you've drawn here are based solely on that evidence upon which you have so little confidence.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is incorrect, and if I must say, a little simple minded. <br>
<br>
I have pointed out a logical pattern in events that led up to the war, tried to show how, and why that evidence does not make sense, how that evidence is the pillar in the justifcation for the war, how that evidence itself either by accident, or by design was given undue precedence in the justification for the war, then drawing that conclusions. You'll actually find, that I have not assumed any peice of information is 'true or false', just whether it makes sense with what has been said, not by the press, but the US administration. <br>
<br>
However, I have drawn the conclusion that if some, most or all of it is true, it doesn't make sense, and if some, most or all of it is false, it shows that the justification wasn't/isn't there, the way it was stated.<br>
<br>
I've been trying to show the big things we have been told, do not make sense, what the actual truth of whats happening, I have not stated or concluded. I am simply stating why I don't think things 'hang together' so to speak.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well, except that the U.S. started saying he was a bastard about the time that the CIA stopped funding him, and by the time he invaded Kuwait, the U.S. was already making fairly loud inquiries into his parentage, as it were.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is a nice argumentative deflection, what I am attempting to point out, is that 'Saddam being a bastard' was not a prominent justification compared to some of the other points. It was a point generally tacked on to others in the lead up to war. <br>
<br>
Seeing as I'm specifically talking about things happening in the run up to the war and not things that happened 10 years ago (unless relevant), using this particular sentence to show how I'm wrong isn't a valid point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

I'd agree with you there, that would make sense. Now, explain to me why Saddam, over one of the million other outrageously horrible dictators in the world. One that brings together all of the points I have made, and makes them make sense. <br>
There is no easy, simple, or 'sensible' conclusion to draw about why saddam in this case that does not relate in exactly the same way, or worse to North Korea.<br>
Also, please elaborate on how 'Saddam being a bastard' wasn't spun into the major point of the war, which would have been closer to the truth and provided a FAR more convincing argument.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your percentages are interesting in a sense, but I don't think there was ever a point where the U.S. ever said they were taking Saddam out for one reason and one reason only.

<br>
Correct, I have not drawn any conclusions about what was correct, and what was wrong. What I am saying, is the implied degree of justification for all of those points were important in bringing forth the case for war. <br>
<br>
If they were given undue prominence, then the public was misled, and my points that you say are invalid are very valid indeed. If they were not, then the things I have pointed out still do not make sense, and the key points you have skipped over still stand as a big question mark.<br>
One of those two things had to have happened.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Okay, I've read it three times now. I think you were trying to make a link between Saddam using WMDs and Osama's hideouts in Afghanistan, but I'm not sure any such link has been implied, so I'm not sure what conclusions you draw from the lack of such evidence. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If Al-qaeda is making WMDs, I'd think Afghanistan would be a poor short or long term choice for storage, considering the lack of relative security and infrastructure compared to, say, Iran or Saudi Arabia.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'll address both points at once here.<br>
First of all, I'll agree that not finding WMD in Afghanistan isn't the most crucial of evidence to draw that type of conclusion from, i'd agree with you there.<br>
<br>
However, if the traces of ricin were discovered in Afghanistan were real, then it does show that Al`qaeda were attempting the manafacture of chemicals there. Again it is only ricin but still.<br>
Lets assume that first set of points were completley false on my part, it was not the main part, nor the only part of my conclusions about Al`qaeda, If decided to read the rest and argue them, I'd be happy to continue.  It seems you have skipped over a relativley large part of it. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>More broadly, I don't think any proof of a WMD program makes Al-qaeda any more or less dangerous. They seem to do fine with commercial aircraft.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I've not come to that conclusion, or otherwise. Terrorism and it's relationship with Iraq was one of the main points listed as justification for the war. I am simply stating why on a second look, why it doesn't make as much sense as claimed.<br>
Not sure if you're agreeing with me or not.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That would be one heck of a pinch, since the longest-range missile NK has known to have tested can barely reach Japan. I think it's fairly safe to say that NK doesn't have any ICBM capabilities.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Okay, so you know more than George Tennet, who said infront of the intelligence committee, that the CIA beleives that North korea has several missiles capable of striking US West cost targets, although Un-Tested, still presented a realistic threat.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well, that's true, except that most of them would be North Koreans, as any response to unilateral aggression would be immediate regime change.

I'm talking about security concerns, I'm saying that the reason the world has become so polarised on this issue, is because you have changed, we have not. I'm not saying it's right or wrong or that there is anything that requires 'Blame' to be caused. I'm explaining how the current climate of argument circles around security concerns and that when security is claimed to be at stake, people will latch on and form a furvored opinion of whats been stated. Because of ths, public opinion is far, far more malleable when it comes to threats. <br>
<br>
But, judging from the rest of the arguments where you seem to be misrepresenting the point I am making, or plain skipping over it, I can only pressume that you have allready assumed I am wrong.<br>

I'm not talking about America as a country being the bad guys, or that America is cause for all evil in the world, Honestly speaking, I've not concluded anything about that.<br>

I have looked at the facts, I've not drawn in any irrational concerns, or stupid assumptions when looking at the facts I have found.

This is far more than you have done, skipping over the meat and bones, and missing the plain and simple context and points I am trying to make.<br>
<br>
Unless you've read something weird into my post, I have not done a big 'bush-bashing' excersise, or that 'America is teh Devil', I have stated that in this particular time, this particular case, I don't think the justification was there. I have stated why, I have not said what was 'evil', or why bush was an idiot. I've stated my case. <br>
You have basically said 'You are wrong, and your arguments are all irrelevant', while 50 % of the arguments were skipped over, 25 % were met with relativley unrelated, or irrelevant points that either restated the point I was making, or didn't do anything to answer them.

If that is considered a rational discourse, then remind me to schedule a debate with beaker from the Muppets.<br>

<br>
First of all, he is not saying 'do nothing about terrorism', which is a distinction you are not drawing when you make your statement.<br>
<br>
Second of all, thinking that 'doing something' against terrorism will always be better than doing nothing is fundamentally wrong. (I'm not going to conclude that we should, or should do not do nothing just to make it clear).<br>
<br>
Lets say, there are 10,000 Extreme individuals, who are determined to carry out Attacks on US Interests because America are evil.<br>
<br>
Lets say, also, you have 10,000,000 non-extreme indivuals who dislike America, but are not prepared to carry out attacks on the US.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
America launches an attack on the 10,000, and manage to break up their main base of operations, kill or capture 7,500 of those people.<br>
<br>
Now, the remaining 2,500 become even more furvored, and even more cunning about planning attacks.<br>
<br>
Also, 100,000 of the non-extreme people who dislike America are angered by what America did (rightly or wrongly), and when approached, or off their own bat, turn to extreme indivudlas, determined to strike at the interests of those they have now come to hate.<br>
<br>
Also 20,000,000 who are non-extreme and didn't mind america now dislike america.<br>
<br>
So, now, you have 102,500 terrorists prepare to carry out attacks on Americans up from 10,000 as a direct consequence of your actions.<br>
<br>
Finally. You are so astoundingly stupid to presume that suicide bombers, and terrorists actually care about what they can get away with.<br>
<br>
How the fuck do you deter someone who is willing to give their life for something?<br>
Seriously?<br>
<br>
&quot;If you kill yourself, we'll put you in prison!&quot;<br>

It's not like you can commit a suicide bombing twice anyways.<br>

I see those 20million as infact giving it a second thought if they know that we will come over and kick thier asses.  And what about the 9984 orgininal terrorists that were waiting to see what we would do after the first 16 killed themselves while taking thousands of Americans with them.  When they see that we are going to do nothing as a reaction....they can then use that to say to the 20 million, &quot;See we can attack them and they wont do anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ram, you and I are NEVER going to agree on this whole topic as we have been round and round on it.<br>
<br>
However his statment was infact that if we did nothing we would therefore not breed any more terrorists.  That is bullshit and even you know it. <p>Wrin ~Benevolent princess of the Bouncy Grrlz

<br>
Saying that doing something is always better than doing nothing is false.<br>
<br>
Next up, you are suggesting that 20 million people will do something fundamentally different from human nature.<br>
<br>
If you take any random person on the entire planet, and get them angry enough, or beleive in something enough, there will come a point where they will do something, and will not fear the consequences.<br>
<br>
That is a simple, undeniable fact. Human nature.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, If your detterent makes people angry, and makes them hold the beleif that america is evil. <br>
<br>
The more you detter, the more people will cross the point where they will do something.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you say this isn't true, then tell me the following :<br>
<br>
If American cities were bombed, would that make you more, or less likely to want to do something about it?<br>

that did happen with Pearl Harbor. And we did do something about it. Which proves your point.<br>
<br>
But the difference is we havethe Strength to &quot;do something about it&quot; and finish it.<br>
<br>
The problem is the Terrorists aren't able to finish it but then again we are not either. At least not the way we handle things these days. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/88/88432/pages/410383/ggGRAF2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

this is what Lan said.<br>
<br>
The second statment says &quot;not doing anything&quot;.  I'm saying that &quot;terrorists less liekely to multipy&quot; because of &quot;not doing anything&quot; is compelet bullshit.  I'm saying that doing nothing give the terrorist the fuel that they need to convince others that they have a free pass to do whatever they want to us. So yes I do is it as something nothing is always worse than doing something and that doing something MUST always be the choice. <p>Wrin ~Benevolent princess of the Bouncy Grrlz

You've skipped over what is called the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>context</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of what Landale said.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Don't invade, many still die, look like assholes for not doing anything</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The key word is 'invade'.<br>
<br>
You seem to hinge upon the fact that he has said do nothing about terrorism at all. Seeing as that is neither what he said, nor the context of his argument, I can only presume that you are an idiot.<br>
<br>
Moreover, you have skipped over the majority of my post which disagree's with you. seeing as you are so unbeleivably anal and argumentative, I can only pressume that you cannot argue with me, because my statements about human nature (as gnip has shown) are correct. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://216.94.170.106/phpBB2/images/avatars/19834029863f67d57cdd2ec.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
