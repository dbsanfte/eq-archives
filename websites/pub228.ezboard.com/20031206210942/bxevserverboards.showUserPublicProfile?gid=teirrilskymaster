Hunted in Misty Thicket for aproximately 14 seasons, where I was asked to be the starting center of the Rivervale Basketball team (I'm tall for a halfling).  I then proceeded to hunt in such places as NRO, and the Oasis.  Around the 20th season I started to adventure more.  I campaigned in such areas as Unrest, Gorge of King Xorb, Runnyeye, and Lake of Ill Omen.  I then met up with the great ranger Vassal who invited me to join his group of friends, the Lords of Malkier, to explore Norrath.  Through the seasons I met many honorable adventurers, these include Yuuzhaknafein (with whom I've explored several areas), Llith (the lovely druid), Bilba (the bravest of all, not the wisest of all druids but certianly the bravest I have met), and last but certaintly not least Vassal (who has gotten me killed more then anyone else I know.....LOL).  Throughout the 30s I hunted in several areas, Runnyeye for money, Feerrott for more money, Uguk Lguk and Mistmoore for adventure, and the Overthere for experience.  At level 40 I learned how to quad kite and discovered the solo power of the druid.  For this I'm grateful but also saddened.  I for one did not have to fight  near as long as anyone else for experience.  On the other hand I missed out on several adventures that many of my friends would go on.  At the season of 48 I needed a break from adventure.  I relaxed in my Hobbit Hole for several Norrathian years.  Finally, a great friend and an Honorable warrior, Sir Entropius paid a visit to me.  He showed me that he had become a great and seasoned warrior and asked me if I would like to adventure with him.  I once again took to adventure and have discovered many other places in Norrath.  I started to seek adventurers in places such as Karnor's Castle, Velktor's Lab, and the City of Mist.  I still enjoy to solo when I cannot find such adventurers.  I enjoy to spend time in Burning Wood, Colbalt Scar, and I plan on venturing to Skyfire soon.  At the season of 50 I joined a new group of adventurers, the Knights of Reverence and I'm still with them to this day.

A lot has changed recently.  I'm still with the Knights of Reverence and am very proud to be amongst their ranks.  During the 55th Season I've obtained a my epic weapon with the help of several friends and that of my guild.  Recently I've been doing a lot of adventuring in Old Sebelis.  I've made several new friends.  These include Aiah (AKA Pasty), Grolsh, Nez, and Traxxus.  I also see several of my older friends still including Yuuz, Vassal, and Entropius.  I'm almost level 57 (like 3 blues), and I hopefully plan on reaching 60 within the next several norrathian years.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 				<span class="privatevalue">disabled</span>						</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="" target="_blank">My Personal Link</a></span></div>		<div id="recentposts"><span class="title">Recent Posts ::</span> 										<span class="value">		<dl>				<dt><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm10.showMessage?topicID=335.topic&index=33" title="post" target="_blank">Re: lolz</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm10" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">/ooc</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm10.showMessage?topicID=335.topic" title="post" target="_blank">Uh Oh</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm10" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">/ooc</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessage?topicID=1118.topic&index=17" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Spoiler Inside</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Rants</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessage?topicID=1118.topic&index=10" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Matrix Revolutions....</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Rants</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm10.showMessage?topicID=314.topic&index=8" title="post" target="_blank">Re: Need advice</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm10" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">/ooc</a></em></dd>				<dt><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessage?topicID=1104.topic&index=60" title="post" target="_blank">Re: OMGz0r</a></dt>		<dd><em>from <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6" title="forum the above post is in" target="_blank">Rants</a></em></dd>				</dl>				</span>				</div>	</div>	<div class="spacer"></div> </div>  <!-- profile footer --> <div id="footing">© Copyright 1999-2003 <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/">ezboard, Inc.</a> All rights reserved.</div></div></body></html><!-- CSS:XHTML 2002 JR.o -->
