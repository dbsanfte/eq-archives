Do you have anything spare that I can have?  Can I have what you are holding/wearing?  Can you spare 200pp, I just started the game?  Can anyone give me 15pp, I need it for my spell?<br>
<br>
I don't think I speak for everyone here but I think most of us grinded through our early days, saving every copper, silver, gold and plat, turning in orc belts and bone chips, selling that 1pp worth cracked staff from level 1 skeletons and eventually bronze and fine steel or what not.  We saved every bit we had to buy that spells or to upgrade to that 5int earring or to get that charred guardian shield.<br>
<br>
What happened to that?  Don't people have pride any more?  Begging?  People are content to be beggars?  Gimme gimme gimme.  Arghhhhhh!!  Crawl back into that hole where you came from and stop bother me.  Stop giving me tells, stop your ooc or shout, stop trying to emote your pitifulness.  We have what we have because we worked hard for them one way or another.  We have them does not mean you deserve it too.  Our being higher level do not mean we are obligated to twink you.  Now go away, bugger off, get out of my face, go beg the newbie guards, cancel your account, move out of your parents house, get off welfare, go find a real job, AND STOP BEGGING!!!<br>
<br>
ok I feel better, move along, nothing to see here<br>

I told him if he could find me, I'd give him some gear.  I cast lev on myself and worked my way out onto the top of one of the spires.  Well, he looked for at least an hour and never found me unfortunately.  I fully intended on telling him to fist his own ass if he did, but at least I got to enjoy wasting an hour of his time.<br>
<br>
Hmm, here's a question.  Can you dispell someone else's levitate?  We could levitate the beggars and get them walk off someplace really high to get their plats(not like anyone would actually give it to em afterwards), then dispell the lev and hopefully they'd fall to their deaths.  Even if it worked, it might be too much of a pain in the butt for the entertainment value I suppose.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hibashira>Hibashira</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#330000>(7/22/03 5:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=875.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Die beggar!!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I had one last night sending me tells (and a couple of my guildies accused me of sending him to them, lol) asking for 500pp because he had just reactivated his account and needed to buy armor dyes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That's the same one that asked me for 200pp ... hehe, I guess you look richer than me with lightning sword and all that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   May be I should walk around naked and pretend I'm a mule. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328193"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hibashirasakai/HibashiraNewHalfSize.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tibult>tibult</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.attbi.com/~ewasan/sig/tibult01.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#330000>(7/22/03 5:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=875.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://tibultelgghinvlos.o-f.com/freaky.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Die beggar!!</span><hr size=1> If I see you doing that long enough, I'll start giving you armor I save to give to my pet when I am playing my necro <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=316564" target="top">Tib</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Had a guildie begging in /gu.  I told him to cut it out, that the guild frowned on that.<br>
<br>
So a little bit latter he asks if someone can come and get him in skyshire.  Trying not to laugh to hard I asked what happened.  He said that someone had told him that they had some weapons for him and to get a port there and they would give them to him. (of course as a lvl 13 being where he was I knew what had happened)<br>
<br>
So I start chatting with a friend in another guild (cause I was going to see if they could send someone to get him as we didn't have anyone one on that could.  She starts laughing and tells me that it was our other friend who did it.  So I laughing so hard I'm crying and a get a tell from our third friend saying that if he had know it was one of my guildies he would never have done it.  I said I thought it was great.<br>
<br>
So after chastising said guildie in /gu about the fact that the guild does not condone pling or begging we got him a rez and a port out.....to PoK.....to bad he didn't have PoP. <p>Wrin ~Benevolent princess of the Bouncy Grrlz

I do remember, back in the old old days, there was this warrior in SK, he used to refuse to group, then &quot;solo&quot; aviaks around the treehouse and beg for heals and buffs in ooc and shout.<br>
<br>
Anyway, some druid evidently got fed up with this and grouped with him, and ported him to Tox forest and left him there. I'm not sure how he got back, I think some porter felt sorry for him, but when he did he was complaining in ooc about this druid. Everyone told him to shut up, he deserved it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Of course, with books and things, Tox wouldn't be nearly as good. Cobalt Scar or Skyfire would work, but they're considerably more fatal, and possible to get you into trouble. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94917" target="_blank">Kianor McKenna</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25366" target="_blank">Benaveriel Banadar</a><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=146054" target="_blank">Carenna Etienne</a><br></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ramshutu>ramshutu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bananaman</span><br>  Posts: 749<br> <font color=#330000>(7/24/03 6:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=875.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.johnsrealmonline.com/classicnick/bananaman/Image33.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Die beggar!!</span><hr size=1> Way back, before Luclin and everyone hung out in Gfay, there were many beggars.<br>
<br>
The most creative method i had of killing them was :<br>
<br>
'Yah, I can lend you some cash, you want to follow me to Felwithe bank? (outside Kelethin bank)?<br>
<br>
'Sure!'<br>
<br>
'Okies, put me on autofollow, i run pretty fast, don't want to get you lost'<br>
<br>
*cast sow*<br>
<br>
'okies, keep me on follow, going now'<br>
<br>
*run off the edge of the bank platform*<br>
<br>
You have taken 350 points of non melee damage.<br>
You have been injured by falling.<br>
A noob beggar is injured by falling.<br>
A noob beggar has fallen to his death.<br>

Well, i told him that i would give him a piercer if he joined my group.
