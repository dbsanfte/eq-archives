Holy fuck, when the hell will men stop being such huge ass chumps? You know why she LJBF (lets just be friends) you? Because you're just another fucking chump. It's cliche to say this but it is tried and true, speaking from experience and lots of study, woman don't want to stay with &quot;nice guys&quot;.<br>
<br>
Nice guys don't usually last because they rare display any form of sexuality, they come off as sexually inexperienced and just all around losers. This doesn't mean that you can be a huge fucking asshole and automatically women are thrusting themselves at you. It's a fine line you must tread and know well.<br>
<br>
You can pay for her shit all you want but the moment I come in and start running some CF (cocky and funny) routines, kino, etc she is mine and you are just some chump that paid for her drinks.<br>
<br>
Women have what are called &quot;shit tests&quot;, they may deny it or not even know they do these things but they are there to test what kind of a man you are. She probably tossed a bunch at you and given your &quot;nice guy&quot; attitude you most likely failed every one. <br>
<br>
For example, a couple months ago I had arranged to meet some girl I met a few days earlier at a coffee shop. We were up ordering our drinks, I ordered some mocha shit whatever and payed. She starts shuffling around her purse looking everywhere and exclaims &quot;Oh whoops, I don't have any money on me&quot;. &lt;---- that is a shit test, she is trying to see I would cough up 3 dollars to pay for her drink but of course I respond &quot;Hah, guess you'll be drinking water&quot;. Guess what happened? She magically found some money at the bottom of her purse. zero to BJ in a couple of hours.<br>
<br>
You just need a shitload more experience. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Foolish man give wife grand piano, wise man give wife upright organ. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Are They Weird or Is Something Wrong With Me?</span><hr size=1> Like I said, I know ONE that is has happened to.  It went something like this:<br>
He came home from High School one day and told him mom &quot;I have found the girl I am going to marry.&quot;  He had JUST met her, and they had talked for the very first time that day.  More than 30 (and quite possibly more) years, 2 kids, and a new home later, they are STILL happily married.  Yes, I do remember times when one wanted to give up and walk away, but didn't.  They have their differences, but they are both VERY good people, I will go as far as to say the best people I will ever know.  <br>
By nature, I am a very critical person.  Of the thousands of people I have known, there are maybe 5 I will make that claim about, and these are 2.  I can not begin to say how rare this is, and hoping you are the lucky one that will have it fall in your lap is like counting on winning the lottery.  <br>
****<br>
Ahhh... I knew it was just a matter of time before Bling Bling came in.<br>
In a nut shell, discredit everything this guy says.  I figure that in about 6 or 7 years, he will be either in a cell for statutory rape or skipping child support payments, or working his ass off to pay for his illigitimate kids, or putting this crap on a free-fantasy-porn site since it is all in his head anyway.  If you think this life is cool, then by all means, do what he says he does (personally, I think he is full of shit and making this up).  If you think honesty is for wimps, be him.  If you want girls that are full of shit and will leave your dumb ass as soon as someone starts waving more money in their face, he is your model.  If you are looking for honesty, integrety, fulfillment, and satisfaction, then every single thing this idiot says is complete horse-shit.  I read his posts strictly for satirical purposes (it means humor, bling-bling) since there is no other reason for it.  To make it better, I copy them and E-mail them to my friends (girls included) and we all laugh our ever-living asses off about him and his posts.  If the kid trying to look tough in front of his import racer isn't funny enough, the idea that he actually thinks he knows what he is talking about is a scream.  PLEASE keep posting, Bling-bling.  You have me in stitches!<br>
Oh, and since you brought it up .... yeah, she was giving you a shit test.  She was seeing if you were a gentleman of the same asshole that would say &quot;Well, I guess you are drinking water&quot;.  The girls I have dated would laugh at you, jsut like I do, and your attempts to &quot;steal&quot; them.  See, they are not possessions, and if we are on a date, it is becasue we are friends who are on a date with eachother.  I have had a similar situation, actually.  She was using her card to pay, nd it wouldn't go through so I put it on mine.  Her thanks was enough for me, but she insisted that I let her pay next time, which she did, of course.  Anytying that happened before or after this point has nothing to do with it... it's coffee, dumbass.  A big difference between girls and boys is that girls are smart enough, at least, to know when they just got used.  Looks to me like YOU still need a shit-load more experience.  Women aren't items to be owned, and as long as you treat them as possessions, you will keep missing the point.  One day (probably when you are a possession yourself to Bubba, your cell-mate) you will learn that, I just hope the kids that have to suffer for your stupidity are kept to a minimum.  Enjoy your Mocha-blowjobs, it is probably the best sex you will never have. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Are They Weird or Is Something Wrong With Me?</span><hr size=1> Aiaka, I wasn't looking for a serious relationship with her, I kept telling her let's take it slow and just have fun, but she kept insisting that she really likes me and wants a serious relationship with me, I never was really serious with her, I never told her things that would make her think I'm all into her and stuff... I mean she'd be like &quot;I really like you...&quot; and wait for me to say it back, so I'd say &quot;I like you too&quot; or some such.  Basically SHE was the one who said she wants it to be really serious.. and after I got to know her a little more I decided that I could be more serious with her, because she seemed like my type of girl.<br>
<br>
Talking through my friend?  Well I guess I worded that rather poorly, after our first date she was asking my friend all sorts of questions about me, asking why I seemed like I wanted to take it so slow, etc, and sometimes he wouldn't know the answer so he would ask me, or show me the log of what they said, and I would answer it.. Basically it was HER asking my friend things that she was scared to ask me after just the first date.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's not you it's me.&quot;  Well actually this time I was like &quot;no bullshit, just tell me so I know for future reference what I did badly or what I screwed up&quot; and she kept saying nothing.. finally she said &quot;I swear to God, you did nothing wrong, you are a great guy and it's all me, there's nothing about you that changed, nothing you did wrong, it was me that changed.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not really getting depressed about it, I just laughed at this last one because I wasn't involved at all and she kept pushing for more and more of a relationship then finally is like &quot;ok don't want it anymore&quot; after she got what she wanted..<br>
<br>
Usildor: thanks, although I managed to figure most of that out on my own after my last one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  As far as being ready for a serious relationship?  I'm like half-way from a culture where people usually start dating at age 16-18, and average marriage age is 20-21, and on the average, people date 1 or 2 people before getting married.  I'm not like most people there, in that I'm closer to &quot;the world average&quot; than they are (hence &quot;half-way from said culture&quot; hehe).  At any rate, I'll be honost with you, all my life I was very very fat, and it was just recently that I managed to lose my weight.. at age 16 I weighed 310 pounds.. as I mentioned earlier I now weigh 185, and I've just dropped below 200 in the last year or so, so needless to say, that's why I'm such a nice guy to women (combined with how my parents REALLY drilled into me growing up, that you ALWAYS respect women and treat them right, etc).<br>
<br>
No more 17 year olds... good point!  Hell I got nothin wrong with em, that nice young tender soft virgin skin is quite appealing to say the least, but if I ever date another 17 year old, it's going to be like I intended for the last one.. JUST FOR FUN! hehe<br>
<br>
Tibult: Thanks for the advice and reassurance man <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Mysidia: What do I have to offer a girl at my age?  Well I have a nice car that I paid for 100% out of my own pocket, I have a large chunk of cash sitting around waiting for me to find something to invest in (hoping to wait till it's large enough and just invest in a house within the next few years), but seriously, what else do I need to offer a girl other than love and myself?  At 19 it's not like I'm gunna be asking her to marry me or anything and it's not like I'm gunna be obligated to support her while we're dating ya know :P.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am young, and my moto as of a couple weeks ago was just to have fun with it and enjoy my teenage years now that I'm capable of it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Idadar.. yeah yer right for the most part, as much as I hate it.. but I don't think I'm capable of being a jackass.. I mean, I just can't use a girl for sex.. I REALLY want to all the time it seems but I manage to controll myself..<br>
<br>
Oh and someone mentioned that I might be shallow?  That is definately not the case.. when I first saw the last girl I was a little disappointed because she wasn't &quot;that hot&quot; ya know?  But I didn't care because everyone that knew her said she has a great personality (and it turned out she does for the most part), and that she's a great person.. so I didn't care that she wasn't as hot as some girls that I could probably go out with.. I went out with her all the same and she treated me as if I was doin her a frikkin favor by going out with her.<br>
<br>
As far as physical with her?  Well our first date we made out.. second date second base, but like I said, I don't use girl's for sex.. I'd rather have a girl that respects herself so that I can respect her, and Danielle was that way.. I never even made it the whole way to 3rd base with her.. I didn't care though, I would rather have a relationship that involved no sex because the girl respected herself enough to not sleep with any guy that came along than a relationship that had sex on the first date..<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm sure there's some things I forgot to mention, but I've gabbed long enough..

Also, I find it interesting that you have so much of your information closed off... and you and bling-bling are SO similar in your posts.  Also, your membership activation times are only 10 days apart.<br>
hmmmmm..... could be total coincidence I guess....<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
Mike, you are impressive to say the least.  Yes, what she gave you was the same run-around I would expect from someone the level of bling-bling... and I consider you quite beyond.  It looks to me like she only wanted you to say you were committed to her, then there was nothing left for her to take, so she moved on.  If you had fun, then you have nothing to worry about, you both left the relationship with considerable gains.  As for the date-base ratio, forget that you ever heard of it.  Forget that there even IS such a thing.  I have never seen this used for anything but a measure for bling-bling and his friends to fantasize about how cool they are.  Consider yourself above this.<br>
Don't be afraid to tell a girl &quot;I am not ready for a relationship like that&quot;.  It is ok for you to tell her &quot;let's be friends&quot;.  When it comes to understanding women, there is no mystical formula that will make it work.  As a guy, all you have to do is consider what makes friendships work with your guy friends, then consider girls your friends you may kiss one day.  A woman (not girl) will appreciate you WAY more if she feels like you actually like HER, not just being seen with her.  If she has questions about you, tell her to come to you, and don't tell your friend the answers.  If it takes as much, make her come to you.  If she won't do it, then ask yourself, is this a person you REALLY want to be with?<br>
And finally, sex.  Yes, I am sure Bling-bling can tell you numerous stories about numerous &quot;chicks&quot; that 'did him' because of his 'smoothness' in coffee shops all over the world.  But ask yourself, if he is so sure of himself, why is he putting on a routine?  Why does he have to hide behind the facade of an asshole that will not last past age 25?  <br>
You sound like you have taken some hard knocks, rebounded, and you are doing fine.  My only advice to you is to (1) keep doing EXACTLY what you are doing now (2) learn about yourself and what interests you and (3) recognize bling-bling (and people like him) exactly for what he is, a joke.  Hell, that sounds so good, I may take that advice myself.<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.gue.ca/Smilies/xyxthumbs.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I've only been hurt REALLY badly one time, and after that, I don't think I'll ever be hurt that badly again, or let myself even get set up to be hurt that badly again.. at least not without being in a relationship like.. 2 years hehe.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I realize that at my age, I can't take things to seriously, and I realized this before my last girlfriend.. which is why I wasn't hurt or anything and just laughed when she broke up with me.. I think I just need to have some fun, meet new people, hang out with friends more often and stuff, even though I like my alone time, I still need to have some fun and stuff while I'm still a teenager <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

That's not the case, although by the kind of person I am, it would seem logical that I am, but I'm not.  I'm very confident around women and very outgoing and such, but I'm not extremely talkative, I'm perfectly happy and content with the girl doing 80% of the talking, and me just listening and learning more about her, etc.. also I've found that women like it when you ask em how their day was and how they're doing and such, and just let them talk.. Although, as Idadar mentioned, that isn't the way to get laid.. If I was after sex, I would have dumped my GF a long time ago and gone out with her sister, who told me basically that she knows her sister isn't putting out, but she most definately would if I chose her instead.. Long story there but anyway.<br>

Two fine examples of something to remember... this isn't a minivan you are shopping for or some sports car your dad can buy for you.  Despite what some societal predisposition may have drilled into your head, women aren't some commodities you can own like jewelry of stock options.  A fat wallet works in the short term, but eventually the girl turns into a woman... and for a woman, that won't be enough.  Learn to treat women like friends, they will hang around.  Treat them like some trophy or prize breeding sow, you better learn where all the good porn sites are, because you will be spending many nights alone.<br>
<br>
And need I remind you of the 19th amendment, women's suffrage, NOW, and women's liberation?  The days of the strong man that must provide for the poor frail woman are long over.  Part of your problem could be the patronizing attitude.  Perhaps Bling-bling has a point and they see you as an easy ticket to pay for everything.  They aren't objects, Mike, they are people.  To understand them, you have to look, and talk, to what is ABOVE the shoulders.  Also, you may be a good listener, but as one of the ladies pointed out earlier, if she has to carry 80% of the conversation, what does she need you for?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think you know what you need to do.  If anything, you seem to be looking to say &quot;but I did that, why isn't it working?&quot;.  Good listener?  Sure, so is my dog, but he seems to have a problem getting girls to stay with him too.  Also, I find it interesting that you follow &quot;not shallow&quot; with &quot;she wasn't that pretty&quot;.  Do you not realize how contradictory these two lines are?  Also, when someone pointed out that you don't have a lot to offer, you refuted by saying what car and money you have... showing once again that you really missed the point.  You aren't talking about a game.  This isn't some contest.  If you can't be friends, the relationship won't last.  Make any excuse about why this doesn't apply, it's still the truth.<br>

Tom Leykis.   Guys call him &quot;the professor&quot; for a reason.  he's out there to educate us guys on relationships.. or lack of them.. these are his &quot;leykis 101 rules&quot; follow them until you're like 27 or you're SERIOUSLY into the chick:<br>
<br>
<br>
NEVER, EVER date a single mother. You already know her stance on abortion, she wont have one.<br>
<br>
Never do what you don't want to do. You make the money, you decide where you are going and what you are doing.<br>
<br>
Don't ask a women what she wants to do. <br>
<br>
Never tell a women how much money you make.<br>
<br>
Never answer the phone, or go out on the weekend. Even if you really dont, you have to make it appear as though you have better things to do than be with her on the weekends.<br>
<br>
Never spend more than 40 bucks on a date.<br>
<br>
If you are not getting laid by the 3rd date, dump her and move on.<br>
<br>
Never be in a committed relationship UNTIL you are reallllllllllllly ready to settle down.<br>
<br>
Don't speak to women you work with unless it's related directly to work. Don't date them. Don't tell them they look nice. Don't comment on anything except whatever work needs you have, because you're a walking lawsuit waiting to happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I broke the rules early and got into a steady relationship at 19.. I'm 24 now and married to her.  so there ARE exceptions, heh<br>

Yeah, you can play the &quot;I don't give a crap&quot; attitude with women. However, do not completely neglect any kind of relationships/flings.<br>
<br>
There is a FS term called GFTOW. It means literally Go Fuck Ten other Women. The context in which it is used is when someone (you) is concentrating or focusing too hard on a woman that has just dumped you.<br>
<br>
Try it out, if the girl gets wind of your sexual exploits there is a high chance that she will take notice in you again (not that you'd need it by then). Absence makes the heart grow fonder (hornier?). <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Foolish man give wife grand piano, wise man give wife upright organ. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
