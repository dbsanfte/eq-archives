<br>
CHARLESTON, W.Va. - Police were searching for a man Monday who they say sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl at a Target store, threatened her with a knife and moved her from department to department before releasing her. <br>
<br>
<br>

 <br>
   <br>
<br>
A surveillance video from the suburban Charleston store before the assault showed the man watching the girl while her mother was shopping in another area, said South Charleston Police Sgt. Stan Miller. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He started watching her real close in the toy section,&quot; Miller said. &quot;He was following her around the rest of the store.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
South Charleston Police Lt. H.S. Leishman said the suspect posed as a security guard Saturday night, told the girl he saw her steal something and ordered her to follow him. Then he pulled a knife and forced her into the garden department where he assaulted her. When too many shoppers walked into the area, he led her into the men's clothing department where he assaulted her again, Leishman said. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;People were everywhere,&quot; Miller said. &quot;I don't know how anybody didn't see it.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Police released a surveillance video showing the man, described as a white male in his 30s. More than 100 tips have come in since then, South Charleston Police Sgt. Robert Yeager said Monday. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We know this is our guy,&quot; Yeager said. &quot;We've just got to put a name with the face. If we knew any more about him, we'd have him.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Yeager said the incident appeared to be isolated, but the suspect showed tendencies of being a prior offender. &quot;We don't have any reason to believe he's done it around here, but he has done it before,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
<br>
The girl was doing &quot;as well as can be expected,&quot; Yeager said. He said police plan to offer her counseling. <br>
<br>
<br>
Store manager Mark Hocter declined comment Monday, saying only that &quot;the safety of our guests and team members is our concern at all times.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
The suspect will likely face charges of first-degree sexual abuse and first-degree sexual assault, Yeager said. <br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
My daughter is the same age as this poor girl, in all of this the thing that I can't seem to understand is the idea that the woman let her 11 year old wander in one part of the store while she went shopping in another.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm overprotective but unless my daughter is with a friend(s) then she stays in my sight when we are in public.  I imagine the mother is probably beating herself up pretty badly right now.  You just can not assume anything about the safety of your kids these days.<br>
<br>
It's a damn scary time to be raising kids.  I hope to hell they catch this scumwad.  It's time we get some legislation passed that says if you do this kinda shit to a minor you fucking fry for it.<br>

<br>
Hell' I was going to the store by myself at 6 years old.<br>
<br>
My son is 2 now and he doesn't leave mine or my wife's sight. Even when we take him to the park, he's within arm's reach at all times.<br>
<br>
And if I catch someone even looking funny at him, the only thing that will beat him to jail is the headlights of the ambulance. <p>Thedosius Dreamtwister<br>

It was the same for me too Thed.<br>
<br>
Can the scum that do these kinds of things ever truly be rehabilitated or are we as a society better off thinning the herd by executing these fuckers as fast as we become aware of them?<br>

I say kill them before they ever get a chance as a repeat offender. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:century gothic;font-size:small;">Here's to you and here's to me, and if ever we should disagree .... then fuck you, here's to me.</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daniell1>daniell1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://canflag.ptbcanadian.com/images/buttons/iamv2.wpcon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Town Idiot</span><br>  Posts: 367<br> <font color=#330000>(7/14/03 1:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=850.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just don't understand...</span><hr size=1> Here is how it happens:<br>
<br>
Kid is born.  Mom and Dad take him to a trailer_home_01.  I don't know, the park might be called Whispering Pines or some shit.  Funny, because there is nothing whispering in there, no is there any pines.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I digress...<br>
<br>
Dad, he drinks a lot.  And he is fucking the whore next door when he is not on the oil rig.  He comes home smelling like whiskey and B.O. and smacks the wife around saying &quot;Get your fat ass up and make me dinner!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mom is no better.  Between chain smoking cigarettes and pimping herself out while dad is on the oil rig, she is also drinking and kid is sat in front of a TV that looks more like a piece of 1960's furniture than a TV, watching mom give $10 blow jobs to all the neighborhood men.  He watches this for 8 hours straight...re-runs of violent television flash in front of his eyes like a strobe light, tempered by visions of Mom, sucking dick.<br>
<br>
So they live paycheck to paycheck, spend their money on booze, always have their electric shut off, their cars repossesed, their water shut off.  <br>
<br>
Finally, Dad leaves to &quot;get some cigarettes&quot; and never comes back.  Mom gets arrestted for prostitution, and out kid &quot;Billy&quot; is put into foster home after foster home until he drops out of the 9th grade.  <br>
<br>
Billy works in a factory, making steel shafts for drivetrains.  Over and over they come out in a mezmerizing motion.  His girlfriend left his ass.  He is uneducated and broke.  He is stewing about his childhood and how he was beaten, and beaten, and beaten....<br>
<br>
And he gets no psychiatric help because America doesn't believe that psychiatry is a valid medical institution, so he can't pay for it, nor the medication (insurance won't cover it).  So he mind gradually sinks further and further...and he walks into a Target...<br>
<br>
And that is how it happens.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=angee1>angee1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Whore</span><br>  Posts: 452<br> <font color=#330000>(7/14/03 2:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=850.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.navc.be/avatars/Vamp4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I just don't understand...</span><hr size=1> I live in small town America.  This is a place where crime is low and gangs are made up of wanna-be-(insert minority here)-kids who feel that their middle class parents have wronged them in some way.  Most parents here would feel safe letting their 11 year old child look at something a few isles away while they compared prices on toilet paper and kitty litter.<br>
<br>
A few years ago the community was shocked when a young boy disappeared on his way to school, never to be seen again.  The chilling truth?  He was abducted by a neighbor then SERVED him in chili to family and friends.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.greatfallstribune.com/news/thebarjonahcase/index.html" target="top">Click here for the story.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
In the course of the investigation the media discovered that the neighborhood he lived in also had the highest concentration of sexual and violent offenders.  It is a beautiful old neighborhood that is cheap and affordable.  It is also across the street from the biggest and most popular park in town.  Complete with a duck pond, play equipment, and beautifully manicured gardens, this is probably the worst place to take your kids.<br>
<br>
These days you aren't safe anywhere.  Not even in a little town in Montana.  Little things can be done to prevent (or at least make every effort) this from happening.  Make sure you leave an extra 5-10 minutes for your kids to &quot;window shop&quot; at the store.  Drive your children to and from school or make sure they are with a group of children if they walk.  Let them know that the world isn't as nice as you think it is.  You don't have to crush their view of the world but let them know that going anywhere with somebody (even if they know them) without your knowledge is dangerous.<br>
<br>
It seems that parents these days treat the world as if it was the one they grew up in.  The sad truth is that it isn't. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.1lastnerve.com">www.1lastnerve.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You are not being overprotective, you are being a smart parent. I can't imagine that I am very much younger than you..I am 25...but my mother was the same way with me and my little brother as children. We were not allowed out of our street when I was a kid without a parent with us. Even then my mom kept a watchful eye on us. I had a man try to abduct me from my front yard when I was around 5 or 6. We lived in a very nice middle class neighborhood. I was always within arms reach of my parents whenever we went out in public. You can't be too careful of your children but I don't think its something new to this generation. <p><center><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=124066'><IMG src="http://www.harmonium.net/filespace/Erinye/rheasig.jpg" border=0></a></center>

<br>
Of course, during that time freaks such as this were given real hard time (not &quot;we will rehabilitate you&quot; BS), and once they got to prison the other prisoners did to them a hundred times worse than they did to the kids.  I honestly don't believe sexual predators can truly be rehabilitated without castration - and even then one freak assaulted a kid when he was let out I recall reading.<br>
<br>
When my daughter is 11, she won't be allowed to wander the store.  And that's a shame. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163281"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/Barnes101/wintersbane.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
