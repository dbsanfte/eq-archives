<br>
First, you can go through Luclin.  That would mean farming the assorted Luclin zone bosses like Grieg and THO while racing for the still-heavily-contested spawns in the Ssraeshza Temple initially, while working on the various items for your VT keys.  (The phrases &quot;Comm 2&quot; and &quot;ME shard&quot; will fill your soul with a kind of horrid apathetic loathing before long, if you decide to go down this route).<br>
<br>
Personally, I couldn't stomach it.  The mind-numbing tedium of Luclin farming was one of the major reasons why I decided I would no longer be a part of a raiding guild; for me, Luclin was where the reward ceased to be worth the effort.<br>
<br>
If you decide to go the Luclin route, you need to appreciate that Luclin critters tend to be unrewarding.  Many Velious critters have a habit of dropping four loots; many Luclin ones have a nasty habit of dropping only two.<br>
<br>
Second, you can skip Luclin entirely and head directly to PoP.  If you've &quot;completed&quot; the Velious expansion, you're more than ready for the early PoP critters.  Again, you need to appreciate that PoP is a place where you can generally expect two loots per critter, but if you're serious about continuing through VT, then you're gearing up for PoP in any case.<br>
<br>
Whichever way you go, the future is in the Elemental Planes and then the Plane of Time.  That means raids of ten groups or more, raiding for five to eight hours on end, killing a succession of critters with two drops plus runes.  Most guilds at this stage of the game seem to raid like this four or five days a week, and the guild rules or charter will tend to say things like &quot;raid attendance is mandatory if you are online&quot; - so you have a raid commitment of something like thirty hours a week to look forward to.<br>
<br>
It's a far cry from Velious, where you can raid with four groups for two or three hours and expect to walk away with a meaningful number of upgrades. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162740">Shadowfrost</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=abitoo>Abitoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#330000>(8/30/03 8:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I blew through Velious and all I got was this shirt</span><hr size=1> There have been a few posts on this on various boards, especially a few months after PoP came out.  Basically the premise was, if you have already farmed about half your emp/VT keys for your guild, than go ahead and finish. If you havent started, dont waste your time.<br>
<br>
Getting into VT requires almost 50-100hrs per key in addition to your normal raiding to get the upgrades to continue your progression.  If I was in your shoes, I'd be tempted to clear NToV an extra time or two to make sure you have all the best drops where you need them. (Ody only did NToV 2-3 times, SM did it the same before moving on to luclin).  Also, I would start hunting the less contested luclin mobs such as THO, Burrower, Greig, Shei, and maybe the odd Ssra mob.<br>
<br>
In addition, I'd start expanding my wings on PoP. The lower PoP mobs have a 3 day respawn and some have very nice loot. AD's loot is so-so but may be what you need... TT has some good loot.  POI mini's have some focus for your priests; Behemoth's loot isnt bad, and the zek twins have nice things. Also, save the girls has a few nice items including a monk fist and enchanter de-agro tash stick.<br>
<br>
You will be killing these same mobs for a long time to get the gear you need, but hey, would you rather kill snakes over and over or go raiding? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/abitoo/Abitoo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

The high end guilds on this server have made EQ a job, and it is. The game takes dedication, lots of time, and lots of people - at the high end game.<br>
<br>
Frankly, not every guild will reach Elemental planes, and fewer will reach PoTime. Many guilds won't be able to stomach the trials and tribulations of the high end game - even after getting there, a guild can fall quickly.<br>
<br>
It is also not feasible that the Xev server can support very many High end raiding guilds. Currently we have 5 guilds in the Elemental planes, 1 of those also being in PoTime. The Elemental Planes can be kept dead with 2 guilds, and were done so for some time - Now there are 5. (though Harm mostly moved on).<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
There is plenty of content that is not at the end game but Xev has become inflated with Raiding guilds, and these encounters are not easy to get very many shots at.<br>
<br>
In Luclin, all of the expansion can be done with 3 groups, and in most cases, less - if geared appropriately. For guilds moving into this content, 5-6 groups should be more then enough to win anything. Since Luclin caters to lower numbers, guilds will find themselves very successful but will also find many frustrating moments when progressing from Luclin to PoP.<br>
<br>
If your guild is not ready to expand and put in the time required to become a high end PoP raiding guild, then Luclin is where you want to be.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
PoP is aimed towards the best. Until Elemental Planes, almost no encounter prior will have any loot worth taking - or at least the loot will help very little towards advancing to the next step.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of Luclin-Equivalent raiding encounters, however, the equipment upgrades cannot match that of Luclin. If you raid PoP, your roster will need to grow as you progress, or eventually your guild will hit a brick wall. Your guild will need to reflag constantly for all new members - which can lead to burnout.<br>
<br>
BoT, HoHa, and Innovation are the only 3 zones worth considering if you intend on being a casual guild and don't want to have to progress through PoP right away. These 3 zones offer encounters that do not require many people, have good rewards and no need to reflag, but the drawback is - the encounters also offer no progression in terms of flags (except HoHa only if you defeat all 3 trials, and a casual guild isnt going to be killing Rydda so the point still stands).<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Expect lots of competition no matter what path is chosen. And although it may hurt to admit, some guilds just need to realize that they are a stepping stone for a lot of people...<br>

I'm not sure I would agree with this. Your point of view is slightly skewed by the fact that, when you personally started doing lower end PoP mobs, you were already coming into them with top-end Luclin equipment. The picture is a little different if you are coming into those encounters with the majority of your guild in NToV quality gear.<br>
<br>
There are quite a few lower end PoP encounters which provide very good upgrades for a guild who has not gone the Ssra/VT route (BoT tower bosses spring to mind).<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, going the Ssra/VT route will definately provide you with more raid quality gear in less time, but you have to decide if the hundreds of man hours spent keying for the events in question (Abitoo isn't exaggerating here) will actually save you any time over heading straight to PoP.<br>

That I would agree with 100%. One encounter with an XP mob in any tier 3 or higher zone will tell you that in no uncertain terms. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Thedosius Dreamtwister<br>

<br>
&quot;or at least the loot will help very little towards advancing to the next step.&quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;the equipment upgrades cannot match that of Luclin&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
First off, all PoP encounters have 2 item drops, Luclin has 3. Many PoP items pre-Elementals do not have the FT, Vengeance, and focus effects that Luclin will offer. Just hp/mana upgrades will not suffice. And also you are lacking weapon drops for the majority of melee classes, therefore you lack tons of DPS. <br>
<br>
And I did mention Bot bosses, as well as Innovation / HoH as having some decent rewards for a casual PoP guild. <br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
When Harm went through all of the PoP encounters, not very much rotted at all, but that doesn't mean the items were actually good items. Especially considering the encounters took 40+ people while a mob in VT takes 10.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The VT key is not very hard and doesnt take 100 hours. I completed an entire Emperor key for Faahy (ring, idol, insig, bag) in 6 hours, I duo'd everything cept the Insignia - had 4 people for that.<br>
<br>
Then I camped VT key shards which might have taken 20 hours at the most (again, duo). <br>
<br>
Anyone with a brain can get a key just as fast, I did 2 VT keys pre-PoP mostly Duo and there are other people in this game who've done 6+ keys by themselves. Pre-PoP we had a necro (faah) solo his entire VT key except emp source. Course not everyone is a necro...<br>
<br>
The only 2 shard camps that require any amount of time are ME and FG - in my experiences. If you get ME and FG you can have the rest done in a day. <br>
<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
If you are a casual guild, would you rather spend time doing keys that require less then a group to complete (except emperor piece) - realizing VT itself takes less then 40 people to complete for an upcoming guild Or waste time killing mobs in PoP that require greater then 40 people, lots of reflagging, and worst loot. <br>
<br>
PoP just isnt a fun place for a casual guild imo, that is why my first sentence was - your guild needs to ask itself what it wants.<br>

If, for instance, you can catch com2 when it is up on server ups, ect - it takes you 10 minutes to clear to him and kill him.  When I was camping mine, we had 2 groups clearing almost the entire second floor and it took over 4 hours for him to pop.  Multiply that times 12 (needed one for everyone in the two groups of course) and you are already far over 20 hours.  Of course you do not need 2 groups, but the more people you have clearing, the more chance you have of him to pop.<br>
<br>
Also, some shards can be deceptively long.  I spent over 60 hours in ME camping that shard.  We had groups clearing all 5 of the possible spawn points, and only 2 other shards dropped in that time for the other groups.  I hear they have since upped the drop rate - however, people still spend a lot of time there.<br>
<br>
All in all, 100 hours for each key is about right for a guild doing them the first time.  Remember that some of that time is spent helping others at camps that will not further your key.  Many of those hours are spent helping others after you have finished your key.  For a guild who is gearing up for emp, you also have to add on ore farming time for bane weapons.<br>
<br>
For a VT capable guild, I'd say 20 hours is about right for the time it should take any member to get a key.  For a guild in the elemental planes, you should be able to solo most everything for a key, or duo it at the worst.  But for a guild just starting, VT is a HUGE time investment.  That isn't to discourage people from doing it - I think the Luclin route is better than farming early PoP.  My main reason for that is the equipment you get from VT normally doesn't get replaced until elemental planes or time.<br>
<br>
All in all, it comes down to where you want to invest the time.  Do you want to farm snakes or would you rather raid in early PoP for a while.  You'll probably end up spending about the same amount of time either way.<br>
