I was pretty much the only person in the zone, and was able to smack the lesser shades around a bit. I am a shaman but for these really, REALLY low greenies I neither summoned a pet nor buffed myself besides haste and sow; I was literally simply smacking things around. <br>
<br>
Neither the kills nor the drops were stellar, of course, but that is what I wanted. I know there are better spots for the swirling shadows :P <br>
<br>
After hunting there for a while, this 39th level ranger called Xxxxxxxxx shows up and starts killing the lesser shades as well. He's anonymous, however since I had been playing low level alts in that zone for a few days I know that he's been farming the low greenie lesser shadows for many days, and that he's an officer of Xxxxxxx xx xxx Xxxxxx guild -- didn't even have to do a /guildstatus for that. Since that area isn't really a camp (albeit many of the spawns are static) and there's this &quot;no camps&quot; policy anyway, I figure fair enough, it's a FFA and pick up the pace on my own kills to keep up with the competition. So far so good. I fire up a fast casting, really low powered nuke that I use to pull with, so that if I try to pull something that's already engaged there's no way I can grab aggro. That, along with running up to the mob and attacking it point blank guarantees that I can't KS a level 5 meleeing wizard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Some time later this other person, Xxxxxx the 21st level ranger, shows up. I've seen her there before and later I find out it's X's wife. I pick up the pace again a little. So there are two rangers and one shaman killing the lesser shades.  Obviously there aren't enough lesser shades for everyone there, so those two start to become reckless and sometimes clearly intercept my pull and even jump on mobs that I'm fighting but have whiffed on for three times. Personally I think they were pissed by that they weren't able drive me away and monopolize all those kills, and ended up KS'ing my kills. Sure, sometimes I pulled a mob that was right in front of one of them, but if I can pull it with a wimpy nuke it ain't engaged and thus free game; they did the same to me with their bows. Difference being that I made damn certain I didn't KS them; they did not respond with the same courtesy. However, that's not what this rant is about. That was the primer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
This rant is about the attitudes of those two little fucktards. <br>
<br>
I was talking to a friend of mine when they showed up. My friend happened to be in the parent guild of the guild these two idiots were in (their guild is separated into a pre-40 and post-40 guilds), and so when the situation got into the KS stage I mentioned to him that I was being KS'ed by his guildies. He asked their names, and I mentioned them to him. *shrug* <br>
<br>
The next thing I know the 39th level ranger sends me a tell.. and make note, this is THE first tell I've <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">ever</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> gotten from him:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/smartboy.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Whoa!<br>
Whose child did I eat for lunch? Did I tell his guildie to chew him out? Did he?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/no-chew-anybody.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
...it would appear not. What the hell is this guy's problem?<br>
<br>
What with the way he opened the conversation, honestly, at this point I wasn't feeling particularily inclined to being in any way, shape, or form NICE to this guy anymore. So when he continues....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/idiot.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I mean man, I KNOW people from those guilds and I know they're levelheaded and cool. At this point I'm reeling a bit. Is this guy for real?! Oh, but it gets better! He replies....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/plot_thickens.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
...the plot thickens.. sounds like this fuckwad has some GENERAL issues and he's taking them out on me. Let's see what happens if I prod him a bit...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/what_is_this_guy_smoking.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
So we have this perfectly nice guy storming into my relaxed farming, starts to KS, tries to monopolize the spawns, and sends me a tell calling me a dickhead? As the first tell no less.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/crybaby.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Uh-huh. And you're farming exactly WHAT, you fucking brainless moron? Newsflash smartass, these ain't bluebies for you, they're LOW green that you kill with one blow. Ditto for your 21st level wife. Pot, kettle? Black much? Who's the crybaby?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/noissueshere.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Notice a pattern here, it's all about &quot;you high levels&quot; isn't it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/whineyranjaboy.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I point out to him that he's doing exactly the same thing, storming into someone else's farming and causing grief...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/meriteuwrong.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
...but are they at fault? Hell no! (if you ask them, that is) This asshat's been KS'ed a few times and all of a sudden he is on the righteous warpath to SCREW the game for everyone, just like his game has been screwed. And boy, will he let you know about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/conspiracy.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
There's that &quot;you guys&quot; again. I tell ya, it's the Grand Conspiracy of the level 65s.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/moralhighhorse.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
I mean WTF the levels have anything to do with it?!?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.questsend.net/rannnt/justquitplz.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
What can I say? Die plz.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sure, I wasn't exactly nice back, but damn! With that kind of a skill for making friends he ought to be a politician. And the weirdest thing is, this is not some 14-year-old cluebait. This guy's sixty-fucking-two! You would think that they'd have more clue by now. This guy also has a 51st level magician on Xev, and his wife has a 45th level necromancer so we're not dealing with a thorough newbie here -- this guy's just a 100% self-centered lamer.<br>
<br>
I've tried contacting the guild leader of the guild this guy and his alts belong to, but they've not deigned to respond. I've asked him twice whether he's read my email, but he says he hasn't. So I guess he's not interested.<br>
<br>
The real fun part came when my wife started talking to this idiot a few days ago, trying to make heads and tails out of it. The guy denied, outright DENIED that he had called me a <br>
dickhead. Only when my wife pointed out that she saw the screenshots, did the guy relent and admit that he called me names. However, then he proceeded to say that I had been terrorizing his wife for DAYS in Shadeweaver's Thicket. Newsflash, dickhead: I haven't been IN Shadeweaver's Thicket besides running from Shar Vahl to the PoK book except that Thursday.  Given that I've been talking with people when I've been online, they can vouch for me.<br>
<br>
I've spoken with a few other, lower level people who've farmed in Shadeweaver's and they said this 39th level ranger and 21st level ranger have caused them trouble also. So much for helping out low-level folks.<br>
<br>
WTF is it with people like this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=landale>Landale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>OH NOS!!11</span><br>  Posts: 516<br> <font color=#330000>(10/2/03 1:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1051.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Memo: Don't level to 65</span><hr size=1> Goes back to the Hawkestone mentality.  &quot;I pay my 12.95/month, I deserve to do what the fuck I want and fuck everyone else&quot; <br>

No action has been taken.  I have a few friends in that guild, and they've kept an eye open for me.  The guild leader even intended to talk with the other person I was having a conversation with, but that hasn't happened either.  I'm guessing this whole thing is being shoved under the carpet, so to say.<br>
<br>
I emailed the full screenshots and logs to the guild leader, BTW.  I also emailed the full screenshots to a few of my friends in those guilds, and the response I got was something to the effect of &quot;OMFG!&quot;  -I prefer screenshots over logs, BTW, cuz they're not so easy to forge. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lledier>Lledier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I am the Last</span><br>  Posts: 458<br> <font color=#330000>(10/2/03 1:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1051.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.everlore.com/GFILES/UserPic121899_17520.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Memo: Don't level to 65</span><hr size=1> Sounds like I need to go to Shadeweavers..... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=558439" target="top">Lledier Hosen</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Dwarven Cleric of Brell - L52 - Dragons of Xev.<br>

Well thought out post for the rant section. We have a rule here, though. We have no problems with anyone venting here to relieve steam off their chest. The only prerequisite is that you have to have your toon name in a sig at the bottom of your post. If your toon name is your EZ board handle, you can put something like &quot;See board name for toon name.&quot; Just something to identify you with.<br>

<br>
I agree with one thing you said, Idadar, which is that Rakyn wasn't any more compassionate and thoughtful with his conversation than the ranger.  The rest of it I don't agree with, having talked to the follow in question.  They were different in more ways than just &quot;who started it&quot;. <br>
<br>
Trying to have a reasonable conversation with this fellow (I was playing peacemaker, or trying to) was like trying to hold onto an eel that had been rubbed in KY jelly.  I'm not saying he couldn't be nice, he just didn't want to admit that maybe he was partially at fault, whereas even Rak up there admits he was being nasty in places.  <br>
<br>
In any case, Rak didn't come here to be told that he's the Good Guy, or a victim of any sort.  He came to vent.  So with that in mind, I'mna work on my own damned rant and stop interfering here.<br>

<br>
1)  They drop them like nuts..  up to 2/3 at a time..<br>
<br>
2)  They are only about level 40.<br>
<br>
3)  Your 60-whatever pet can eat them.<br>
<br>
4)  Don't let them swarm you, if you fall asleep at the keyboard that 150pt LT can hurt.<br>
<br>
5)  A level 29 ranger or level 5 melee'ing wizard would get plastered in a few hits by any of these, so the only competition will be from other higher level folks.<br>

I did it again in /shout, again no answer. So I spend a while buffing myself, getting ready to do some serious farming. Get over to the island started to kill those shades. <br>
<br>
Next thing I know this level 55 or so druid (may have been a ranger) comes and starts to /tell me with profanities why I am KSing his mob. I explained to him that I did /ooc and /shout for camp and no one answered so I assume that the camp was free. His response is he turned off /ooc and /shout because he didn't want to be bothered with newbie requests and begs. I did /who and there were just me and him in the zone. /boggle. Anyways, I was not in a good mood but just gave him a stern warning about his attitude and left.<br>
