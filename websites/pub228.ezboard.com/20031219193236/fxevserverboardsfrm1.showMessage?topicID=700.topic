<br>
Most importantly is the effect of pets with PCs in melee range. Everyone knows that if a player character has aggro from a mob, and is in melee range, no pet or NPC in melee range will be attacked, regardless of damage done or spells cast by the NPC. <br>
<br>
It is very obvious that the aggro of a pet is independant of it's owner or of those in melee range. any mage can nuke so much that his/her pet looses aggro ( i.e. is no longer top on the aggression list ) and the mob goes after the magician. necros that use all of their DoTs as soon as possible better hope darkness landed. and so on. yet, regardless, if anyone enters melee range and gets any aggro, be it proximity or from taking offensive action, that PC will be attacked.<br>
<br>
nothing new there. just a preface. however...<br>
<br>
say for example you have a warrior, beastlord, and shaman. the beastlord's pet is tanking a mob. its proc goes off several times, and the pet as gained a lot of aggro. the shaman debuffs the mob and DoTs it, but the pet still has aggro. then the warrior steps up and swings once. the warrior has aggro, and is being attacked. <br>
so what? <br>
well. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>effectively</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the warrior now has MORE aggro than the Shaman that just landed debuffs and DoTs, and all he did was swing once. the mob will not go after the shaman, because the pet has more aggro than the shaman. but the mob will not attack the pet, because there is a PC in melee range.<br>
<br>
my first thought was that anyone in melee range must have MORE aggro than the pet, so the game just has the warrior's aggro shoot up to that of the pet's. this is incorrect. if, in this case, the beastlord tells his pet to back off, once the pet leaves melee range, the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>mob will stop attacking the warrior and go after the shaman</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
put simply, even though a pet isn't getting hit, it's aggro can be what's keeping the mob off of the casters. i used BL pet in this case because their proc is a nice DD + taunt, and i've seen them hold aggro over magician and necro pets.<br>
__________________________<br>
the next, which is very minor, is the effect of being low on health. once you get below about 30% health, every mob that has any aggro towards you ignores its current target and focuses on you. this is normally referred to as &quot;bloodlust&quot;. this also effects pets, usually when a pet is tanking one mob and  a groupmember is tanking another, it will switch targets once one of the mobs gets low on health.<br>
<br>
It is commonly believed that once you reach this point, it is *impossible* to taunt the mob off of whomever is low on health. last night my monk was &quot;aggro kiting&quot; ( read as: low on health and had SoW ) a giant while my group followed him and got in some free hits. we weren't quite powerful enough to take him in a normal fashion, so this went on for over 3 minutes. eventually, the warrior gained aggro. this was *not* because i got too far away or used FD. i even went back to the giant and started hitting it without gaining aggro.<br>
<br>
in short, the *bloodlust* stage adds a LARGE amount of aggro, but does not add an infinite amount of aggro.<br>
_______________________<br>
the next one is more of a question than speculation.<br>
<br>
if I am KOS to a mob that is attacking someone else, when I sit down to it, I *may* or *may not* get aggro. this appears to be independant of who is attacking the mob, or what he/she has done. <br>
<br>
i've seen people just gain proximity aggro, run by me while I'm sitting, and I'm perfectly safe ( yes, KOS to the mob ). I've had a ranger snare a mob to pull it, and it goes for me while I'm sitting BEHIND the ranger, clearly out of melee range. <br>
<br>
some mobs will aggro on me just for being around even in they are engaged. some won't. why? is it entirely dependent on the mob? is it limited to specific zones? although I've seen many mobs change targets to attack me BEFORE I DO ANYTHING, it has been limited to specific areas, such as Karnor's.  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://community.the-underdogs.org/smiley/armed/dark2.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnipgnoppikpok>Gnipgnop Pikpok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Xev Peon</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#330000>(3/19/03 11:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=700.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a few points about NPC aggression</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>well. effectively, the warrior now has MORE aggro than the Shaman that just landed debuffs and DoTs, and all he did was swing once. the mob will not go after the shaman, because the pet has more aggro than the shaman. but the mob will not attack the pet, because there is a PC in melee range<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yes that is how it works, but I never really thought about it in that way. Interesting.

So they changed it that a pet of any kind does not gain aggro if any players are around. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260848">Shamu Whitewale</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Some mobs seem to stick to whoever they notice first.  I've had occasions where I did absolutely nothing to a mob and had not yet done any healing, and it just wouldn't leave me alone even though Lyndar was slashing and snaring -- and any druid can tell you how much hate snaring generates.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I have to root such mobs, and it takes Lyndar doing a considerable amount of damage before he can retain aggro when root breaks.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to factor heal aggro into this, too.  Sometimes I can sit, and sometimes if I sit the mob comes after me, depending on how much hate sit aggro adds to my existing heal aggro.  Particularly when Lyndar and I are duoing, it can be amusing to sit and stand and sit and stand and watch the mob do double takes, until/unless Lyndar gets enough hate that sitting no longer causes the mob to come after me.<br>

<br>
I've had a number of occasions when the group had 2 or 3 pets in it, and the mob still immediately turned on any player that got in melee range.  This was also true when the &quot;tank&quot; was a charmed or dire charmed mob and there were no melees in the group.  It would be cool if the two pet theory were true, but I've been in just that situation and a variety of others (exactly 2 pets in the group, more than 2 pets in the group, etc) and haven't seen it happen.  If someone else *has* seen this, I'd love to hear about it (so I can figure out what circumstances are required <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p>Lyndarra Cuthalion ‹›<br>

<br>
One method for keeping aggro on the warrior as a Paladin that I've found, actually, can be pretty interesting. I pull with 3 to 4 stuns (wee, can be fun trying to get them all off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), then the Warrior sets in hacking. Nobody has aggro over me, until the Warrior's taunt succeeds. Then, the Warrior is placed over me on the aggro list, and is thus FAR above everyone else. Of course, this only happens when a group invites both me and a Warrior, which never happens anymore because when someone in the group tanks better than I do, most pickup groupers consider my usefulness minimal, at best... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I suppose actually playing my Paladin would improve the number of groups he gets, though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This tactic works with any class that is able to tank a few rounds and has a way to generate quick aggro, and if the casters are told what's going on, they're generally pretty happy with it.<br>
<br>
(just my few thoughts, since one of the posts concerned high-aggro classes using that aggro to keep the MoB on the tank...)<br>
