We're a few months old, founded by a group of friends, and grown from there.  I'm not an original member, but I'm one of the earlier recruits.  Levels range from 53 down to nothing (bazaar mules).  <br>
<br>
We're in that awkward phase where we've lost several 50+ people because of a lack of support for epics, raids, PoP groups, etc.  At one point, we enforced a no alts until lvl 45 policy, to try and get people to a closer level, but this caused several low level people to leave.  In order to accomodate everyone, our &quot;raids&quot; (using the term loosely) have been to zones like Tower of the Frozen Shadow, Lower Guk, SolB, Hollowshade.  Since we have such a broad range of levels, though, no one gets exp, there's little loot in these zones, and its trivial content for the upper level peeps.  Anyway, enough with the history.<br>
<br>
Can anyone share some advice on how to get through this stage?  I don't want to see the guild fail, as I've invested a lot of energy in it, and have made many friends.  I see a few options, all of which have drawbacks:<br>
1) tighten up recruiting, and only accept people above a certain level (45 or so?)<br>
2) Have guild powerleveling nights, where people park themselves in TD and I quad spirocs until my eyes bleed.<br>
3) Hook up with a higher level guild and become their junior partner.<br>
4) Beg and plead for people to stop playing alts and to level their mains<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'd appreciate any insight or advice. <p>Willain of Xev<br>

<br>
I think Celestial Rising cover this best, they'll accept level 35 recruits - but as their applications section says - there is nothing in the guild for you at level 35.  You see level in itself is no gauge of the person, only a temporary measurement of a characters power - and excluding people because of it will not necessarily start getting you the 'right' kind of people for your guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) Have guild powerleveling nights, where people park themselves in TD and I quad spirocs until my eyes bleed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is a bad idea for two reasons, firstly: Extensive power levelling will leave you with a lot of high level characers who don't know their class very well.  Secondaly, 4 mobs is not enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   AOE baby - it's THE way to power level <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However that should not detract you from spending time with your younger members and hanging out with them, playing with them (be it with an alt or 'helping' their group for an hour or so).  This could be a positive long term investment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>3) Hook up with a higher level guild and become their junior partner.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How about hooking up with a guild of similar stature?  There's plenty of pre-epic guilds about who'd love to do them but don't have the numbers.  Individually you are just a bunch of noobs, together your a bunch of zerglings capable of some pretty big corpse runs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>4) Beg and plead for people to stop playing alts and to level their mains<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Encourage your guild to be incestual, to first LFG within /gu - and to consider leaving groups gracefully for guild offered groups (this is good training for raids).  A member alone is meating other people, but your members together are having other people meet them...<br>
<br>
<br>
In regards to raids organising 'something for everyone' is generally a bad idea.  I bet you'll find the lower levels might come if they are on, stay for a short while and then begin the feel that 'its all just for the high levels, I feel useless, and I feel like i'm giving THEM gear'...  In my view all-level range raids create a THEM and us fealing.<br>
<br>
Once you have established a culture of incestual inter-grouping within your guild then you will find that groups start forming for loot rather than xp. When that happens you are ready to start raiding.<br>
<br>
The strength of a guild comes not from the guild itself but from the members of the guild, encouraging your members to do what the 'guild' wants them to do will just distance you from those members.  Instead the guild should do what the members want - or at least be very clear about it's objectives when recruiting.<br>

These can be anything from 'bash-a-guildie' events to lvl 1 gnome races.<br>
<br>
This will encourage the guild to be together more and get to know eachother better. Some of my most fun times have been on these kind of events with my guild.<br>
<br>
Levels will come in time eventually but at least you can have fun together and give people a different reason to be in the guild. <p>Formerly Pizzicato<br>

First off, you need to get your guild's purpose in order.  Don't just say &quot;our goal is to have fun&quot;.  Everyone says that, its meaningless.  Fun is different for different people.  Some likes loots and gears, some like to see higher and higher level contents, some like to do tradeskills, some like to raid raid raid raid.  Some fun things (like loots) are high maintenance while others (like tradeskills) requires no maintenance.<br>
<br>
The 50+ you lost are the ones that are probably more focused on loots and gears and progression to high level content.  If you guild is not supporting that or driving towards that, they won't stay one way or another.<br>
<br>
So the key is to really sit down and define what your guild is about, where you plan to go in-game, how you are going to get there, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and by when</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  When you have that, present that to your members.  Some will stay, some will leave.  But from that point on, only accept those that understand the purpose, goals, and future progression of your guild.<br>
<br>
Getting people to raid level will not necessarily help you to keep people.  You might keep the raiders but you might lose the more causal players.  Remember your core are the people who started the gulid with you.  Start with what you want and what they want.<br>
<br>
As for the other things you've suggested:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1) tighten up recruiting, and only accept people above a certain level (45 or so?)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Level matters less than play style.  A level 45 can have fun and stay at 45 for months.  A level 20 can be a level 50 in a few weeks.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2) Have guild powerleveling nights, where people park themselves in TD and I quad spirocs until my eyes bleed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
In general, never PL people.  The PLed are generally less knowledgable about their classes and often turn into single-role stereotype.  Besides, if you want them to level up and they don't, that means they don't listen to you anyway, what's the point.  And if they can't level up on their own, then what good are they?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>3) Hook up with a higher level guild and become their junior partner.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
By doing that, you are telling your own guild that the guild can't stand on its own.  Shows no grits.  Its a slap on the face.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>4) Beg and plead for people to stop playing alts and to level their mains<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
This has to do with play style.  You have to start with setting guild goals, the pace of progression, and recruit only those that fit the path.  If a large number of your members play lots of alts, chances are they will never be the raiders that you'd like to see.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the end, its all about management.  You cannot just gather a group of people together, slap a guild tag on them and expect progress or unity.  You need to create goals and expectations, and follow through with them.  That gives your applicants and members a roadmap.  They'll either help you along or following another path at different speed and ferocity. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=328193"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/hibashirasakai/HibashiraNewHalfSize.txt"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dlaritan>Dlaritan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#330000>(7/29/03 8:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.usefulware.com/graphics/lines/avatar.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mid-level guild blues</span><hr size=1> all this advice is, of course, predicated on whether you want to be a raiding guild.  your app process needs to make sure you are getting people who want the SAME THINGS out of their EQ experience.<br>

If they (your guild) want to play a bunch of chars and have fun doing so, dont push people to level so they can raid, that isnt what they want to do.<br>

once everyone's goals are the same, everyone knows what the plan is for achieving them, and your recruiting process is bringing in people who have the same goals and are willing to do what it takes according to the plan, you will be in guilded bliss. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8660" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.usefulware.com/graphics/lines/sigalone.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Forest Stalker of Karana</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Dlaritan scowls at you, ready to attack -- He looks like he could wipe the floor with you!</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shamuofxev>shamuofxev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mu</span><br>  Posts: 400<br> <font color=#330000>(7/29/03 9:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~arithon/EQ/mgosau_sig_commission.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mid-level guild blues</span><hr size=1> The split between the &quot;fun and family&quot; guild and the &quot;raiding&quot; guild is nearly impossible to overcome.  There are some &quot;social&quot; guilds that have been around for years (AF and SoH come to mind) with a strict &quot;no mandatory raiding&quot; policy.  And they routinely go through splits, when one generation of players has reached the maximum of what they can achieve in the guild, and move on.  As long as you have a good leadership and good recruiting, you can survive being &quot;non-raiding&quot;, even when you will just loose most of your top end players at some point. If you do it right, you can develop a nice community of ex-members, that will assist your guild in times of need, that feel a common bond having gone through a development phase in their characters that involved your guild.<br>
Now, if you have a consensus you want to develop as a guild towards high end content, you need to make that decission as a guild, and then make it clear at recruiting time to all you add.  Moving up means raids, and raids require time commitment.  The typical starting raid, Kael arena, needs 40 people of 50 average for 3 h. Maybe 30 with today's equipment available even for a level 50.<br>
If you want to move up, you need to make raid attendance mandatory for all on line, you will not be able to get the necessary teamwork going if you have always changing people at your raids.<br>
Once you made the commitment you can start moving up the ranks, Kael, ToV-HoT, RC,Doom, Dain, KT, IV, NToV, AoW, Ssra bosses and so on.<br>
But the all important quesion is, what do you want to be?  And that is the one question you have to answer for yourself. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260848">Shamu Whitewale</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

If you're lucky to develop such a community of ex-members, be sure to let your current members know why it's important to keep those relationships strong.  Sometimes current members ask the question, &quot;Why do we want them hanging around?  They left.&quot;  Help them see the benefit of having friends outside the guild. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.geocities.com/lorellelovecraft/tempsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=300843">Lorelle's Magelo Profile</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=uefbyte>UEF Byte</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www-und.ida.liu.se/~johro897/flags/germany.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#330000>(7/30/03 12:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mid-level guild blues</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So the key is to really sit down and define what your guild is about, where you plan to go in-game, how you are going to get there, and by when.

Thats indeed the key. Deal with that. Define your goals. Then do it, dont rush, just keep working toward it. Depending on your goals look and plan ahead. This concerns recruitment, loot policys, raiding etc. Not much more to say, because it really depends on your guild and your goals now. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>

<br>
 OoD used to be a guild who looked at ToV with pure terror, Sleepers was a dream, hell, we used to wipe joint raiding Kael with another guild, and I'm not even talking about the big dogs (see invs giants =P)<br>
<br>
 The main reason was members and goals, as posted above, gonna be a weeding in and out prosses, times will get tough when not many are on etc. . <br>
<br>
 I remember doing a /who all order and if we saw 20 people on WOW RAID TIME YAY!<br>
<br>
 Its all about sticking with it, plenty of times we woulda crashed and burned but we stayed strong with a core of great people that believed. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/fdraconis6440frm66.showMessage?topicID=16.topic" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/newfie8088/mahl3.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.orderofdraconis.com"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-family:times;font-size:medium;">Order of Draconis</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=587989"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;font-family:times;font-size:xx-small;">Runamuk</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gairgraymist>Gair Graymist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(9/18/03 6:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mid-level guild blues</span><hr size=1> Honored Circle was a prime example of a family based guild that had TONS of members move through it and then leave but was still able to be friends with ex members.<br>

<br>
Honestly though, I think its really hard for a mid-level guild to survive considering how many 55-65 people there are nowadays.  Level progression has become much easier with PoP and I can't even begin to tell you how many good people we lost from what we always felt was our &quot;social guild&quot; because those who were serious about playing (i.e. 20-30 hours per week and up) simply levelled and passed everyone including the officers.<br>
<br>
I'd agree with the suggestion of understanding and accepting what you want your guild to be as well.  If its just social, churn is always going to be a huge issue but you should be able to maintain the relationships outside of the guild channel by setting up an allies or alumni channel.  <br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

make clear that advancing in the game means raiding. the other real options are tradeskilling only or do zillions of LDON adv to get some pre-elemental gear in some slots. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=67678"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nogi</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

I know of at least 1 club out there that basically takes anyone, no tags, no guild, only a channel and raiding-ready members of family-social guilds. It's kinda a ghost-guild if there is such a thing. Ask around, you might find one. Show your ready and someone might invite you. Good way to get those epics and quests and whatnot that the typical social guild has no hope of ever accomplishing.  <p>-Drylar<br>
