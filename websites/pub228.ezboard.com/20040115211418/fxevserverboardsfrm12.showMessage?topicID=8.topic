We don't want the administrivia involved, we don't want to determine what item is worth how many points, we don't want folks to accumulate points they can't spend because we don't raid enough (and don't plan on nightly raids just to pad the bank), etc.<br>
<br>
Some folks in the guild (predominantly folks that came from dkp guilds) aren't thrilled about this. Most folks in the guild, though, are happy with it.<br>
<br>
What are some opinions here? I know I can't make everyone happy, and I'm not in a big hurry to change over to dkp just to please a few newcomers, but as we get higher (most of the mains are 50+ and some are 60+ at this point), we have a hard time finding new warriors and clerics because of the draw of gear a &quot;raiding guild&quot; could provide. <p>Baron Wiltan Ryouki<br>

<br>
You can also use DKP to your advantage, sick of people turning up late?  I used to award DKP something like:<br>
<br>
3pts Posted on forum would attend and arrived on time<br>
2pts Didn't post on forum, but arrived on time anyway<br>
1pt Attended Raid<br>
-2pts Posted on forum that they'd attend, and didn't.<br>
<br>
You can use DKP as a lever, aslong as the rules are known and visible to the membership (ie. no sending tells, &quot;i'll double your DKP if you come&quot;) then it's fair.<br>
<br>
DKP isn't a hard-line rules system, I laugh my head off when I read guilds that say &quot;we dont use dkp, we use a merit system&quot;.  So um, what exactly is DKP if not a measure of merit?<br>
<br>
The difference between DKP and 'merit' systems is that DKP rewards the same things that merit systems do, but merit systems keep on rewarding the same people whereas DKP spreads the loot evenly.<br>
<br>
I found it quite suprising that one of the top DKP scorers of my little band was a Necro I probably wouldn't have noticed on a merit system.  He kept his head down and never made a splash - but he was always there, supporting the guild and doing his bit - DKP rewarded him, merit would have overlooked him.<br>
<br>
Previous to that experience I was in a guild that adopted DKP during my time there, I was very much opposed to it at the inception - I considered DKP to be a way of the hard core of the guild keeping all the loot for themselves.  However DKP was introduced, and I actually liked it.<br>
<br>
I liked it because previously I had very much gone un-noticed but after it's introduction I was finaly getting rewarded for my efforts and earning the right to loot I didn't think that cleric05 would ever be allowed.<br>
<br>
Is it fair for cleric05 to get a decent item once in a while?  I ask you, what good is having a 5th cleric if they aren't geared?<br>

<br>
If you have too few points coming in, nobody can ever afford anything.<br>
<br>
If you have too few points going out, it leads to point hoarding.<br>
<br>
When Cult of Setekh was setting up it's DKP system, I was concerned about point hoarding (it had been a problem in Soveriegn's Might), so I, along with my officers, delayed the introduction for several weeks until we had a chance to run tests.<br>
<br>
In the end, the system worked very well. Any given member could expect to recieve an upgrade in turn, and nothing ever rotted.<br>
<br>
When demand for loot from certain mobs started to drop off, we would devalue the mob's point value (NEVER adjust the value of items unless the mob that drops it is a new addition to your target list. Otherwise, it can lead to &quot;but x-person only paid 4 points, why should I pay 5?&quot;) until the mob would reach a value of 0.0 and we would stop persuing it.<br>
<br>
My guild is gone now, but one thing I think you will find everyone agreed on was that we were extremely fair with our loot distribution. My only regret was not finding more loot for our chain classes, particularly our Rogues. <p>Thedosius Dreamtwister<br>

It is also extremly rigid in times of &quot;emergency&quot;, for example if your main tank leaves and you quickly need to equip a new one.  It also prevents &quot;rewards&quot;, e. g. for the puller dieing 17 times on one raid trying to figure out a new pull.<br>
On the other hand, it's prefereable to the random system, which always rewards the underequipped player (who rolls on everything, probably beating out the well equipped player on the one time a month something drops he could use).  Random leads to a very even equipment level in your guild, what is not always the best for a raid oriented build (that needs a MT, high mana regen clerics etc).<br>
Award loot systems are the ones that best help your guild progress - and most easily destroy your guild.  Nothing worse then people getting the feeling &quot;loot only goes to friends of XYZ&quot;.  The best way to handle award is probably to keep your own hidden dkp, but use it only as a guildeline when determening where to put the loot (aka if it's not guild-important, reward attendance, if it is, screw dkp, the MT needs that BoC). <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260848">Shamu Whitewale</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
If you plan to go on and get into higher and higher stuff all the time, then i strongly suggest a DKP system. The earlier you start it, the better. I am not sure where you are in the game, but if you start doing HoT, this might be a good time to also start such a number based system. <br>
<br>
The system will help you to distribute loot somewhat fair. In the beginning people wont like it, but they ll soon realize its actually not that bad, especially if you assign loot already instead to roll.<br>
<br>
The system will help you to decide who gets what, which will be very helpful when 100hp/100mana All/All items start to drop and every class claims it fits best for just this class.<br>
<br>
Of course there are guilds out there which assign loot by some council, but if you arent a leading guild or ALL very close friends (which i doubt) then this wont work out for you.<br>
<br>
When using DKP you can choose between open and closed numbers. Both things have ups and downs. I suggest closed numbers to avoid discussions. Determinging values for items is very hard and the less people are involved in that the better. Its important however to watch that your DKP in = DKP out and adjust values over time to accomodate that.<br>
<br>
Also when using DKP dont look straight at numbers. The numbers are there to help YOU, its not like you are there to help the numbers. Keep this in mind and you ll be fine. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>

There will always be someone who is not rewarded properly for his or her contribution.<br>
<br>
A major problem is that the game contains the wrong balance of loot.  For example, in the Velious expansion, significantly more melee loot drops than caster loot, and the caster loot itself is much less of an upgrade than the melee loot.  It's only in Luclin and beyond that this imbalance is corrected; and in PoP, the pendulum swings perhaps a little too far the other way, with casters doing rather better than melees (apart from the knights, of course, who seem to do very well indeed from PoP boss itemization).<br>
<br>
So even if you get the points values completely right - an impossible task of itself - you still won't have completely fair loot distribution.  That's just how it is.<br>
<br>
My view has always been that you might as well use /random, because in a long enough time period, the people who attend the most raids will get to roll the dice most often in any case.<br>

<br>
We then implemented our PPP (DkP) system.  At first it was strictly raid attendance.  As we went on and were killing mobs out of raid hours we needed to add more incentive for ppl to want to help on X mob so we added target mob kills as well.<br>
<br>
The reason behind having DkP is to reward those that help you step up along the mob ladder and not to the casual player who doesn't do much to get you there.<br>
<br>
With DkP you don't have players wishing they had better dice or players thinking you only awarded that to him because he is your buddy.<br>
<br>
Some DkP are only used in a merit based system anyhow.  Ours isn't.  The members bid on items that have set values.  The person highest on DkP list bidding wins and loses pts.<br>
<br>
We've had to make adjustments so it may look more complicated than it is at this point.  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.peritusx.com/rules.html" target="top">Take a look if you like.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I would have to say that my guildies never have issues with loot.  Not that they don't like it and want it, but I think they truly feel they have control over what they receive and that is a comforting feeling to have.  Seems to keep people happy. <p>Anakaunda Dro`lani<br>

However I don't think just any DKP system would work fine, you have to tune the system you use to your guild. Some important, non-obvious aspects to our system are:<br>
<br>
* we use zero-sum DKP. The way it works is that if 3 items drop worth 10 points each and 30 people were there, everyone gets one point (10 * 3 / 30). That has a few important effects on things, first of all it keeps the system relatively balanced, in terms of an economy. If we priced every item at 100's of DKP, it wouldn't matter, because people would get lots of DKP when those expensive items dropped. It also incents us to do raids where there are lots of possible upgrades for people vs not so many. When we were doing ST key mobs, we had to add a bonus to things like Sontalak where the *only* reason to kill him was the key. We also had to add a bonus for people who showed up early to clear for Tunare. Other than those two things this system has worked well for us.<br>
<br>
* We allow people to buy stuff even if they're negative on DKP. Basically it's important that stuff doesn't rot, and we're not going to let an upgrade for someone rot simply because they don't have the DKP. However we do charge people full price for everything that's looted, which means some folks end up *very* negative. Rotting items do not get a reduction in price, otherwise people can just let it go to the rot tier and buy it on the cheap.<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned that a couple objections to DKP that I want to cover, at least to the degree that it works for our guild:<br>
<br>
1) DKP doesn't reward the people who take on more demanding roles in a raid.<br>
<br>
This is a frequent bias against DKP that shows up in merit guilds. However, ask yourself -- would Tank_23 like to tank the big mob too? How about Puller_4, think they want to pull some? Probably they do. Why can't they? Well, because their gear isn't as good. Oh, but the best gear is going to the MT and the puller, because they need it... If you're Tank_23 or Puller_4, you're sitting there going &quot;how do I ever get to tank then?&quot; And the answer is you don't, not unless someone doesn't show up, and when that happens you probably can't do as great a job simply because you've been getting the trickle-down loot.<br>
<br>
Merit systems are a self-reinforcing cycle when you distribute loot based on perceived need because of roles in a raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) DKP systems don't allow you to adjust quickly if you lose a key character<br>
<br>
If you're using a DKP system, loot is getting spread around to the people who raid the most. But the key is it's getting spread around. Ask on a class board and the most common factor separating DKP guilds from Merit guilds is that loot gets spread around. Merit guilds tend to have one strong MT, one strong puller, a few strong clerics, etc whereas DKP guilds tend to have several strong MT's, several strong pullers, and down the line. In a DKP guild, if you lose your MT, you have someone else with similar gear who can step in. You don't *have* to equip someone quickly, because you've been distributing the loot all along.<br>
<br>
In practice this works really well. If you look at NULL's top 4 tanks (in terms of gear), we all have very similar stats. Two of the tanks are on break right now, and we've been able to continue on without a hiccup, although of course we'd prefer they were around. The tanks who aren't as well equipped don't raid as much. If they raided more, they'd be right in the front lines too.<br>
<br>
We do allow for a few exceptions to the system. Agro weapons only go to warriors, for instance.<br>
<br>
A good percentage of our guild came from GC, where a merit system had been used. I personally did pretty well under the merit system, since as one of the guild's MT's I often got tank loot sent my way. It still frustrated me, though. There was often a strong bias to thinking like &quot;well, that has FT, it should go to a caster.&quot; Nevermind that the item in question was arguably the best range slot at that level for a tank as well. It also led to some really arbitrary decisions at time. One member didn't get an item they'd been dreaming about for years because the folks who decided merit had a brain fart that day. Instead it went to a relatively new member of the guild who'd never gotten anything with us before. I'm all for new members getting upgrades too, but that wouldn't have happened with a DKP system. <br>
<br>
The most important thing to know about merit systems, though, is that people bitch. I don't care how nice everyone is about it, they bitch about loot. And if you're an officer of a raiding guild, the last thing you want to hear is bitches about loot for the next 3 years. So either you get really draconian and kick people out for bitching, or you have major officer burnout. I'm sure that the raiding guilds who make merit work for them do it by having an extremely strong policy about loot whining. If you're not a raiding guild, the issue doesn't come up as much.<br>
<br>
In the end, I think it comes down to what kind of guild you are. Do you raid a lot? Do you have aspirations to raid more and bigger things? Are you a small guild and have to count on a few key people?<br>
<br>
If you're a small guild that doesn't raid much, it may be worth it to use merit simply to make sure your strongest players stay strong. Just keep in mind that you're going down that self-reinforcing rathole -- needing to keep rewarding someone because they have been rewarded in the past, and because you can't afford to have them leave.<br>
<br>
I'm obviously very pro DKP, so I'll mention some points where I think it doesn't work very well for us. First of all, we don't do many raids where there's only a small chance of a HUGE upgrade for someone dropping. It's basically not a good use of the guild's time. So I will probably never see a Crystallized Acid Bracer except via the Bazaar. We don't do NToV anymore, even though the Cloak of Thorns is an upgrade for many of our members, as are the gauntlets off Vyemm. Eashen isn't on our target list, despite the fact that his cloak, mask, and ring are an upgrade for many of us.<br>
<br>
Another place it's got some rough edges is that it's very easy for items to end up in &quot;odd&quot; places. One of our SK's won our first Improved Damage 4 neck off AD for instance. He loves the neck, it makes all his lifetaps bigger, and the stats are great. But it upset some people that an ID4 item would go to a hybrid tank before a caster (we lost one app over it). Personally I see this as the flipside to the merit problem, though. Either loot goes to very predictable places, or it can go to odd places sometimes. Which is better for your guild is up to you to decide.<br>
<br>
As an officer of a raiding guild, the thing that I appreciate most about DKP is that in the six months or so that we've been doing this, I've had to hear about a loot complaint exactly once. And I get to laugh when people tell me that SoAndSo has a reputation as a loot whore, since you're welcome to ask for everything you can use in our guild. Our biggest problem with loot is people NOT asking for things. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I agree 100% with pretty much everything he said here.  <br>
<br>
Merit will only lead to Officer/GL burn out and there's simply no way around it.  There is no way to make un-biased calls by using a merit system no matter how good your intentions will be.  <br>
<br>
The #1 thing that makes DKP work so well is that it brings a level of consistancy to loot calling.  People can no longer complain as the rules are in place and everything is out in the open, so either you accept it as it is, or you do not.  <br>
<br>
DKP always has to be fine tuned towards your guild though, not everyone handles issues the same.  One issue for example is loot rots, the worst thing that can happen is a really nice item rotting because a person wants to save for an even nicer one.<br>
<br>
Once a guild gets to NToV level or so, it becomes literally impossible to maintain a fair merit based system as there's too much loot coming in.  <br>
<br>
Overall I'm a big fan of Merit, as it really is the way things should be.  But human nature prevents this from working the way it should, so for officer and guild leader sanity, DKP is the only choice for a lasting solution.<br>

So yeah, you obviously need someone to do the work. We're pretty lucky in that we have the programming talent in guild to write our own system, make it do what we want, and then a team of people to make sure it keeps working for us.<br>
<br>
The flipside is that the guild runs pretty well with 6 people doing these key tasks. You'd have just as many key people in a merit guild, they're just dealing with different sets of problems.<br>

If dying a half dozen times &quot;for the good of the raid&quot; doesn't count, why would you do it?  You must have highly idealistic players to get something done under a DKP system.

Ask the people in your guild, heck any raiding guild, if they'd be willing to die 10 times each raid but in exchange they would get the best loot for their role in the guild. Everyone would jump all over that! Everyone wants to get a chance to contribute at that level, it's just that some people don't get that chance either because of experience or gear.<br>
<br>
Death at 65 is a very low risk proposition. Eek! I might lose 1% of real xp -- that it takes me 20 minutes in an xp group to recover, or if I turn on real xp in raids I often recover just in clearing mobs. Any Warrior in NULL is *psyched* to get to tank. They see it as their chance to show that they can hang with the big mobs too -- and for the most part they can, because they have the gear to do it.<br>
<br>
Also, don't laugh, but sometimes the folks not tanking die *more* in our guild. Every warrior that's there dies on Shei -- except the MT. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Maybe you dont see that this works, but if you have a closer look at high end guilds you ll notice it works very well. And to go even further, our system is far more better than some of the none DKP systems which prefer tank and clerics over all others. It gives you redundancy regarding the equipment of your players in certain classes and leaves almost zero arguments for discussion.<br>

If dying a half dozen times &quot;for the good of the raid&quot; doesn't count, why would you do it? You must have highly idealistic players to get something done under a DKP system. Merit has great potential to be unjust, but it favors those that stand out in their effort.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't agree with this at all.  Obviously your most dedicated members will get more loot because they show more.  Your best equipped tank is your MA.  But does it seem fair to give him more merit just cause he has the best gear? or the monk who is main puller? I don't think so, how would that make it fair for the other members some of which attend everything.  How do you judge risk? I'm a guild leader so does that mean i should get twice the loot? I do not think so.<br>
<br>
DKP evens the playing field, and if done right, rewards evenly and more to those who participate the most, and not necessarily because they are the superstar.  As a side benefit (which was already mentioned) loot is so even that if you lose your key players such as your MA or your main puller, there is a high probability that there will be someone relatively equally equipped to take his/her place.<br>

But its pointless to discuss it, because if you never experienced it you wont understand it. <br>
<br>
I know how hard it was in the times back when we wanted to implement a point based system, the discussions we had and how the majority of people were heavily against it. So we convinced our people to have it run as a test and it worked out great. All systems have flaws and no system is perfect. A point based system is surely one of the fairest (or most fair?) system out there, if done right. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>

<br>
For larger guilds, some form of scoring, attendance logging is probably necessary, whether DKP based, or another points system, or even just counting loot and attendance and making sure that it's fairly evenly spread.<br>
<br>
One of the problems with merit is missing out on the quiet people - the ones that always turn up, do their job, but don't say much, don't get noticed. These are often the backbone of a guild, but can be missed out on loot because they're quiet.<br>
<br>
Conversely, merit can be used to equip people for the guild's goals, and to reward people for going above and beyond the call of duty.<br>
<br>
If it's a small 50-60 guild, which has a few tanks, they might want to equip their main tanks first, since the quality of gear of the MA has a large bearing on what mobs you can do. Merit can allow for that, but does leave the officers open to cries of favouritism.<br>
<br>
By &quot;above and beyond&quot;, I'm not necessarily referring to the puller dying 10 times in a raid - most people are prepared to die in raids. I'm talking about the people who spend hours running around tracking mobs to find raid targets, that sort of thing, when the rest of the guild are in exp groups asking the guild, &quot;When are we going to raid?&quot;<br>
