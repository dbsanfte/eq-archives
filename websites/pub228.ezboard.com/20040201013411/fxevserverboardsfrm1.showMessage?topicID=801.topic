He had always lived his life in an attempt to make as easy a time of it as he could, and that is exactly what he did.<br>
<br>
Life was busy but simple since he had taken up employ in the underground halls of Last Exodus. Sure, he wasn’t a hero or even known by name to many, but he was content. They paid well enough, and all he had to do was keep the place clean. They gave him room and board and his wages more than covered his tab down at the tavern within the subterranean lair, a place called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Pulpit</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and it was run by one of his cousins, Drano Brewmeister.<br>
<br>
He was in his favorite establishment engaging in his favorite pastime when he heard a commotion unlike any other. He heard the outer doors open with a clang, and the hustle and bustle of many people. There was shouting and cheering, and did he hear singing?<br>
<br>
Aye, that he did. The sound grew louder and louder until he thought his ears would burst! But instead it was the door to the pulpit that burst. It was thrown wide and in rushed a ragged bunch fresh from the battlefield. Blood covered the haughty warriors from head to toe, and Grimlor noted with pride that most of it seemed to belong to someone else. The returning bunch joked and smiled with one another as they found seats and the chatter began. It was such a cacophony that Grimlor couldn’t make out any specifics but his attention was snapped away to gape in wild wonder at the door to The Pulpit. Standing in its ample frame was an ample dwarf. He was easily recognizable as the proprietor, Drano Brewmeister but he was in armor!! <br>
<br>
The priest had all but given up his adventuring days to retire here in his pub, yet here he was covered in blood and sweat like the others. All but his breastplate, and what a wonder it was; shiny and new, in stark contrast to the rest of the antique gear that the priest normally carried. The expression on the surly dwarfs face was nothing new however it was his customary scowl.<br>
<br>
“OI!” The dwarf shouted and immediately the crowd hushed. All eyes turned towards this diminutive priest as he sat there with an extended wagging finger as if he was scolding children who had committed some capitol sin. The scowl seemed to falter, and then gave way to a smile that looked like it would split the dwarfs face in two! The venerable priest looked to one of the bar wenches he employed and caught her eye. “Lassie, ye better be openin’ one o’ the ‘special’ kegs tonight. The drinks be on th’ house!!”<br>
<br>
Such a cheer rose throughout the hall that Grimlor thought the gods themselves had come home to stay, and he watched as Drano made his way through the bar. As the priest passed Grimlors table, he tossed out a shiny platinum coin that rolled around the table and came to sparkling rest in front of Grimlor. Flabbergasted, Grimlor picked it up and then gazed into the smiling face of Drano. “Lad, ye better be getting’ to yer work. Plenty o’ time to hear the tales tonight in th’ Pulpit. Methinks it will be a late night!”<br>
<br>
With a chuckle the priest wandered away to take his rightful place behind the bar, and not for the last time did Grimlor wonder what event had transpired that could have such an effect upon this house. <br>
<br>
Yet he was a dwarf and dwarves know their duty, be it the working of iron, the brewing of ale, and yes even the humble work of a janitor is taken seriously. Grimlor moaned inwardly as he left the hallway and saw the trail of soil and blood that covered the marble floor.<br>
<br>
He toiled away with his mop and bucket for some hours, cleaning up the clumps of fertile black soil and bits of grass that had found their way back into the halls of his home. Were he a farmer he would note that this was exceptionally rich soil but alas he paid it no heed, instead concentrating on the trail of ruin.<br>
<br>
He was nearly finished and most of the dirt was gone, yet the trail of blood lead all the way deep into the complex to the door of the Transcendent. He learned early on that to disturb the meditations of the leader of this house was to invite gruesome retaliation, and so with more than a little trepidation he lightly knocked at the door as he had been instructed. When no answer came he gave the door a shove and it opened wide into the private training area of Chakkan Veridian. He shrugged his stocky frame and picked up the mop and bucket to continue his work, eyes to the ground following the trail of blood. A few more minutes and he came to what must be the source as there was a small pool of the liquid on the floor. He mopped it up and when finished he wiped his brow, raising his eyes from the floor for the first time. <br>
<br>
He stood there agape, kerchief hanging loosely in his grasp as his eyes threatened to burst from his skull. He began to sweat now, that was not the product of labor, and hurriedly gathered his bucket and mop and all but ran down the hall back towards The Pulpit, leaving the door open in his carelessness.<br>
<br>
It was sometime later that one of the patrolling guardsman noticed the ajar door, so he walked in to make sure all was well. His eyes were drawn to waves of golden hair topped with a crown, the locks tumbling down to encase a face so beautiful it could not be of mortal origin. But the beauty ended there, as the eyes were wide open and the mouth extended in an eternal silent scream. Blood still ran from the severed neck to the floor, and the guard noted before his courage gave way, the latest addition to Chakkans trophy room. Scratched into the very wall was a single word…<br>
