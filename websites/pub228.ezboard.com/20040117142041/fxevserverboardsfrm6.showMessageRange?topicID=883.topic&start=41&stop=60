<br>
Artists are paid in both performance royalties (how often the song is played on the radio and source music - tv, commercial, movie soundtrack, etc) and mechanical royalties. Mechanical royalties are paid on a basis of albums sold (and a number of tracks on that album, up to 11, I believe) and the rates are controlled by a national statutory rate set by Congress. The mechanical royalties are one of the primary sources of income for most musicians. <br>
<br>
(Of course, a lot of musicians - writers in particular - would die to have a soundtrack song for a popular movie, not only for the publicity, but each showing, video rental, etc. produces performance royalties for source music, plus residuals contracted out from the actual soundtrack sales which I believe are handed differently.)<br>
<br>
There are a number of splits where the money goes, depending on the writer, the publisher, the performer, etc. Your average $15 CD (I know, they're more expensive now, but I'm working from dated knowledge) produces about $11.15 worth of revenue that is considered for royalty purposes. The average mechanical royalty rate after the deductions and splits and whatnot (and assuming the performer is also the writer) is around 10%. So your average artist is making about $1.25 (rounding up a bit for easy math or so per album.<br>
<br>
So downloading eliminates X% of how many albums they sell, but if you look a little closer, any given act has a huge debt to pay off. Most artists don't break even until they sell almost 500,000 albums. At that point, they haven't made any money at all. (Also side note, only about 10% of acts actually make back the advance - promotion, recording, publishing, printing - of an album. It's unfortunate but the world of good music rides on the coattails of Garth Brooks, Janet Jackson, and The Backstreat Boys...) <br>
<br>
If they're given an advance for a video as well, it may take an artist closer to selling 1,000,000 copies before they hit the break even point (of which only 900,000 are considered because of age-old traditions of not getting paid for albums that broke in shipment. Something that doesn't happen hardly at all with CD's as opposed to vinyl).<br>
<br>
The performance royalties are a long-term investment, and risky at best. These also go almost exclusively to the songwriter, or the holder of the rights to those songs, though, which is why you see the Beatles catalogue going for millions of dollars. It's a risky venture, without one killer song on an album, the performance royalties are going to be a pittance compared to the mechanical royalties.<br>
<br>
So yes, in fact, the artists are being ripped off by the record industry to a massive degree. The artist, on a good contract with a good fanbase is pulling down $1.50 per CD or so (oh yeah, then off profits, deduct 20% for management, then split it between the 4-5 members of the band...), only the songwriter (which is sometimes the entire band, but not always) is pulling down the performance royalties. The record companies are making $3-6 per album. <br>
<br>
But it's really hard to blame the artist in that situation. They are definitely under the thumb of the big media companies, but the big media companies are the only ones who guarantee they even get the pittance of profit they do get... the RIAA is, by virtue of their greed in maintaining their $3-6 per album the ones making sure and fighting for the artist's right to get paid (even less) for their own material. So as much as I think Metallica's gone off the deep end, supporting the RIAA is not an illogical position for them or any other act.<br>
<br>
Downloading music is, ultimately, stealing from the artist - at least those artists who are published by the RIAA. It may be an incredible tool for getting name recognition and distribution out there for lesser known artists who don't currently have record contracts, but that remains to be proven as an effective advertising method. Donwloading music hurts the artist in what I would consider collateral damage at something that, free music aside, is primarily directed at hurting the big music companies.<br>
<br>
The sad fact is, because so much of an artist's profit is tied up in mechanical royalties, and the deals negotiated by the RIAA with legal systems like Apple's new music download system, actually put more money in the pockets of the RIAA and less in the hands of the artists than if we're forced to buy albums containing all of their material.<br>
<br>
Sorta a non-partisan view on the whole thing, really. I've never actually downloaded illegal music, just samples and the stuff that artists and labels provide free. And when someone loans me a CD, if I like it, I'll buy a copy. And suing the customer is not exactly the best politic thing to do, but with everything from governmental regulation to derrision of the whole idea of 'intellectual property' and wanting something for nothing, there's a lot more that needs to change than just stopping downloading.<br>
<br>
Downloading won't stop, but the RIAA is left with few alternatives. And the artist left with fewer alternatives still than to let the RIAA help them get what they are due via their contracts. It's a sad circle, but major reform of the entire industry will need to take place before any of it budges at all...<br>
<br>
Sorta depressing when you think about it.<br>

See, When I buy CD's (Beef Jerky, Birdmen of Alkartraz) I won't buy them unless I can get them directly from the artist.  Sure, I listen to the radio, RARELY since it bites, and hear the music you are talking about through RICAA, but it is just flat, meaningless crap.  It is produced for a profit, and I refuse to support it.  Yes, it is illegal to steal it, I fully agree.  Unfortuantely, I think art belongs to the artist, ONLY, and if it becomes an industry, you are taking form the artist and the art-form itself.  When Metallica went from Mega-force to Capitol, it was in their best financial intereast to begin supporting the comercialization of their music.  Maybe you don't notice the drop in the quality of their music, I do.  <br>
I will be one to tell you that if you download music you are stealing it, becasue you are.  At the same time, I will not tell you to stop, because this art was TAKEN from the creators by the producers.  I have told bands my theories of the music industry; they hug me for it.  Living right outside of Detroit, Michigan, you can imagine how many hugs that is.  I will buy it from them, but I won't buy it from Capitol.  The problem ISN'T that the artists can't do it on their own... the problem is that they can't compete with the mega-corps.  My solution isn't to try to bring down the corps, that's impossible.  Mine is a very personal solution in that I will only buy from the artist.<br>
<br>
The simple truth is that you can't download a show.  When you go to a show and they are selling their self produced CD, it is reasonably priced, and you are buying DIRECTLY from the artist.  I REFUSE to pay Capitol for Joan Ridel's songs, I will pay Joan directly... and have.  <br>
In this day and age, you can not tell me that bands can not market their own music.  Sure, the industry may make it easier, but their methods are immoral and a stain on the art form.  Stealing IS wrong, and downloading music IS stealing it from the industry, but this is a case where I will just turn my head and pretend I never saw you do it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://guildmagic.com/character.cfm?ID=316564" target="top">Tib</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

For every Brittney Spears out there, there are another 100 bands who are unable to even repay thier advances. A very small percentage of professional musicians are actually paid at all, let alone payed too much. As for CD's being overpriced, I think China summed it up quite well.<br>

<br>
It's all about volume. 30 years ago, maybe you made a copy of your friend's new Blue Oyster Cult record and listened to it. Maybe your brother made a copy of that tape. It rarely went much beyond that. Nowadays, you can post a song online and it can be downloaded literally downloaded millions of times. Those copies can then be further downloaded millions more times. It is significantly different.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You think it's &quot;wrong&quot; that the artists don't get enough of the sticker price? So fucking what.

<br>
Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Either the artist accepts the deal they are offered, or they get <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NO</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> deal. There is no negotiating. The record labels have the resources to dictate terms to new artists. Maybe an estabilished artist can negotiate a bigger piece of the pie, but by and large, it's a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; situation.<br>

It's ok to steal so long as you are doing it in protest of an established industry that you happen to think has sucky business practices.<br>

In a court of law I'm positive you'll do time for stealing with that lame ass excuse for a rationalization.<br>
<br>

<br>
This crap about Metallica and how when they first came out they were anti industry and all about the fans so they promoted boot leg tapes of their tunes... well fucking duh idiot.  <br>
<br>
They had no recording contract, they knew the industry wanted nothing to do with THAT kind of music, so they found a very damn creative way to draw a fuckton of attention to themselves so they COULD get a contract.  Now that they work for the industry and THEY see your downloading of their music without you paying THEM for it is stealing you somehow have a fucking problem with that?<br>
<br>
Guess what skippy, it IS still stealing, you're still guilty, and if they bust your ass you're fucked with no one to blame for it but yourself because like I already said...<br>

<br>
Yes, I am involved in the music industry in some way, but I won't tell you how because it's none of your damn business! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So my income aside, and in my opinion, here is why downloading music is a bad idea:<br>
<br>
1)  Artist - The artist recieves what is called a &quot;Royalty&quot; from sales of their ART (&lt;notice how I capatalized ART&gt;).  They royalty that they recieve per each sale of their ART is significantly less than you can possibly comprehend or imagine.  <br>
<br>
Also, based on reports from a thing called &quot;Soundscan&quot;, an Artist recieves another &quot;Royalty&quot; from each time their song is played on the radio.  This is also significantly less than you can possibly imagine.<br>
<br>
Finally, an artist recieves income from Concert Tours and Venue sales, endorsments (like Pepsi), and through personal appearances.  This is where the artist makes the bulk of their capital.<br>
<br>
In order for an artist to be successful, to actually make money for their ART, they must be able to successfully promote themselves.  Promotion costs money.  There are posters, advertising, travel, personal expenses, etc.  In order to promote yourself successfully, it takes money.  A lot of money.  <br>
<br>
Most Artists cannot do this on their own (for it is far, far too expensive) so they rely on a recording company to foot the bill.  The recording company notices the saleability of an artist, their ability to generate radio airplay (most important), and ticket sales from tours.  They give the Artist and advance (which is like a loan).  Usually, it is just enough to get the artist on track to make a decent living.<br>
<br>
Once the artist signs the contract, the advance money starts decreasing rapidly.  There are expenses (like using a professional recording studio to record their album at 1000's of dollars an hour), distribution (I will get back to this), promotion, and tour expenses (like that bus you see them riding around in - which may seem extravagant to you but it's their home for a year or more).<br>
<br>
What a record company will do is take care of all of this for the artist in the hope that the artist will get significant radio play, which turns into sales, which makes people buy tickets for their live shows.  Once the artist has paid off the Advance, then they start generating income for themselves, and most times only if they make significant sales.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, the record company puts them on the road, where they become &quot;Road Dogs&quot;.  A Road Dog will stay on the road, away from their families, playing the same songs night after night until their advance is paid.  Then the record company will usually drop their contract.  Sound evil?  Well, perhaps, but this is a business and just like things that don't sell don't get manufactured, so artists get dropped.<br>
<br>
If you are a lucky one (which by the way is a very low percentage of ALL the artists that get signed to a Major record label), then maybe you start making your own money.  Maybe you get another deal to make 2 or 3 more records.  At this point you have proved your saleability and the recording company will use their market saavy to help you sell more.  Many artists (like Prince) look at this as slavery.  He may be right, but to the industry it's good business practice. <br>
<br>
Most artists suffer a massive amount before they get lucky.  Many more wither up and die away, or become local acts again and make a few thousand dollars a year.<br>
<br>
2) Record Companies - Take all the risk with a new artist.  Often times the record company sink hundred of thousands of dollars into an Artist who just doesn't have appeal, and must make up for these losses with Artists that do. It's a very difficult and complex &quot;game&quot; for the record company to figure out what may or may not sell.<br>
<br>
A record company manufactures a CD.  I won't tell you how much it costs, but it is very cheap.  Then they put an insert (art) into it, promote it, distribute it, and calculate royalties.  To do all of these tasks takes employees.  Employees are an expense.  They then sell it to a distributor at a cost (which is a small (and I do mean small) percentage of what you pay for a CD at the store).  The distributor tacks on their markup (they have employees too), and the record store tacks on theirs...and thus a CD that cost less than the change you have in your sofa to make a CD that costs you $15 or more at the store.<br>
<br>
When Soundscan reports to the Record Company that a radio station has played a single, they collect a fee from the radio station.  The radio station pays the fee through advertising.  The record company collects this fee and pays the artist their royalty and keeps the rest.  Again, this is far less significant than you can imagine.  The rest of the income is made through endorsments (because likely the Record Company has rights to an artist's catalogue), and other general revenue.  By this time, they hope they can make a profit to sign more artists and generate more revenue.  Often times they lose, sometimes they break even, even more rarely a U2 comes along and makes them a large enough profit to cover their other losses - and like any business make a profit.<br>
<br>
So, in a nutshell, and far more complicated than I can explain in this meagar space, when you download music, you are killing the industry.  When a record company sells 200,000 copies of an album that previously would have sold 1,000,000, the Artist makes less, the record company makes less, and the Artist is less likely to make another record, nor is the record company likely to re-sign them.<br>
<br>
But, you are killing an evil, evil capatalistic corporate machine!  Yes, perhaps.  But I submit this.  When nobody is willing to put money into a dying business, when you go to the record store to buy CD's and the shelves are empty, when you turn on your radio to only find channel after channel of &quot;Rush Limbaugh&quot;, then will you blame Napster, Kazaa, and other music downloading companies?  When you can't find a great piece of music through all of the trash (go to MP3.COM if you don't believe that there is a bunch of trash out there), how long will your word of mouth campaign carry it, if it's not on the radio and not promotable but through the internet.<br>
<br>
And did you ever wonder why most radio stations play the same crap over and over and over?  Because they know that it's something that they can make revenue on...not because it's any better than anything else.<br>
<br>
And before you go about thinking that you will support your local &quot;Jimmy Jam and the Freedom Band&quot; think about how difficult it is for an artist to fill such a venue every single night (because remember, that is how they get paid, by the number of people that show up).  Think about how unlikely a club owner would be willing to book an act into their venue when 2 people show up and buy 2 beers.  Most people have lives.  Most people can't show up every night.  Most artists can't afford to sustain themselves this way.<br>
<br>
Worst of all is the fellow who is supporting a family working in a Record Company mail room who has to go tell his kids that he got laid off and has to find a new job, because illegal downloading has cost the record companies as a whole huge profits and they can't afford him any more.<br>
<br>
You are not hurting an evil, corrupt company, because like most companies they will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and become extinct. You are hurting real people with real dreams and aspirations, and if that is worth your concience and stealing music from the internet, then go for it.....just remember what I said in a year.  You are hurting much, much more than Metallica, and although I don't necessarily agree with a lot of what Lars says, I do respect him very much for protecting the little guy.<br>
<br>
Finally, imagine if you made a cool widget.  And someone went into wal-mart and stole all your widgets.  And it cost you way more to make widgets than you were getting money from them.  How long would you continute to make them?  How long before you would cry &quot;foul&quot; and try to reduce your losses?<br>
<br>
And I am sure that I will be met with a barrage of insults, tiraids, and hate....and that's fine.  You are entitled to your opinion on the matter.  I am just a person most of you don't know.  But I hope that these words mean something to someone.<br>
<br>
P.S.  The RIAA, by the way, is paid by the 5 major record labels to protect the interests of the recording community, and do not directly make money from the sales of records....just so you know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thedosiusdreamtwister>Thedosius Dreamtwister</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.rogers.com/shadowgovernment01/thedhead.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#330000>(7/28/03 10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=883.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: </span><hr size=1> That begs 2 questions:<br>

How much money does it take per year just to get by in the U.S.?<br>
<br>
Throw out some numbers ,then we'll all agree on it.<br>
<br>
How much money does it take per year to live <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>comfortably</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in the U.S.?<br>
<br>
Throw out some more numbers.  Again, we'll agree on it.<br>
<br>
How much does the average artist/musician/record label exec make a year?<br>
<br>
Can everyone agree that they're making a hell of a lot more than either of the numbers agreed upon in the first 2 questions?<br>
<br>
They're only bitching because they're wasteful.  If an artist makes a million dollars and sticks it in an overseas bank where it cannot be taxed by our government, more likely than not they could live off the interest alone.<br>
<br>
Is it their fault for losing money?  No.<br>
<br>
Is it their fault for not saving the money they make to get by in &quot;hard times&quot; such as these?  Hell yes.<br>
<br>
Munky, the bassist from KORN, collects mercedes or beemers, can't remember which.  Does someone really need THAT MUCH money?  I can understand certain fulfillments, but grow up.  If they were making just enough to get by, and started losing money, they could complain.  They're not.<br>
<br>
Stop crying over spilled milk and grow the fuck up.<br>
<br>
Want an analogy that pertains to this?  Robin Hood.<br>
<br>
Napster/Kazaa/Morpheus/Any P2P program is the Robin Hood of this day and age's music industry producer/consumer relationship.<br>
<br>
Yes, it's stealing.  Yes, two wrongs don't make a right.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, who the fuck cares?  They haven't found a solution, and it's not going to work.  AND in the years it will take to sue as many people as they do, how many other lookalikes will pop up?  Do they have the time and energy to continue suing people for the rest of human civilization?<br>
<br>
And while I'm on the whole &quot;two wrongs don't make a right&quot; thing, we went in, bombed a country and killed innocent people to take a madman out of power.  Now we're still there, and some people are starting to think they'd rather have the madman back.  Two wrongs sure seemed to have made a right in that situation to a lot of people on these boards...<br>
<br>
AND, do point out the counterproductivity of arguing that fining/suing them is ok, I have yet to see a law that says that downloading music is illegal.  Therefore suing/fing someone who didn't really break a law (written...if you start arguing morality you'll just dig yourself deeper) would be another wrong in it's own right, would it not?<br>

<br>
Most 'musicians' and even fewer songwriters can make a living. The fact is, new songwriters are dependant on the big multi-million-dollar-in-the-bank acts to even get noticed.<br>
<br>
Okay, record execs tend to make money... they're not exactly in the same class as the other two you've listed. Big acts are, but big acts are the top 1% of all popular music acts and probably the top .0001% of all musicians.<br>
<br>
And just because person A makes more money than person B, it doesn't give person B any more right to person A's stuff. Here's another tack - why doesn't person B go out and get a second job (or likely a first one) so they can afford what they want that person A has? Why can't, say, person B 'save up' their own damned money so they can buy something?<br>
<br>
Shoe, meet other foot.<br>
<br>
And regardless of how noble the cause, Robin Hood was still a crook.<br>
<br>
But you're right. They haven't found a solution. There won't be a solution because it sits intrinsically with the honesty of the common man.<br>
<br>
There's no hope for that on a wide scale.<br>

And Ted Turner (You know the multimillionare founder and/or owner of gods know how many media outlets) owns a 35,000 acre Bison ranch in Medicine Lodge, Kansas. He also owns 1.6 million acres across Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico and South Dakota. <br>

Last time I checked, they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>EARNED</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it. (I may not like how they earned it, but that's an issue for another discussion).<br>

So you are saying that, because Munky can afford to collect cars with his wage, it's somehow wrong? Why?  <p>Thedosius Dreamtwister<br>

Then you and your family are indeed part of the problem, you all think it's ok to steal you just get to be selective about it and that somehow makes it ok.<br>
<br>
I hope they bust you and your family. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=883.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=883.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=883.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=883.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=883.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=883.topic&start=121&stop=132>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=883.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=883.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=883.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=883.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.threadControl?topicID=883.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=883.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=883.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub228.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="xevserverboardsfrm1">General Discussion<option value="xevserverboardsfrm7">Marketplace<option value="xevserverboardsfrm2">Raiding<option value="xevserverboardsfrm16">Poll Mania<option value="xevserverboardsfrm4">Epic Quests<option value="xevserverboardsfrm13">Trade Skills<option value="xevserverboardsfrm3">Tactics<option value="xevserverboardsfrm5">Questing<option value="xevserverboardsfrm9">Looking for Guild<option value="xevserverboardsfrm12">Guild Leading and Officership<option value="xevserverboardsfrm11">Guild Link Submission<option value="xevserverboardsfrm6">Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm26">Political Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm10">/ooc<option value="xevserverboardsfrm21">Rant Polls<option value="xevserverboardsfrm19">Archives<option value="xevserverboardsfrm15">Moderators Forum<option value="xevserverboardsfrm23">ber<option value="xevserverboardsfrm27">Ask the Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards>Xev Server Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6>Rants</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.3e<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
