<br>

<br>
<br>
Studies show that the excitement of video games makes playing them addictive. Parents of preteens hardly find this surprising.<br>
Ask any preteen how they love to spend their spare time, and chances are you'll get an earful about video games. But why do they love them so? Are they addictive? According to some studies it would appear that the excitement of video games causes the brain to release a chemical that is, in essence, addictive. For any parent who has seen the fervor by which some kids play video games, this news is no surprise. <br>
<br>
What makes these games so addictive? Media literacy specialist, Dr. Charles Ungerleider explains that &quot;they're very compelling with increasing complexity, so a child becomes more facile, yet wants to know more and apply new skills.&quot; While wanting to improve their game isn't a problem in itself, it becomes one if video games are &quot;taking a youngster away too much from other activities,&quot; says Ungerleider. &quot;Then the parent has to intervene and limit the amount of time the youngster spends with the video game.&quot; <br>
<br>
Professor of Computer Science, Maria Klavee feels video games, if not too violent, can &quot;offer some real opportunities for puzzle solving, strategic and critical thinking&quot;. But she adds that it's important that video and computer games are played in moderation. Klavee says parents should &quot;provide a selection of activities, not just the ones that have the most action or are addictive. Choose some that involve problem solving or good story lines. Also aim for a balance in your child's life. Sports are important, reading's important. Just think of computer games as one more component in a child's exploration of what's out there in society.&quot; <br>
<br>
As for addiction? Ungerleider believes that &quot;a parent can prevent youngsters from becoming addicted to too much TV or too many video games by establishing a pattern of selective viewing or by using video game material early in a child's life so that by the time a youngster gets to be an adolescent and there's very little surveillance or control, it's less likely to occur.&quot; <br>
<br>
Finally, Ungerleider remind parents that &quot;if a youngster becomes addicted to video games it can be a problem and the parent does need to intervene and provide attractive alternatives.&quot; <br>

The Quest to End Game Addiction  <br>
<br>
<br>
By Julia Scheeres  |   Also by this reporter  Page 1 of 2 next » <br>
<br>
02:00 AM Dec. 05, 2001 PT<br>
<br>
With the holidays just around the corner, many people are relishing the thought of relaxing at home, munching all manner of fatty sweets and spending extra time with their ... computer games. <br>
<br>
Instead of slurping hot cocoa with loved ones, the gamers will be off by themselves in darkened rooms, slaying monsters, conquering new worlds and otherwise stroking their heroic alter egos. <br>
That behavior bothers a lot of people. It's not fun being jilted for a computer game, especially during a season that's supposed to be about human love, harmony and all those other warm and fuzzy notions. <br>
<br>
And while hard-core gamers insist their favorite activity is a harmless pastime, their loved ones sometimes suspect that their hobby has turned into something a little more compulsive, which raises the question: Is there such a thing as gaming addiction or is the very concept a crock of excrement? <br>
<br>
It depends on whom you ask. At one extreme, there are gamers who threaten to &quot;get medieval&quot; if someone so much as suggests they step away from their computer for a butt break. At the other extreme, there are the neglected spouses, former gamers and a bevy of therapists dedicated to treating game junkies. <br>
<br>
Some games are more reviled than others by the loved ones. EverQuest -- or EverCrack as some people call it -– tops the list. Yahoo has two clubs devoted to the sword-and-sorcery game where players slip into the bodies of barbarians and erudites and chase each other around the fantasy world of Norrath: Spouses Against EverQuest and EverQuest Widows. <br>
<br>
The latter, which boasts over 1,000 members, has all the markings of a virtual Al-Anon meeting. <br>
<br>
&quot;Hi, I'm 19 years old and I have been an EQ widow for a year now. My boyfriend plays at least 5 hours a day ...&quot; reads the typical new member introduction. <br>
<br>
The &quot;EQ Wids&quot; commiserate over tales of woe (one husband insisted on playing the game in the delivery room while his wife gave birth) and offer each other encouragement and company. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's just a forum for people to help each other vent,&quot; said the group moderator, Tony, who didn't want to reveal his last name. &quot;A lot of the members have come to the point where they've gotten on with their lives. They don't sit at home watching the back of their spouse's head anymore.&quot; <br>
<br>
Members also share tips on how to sabotage EverQuest by deleting characters or blocking access to servers. As a result, the board is regularly raided by angry gamers who warn the widows &quot;not to fuck with EQ.&quot; <br>
<br>
And then there's the business of EQ marriages. In addition to being snubbed for a piece of software, many EQ widows fear getting snubbed for a virtual lover. EverQuest characters frequently marry online and sometimes the romance carries over into real life. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's really destroyed a lot of marriages,&quot; said Tony, whose wife had an affair with her make-believe husband. He allowed her to return home for the sake of their three children. &quot;I told her that if it happens again, I'm not going to take her back.&quot; <br>
<br>
Some former players have gone online to preach the evils of gaming themselves. <br>
<br>
Jeffrey Stark, a high-school student from Ontario, Canada, wrote an impassioned essay in a self-help forum in which he charged that EQ had ruined his life. <br>
<br>
When his not-too-tech-savvy parents threatened to unplug the machine, he told them that doing so would destroy it (they believed him). He'd go for a week without bathing or eating a proper meal. He finally stopped going to school for a semester because he couldn't tear himself away. <br>
<br>
&quot;I dropped out of school for a semester and was feeling really low,&quot; he said. &quot;My parents told me that if I continued to play games, I'd become a garbage man. It was totally insulting.&quot; <br>
<br>
Stark eventually reached the highest EQ levels and sold three characters on eBay for $4,500, he said. Now he advocates that parents regulate their child's game playing at all times. <br>
<br>
Story continued on Page 2 »<br>
Reuben Logsdon, a software writer from Washington, played Civilization for seven straight years after a college dorm friend gave him the installation disks. At the time, the ability to create an alternate world was a refreshing break from the routine of student life. <br>
<br>
&quot;For the first week, I didn't go to sleep,&quot; said Logsdon, who has also posted his experience online. &quot;It was worse than being on crank. I'd always get a sinking feeling when I looked out the window and saw it was dawn. I'd get angry at myself for being such a loser because the game was controlling my life.&quot; <br>
  <br>
Logsdon finally went cold turkey by smashing the disks, but finds it harder to resist temptation now that he can simply download the game from file-sharing sites such as Gnutella. <br>
<br>
Both men exhibited the classic signs of game junkies, according to the criteria of Maressa Hecht Orzack, the director of the Computer Addiction Studies Center. <br>
<br>
Symptoms of game addiction include falling behind in school and work and basically deferring everything else in your life so you can play, she said. Compulsive playing tends to mask underlying problems such as depression, anger and low self-esteem, said Orzack, who said she was once hooked on computer solitaire. <br>
<br>
&quot;A lot of people get into these (games) because they're bored,&quot; she said. &quot;The excitement is so reinforcing. They get pleasure from it and want to repeat it. That's how the addiction builds up.&quot; <br>
<br>
Her treatment program includes behavioral therapy, anti-depressants and Zyban, a prescription drug used by smokers to kick the tobacco habit. <br>
<br>
But for all the game naysayers, there are those who argue that games are beneficial. <br>
<br>
Just ask Camilla Bennet, the Quake3World.com administrator and an avid gamer from New Zealand. The computer saleswoman creates &quot;skins&quot; -- customized characters for computer games -– in her spare time, and hopes to turn her passion into pay dirt. <br>
<br>
&quot;I really want to get into game development,&quot; she said. &quot;I've already handed in my first production skin, something that may well lead to a career.&quot; <br>
<br>
MIT's Games-To-Teach project studies how gaming technology can be incorporated into education. <br>
<br>
The project's research manager, Kurt Squire, has found that games sharpen players' critical thinking, improve their social skills and increase their empathy (by choosing the opposite sex for their character's gender). <br>
<br>
&quot;The notion that games are powerful enough to ruin someone's life is just ridiculous,&quot; said Squire. &quot;The main concern people have is that technology is overpowering people and making them helpless. That's happened with every new medium that has come along -- even books were once regarded with suspicion.&quot; <br>
<br>
In the final analysis, almost anything can be called an addiction if it routinely interrupts life's basic components, including school, work and relationships, he said. The important thing is balance. So align your chakras -- and remember, it's just a game. <br>

A lot of things can make someone have an addictive personality.  One key ingredient to that as far as games as the need for some people to escape reality.  We all do this to some extent (books, movies, games, etc), but some are not happy with their lives so they continually stay emersed in the game.  It can get worse and worse as the events in game are more exciting than those in RL and as RL pressures wear you down, or your social activities diminish (made worse by always playing) you dont have any good reason to choose RL over the game.  Any type of social activity (chat rooms, MB's, etc) can be addictive because it fufills the need for communication and roleplay activities are even worse because not only can you fufill your need for communication with others but you can assume a totally different identity, one much more interesting than your own.  <br>
     <br>
     This game will never get me addicted simply because my life is too busy.  While some of the things that make it busy aren't pleasant, which do lead me to rather be playing than living life, most aren't.  I have a lot of friends that I regularly go out with, two nieces that I devote a lot of time to, a girlfriend I'm very happy with....etc.  Those things, while EQ is fun, are much more fufilling to me than EQ could ever be.  BUT...if those things were to go away and my life not so full....who knows.  Honestly, I probably would stay on EQ all the time at that point.  I mean really....why wouldn't I?  <br>
<br>
The problem is that people want to put blame on other things not under their control as to why their loved ones shut them out in favor of a game, rather than accept any responsibility themselves.  The statements about parents needing to introduce other activities is a good one.  Put more pleasant things in front of the child so that they have other &quot;escapes&quot; than just the game.  But it still comes down to the fact that if the person has an inherantly addictive personality, or EQ is simply better and more fufilling than their real life, they will choose the game (or any game) over that life.  It's not the game...it's YOU. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Is a guy that has a project car in his garage that he spends the same amount of time restoring addicted?<br>
<br>
Knitting?<br>
<br>
Sewing?<br>
<br>
Wood-working?<br>
<br>
This is the one thing that I put my time into, like others do with their hobbies, to unwind and have fun.<br>
<br>
I think like any new and exciting &quot;thing&quot; that comes into your life it can be understood as addictive, mostly because you put lots of energy into it and you tell people of your new toy.<br>
<br>
I have friends that restore old cars, a father that is always doing something around the house and relatives that golf every free moment of their schedule.<br>
<br>
Me I wait until my 7 year old goes to bed and I play EQ with my wife using the computer next to me. Whether she is playing EQ with me or some online game is irelevant because we are spending time together more than alot of couples.<br>
<br>
Pre-kid we spent time going out to movies then out for supper and to a club.<br>
<br>
Today we have a child that doesn't aloow for that.<br>
<br>
When we have a night to ourselves we go out the same as we had when we were childless.<br>
<br>
EQ is a hobby to me.<br>
<br>
It is fun and a way to relax.<br>
<br>
Nothing more and nothing less.<br>
<br>
I see people that let the game consume their lives and to be honest I wonder what is so bad about life with these people that they let the game consume them so.<br>
<br>
I could never be in a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
To have someone TELL me that I have to be at a certain spot at a certain time and THIS is what we will do tonight is a foreign concept that would earn them a fat lip in RL if the same approach was taken.<br>
<br>
Some people are leaders and some are followers, EQ is full of followers.<br>
<br>
I think some people are addicted to this game.<br>
<br>
I for sure am not.<br>

Everquest is nothing more than a distraction from everyday living. Can I live without it? Of course. I've done so for nearly a year before coming back. It is something I enjoy doing. It lets me relax and gives me opportunities to interact with people, on a level, that I might not get the opportunity to. <br>
<br>
(I.E. play a game with someone from UK.)<br>
<br>
Video games are only addictive if you let them interfere with every day living. They are a release from the pressures and stresses of everyday living. They give us a sense of escapism from the BS of life. Does this mean we are using it to self-medicate away from our problems? No. How many of us has put off a raid for real life issues. I bet everyone here can raise their hand at least once on that.<br>
<br>
We have found something legal that gives us enjoyment that takes us out of reality for a while. We're not hurting anyone. Yet, because we have found something to make us happy, that others would find odd, we're scrutinized for it. <br>
<br>
It's fucking bullshit and it pisses me off. <br>

<br>
That is one of the definitions for addiction.  Read it and think about it - how many things could you say that you are habitually or compulsively occupied with?  Lets give some examples - do you brush your teeth every night?  That is a habit - and according to the definition you are addicted to brushing your teeth.  However, we all know that the person who wrote the originally cited articles would disagree - they would claim that to be an addiction, there must be adverse affects to the individual.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't believe personality has anything to do with addiction.  I think we are all addicted to any number of things.  I think Personallity has a lot to do with abuse.  Anything when taken to the extreme bad have adverse results.  Everquest is no exception.  Neither is television, listening to music, reading science books, ect.<br>
<br>
When I ran cross country - we used to joke that we were addicted to pain.  After all, what else could lead someone to run 7-10 miles every day of the week, sometimes more for &quot;fun&quot;.  Several times I ran hard enough that I made myself physically ill - to the point I would vomit and have a hard time standing.  That most definately wasn't healthy - but the same people who critisize me for spending too much time on the computer now encouraged me at that point.  Looking back, that was just as much of an addiction as everquest could ever be to me.<br>
<br>
The thing that bothers me about the people who whine about Everquest being addictive is their obvious double standards.  They try to pin all of the worlds ills on a computer game.  They refuse to admit any form of individual responsibility - instead choosing to blame all faults on a computer game.  That is retarded.  Like I stated before - anything can be addictive.  Taken to extremes, anything can be harmful.  I would even go as far as to say the &quot;power&quot; gamer is more likely to take something to an extreme - because we hate to lose and are often willing to spend whatever time it takes not to lose.  However, I would say that the same group is the easiest to prevent from having a harmful addiction - because they are normally much easier to convince to take responsibility for themselves.<br>

They want the significant other to quit what he/she like to do and do something else which is more than likely what the spouse enjoys. <br>
<br>
The answer to a good relationship is finding something you both enjoy and doing it together. If the spouses would take the time to make a noobie character and give eq a try, they could be spending that time together. <br>
<br>
 My hubby and I play ALOT. He bought the game first and tried it out. Now 3 years later not only do we both play but our children play as well ocassionally. We have set time aside each week to play the 4 of us. These 4 characters can only be played when we play together so they do not level unless its with each other. How is that bad?  <br>
<br>
I do have to agree the whole roleplay husband/wife thing does bother me though from RL married people.<br>
<br>
I would be horrible insulted if my husband married In Game another person besides me. But that is just my feelings on it /grin<br>

Oh hell, I may as well comment.  I believe that you are only addicted when you try to schedule your entire life around it.  I mean, being in a raiding guild, I try not to do anything past 5pm PST.  But if something comes up, I'm out.  That's just how it is with me.  I quit cold turkey 5 months ago.  I had problems filling the days so I got back into it (I was bored A LOT).  Quite honestly, as a student, all I have to do is study and play games.  None of my friends are really the outgoing types, so we mostly just hang out and play games and watch movies.  That's just what we do as our hobbies. =P<br>
<br>
If someone's addicted to a game, then there was something wrong with the person before they played the game.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=113883">Landale Palemoon (Primary Gear, WITH NEW AND IMPROVED PANTS!)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Wrong, bitch, take it to the back. Machene and I play several games together. He has his interests though, like paint ball, Tribes, his friends, his messageboards... And I have my interests, Renaissance Faire, my friends, candles, my various other video games I play. <br>
<br>
Point is, we have our seperate stuff but we also find things to do to interact. You can't make your relationship your entire life. You have to have &quot;you&quot; time in there SOMEWHERE. <br>

Sitting in front on a computer for 4-12 hours a day is not exactly good for your health either.  If you dont play that much then good for you, but most people that I know that are in higher level guilds either do or have done in the past.   Many rabid eq players do schedule their lives around eq, and often ignore real life commitments and social interactions in favor of playing.  I am not just pointing the finger at other people, I certainly have blown off my share of friends who called to go grab a beer or catch a flick, because I had a raid planned that night, or was in the middle of a tradeskills run and my lucky troll doll said that skillups were looking plentiful.. <br>
       All things in moderation is a great idea, but I have to disagree with our classic moderator Mysidia, in that, you do not need to have an addictive personality to become addicted to something.   There are always people who seem to be an exception to any rule, but for the most part I am sure not all cigarette smokers, heroin addicts and chronic food munchers have addictive personalities.  The body is a strange and complex machine and we often dont know the effects of certain things until later on.  The example of running given ( I will paraphrase because I am hopped up on crack atm and cant remember the exact phrasing) is a valid one,  runners can often become &quot;addicted&quot; to the endorphin high they get from pushing themselves as far as they can and can suffer withdrawls from stopping their running.  The same goes for peopel who eat alot of hot stuff ( chilis, tobasco etc) because of teh endorphin rush caused by the &quot;heat&quot;.<br>
         A lot of you seem to be able to play without issue, and i think that is great, but not everyone has the same relationship with EQ.  While I have not seen withdrawls from eq ( no one I know has successfully quit yet), I have seen some of the life penalties from constant play.  Chronic joblessness, execessive procrastination as well as the unintentional destruction of personal relationships that can occur by shutting people out to engage in a computer game.  I think it is a mistake to catagorically get defensive about EQ being addictive, and maybe look at the bigger picture as far as how we spend our time, and if from a distance we would be proud of what we do.  If you told me three years ago that I would have logged 140 days in a game, out of my real life, I would have said that you were crazy.. and no way... But sure enough here I sit..  Maybe you can handle it, but some people cant.  I am sure it is not EQ specifically, but maybe a time vs decreasing reward games in general, in which EQ just happens to reign supreme at the moment.  Laws etc.. regulating addictive substances are a joke for the most part and do nothing to help the &quot;problem&quot;,self education can though.  I salute you for delving into the issue, and maybe if more people were honest with themselves and did not feel so defensive, more people could have the best of both worlds.

<br>
Yes, I believe there is such a thing as being addicted to a game, but I believe that if a person is such, then there was something wrong with them to begin with.  I also believe that if it wasn't a game, it would be some other addiction.  The game just happened to be there first before anything else. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=113883">Landale Palemoon (Primary Gear, WITH NEW AND IMPROVED PANTS!)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Once again - this is the problem that I was referring too.  You see little to gain from everquest so addiction to it is a problem.  Other people see very little to gain from Cross Country, so addiction to it would be a problem.  Who gets to judge what is harmful and what isn't?  Personally, I would much rather have people addicted to EQ than I would to television or even a strenuous sport.<br>
<br>
For instance - after taking many learning tests, I have been told that I learn by pattern recognition.  I have also been told that I am pretty good at it.  Personally, I attribute a large part of that to my video game playing.  Many of the same skills that I use every day to interpret difficult math problems game from playing video games.  I can guarentee without having grown up with video games I would have never learned to program, I would have never learned to fix computers, and I would not have been able to support my family with those skills.  Why?  Because each of those activities started as a direct result of a challenge facing me in a video game.<br>
<br>
So who is to say that there is little to learn from EQ?  Especially in a world where physical strength and mechanical apptitude are quickly being replaced by computer operating skills and quick decision making as highly desirable qualities.<br>
<br>
Once again - the problem with any addiction is abuse.  By abuse I mean letting the addiction consume your life.  It is just as dangerous to let running or working on cars consume your life as it is to let EQ consume your life.<br>

In fact they lean more toward the persons position in life making them vulnerable to things such as video games and the relationships involved. Vulnerable not addicted.  It is those people who do not pay attention and slack off from daily life and responsibilities.<br>
<br>
At one point in time I let my life slip a bit and wasnt paying bills, was showing up to work late or calling in, but I recall I was going thru a divorce at that time.  Granted it was a divorce that I had filed for and requested but it is a tough time no less.  I considered at that time was I addicted to a video game?  Answer: No.  It was a release.  My characters life wasnt going thru the same drama my RL was going thru and no one even knew I was going thru it.  Where as in RL everyone asks 20 questions and reminds you all the more how things are going.  So all of my time went into game.<br>
<br>
And now a year later, I play in the evenings after I get done attending a full time job and all my bills get paid.  Im raising my 16 year old brother.  I have a RL but still play EQ.  When it comes down to it, if Im not working (working as in house and job) what else is there to do?  I could be like the rest of the world and watch sitcoms all night.  I guess then I could be considered &quot;normal.&quot;  I do not attend a Christian church.  I do not drink so no cause to go to bars.  If I went to one movie it is the cost I can pay for EQ for an entire month, and thats WITH OUT popcorn, soda, and a friend. 2 hours of entertainment vs. my own schedule permitting an entire month.<br>
<br>
EQ saves me cash.  And I get to socialize with people I would never other wise get a chance to do so.  I live in Missouri, and my friends all play from California, Nevada, etc.  I have had friends in S. Korea and Singapore.  Even gotten to know them on a first name basis and about thier RL and families.  So those who think we are addicted to a &quot;fantasy&quot; also have it false.<br>
<br>
And btw Rani hit the nail on the head.  I too started playing EQ to find something in common to do with my husband.  Those who are bent out of shape cause thier significant other does not spend so much time with them are sorta being selfish.  Stop whining and if they mean that much to you, YOU try to find a way to meet them half way.  You would be suprised that they would realize the effort and try one of your hobbies with you.<br>
<br>
Hope my opinion helps you on your paper, you may look into the evidence supporting the non-addiction.  Just off the top of my head if you go to castersrealm there was an article linked the news pages about a woman whos daughter died while locked in a car as she played everquest.  There was a psychologist on there who claims RPG's are not addictive.  My opinion is the same.  <br>
