We call shroom house and he shouts &quot;taking shroom house&quot;...now i am not one to rant, and i put him on ignore too fast to log it, but he killed everything in the house, then trained our cleric, then trained Greatgoogly some guy with a shammy. HE then follow CLawll and myself around inspecting us over and over. We moved to ME zone for a new group. <br>
He then followed us there, started harassing the new group of ppl, and sitting on the stones killing all the tribals. Now I dont know about you but this shit pissed me off, everyoen in the zone basically petitioned him, and yet he wouldnt stop following us around and inspecting us taking our mobs , or slow/aggroing mbs that we where pulling.<br>
Just a warning and a vent, this guys a fucking loser and i hope he dies. tnx Wu <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=344827"> Sensei Wubonk Squarepantz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I am so glad that I am not the only person who has come here to inform others about this idiot.  He also has a Monk alt he uses to pull the same chit.  One of my guildies was playing her mid-30s Cleric in a full group at ME, when he called camp check.  When the group piped up with &quot;ME&quot;, he replied with &quot;u have to share&quot;.  To which her group did not bother to reply.  Within minutes Fortress Wickedevil (Moronic Human Monk Alt of Mortichai) came running along with wolves in tow.  He ended up getting only a single member of the group killed before they got the mobs.  He attempted to do it several other times but the Cleric started using Atone to clear aggro from the mobs.<br>
<br>
He then camped to Mortichai Beastheart, level 57 Iksar Shaman.  He sat in the middle of the rocks of the Tribals and begin to KS the mobs they pulled, as well as any mobs they couldnt pull in the first few seconds.  Myself, and some other friends showed up and asked him to leave (starting with politely and up to finally telling him to shove off), wherein he aggro'd as many wolves and NPC's as he could and trained a group over at the GE zone/camp causing the death of one of their members.<br>
<br>
He has apparently been doing this for several days.  A friend of mine and I went around rezzing and buffing the people he had gotten killed, and contacted his (at the time) guild leader about his actions.  After informing his guild leader about it, his guild leader de-guilded him (Thank you, High Guards of Xev.)  Mortichai then made an alt and pretended to be of our guild and tried to muddy the issue by claiming we were joking.<br>
<br>
So he is currently not of any guild, and has been OOC'ing looking for a guild.  I highly recommend to all guilds that they not pick him up as he is effectively besmirching your name by KS'ing, harassing lowbies, and generally being a PITA.<br>
<br>
For those of you who he attempts to fool by going ROLE or ANON.....   &quot;/guildstatus Mortichai&quot;   ... Then contact someone in his guild and speak to them.<br>

We just got trained by some chump.&quot;<br>
_______________________<br>
<br>
People that go out of their way to make others experience of EQ a negative one have no business playing the game. This was exactly what Mortichai was trying to accomplish. I decided to hang out for awhile after rezzing and buffing the lowbies group just to see if there would be anymore antagonizing.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later this Iksar Shaman Mortichai appears on his Drogmor just sitting at the Tribal camp near the ME zone. Says nothing just attacks anything that pops in front of him and tries to KS the lowbie group that had been there for a long time. This carried on for about an hour. After telling a few of my friends about this fucktard some came to take a look themselves and was trying politely to get him to leave. Eventually when he did leave it was just to gather a score of wolves and smugglers and to take them on a tour ending at a different lowbie group at the Griegs End zoneline.<br>
<br>
So naturally the OOC line picks up and everyone is all WTF this and dont be a dick blah blah blah. So I go over there do a rez and some buffs to help prevent another train attack by the idiot. Eventually I did a /guildstatus and found out that he was a member of the High Guards of Xev. After asking around abit I sent a tell to their guildleader Rabassis who was already on the way to check it out for himself.<br>
<br>
Finally Mortichai returns to PoK and turns off anon, just to get his guild tag removed from Rabassis of HGoX. And all was good.<br>
<br>
So I thought. A few minutes later I receive a tell from Rabassis saying that Mortichai claims that we just hate him and were trying to get him deguilded as some sort of joke. I was shocked that Rabassis believed this nonsense after going to DSP himself and hearing about all the complaints.<br>
<br>
Apparently Mortichai created an alt went anon and told Rabassis that he was a member of my guild. After telling him about the /guildstatus command he understood that it was bullshit.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is now hes looking for a new guild to find support from. So desparate he sent OOCs in PoK looking for a guild. Hopefully, any guild that may be interested recruiting him will just refer to this thread and keep him pariah.<br>

I stopped by DawnShroud again today when I noticed the chump was running amok there again.  It didn't take long for him to take his Monk, and train the ME group again.  It was only one death this time, as I and a Wizard friend were rooting and blasting away.<br>
<br>
He again switched to his Shaman and began to KS the xp group that was there.  After some /petitions and /reports, the GM-Admin Beghn came out and after quoting rules to us (First one about if someone is running past you to zone, and their mobs then aggro you on the way out that isnt training... Hello, he never left the freaking zone.  PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING, GM's.  PLZ K THX!, and second, that he had as much right to unaggro'd mobs as we did.  HELLO AGAIN!  KILLING MOBS THAT ARE ATTACKING PEOPLE IS SINCE WHEN CONSIDERED UNAGGROD?  MUST I HAVE KILLED THE MOB TO A CORPSE BEFORE THEY CAN KILL-STEAL??  AGAIN, PAY ATTENTION, PLZ K THX!  Beghn then immediately left and seconds later, blam!  Mortichai/Fortress KS's the xp group.<br>
<br>
After some time talking to him, I discover that he REALLY REALLY doesnt like me hovering in his face with my Spirit of Eagle.  I keep this up some time while the xp group gets some xp from their mobs, and eventually.  PWOOF.  Mort is gone.  Suddenly, so am I.<br>
<br>
We find ourselves in the Qeynos Aqueducts where the following conversation happens<br>
<br>
Uhyre says, 'Seeing as neither of you can get along in the zone I will be removing you both from the zone for 24 hrs , if you are found in the zone your accounts will be warned and possibly suspended , Do I make myself clear'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Sounds excellent to me.'<br>
<br>
You say, 'It will give the people trying to xp there some quiet time.'<br>
<br>
Mortichai says, 'yes'<br>
<br>
You say, 'Without dying.'<br>
<br>
Uhyre says, 'the other GMs and guides will be made aware of this also , and this rules applies to any other characters or accounts you may have on this server'<br>
<br>
You told Uhyre, 'Thanks!  That will be helpful for the people in DSP now.'<br>
<br>
Totally worth it.  I have no real reason to enter Dawnshroud except to stop him from harassing my friends, and other lowbies.  If you have been grouping there, you have until just after 5pm Pacific to xp without him bothering you.  ENJOY!<br>

Frankly you should be hung for calling upon us to trash the reputation of a long standing guild just because they recruited somebody of whome they did not realise his past or perhaps they have spoken to Mort and decided to give him a chance to proove he can be an asset before they hung draw and quarter him.<br>
<br>
Whilst such an act may proove foolish, I hardly think they should be trashed for doing it.  Instead we should pat them on the back, wish them the best of luck and then break out the popcorn and watch what happens.<br>
<br>
personally I don't think he'll change, but you never know, perhaps loosing his guild has taught him a lesson or two.  Although even if he starts playing a bit fairer I still doubt very much he'll play to a competent standard.<br>
