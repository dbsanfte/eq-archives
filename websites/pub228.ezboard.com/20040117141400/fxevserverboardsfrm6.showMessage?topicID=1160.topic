I jokingly sent a tell saying how much pp he would pay before offering my services free of charge while I set up another adventure. I was led to believe that the entire job would take approximatly 10 minutes and when I asked I was told a port would be provided for me back to PoK. Fair enough I think and toddled off to meet him.<br>
<br>
After a little messing about on where to meet as a result of my n00bness we finally meet him in the company of a guildie and a untagged person. The guild in question is &lt;Infernal Harvest&gt;, but we will get to that bit later...<br>
<br>
I ask which door it is that he wants me to pick and he informs me that it is the door in CoM to go to the reavers. Now at this point I need to say that I havnt played much EQ at all over the last year or so (less than 20 times) so wasnt sure if it was bard pickable or not knowing that the lockpick skill for bards had been raised and my skill is maxed i believe. So when I notice that my Selo's Accelerating chorus song was being overwritten by another bard in the greoup I questioned why I was needed. The reply was that he decided to come along at the last minute, then we ported....wtf <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :okfucktard --><img src=http://www.gue.ca/Smilies/okfucktard.gif ALT=":okfucktard"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
We get to EJ and they all start running, so I catch up and ask why I was needed? I get no response. We get to Com where the bard and one other char log off to switch chars, fair enough i think, i am needed after all.<br>
<br>
Unholi goes off to clear the way expecting myself and the unguilded person to find our own way and ignored multiple tells saying we didnt know the way.  At this point I realise that I will not have enough time to get another LDoN as it has taken nearly half an hour to get this far and I had to log off in about 1 1/4 hours. I play at an internet cafe so it is non-negotiable the time I log off. So I think well I am here I can try and help a little with the reavers and then get a port out and log. I tell this to Unholi to which the reply was 'I think it should be ok to port you out when you need to go'. I then pointed out to him that I needed to make sure the port was available when I needed it as I dont want to log in next time stuck in the middle of CoM. I get no reply...When he eventually comes back to get us he nearly leaves us behind but we all get to the required door safely. I then get my lockpicks out and find out that the door is not bard pickable still. Literally seconds after this happens a group ooc in the zone asking if the eavers are camped which he shouts that they are, never mind the fact that we cant actually get the them so I ooc that they are not camped as we cannot actually get to them. At this point the whole fiasco has taken nearly 45 minutes and I am very annoyed. So we go back to the ZI to port out and wait for the druid to log back in....10 minutes later-no druid and he says that he is going to run and just zones out. I send him a tell asking where the port is and he said 'sorry &lt;insert druids name here&gt; must have fallen asleep. lol'<br>
<br>
Now I am very annoyed at this point and ask him what I am supposed to do and he tells me there is wizzard on his way to port us out and gives me his name. Fair enough...I send the wizzard a tell. The person is not online. I tell him and he said to ask kyrae (tha char who asked if the reavers were camped) and that she would help me. At this point I had had enough and disbanded and ran my way out.<br>
<br>
This guy had no intention of providing any sort of port and managed to screw me around for what ended up killing what little time I had left, Ignored tells and generally fucked several of us over...And the worst thing? I had recognised his name when he originally shouted for a lockpicker but couldnt remember where from. You guessed it his name has cropped up on here before /bonk me<br>
<br>
I sent an officer from his guild (Lassor) a tell and was very pleasantly surprised by his reaction as he was very good about it and promised to look into the matter and deal with him.<br>
<br>
I just want to refresh the warning in peoples mind to stay away from ths goat rapist, fecal sucking, kebeb minded wazook as he has done this sort of thing so many times before and will do it again<br>
<br>
The slimey little tosspot to my mind had no intention of even thanking or let alone providing a port to those who helped him and wasted there time they could have been doing something far more interesting and worthwhile, say for instance counting the orcs in cxrushbone or perhaps injecting myself with HIV?<br>
<br>
PLEB!<br>
<br>
Not a great rant but the bones are there for you all to pick on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Ok, for you upper-end people that read this ...<br>
<br>
If you are heading into HoT and you do a /who and see that a relatively large (aprox 12-15 peeps) number of a guild are in a zone ... is it common to at least CHECK to see what is and isn't camped?  I mean, for group hunting, I have always done a camp check unless there is only ONE other person in zone (this happens quite a bit, actually).  Is it common to just not care who is where and whose camps you are fucking up?<br>
<br>
ALSO ...<br>
<br>
Let's just PRETEND that you did check, and let's PRETEND that a number of the members inthis guild you noticed shouted back &quot;Don't come in yet, we are engaged&quot; ...k?  IF you enter anyway, AND you wipe the entire guild... several times... on a scale of 1-10 ... how bad is that?<br>
<br>
Now, lets FURTHER pretend that you actully had a scout in the room with said guild, STILL called out a camp check, and STILL got the same reply, and STILL entered anyway and wiped the entire guild.  Is that worse?<br>
<br>
If Unholi is the one that was in the room with us ... and if Infernal Harvest was the guild, does that make it ok then?<br>
<br>
What if they stick around afterward and help get you buffed (ok, well, they actully just used one of their bots to give us KEI... but that did save us trips to PoK) before they move on to the camp they wanted to begin with.  Does that make everything ok?<br>
Seriously ... where is the line? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=baldrikthedorf>Baldrik the Dorf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.josh-leclair.com/uploads/docs/fairy_bounce08.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ANGRY. rar.</span><br>  Posts: 737<br> <font color=#330000>(11/24/03 11:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1160.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Unholi matters....</span><hr size=1> everyone ive seen with the infernal harvest tag already has the &quot;stay away from me&quot; reputation. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=92695">Baldrik D'Grump</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.orderofdraconis.com/">Order of Draconis</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>
