That was 3 years ago.  Since then, we had another miscarriage.  But last July we had a healthy baby girl.  Her name is Phoebe.<br>
<br>
We have Audrey's picture (taken after she was still-born, the nurses cleaned her up, put a diaper on her, wrapped her up in a receving blanket, and let us say goodbye) on the wall in the hallway.  And we make sure Phoebe say goodnight to her sister every night.  &quot;Who's that?  Yeah, that's your sister Audrey and she loves Korean pears.  Say good night sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
Had Audrey lived, our lives would have been very different, probably difficult and painful.  But that's what parenthood is.  Its the good, the bad, the ugly, the joy, the sadness, the laugh, and the disaster.  The little ones didn't ask to be born, we did.  So we'll take every responsibility and baggage that comes with her.  And I would not give up a minute of it.<br>
<br>
I have always been pro-choice.  And I choose life. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tryonb>TryonB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#330000>(8/8/03 9:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=933.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To let live or to euthanize?

My first reaction was with the majority here, best to end it's life and save it from a short life of pain.  But then I got to thinking about it a little and I'm torn.  The child is born this way, thus has no basis of comparison of what a normal life is supposed to be.  I'm sure the pain is there, but since this feeling is all the child knows there might be a chance to, for lack of a better term, get used to it.  The child might become accustomed to it and learn to forget about it.  While that in and of itself is tragic, we don't really know what goes on in the minds of these victims.  Call me crazy, but after looking at the picture and getting over the initial horror of the grotesqueness, I can actually see a happy child inside.  He's wearing some spiffy shorts and appears to be trying to smile, seriously.  While he in no way lead a normal life, normal is what we make of it.  The child doesn't know what a normal life is.  If there is any possible way to bring joy to it, somehow...if faced with the decision I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>might</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> chose to let it live just to see it try to smile once.  I've never fathered a child though, so I truely don't know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=idadar1337>Idadar1337</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.everlore.com/GFILES/UserPic67062_13144.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>T3h 1337 0n3</span><br>  Posts: 624<br> <font color=#330000>(8/8/03 9:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=933.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hot.ee/raadius/tatu.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To let live or to euthanize?

(kinda NSFW, no porn)</span><hr size=1> I have to agree with Tryon.  I do not see myself as being able to play God with anyone's life.  For a short time I used to visit a local children's hospital when I was  in my teens.  Some people may know about it Riley Hospital for Children.<br>
I always remember hearing stories of these kids who were so full of life and hope, yet they couldn't run, play, or do anything of the sort.  I can not describe to you how ashamed I felt of myself many times.  I would have a bad week and go in there and they would be ready to hug me and tell me how they had such a great week they only had to go through 2 radation treatments and they still have most of their hair!  Or they were allowed to start eating solid foods again, how wonderful lime jello tastes to them!  They were so happy over the little things.  I think the only reason their parents made it through everything was the life and joy these ill children brought to them.  It was very hard to come in and see empty beds knowing they were not empty because the children went home well but empty because they passed away.<br>
I asked one of the parents if they had to do it over again would they have gone through eveything.  They said yes without even thinking about it, they said had they not gone through all the pain the memories of all the joy wouldn't seem nearly as wonderful and they knew that their lives would have been empty without the love of that child.  And how blessed they felt that they were allowed to love someone so wonderful even if it was only for a few years.<br>
<br>
I could never throw away a human life without a second thought.  I could never look at my unborn child and say you are not fit to live.  You never know when the doctor could be wrong on a test.  <br>
Maybe being a religious person I view this in another light.  I belive everything happens for a purpose, and no matter how disfigured or horrid it may seem to some, that life was allowed to happen for a reason.

My girlfriend is in a very similar situation.  She has a very bad case of endometriosis.  I've seen the pictures they took, it looks like a spider went crazy inside her.  Her ovaries are literally stuck and appear as if spiderwebbed to the side walls of the uterus (I think it's the uterus but I may be wrong) and one tube is totally blocked while the other allows but a mere trickle.<br>
<br>
Last summer they gave her lupron injections, for 6 months she endured forced menopause.  Between my pain and her mood swings it was not a fun time but we managed. lol<br>
<br>
Sadly the pain is coming back and for her the only real option is a full hysterectomy.  She's 36 and will never bear a child.  I know from doing all I can to comfort her exactly what you are going through Wrin.<br>
<br>
I'm truly sorry.<br>
<br>
I disagree with you on one small but vital point.  It is true that some children are more understanding and tolerant of differences but by and large kids are simply cruel to one another over things like that.  In the case of this poor child I have no doubt they would be the butt end of every joke.<br>
<br>
My daughter for example, she was born with tight heel cords and is a toe walker, horrible for balance and posture and of course it looks odd seeing someone always on their tip toes.  Her doctor fitted her with a  special brace that forced her to walk flat footed, after less than 3 weeks she was begging not to have to wear it because the other kids were picking on her about it.  <br>
<br>
I'm with Idadar on this one.  If the child had any real hope of a pain free and care free life I'd change my mind in a moment.  I don't think that's a possibility and I can tell you bluntly and honestly from my own expierence with chronic pain...<br>
<br>
were it not for my daughter and my girlfriend I'd have ended my life.  That's how bad I hurt and how miserable I am. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mausoleumthenecro>Mausoleum the Necro</A> at: 8/8/03 10:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wrinsylkenhand>Wrin Sylkenhand </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle> the fury</span><br>  Posts: 1045<br> <font color=#330000>(8/8/03 10:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=933.topic&index=28>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To let live or to euthanize?

That's how she describes a good day.<br>
<br>
My girlfriend has just started with the back pains too.  She says I give the best one handed massage in the world, I just wish the relaxation lasted longer for her.  She's afraid to tell her doctor the pain is coming back because she doesn't want the hysterectomy so I just try to baby her as much as I can.<br>
<br>

and yes it is a desise.  And she needs to tell them the pain is coming back but like I said have her ask about the Depo.  It's a &quot;birthcontrol&quot; but it acutally does much more than that and was orginially designed for endomitreosis. <p>Wrin ~Benevolent princess of the Bouncy Grrlz

I personally do not have any kids (that I know of <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) so my decision to have the child killed after birth may be riding on the fact that I have never experienced that kind of love for my own children.<br>
<br>
Do those with children see it as more loving to have the child killed to ease the &quot;pain&quot; or to let it live? Which one is more selfish? <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Foolish man give wife grand piano, wise man give wife upright organ. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Personally i dont think either should be seen as selfish, it all comes down to different deffinitions of love for that child, by the parents.

That says it way better than I could have.  I have an 11 year old daughter so from a parental point of view I'd say go with the mercy killing because that to me is the right choice.  For others it is not and that is how it should be I think.<br>

It's not a matter of being selfish, it's a matter of doing what you happen to think is best for the child. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=usildordhujata>Usildor Dhujata</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 330<br> <font color=#330000>(8/9/03 10:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=933.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/poeticsarcasm/images/marblemn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To let live or to euthanize? (kinda NSFW, no porn)</span><hr size=1> I'm not a parent so this discussion is hard for me to answer based on my own opinion.  I did spend much of my childhood and young adulthood caring for my younger sister who was born severely developmentally challenged and has seizure disorder.  She doesn't have horrible physical abnormalities but she does have mental ones.  She has suffered years of emotional torment from kids her age her whole life.  She's always been pointed out by those outside our family as &quot;different.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I am an overweight man, obese if you will.  Always have been.  Many people hate the obese (some form these boards if I remember corrently) and yet others just like to torture people's emotions.  So I underwent a lot of ridicule as well.  <br>
<br>
Funny thing is, while she has gone through much more teasing than I have, she nearly never lets it bother her.  I have seen her go through being teased in front of large groups to the point that would leave many people in tears, and she just tells them to &quot;buzz off&quot; and goes back to what she's doing.  It's actually quite amazing.  I envy her, she has taught me a lot.  Wrote an essay about it for college a few years back.  Sometimes a disadvantage makes the strongest of people, and those are the people that can teach us a lot.  <br>
<br>
If someone asked me if I'd want the mother of my future children to go through with a pregnancy if we knew beforehand that the child would have downs or some other disease, a relfex would say no.  But then I think of all the things my sister has taught me and given me to strive to be a better man, and I stall.  I think of how happy she always makes herself even when all the circumstances state that she shouldn't, and I change my mind.  If it's a lifetime of physical pain, I'd react to say abort.  But what greatness may be stifled in the process?  I'm not religious or a believer of fate, but sometimes leaving things in the hands of chance might be best. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/poeticsarcasm/images/eodsig.jpg" style="border:0;height:200;width:500;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
