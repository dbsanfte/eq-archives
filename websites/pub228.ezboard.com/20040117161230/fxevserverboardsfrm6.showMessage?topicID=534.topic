A rant is composed in the brain, shot from the hip, derived from the gut, and straight from the heart of a person who has a problem with someone or something. When you are done ranting you are supposed to feel fucking good. It doesn't matter what you rant about, or how many people you drag down in the gutter in the process of your rant... as long as you walk away feeling better than you did before you hit the &quot;post&quot; button.<br>
<br>
I think that is half of the problem. The majority of you people are hitting the post button with more &quot;un-happy feelings&quot; than you had before your emotionally deprived ass started your post.<br>
<br>
So I'm started this thread in the hope of reviving the true nature of what a rant is. What is a true rant? A true rant is when you've had a bad day at work and nobody at home gives a fuck so you come to xevserver, find this thread and tell everyone about it using at least 3 cuss words per sentence. Just fucking let loose. What is pissing you off? It doesn't even have to be something that is happening in your life as of now. Tell us about that motherfucker that used to beat you up in junior high and what you would do to him if you saw him today.<br>
<br>
The point is to feel better when you done. Don't like President bush? Tell us about it.. Don't like your boyfriend/girlfriend? Friends tired of listening to you bitch about your sorry poor excuse for a relationship? We may not listen either, but you will feel fucking good typing it out and reading your masterpeice after your done. Writing a truely good rant is like having sex with a really good looking woman. You will probably never preform that good again, your dick will itch for a week, your friends don't believe you that you actually slept with her, but after it's all said and done, you can stand back and look at her and say to yourself. &quot;I tapped that... I'm the fucking man!&quot;<br>
<br>
So my challenge to everyone on Xev is to RANT!! Rant like it's your soul purpose on the earth for the duration of time it takes you to make your post. Time to feel good again...<br>
<br>
NOW RANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

<br>
Online music trading..<br>
<br>
<br>
I just don't feel bad about stealing a song from Dr. Dre or Metallica while they drive around in $300,000.00 Bentleys and live in houses bigger than my old High School. When theses overpayed greedy fuckers make 60 grand a year, and actually have to struggle like rest of us.. I'll BUY their CD's. Makes me laugh to hear these adds on the radio and on TV by Britney spears and others about how people shouldn't download music and steal from artists. How much does a CD cost? like $18 bucks where I live. Fuck that. I know I'm not the only one who thinks these people make entirely too much money. A doctor who saves lives and a teacher who shapes a childs future should be the people who make the money.. not these idiots.<br>
<br>
I salute the young kid who made Napster.. we need more programs like this to bring down the cost of CD's and the record companies in their place. K-mart released to the press that in 2002 CD sales were at a record low, possibly to do the rapid growth of a problem known as online music &quot;trading&quot;. hahahahha.. take that you overpayed sons of bitches.. it will only get worse. Until the Goverment steps in and bans MP3 files alltogether like China did, your gonna make less and less money.<br>
<br>
Granted, these people have talent.. and this rare talent that these artists have should be rewarded. But being rewarded by making a living with your talent, and making 20 million a year is where I draw the line. It's a underground revolution, and we are only seeing the begining of it. What happened in China was the advanced stage.. we are not to far off from that. Online music trading will become a bigger problem as technolegy becomes better. Imagine if there was a way to download entire CD's worth of music in a half a second. Who would buy music then if it was that easy to just download it? With our current technolegy a average person can download 15 songs, and burn them on to a CD faster than they can go to the store and buy it. Cost? The price of a single CD-R .. which when bought in bulk is around .50 cents. I havn't bought a CD in a year.. and I don't intend to. <br>
<br>
Enjoy your Bentleys.. while I drive around in my 94 GMC pick-up truck listening to your music and not paying a fucking dime for it. Blow me metallica.. you earned it.<br>

You miss the whole point of this thread. Your the type of people I'm talking about. Instead of coming here to rant and let off some steam, you pick apart my post, find something that might aggrivate me, and post about it to either a) make yourself look good or b) your really really fucking pathetic.<br>
<br>
I try to understand you type of people but I fail everytime.. I guess I just don't have that kind of hate in my life. If I do I choose not to channel it at other people.. I find something that annoys me and center my attention on it.<br>
<br>
No sooner than I posted that thread, I realized there would be people who have nothing better to do than pick it apart and make fun of me. That's life.. and the sex analogy was a joke, and an attempt at humor. But within 20 min 2 people had already isolated the sex part and quoted me.<br>
<br>
Do you 2 realize this? Do you realize you spent a few minutes out of your life to instead of make yourself feel better you tried to make yourselfs look good on a topic that was obiously sarcasm and undeniable humor?<br>
<br>
I love to make fun of myself. If you can't make fun of yourself, your insecure and self-concious and other people will rip you apart. People like Rikera and the other odd named person that were attempting to get a &quot;look at me I'm funny&quot; shot in on me. <br>
<br>
You can make fun of me in what I had hoped would be a fun and stress relieving thread, but I will only say worse things about myself. I don't give a fuck.. that's just me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'll say it one more time... rant people.. RANT! Don't pick apart my posts.. don't pick apart other peoples posts.. just let off some steam about some shit that pisses you off. If I piss you off, rant about me. But make a decent fucking rant out of it for fucks sakes. Your posts were sad and pathetic.. Impress me with a rant of how much I suck, or how I've never been laid and my penis itches or something. Fucking let me have it.. Write one for the books.. just rant!! You'll feel better.. trust me. It's the cheapest form of stress release I can think of right now for some of you people... your already here at this server.. let loose!<br>

Oh, please. If you want VNBoard whinage, please, by all means, stir the pot up.<br>

I've stayed off these boards MOSTLY for months. I don't need to have some 'retired' holier than thou ex-VNboard whiner telling me (or anyone else, for that matter) how it 'should' be done (whatever the hell 'it' is).<br>

Wow..lookee that, you can rant. Here's a cookie. Is that better? <br>

Oh, and perhaps in your limited mindset you missed the fact that your post WAS taken as intended...and was punned upon.<br>

Yep, one of the many reasons I never want to live in a major city.

People bitch about work, school, driving, expenses, relationships (or lack there of), and most of all, EQ. We've put every combination of cum, fuck, pussy, chode, and ballsack together that the laughter has now faded into a chuckle. People don't rant anymore because it's overdone, overplayed. No one wants to listen and people WILL pick apart ANY rant just to make themselves feel better. Welcome to the rant section. <br>

People have misunderstood what a rant is and overplayed it so much that it has just lost its luster.<br>
<br>
Take swearing for example.  There was a time it meant something - that a well placed cuss word could earn the admiration of an entire crowd.  Now people think that swearing every 2 or 3 words is necissary for the rant to be succesful.<br>
<br>
Also - people forget that a rant isn't a flame.  A rant doesn't need to be directed at a person.  It doesn't need to be filled with profanity.  It doesn't even need to be angry - a rant can have a life of its own.<br>
<br>
For example - let me tell you about a customer I had calling tech support when I worked for an ISP.  You see - this customer had a very simple problem, they were getting the error message &quot;username or password invalid - please check them and try again&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, I answer the phone as always and ask the problem - he gives me the error message.  Of course, being a smart technical support agent I ask &quot;Have you tried retyping them?&quot;  Too which he replies &quot;Don't give my the bullshit - just fix the problem with your servers&quot;.<br>
<br>
I reply &quot;I am unaware of any problems with our servers sir - is this your first call today?  What have you already tried to fix it?&quot;<br>
<br>
He replied &quot;What is your problem?  I have an MCSE - I get paid 60,000 dollars a year to fix servers.  I fukkin know when a server has a problem.  Are your engineers just stupid?  I recognized the problem the first time I dialed - and if I can do it from here, your engineers should be able to see it&quot;.<br>
<br>
OK - now lets review this for a moment because he gave several verbal clues to his real problem.  The first was the error message - that error message is authentication.  There are 2 places authentication needs to happen, one is with our servers, the other is on your own computer.  Thats right - windows authenticates with itself when it connects to a dial up connection if this hasn't been turned off.  So - we have the problem narrowed down some.<br>
<br>
Now, moving on - he said he recognized the problem on the first try.  This here is crucial - he dialed the number once then called tech support.  He had obviously not been at the computer long.  Now I knew for a fact our authentication servers were working - so problem must be on his side.  I heard kids in the background.  That led me right to the root of the problem.<br>
<br>
Have you figured his problem out yet?  Well - I wont keep you in suspense any longer, his problem was that he was a fukkin MSCE - Microsoft Certified Idiot.  I know Idiot doesn't start with an E - but don't tell them that, they'd just change the spelling to Ediot and I'd need to learn a new word.  I mean seriously - this guy spent the next 30 minutes refussing to retype his damn password because he knew better than me.<br>
<br>
Now - if you call me asking for my help, then you had damn well be ready to listen.  If you aren't, why call?  I'm sure there is a busy road you can run out in or a cliff to jump off of near by.  That would solve your problem just as fast - so why waste my time by calling me and trying to blame your incompetence on me?  Yeah, I'm going to end my call with &quot;don't worry - happens to the best of us&quot; because I am good at my job and want to keep it - but it doesn't &quot;happen to the best of us&quot;.  It only happens to idiots like you - and before long, I will have spread the story of your idiocy to all my friends and coworkers.<br>
<br>
That being said, after 30 minutes of arguing I was finally able to convince him to retype his password.  He did so, and it logged on immediately.  He of course thanked me by saying &quot;It shouldn't have taken you a gd half hour to change my password back from whatever you guys had changed it to.  In the future - I don't want anyone changing my password without my permission&quot; and hung up.<br>
<br>
Now do I feel better after telling the story?  Of course, nothing better than knowing that even more people out there will appreciate the stupidity of this particular computer owner.  Was it a rant?  Yeah - it displayed my opinion on the matter quite clearly and let me get it off my chest.  Was it a flame?  No - why waste the effort when he wont be here to read it?  Was it a good one?  No - its been to long since it happened, most of my fire has died down.<br>
<br>
Maybe one day the true art of ranting will return.  Until that time - guess you'll have to live with the sewage that currently gets called the &quot;rant&quot;.<br>
