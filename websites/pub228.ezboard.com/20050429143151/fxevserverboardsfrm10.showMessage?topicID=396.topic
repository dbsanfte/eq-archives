  according to CNN this morning ,,,,, (shamelessly copy/pasted)<br>
<br>
<br>
   TIKRIT, Iraq (CNN) -- In a late night raid in his hometown, U.S. forces captured a man they believe to be ousted Iraqi Saddam Hussein, officials said Sunday. <br>
<br>
In Washington, a military official told CNN there's &quot;a high degree of confidence&quot; that the prisoner -- wearing a fake beard when captured, according to several officials -- is in fact Saddam. <br>
<br>
In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said without qualification that Saddam has been captured, and the president of the Iraqi Governing Council said in Madrid that a positive identification was made through DNA tests. (Blair reaction) <br>
<br>
A U.S. military official in Washington said he was unaware of DNA results, but said that scars on the man's body matched wounds that the U.S. believes Saddam would have suffered in past coup attempts. <br>
<br>
The official said the man is being shown to former Iraqi leaders in custody at Baghdad's airport to complete the identification process. <br>
<br>
He was captured, the official said, with little or no resistance along with a small group of aides. <br>
<br>
A senior U.S. official told CNN's Dana Bash in Washington that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told President Bush Saturday afternoon (EST) of the likely capture. <br>
<br>
Abdel-Aziz al-Hakim, president of the Iraqi Governing Council, said Sunday at a joint news conference with Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio, that the man was in a basement and wearing a fake beard when he was captured. <br>
<br>
Hours after the word leaked out on the possible capture, there were volleys of celebratory gunfire and people honking their car horns in Baghdad. <br>
<br>
The raid was based on intelligence that Saddam was at a particular location in the area, the officials said. <br>
<br>
Video following that raid -- exclusively shot by CNN's Alphonso Van Marsh -- showed a group of U.S.-led coalition soldiers patting each other on the back -- apparently in celebration -- and taking group photos in front of a military vehicle. <br>
<br>
The 66-year-old longtime Iraqi leader was number one on the coalition's 55 most wanted list, and his evasion has been a political sore spot for the U.S. administration. (Saddam profile) <br>
<br>
The Iraq war began on March 19 when U.S. forces launched a &quot;decapitation attack&quot; aimed at the Iraqi president and other top members of the country's leadership. <br>
  <br>
<br>
   Hours later, a defiant Saddam wearing a military uniform appeared on Iraqi television to denounce the U.S.-led military campaign as &quot;criminal&quot; and to say his countrymen would be victorious. <br>
<br>
At least a dozen audiotapes believed to have been recorded by Saddam, 66, have been released since he was forced out of power by the coalition forces during the Iraq war. The most recent was broadcast in November. <br>
<br>
His sons Uday and Qusay -- also on the coalition's most wanted list -- were killed in July, after U.S. forces stormed their hideout in Mosul. <br>
<br>
Initial hopes that their father would soon be found faded in the months following that raid. <br>
<br>
Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of U.S. ground forces in Iraq, has been dogged by reporters wanting to know the status of the search for Saddam. <br>
<br>
&quot;It is difficult to find him,&quot; Sanchez said, at a press briefing earlier this month. &quot;Given that I haven't found him killed him or captured him, and I need the Iraqi people's help, and together we will find him, we will capture him, we will kill him.&quot; <br>
<br>
The announcement comes on the same day that 20 people were killed and 32 wounded by a car bomb outside an Iraqi police station west of Baghdad, an Iraqi police officer told CNN. <br>
<br>
Sixteen policemen were among those killed in Sunday's explosion at Khaldiyah, 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the Iraqi capital, the officer added. (Full story) <br>

He can be put in front of the Hague now where the world can see his every war crime.<br>
<br>
I've already had a couple conversations today about it.  I believe that we can expect very visible attacks by Hussein's loyalists in the next few weeks, and that they would happen no matter what the status of the former leader of the country.<br>
<br>
Now if we can just find the burial place of Osama bin Laden.<br>
<br>
Bush's approval rating is going to skyrocket.  Despite how little I want to think about it, Bush will probably be able to stay in office mostly because of this success.  Unless somehow he lets the retaliation I mentioned above get out of hand.<br>

And to comment about the re-elections.  If this was delayed purposely to boost Bush's popularity before re-elections it wouldnt have come 11 months removed from them, it would have been closer to 3 months or 6 months at the longest. At least that's when I'd do it if I was running his campaign.... <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/abitoo/Abitoo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
His capture is great, but he still needs to be convicted of his crimes. I guess my biggest fear is that he will somehow manage to escape conviction and be a &quot;free man&quot; in exile from his country or something. Too bad he wasnt killed &quot;resisting arrest&quot; (with video tape to prove the resisting part)<br>
<br>
His capture 11 months before the Nov. 2004 elections may help assuming he is convicted in a speedy trial.  Imagine Bush's approval ratings if about a week before the election he is convicted and/or punished, especially if he gets the death penalty.<br>
<br>
This year's Presidential Election is gonna be interesting if the Dem's can put up a decent candidate. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/abitoo/Abitoo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Though I would love to see otherwise, I FULLY expect top see Bush remain in office.  Especially now.<br>
<br>
Point 2<br>
Bush was under a LOT of heat for this war (and approval, yes, I know) and needed something to cool everyone down.  Yes, this did come at a VERY convienient time for him and Sadam's complete lack of resistance makes me wonder, though these are questions in MY mind that are completely unfounded and not even worth mentioning.<br>
I was working as a journalist and working on a journalism degree... my mind questions everything and I take nothing for face value.<br>
<br>
Point 3<br>
Bush is slashing medicare and Social Security monies to the bone, and juicy headlines like these mere DAYS after bills like those insure that most people will not evenbe aware of it.<br>
<br>
Point 4<br>
As I said in a previous post (on another thread) this will, HOPEFULLY, give us the definite yes or no answer about the WMD's.  Once again, the fact that he was so resigned to his fate and hidden in a hole some where so obvious as his hometown just makes my journalistic spider-senses go all haywire again.<br>
<br>
Has this been some sort of elaborate setup?<br>
Where is Bin Laden (remember him?)<br>
Why was the former leader of an entire nation living in a hole in the ground?<br>
Why aren't we being told who supplied the information if he was so passive and easy to capture?<br>
If all of these Sadam Loyalists are fighting so hard for him, how did they know anything about him, or that he EVEN wanted them to?<br>
<br>
Now, if you actually read all of this, let me say now that I am not saying anything IS or ISN'T anything.  These are just the questions/thoughts I have in my mind.<br>
At some point, I only hope we get some answers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dramid>Dramid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 453<br> <font color=#330000>(12/15/03 9:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://p072.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=396.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well i'll be a son of a ...</span><hr size=1> It was announced that Saddam will remain in US custody for atleast 6 months before he is turned over to the Iraqi people to be tried.
