This story I give the title &quot;You WILL join my guild! What must an unguilded bot do to get some peace in the world of Norrath?&quot;<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
To set the scene.  Once upon a time Niliu Whytevanman (trusted 55th Enchanterbot of Pneumatic Dryll) was sitting at her bind point waiting to be rezzed when a young Druid started sending her tells about a 'great' guild.  This was the 4th time that same day this had happened to Niliu, and she was getting tired of dealing with guild invites so she undertook a cunning plan.  She accepted, and guild invites soon stopped.<br>
<br>
A few days later the leader of the guild Lytch begged Niliu's master Pneumatic to attend a raid.<br>
<br>
[Thu May 15 02:32:31 2003] Lytch tells you, 'Ill have your guild points doubled if you bring your click stick cleric, ok?'<br>
[Thu May 15 02:32:42 2003] Lytch tells you, 'instead of 1 point an hour its 2'<br>
[Thu May 15 02:33:00 2003] Lytch tells the guild, 'we need more ATTENDANCE for sick drops in The Deep!'<br>
<br>
Pneumatic didn't have the heart to say no, even though it was 2:30 in the morning and the raid hadn't even started forming.  They clearly needed her.<br>
<br>
[Thu May 15 02:37:05 2003] You told Lytch, 'k - I bring Pneumatic to raid'<br>
[Thu May 15 02:37:11 2003] Lytch tells you, 'thanks'<br>
<br>
She was most displeased to note that Lytch hadn't bothered to come to the raid himself, infact many 50+ members of the guild where on and they didn't bother to come.  The raid itself was a single group affair, borrowing 3 non-guild characters.  The 3 LoA members in the group where all too low for the zone.  Niliu intended at this point to leave the guild, but didn't appear again in the world of Norrath for some months.<br>
<br>
When she eventually returned Lytch had left the guild and she met the new leader.  They went to the Tower of Frozen Shadows together and Niliu enjoyed her time there, she decided the new guy was alright and that she would stay.<br>
<br>

<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:05:39 2002] Lytch tells you, 'Legacy had too many low levels and we wiped on most of our raids, i was tired of it and made an organized 50+ roleplaying/raiding guild'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:06:01 2002] You told Lytch, 'you didn't just make some raids 40+ or 50+ ?'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:06:13 2002] Lytch tells you, 'tried it'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:06:19 2002] Lytch tells you, 'we didnt have much 50+'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:06:28 2002] Lytch tells you, 'and legacy has name for being a &quot;newbie&quot; guild'<br>

[Thu Oct 17 17:08:39 2002] Lytch tells you, 'what makes you say that?'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:08:58 2002] Lytch tells you, 'Legacy has started with the reputation of being a newbie guild, and has ended that way'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:09:00 2002] You told Lytch, 'because you've done nothing to change your reputation - you are new, therefor you are a newbie guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>

[Thu Oct 17 17:11:36 2002] Lytch tells you, 'i still have control of the guild too'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:11:37 2002] You told Lytch, 'AFK Message: on Pneumatic'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:13:07 2002] You told Lytch, 'are you sure you have control of the guild, you aren't in it?  I spoke to a guy this morning who seemed to think he was the leader.'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:13:46 2002] Lytch tells you, 'the original creator of the guild is on my account, and I can easily petition that leader to be removed if he doesnt follow what I tell him, thats why i picked someone i trusted'<br>
<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:14:04 2002] Lytch tells you, 'I know what im doing, dont doubt me on this. Lost in Trance will be so successful'<br>

[Thu Oct 17 17:14:37 2002] Lytch tells you, 'every one goes before me'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:14:39 2002] You told Lytch, 'well success really does depend how you measure it.  I've been in one of the top guilds on the server, but I left that.

<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:16:03 2002] Lytch tells you, 'are you saying you have no want or need to participate in guild events?'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:17:06 2002] Lytch tells you, 'just to be in such a guild that would want to help you.. the people there that consider you as a good friend.. is that not worth fighting for? is it worth dying for?'<br>

<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:32:28 2002] You told Lytch, 'ok let's look at your offer, the chance to raid at 5am in the morning when you beg me to come then dont bother showing up yourself like you did last time.  My friends, whome I know only you who didn't show up for the one thing I expected you to be at, have fun - aye I probably would, I can do that anywhere.

[Thu Oct 17 17:36:19 2002] You told Lytch, 'I raid pretty much as often as a like already, with friends and by guesting on raids.  I often tag along and help newbie guilds out - guilds just learning to raid, or seeing the plains or ToV for the first time - you know the sort I meen, newbies.'<br>
<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:36:22 2002] Lytch tells you, 'if your going to be like that, you really arent what legacy is seeking. everyone else was so happy i made this guild'<br>

[Thu Oct 17 17:43:39 2002] Lytch tells you, 'you know who your talking to right?'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:43:43 2002] You told Lytch, 'seein as I am, by circumstance, an LoA member - i'll take the time to help out at guild events, and i'll try not to solo their raids and instead teach.'<br>
[Thu Oct 17 17:43:57 2002] You told Lytch, 'Lost in Trance and Legacy of Annihilation'<br>

[Thu Oct 17 18:04:52 2002] You told Lytch, 'I can solo kael arena.  I'm sorry if that offends you.  I also solo'd PoJ, and PoG although both have been nerfed since.  I've solo Chardok, Sebelis as far as Jail and Vexsar, i'm sorry if you find that disagreeable but thats' the level of progression i'm at.  I'm far from the most powerful on this server, others could solo those places far more efficiently than me.  Your raids would have a higher kill speed too.

A) Shoot myself (in the foot, for being so stupid)<br>
<br>
B) Shoot him (In the head, for the same reason as stated above)<br>
<br>
C) /guildremove (obviously)<br>
<br>
How the hell can he even call himself a guild leader, yet call his guild a bunch of newbs?  The only way a guild gets branded as a newb guild is:<br>
<br>
A) They are one. (possibly this choice in THIS situation, but not likely)<br>
<br>
B) They act like one.<br>
<br>
Either way, a guild getting branded as something is entirely their own fault (Re: Hawkestone), and that fault falls onto the guild leader and officers.  Therefore, maybe he's not as much of a dumbass as we think...calling his guild newb because he is one, perhaps?<br>
<br>
It makes ya think...how the hell do all these morons start playing Everquest?  Is it some conspiracy by Sony?<br>

I could imagine Sony sending complete EQ packages to random morons througout the world...<br>

Random Moron:  OH!  What's this?  Everquest?  Looks fun...<br>

<br>
I personally helped Shadowfrost through the last stages of her epic and I can assure you she didn't complain once.  She had a fairly rough time camping the old Skyfire Ragefire and even lost out from a week long guide-wide vigil in the zone yet she still kept her cool, most commendable.<br>
<br>
As for myself, i've three times been accused of KS'ing the old Ragefire: One when I didn't even engage him.<br>
<br>
Once when there was no opposition in the zone and I was offered the heart, and I refused it in favour of another cleric.<br>
<br>
Finaly when BC Ks'd Ragefire from Harmonium I was at work and not even online.  I was accused of KS'ing him anyway - even though I subsequently guildremoved after finding out what happened.<br>
<br>
Then the spawn changed so clerics had to get the pearls, and instead of whinning and moaning that I didn't have pearls I went out there and solo'd it.  I hardly call that complaining my way to my epic.<br>
<br>
Then when I needed to do the SolB part of my epic, again I didn't bitch and moan to my guild to help me past the Fire Giants, I didn't even complain that I kept getting beaten to the spawn, instead I ended up racing a group of BC for it, on my own, and solo'd my way to him first.<br>
<br>
I didn't get my epic 2 years after starting the quest by bitching and moaning, I got my epic out of tenacity and ingenuity.<br>
<br>
As for 'not having the initiative' to start a guild, I did try once and led a small guild on several sucessful raids and never wiped out despite our low numbers (although admitedly not without the help of friends) and big targets, but we never managed to have enough online to do the guild petition thing and subsequently people started moving on.<br>
<br>
Did I knock him for trying?  Well I don't know how much fairer I could be to him.  I wasn't interested in joining his new guild, is that evil?  I tried being polite, I tried explaining to him why I didn't want to join.  What would you have done Crylin?  Please tell me, please explain why i'm so evil and your so holy.<br>

As for the SolB race, believe what you like.  I capitalised on the pathing of the Fire Giants and escaped combatting them, I was eventually slain but only after the hand in.  I then employed a necro to retrieve my corpse.  That was not a case of group works faster than a solo cleric, it is a case of using Ingenious strategic mastery to turn a clear defeat into victory.  Something you wouldn't understand, because your a fucking noob so to you WAR+CLR+DRU &gt; solo CLR.<br>
<br>
If you had any understanding of the game at all, you'd realise that EQ is about more than what forces you throw at a problem.  However i'm not going to go into a detailed discussion of the game here, your already high level so it's clearly to late for you to learn - the only noob around here is you, Crylin.<br>

I wouldnt call it a race either, the BC ppl who was after him was AFK if I remember right. I can see if I still got the loggs there, It all started with you asking for a gate if Im not mistaken and after that I just joined up since I handt anything to do. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=557206">Bippwinno Breedfoot</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://bloodcult.net">Blood Cult, Xev</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Please forgive my ailing memory as it was a while ago.<br>
<br>
The point however is the same, you where there out of circumstance and not because I bitched and whined until you came - as Crylin insists - quite a claim for a guy who has absolutely no idea what happened.<br>
<br>
Was it a race with BC?  Well once I got inplace I seem to recall you departed and I was at that time alone - after an hour or so the Fire Giants started popping.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the point is, I didn't bitch and moan my why to my epic, unlike most clerics who wouldn't even step foot in Skyfire to get their pearls without a group.  Infact let's look at some of the other encounters I did: The first bit in Lake Rathe - myself and an old friend did it one day because we where bored and wanted something to do - not because I begged anyone - it was more a case of he begged me to start!<br>
<br>
Chardok, I drove home from work at speeds in excess of 100mph, at times 120mph (my car only did 125 max!) to make that raid and help Sekumsid get his warrior epic,  the scroll dropped on the way and I declined it again - this time in favour of Nogi's bot because I felt that was better for the guild, however Nogi's bot Egon already had the scroll and with no other non-epiced clerics there I took the scroll.<br>
<br>
Then there was the Sol Temple encounter.  We'd formed a group to do the Paladin epic encounter in Permafrost but after we got in and buffed we found that somebody had already done the encounter and the mob was down.  I believe the unlucky Paladin was Nioli.  As we where all dress up with nowhere to go somebody asked for suggestions and I put my Sol Temple encounter into the pot - the responce from the group was immediate and moments later i'd done the encounter.<br>
<br>
I could go on, but for what purpose - I think i've proved my point whereas Crylin has only thrown around loose insults.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is in game yesterday I got a tell from somebody about Lytch saying what trouble they had with him, and in my inbox this mourning I got an email about Crylin - I so wish I could post it here - it seems that my famous 'reputation' is a far cry from the most notorious around here.<br>

<br>
If I had known that my simply having an epic would cause so much trouble then I don't think i'd ever have played Everquest in the first place, i've tried to do everything right and do what I thought was the decent thing at every step along the way.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed raiding in BC, but I even gave that up because of issues surrounding the sodding cleric epic.  I lost a few friends from SoH, a few in BC, crossed swords with Harmonium and I lost the respect of a few on this forum because of the fucking thing.<br>
<br>
However if I went back now with the benefit of hindsight I still think the same things would happen.  I guess there will always be different views for everything though, and some views will always be from the perspective of assholes like Crylin.<br>

A little history here, I never camped Ragefire for myself.  When I did Ragefire for me it was because the guild where all logging on after camping out in skyfire following the previous nights Ragefire kill - so we ganked him for me before doing our thing for the night.  Infact I didn't want to do the kill as I'd constructed a strategy for doing him with 3 of my friends, and I very much wanted to do it that way but Persepine, the guild leader, was most adamant and eventually I gave in.<br>

If you it took you 2 mins to read the log then why did you not stop reading after the first minute once you realised it was boring?<br>
