<br>
TELL US WE ARE BOMBING THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE PAYING/HARBORING TERRORISTS.<br>
<br>
Not because they possess weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
Simple, subtle distinction.<br>
<br>
Oh and those 'weapons of mass destruction' used on 9/11 ... THEY WERE OUR FUCKING PLANES. OMFG invade us. Seriously now. Was there a direct link between 9/11 and Saddam? I'm talking direct, not indirect, like 4, 5, 10 years ago a donation to the Bin Laden foundation. Some say yes, some say no... we don't know for sure yet. Are there ties? Yes. But honestly, playing the sympathy card for the 9/11 terrorist acts is tired. Hell, even our lying president has stopped using it. You should follow suit.<br>
<br>
He lied or intelligence failed, now they're trying to cover it up.<br>
<br>
The truth would have been much easier.<br>
<br>
I'm sure the people who died on 9/11 would understand the distinction between 'we are attacking him because he is paying people to kill you' and 'we are attacking him because he currently has weapons that can kill you and is poised and ready to use them.'<br>
<br>
I'm not saying we shouldn't be over there. Frankly I think Saddam being out of power and us having forced that is a good thing. I don't disagree with the ends, but I disagree with the justification of those ends. Hell, if he said 'we're going to invade Iraq, take their oil and make it cheaper for US citizens while enslaving that nation for low-cost labor' hell, I might have been drunk enough at poll time to say 'wtf, why not?' to that.<br>
<br>
Is that hard to fathom? <br>
<br>
But if we say 'we are going after Saddam Hussein because he has weapons of mass destruction' we better damn well be going after him because he (here's the tough part now, follow close) HAS weapons of mass destruction, otherwise the goofball in the oval office looks like a dufus. <br>
<br>
I'm not saying we don't (or didn't) take him seriously. I'm not saying we shouldn't have invaded him, my point (which you CLEARLY missed) was that the weapons of mass destruction card is being downplayed in favor of more tangiable (and true) reasons why we should be over there and doing what we're doing. But the human rights violations and all of the 'other stuff' is starting to be the topic of spin while WMD's are played down by the white house (and consequently the spineless media). <br>

he said after the first gulf war we knew WMDs saddam had. inspectors got rid of some of it, but there was still a lot left, in 1998 we attacked some places, we don't know if we got all or some or none of what was left. it was prudent that bush go to the UN and to get inspectors back in and threaten saddam with regime change instead of keeping sanctions going. <br>
<br>
<br>
i know you all jump over bush about the the seeking materials in africa. thats just 1 piece of the reasons we went in, its not the only reason. he said that it was from british intelligence, and the british still stand by that statement. <br>
<br>
<br>
you can't come out and say there are no WMDs in iraq, even clinton said there is still unaccounted for WMDs. <br>

Right now, I honestly don't know.  Saddam Hussein is gone but the civilian body count since mid-March is now around 6000-7000..<br>
<br>
I agree with Chiana.  I don't necessarily disagree with the ends (because it's too soon to judge whether the war had a good or bad effect), but I disagree with the justification of the ends.  <br>
<br>
I've been following the news for a while now and it's obvious that they've been varying the reasons for war.. from &quot;Saddam Hussein supports al-Qaeda,&quot; to &quot;Saddam Hussein possesses WMD,&quot; to &quot;We're doing a good thing for the Iraqi civilians.&quot;  What is the real reason??<br>
<br>
I know WMD isn't the principal reason.  Paul Wolfowitz said in Vanity Fair magazine: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>for reasons that have a lot to do with the US government bureaucracy, we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on: weapons of mass destruction.&quot; <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  I think what it boils down to is that the war could have been a good thing for the Iraqi civilians, but if it was, it was a side-effect, a byproduct.  We all know that the US really doesn't care about being humanitarian.. it's only now pretending to be.  When they say the Iraqi civilians are safer now, I feel happy for them but I'm also mad that we're pretending that's one of the reasons why we went to war. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168753"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.pacbell.net/ping000/Rasc-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
1) WMD<br>
<br>
2) Inhumane treatment of the Iraq citizens by the regime<br>
<br>
3) Aiding terrorists and terrorism<br>
<br>
4) Broken UN Mandates<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why people are fixating on just one part of the whole when it has all been proven, hell even a former president from the other party has stepped up and said they had WMD.  It wasn't just one thing that forced our government's hand, it was many.<br>
<br>
I agree we have a horrible history of building attempting to build a democracy in other countries, I agree we had some flawed intelligence but I think the same can be said about any war no matter who the combatants, I agree that acting without the backing of the UN was not a good thing.<br>
<br>
Bush said he would do anything and everything in his power to stop terrorism and while the methods may not always meet with my personal approval he is doing exactly what he said he would do and taking full responsibility for it.

<br>
They did tell us that.  The only ones harping on and singling out WMD are the anti-war, anti-bush people.<br>
<br>
You claim we are only there because of WMD, well okay, lets just say that is true, that is the only reason we are there.  We already have established proof of the capability of Saddam to create and use WMD.  Now, what exactly do we need to prove, if we are going to base this action on WMD, well we need to prove Saddam had the capability to create and use WMD.  Okay, well we did that.  The UN has known about this capability for years.  We knew it before we went into the war and we found more proof of it after the war.<br>
So if you want to claim we are only justifying this war using WMD, well then there is your proof.<br>
<br>
The truth of the matter is, saying we are fighting Iraq for WMD is like saying the Civil War was about slavery.  A part of it was, but the overall reasons for going to war are more complex.  And the government has always said they were more complex then just WMD.<br>
<br>
Sadly, what happens is alot of people get sucked into propaganda machines, like the anti-bush, WMD one spreading through the world right now.  There are actually people out there, most of them democrats, who have the nerve to stand up and say that they are not so sure we did a good thing by deposing Saddam.  They think we should have left him there.  You know why they say that?  Not because they believe he should have been allowed to torture, rape mulitilate and kill his own people, not that he should have the right to continue aiding those who seek to kill Americans at home and abroad, no, not for any of those reasons.  They say that for one reason, they don't like Bush and they don't want a republican president.<br>
<br>
So when you get all up in arms about the WMD you already know are there, ask what else you are supporting.  Be informed people.  Don't be a partisan puppet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mausoleumthenecro>Mausoleum the Necro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Opinionated Asshole</span><br>  Posts: 355<br> <font color=#330000>(7/24/03 10:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=877.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Be informed people.

<br>
I listened to the anti-war, anti-Bush people being put on the hot seat, asked point blank to defend anything they were claiming and I have yet to see one person who could do it.  They hemmed and hawed, back tracked, and used double talk to avoid ever truly defending their own passionate point of view.  After that I went out and sought people who thought differently then I did and engaged them the same way.  When presented with facts. not one of them could defend why they felt the way they did about the war.  <br>

The problem is not whether we went to war over a,b,c or all of the above, the problem is that the WMD were given as a reason to invoke &quot;clear and present danger&quot;, therfore justifying the use of force without UN approval.  If there are no WMDs, there was no reason to go in &quot;right now&quot;, as justified it would have been to save the Iraqi people from the dictator.<br>
The only internationally accepted reason to go to war is self defence.  Everything else is meddling in other countries internal affairs, something we are very keen on the other please don't do to us (like in the anual condemnation of our death penalty).<br>
If we are willing to drop the non-interference policy we should say so, not pretend we were in danger from Iraq.<br>

I sometimes wonder if people realize what size of an operation an industrial WMD program is.  Effective chemical weapons need to be produced in the ton scale, not something you can do in the back of a truck.  A homemade kilo of tabun in the tokyo subway may make for a desastrous terror attack, but does not constitue a national WMD capability if they would find it in Iraq.<br>
Nuclear facilites that can process any quantity of weapons grade material are the size of factories, not machines that are hidden in some basement.  Isotope enrichment is one of the trickiest things to do on a large scale, you don't do it right you either don't get a working bomb, or you blow yourself up long before you've gotten one.  Plus you need a working nuclear reactor somewhere to make your plutonium in the first place, another item noone has found yet.<br>
The knowledge to build WMDs is tought in any university today, converting it into an actual capability is something completely different. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260848">Shamu Whitewale</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You also have to understand he had 12 years to disassemble and hide alot of these materials.  This is not going to be as easy as finding a fully assembled arsenal of anthrax warheads.

That elicited a chuckle. The fact that democrats are criticizing the president and his actions in justifying this war and the fact I am criticizing him for the same are coincidence, not any implicit tie or link between my views and theirs. <br>
<br>
The last time I voted remotely democrat was... hmm. Never.<br>
<br>
The simple fact is, the reason everyone was focused on WMDs was because the Whitehouse was focusing on WMDs. It was the keynote speech, it was the trumpet and the flag by which we declared war. <br>
<br>
Oh the others were there... they were footnotes. Valid, true, but overshadowed by the larger issue that they presented.<br>
<br>
They have proven he had WMDs ... prior to the last gulf conflict. Sure, the guy was a complete and utter ass to the inspection crew and thwarted them at every opportunity, but what we've found over there... pretty much confirms what the inspection team had reported. Saddam <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did not have an active weapons program capable of producing what we said he was producing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. He HAD one (past tense, first war), but it was no more. Buried in the sand. He had a small selection of warheads that could exceed their allowed range. Now if we move Arkansas to the geographical location of say, Iran, we might have an argument that those presented an immediate threat.<br>
<br>
I'm still holding out hope we find a smoking gun. I'd be happy as a pig in shit to be wrong in calling the Bush administration propagandist liars. I'd like to have my faith restored in the administration because I do believe he is doing things in a manner he considers right (and which I consider the right things to do... tangent: envision Bittleaye having a heart-attack right now... trust me on that one). But the fact that the whole WMD trumpet is sorely out of tune placed doubt on the sincerity, quality and intelligence of his other decisions. <br>
<br>
I'm not here to make Bush look bad. I don't think I need to be, he's doing that quite well himself. The media will fry him, likely. But you cannot discount their conclusions entirely just because they, for the most part, support an opposite party line, just as one cannot hold Bush entirely accountable for the propaganda and lies. Which I don't. <br>
<br>
Maybe I'm backpedaling a bit, I probably am. I'm not really anti- or pro- Bush at this point, but the actions of the Bush administration regarding the justification for the war make me less likely to be a 'partisan puppet' and support him regardless of what he does. I'm critical of the people I helped put in office (had to get him out of the Governer slot here in Texas, sorry folks!), and his actions have placed doubt on my trusting him. I consider what he did was lying, given the facts of what they have actually found over there.<br>
<br>
As for North Korea, there I think Bush is acting as he should. Okay, lets pretend that I'm still supporting Bush on Iraq policy based on the statement, paraphrased, &quot;we are going in to prevent him from establishing a nuclear weapons program.&quot; <br>
<br>
Therein lies the first problem. We can't really prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear weapons program capable of creating long-range (or short range for that matter) nuclear weapons. Why? Because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>they already have them</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. The program's already they. They are capable, they are making them. (Feel free, Mav, to jump in here and spew something about Straw Man, yep, I'm committing a falacy, sue me). <br>
<br>
Diplomacy wasn't going to work with Saddam. I think he got the only thing he was actually going to respond to, which was a significant show of force. His support of terrorism was an effort to weaken other nations, not jockey for global political power. His human rights violations was an effort to keep a majority held as a minority in his country, completely under his control. He was sitting on one of the wealthiest oil reserves in the world. He had money, he had local power, his plans, I believe, were far more nefarious than just diplomatic juxtaposition in the global political scheme.<br>
<br>
Now, North Korea, on the other hand (who is, likely also guilty of human rights violations, but I digress) is using their nuclear build-up exactly to increase their bargaining power on the global scale. Why? Because they don't offer anything else. They're under the grip of a dictator who has driven the country into a deep poverty in order to strengthen their military (but who knows, it worked for Germany). <br>
<br>
What needs to happen there is we need to use our trade ties with China to entice China into bringing North Korea under its nuclear umbrella since not only does China have a regional interest, they're the ones that enabled the current government of North Korea (well, actually the last government of NK) to establish their nuclear status. It's something that actually has a diplomatic solution, and I think the Bush administration is taking the correct tack on that issue to solve it diplomatically.<br>
<br>
And the media may be focusing away from the NK issue and more on Iraq, but dear god, do you blame them? Which would you rather watch, a Bruce Willis shoot-em-up flick or CSPAN? <br>

What I am saying is that the popular information media outlets ARE on definite party lines.

And I haven't exactly found anything supporting the fact we've found evidence of active WMD plants or even the ability to activate such in the short term. <br>
<br>
As far as my sources, I'm a media junkie, and not just the popular media. I'm afraid we will have to agree to disagree, because my conclusions are based from information gleaned from mainstream, fringe, right and left wing sources. I still think he was lying, or in the least knew the grounds by which he was making his call were shakey at best (concerning the potential threat of WMDs, specifically). <br>
<br>
The popular media exaggerates... which is why, if I think I've got my ducks in order, I'm not completely throwing out support for the Bush administration as one who was 'towing the party line' in concordance with what the news media feeds us would have me do. <br>
<br>
But far be it from me to discredit the popular media when, heaven forbid, they may actually be on to something. Just because they're on the opposite party line doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elrynia>elrynia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gnomish Pr0n Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 709<br> <font color=#330000>(7/24/03 1:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=877.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Then we agree to disagree.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=877.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=877.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=877.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=877.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=877.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=877.topic&start=121&stop=121>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=877.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=877.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=877.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=877.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.threadControl?topicID=877.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=877.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=877.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub228.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="xevserverboardsfrm1">General Discussion<option value="xevserverboardsfrm7">Marketplace<option value="xevserverboardsfrm2">Raiding<option value="xevserverboardsfrm16">Poll Mania<option value="xevserverboardsfrm4">Epic Quests<option value="xevserverboardsfrm13">Trade Skills<option value="xevserverboardsfrm3">Tactics<option value="xevserverboardsfrm5">Questing<option value="xevserverboardsfrm9">Looking for Guild<option value="xevserverboardsfrm12">Guild Leading and Officership<option value="xevserverboardsfrm11">Guild Link Submission<option value="xevserverboardsfrm6">Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm26">Political Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm10">/ooc<option value="xevserverboardsfrm21">Rant Polls<option value="xevserverboardsfrm19">Archives<option value="xevserverboardsfrm15">Moderators Forum<option value="xevserverboardsfrm23">ber<option value="xevserverboardsfrm27">Ask the Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards>Xev Server Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6>Rants</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.3e<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
