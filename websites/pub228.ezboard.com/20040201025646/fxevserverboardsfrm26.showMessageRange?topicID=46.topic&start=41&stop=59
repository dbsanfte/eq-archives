That's were you're wrong - since we don't have a &quot;they&quot; to kick.  For them there are 300 million targets, we have to figure out which 100,000 in the 300 million are the &quot;at least somewhat guilty&quot;.<br>
Wholesale reprisal slaughter has gotten such a bad name (Lidice, Oradur etc.) that wiping whole cities of the surface of the earth because a terrorist or two might be in it has become unacceptable.  Even blockade ala Biaffra is considered a no-no today, can't have pictures of starving children on TV.<br>
And don't forget the first rule of political terror - make your targets overreact, that will give you the support of the masses that initially don't support their cause. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260848">Shamu Whitewale</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I did address your comments; unfortunately I didn’t kowtow to the great and mighty Ram when I did it.  I completely disagree with you assessment of the situation.  Yes I'm saying that I disagree with YOUR view of human nature.  And last I checked you were not omnipotent in any way expect perhaps in your own mind.  <br>
<br>
Lan's statement is all there.  What I see it saying is that if you don't do something then less people will be upset with you.<br>
<br>
I say that that statement is bullshit in its context, be it a single encounter or an invasion.  I say that it is human nature for people to try to get away with as much as they possible can till they get caught, and someone else gets pissed at what they are doing.  And I say that it is human nature for people who can get away with something to brag about it to other people.  And I say that it is human nature for those people to think again that maybe because Curly, Larry, and Moe can get always with it then I can too.<br>
<br>
As far as the killing themselves.....do you understand at all how their view on this works.  They get the greatest reward 2 fold.  They get the satisfaction of knowing that they have killed thousands of people they hate, and they will be given glory not only in the memories of people they leave behind but also from Allah.  They think that they will be able to show others that there is a way to kill those they hate and be honored for it.  That too is human nature.<br>

<br>
I am calling you an idiot because of several reasons :<br>
<br>
1.) Landale was advocating 'doing nothing at all'  as in 'not invading iraq' which was clearly the 'context' of the statement, no matter how much you wish it not to be.<br>
<br>
2.) You feel that if someone is not you, their fundamental human nature is completeley, and totaly removed from yours.<br>
<br>
3.) you claim to have answered my statements, but really have not.<br>
<br>
The simplest debate failure, is to take an argument, and to miss the point, then argue that missed point.<br>
<br>
<br>
Simple. I'll boil it down to one statement that you can answer, or probably not answer.<br>
<br>
<br>
If Terrorists (those bastards) bomb america, it makes you LESS likely to want to sit and do nothing.<br>
<br>
Why is it that you expect that :<br>
<br>
If America Bomb a country, it makes people who are 'almost' terrorists MORE likely to want to sit and do nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The problem is, that you have not reversed your 'soltution' and asked if you had the same thing happen to you, how would you react? Becasuse if you did, common sense would show that you would react the exact opposite of how you expect those you wish to 'deter' to react.<br>
<br>
As for your paragraph about 'get away with as much as possible'...<br>
<br>
Don't evade the point, which I outlined, simply answer these questions...<br>
<br>
If someone is so severely pissed off at you that they are willing to kill themselves to kill you, how can you possibly detter them?<br>
<br>
If a detterent designed to stop people blowing you up, pisses so many people off so much that it makes them so angry they want to blow you up, how is that detterent solving any problems?<br>
<br>
Is what you think, and want to do more fundamental in guiding your actions than 'what you can get away with'<br>
<br>
If the answer is no, you may have prooved your own statement, but have disprooved every single persons actions that has ever lived since the dawn of man.<br>

Oh, there's lots you can do to stop their attacks:<br>
<br>
You can bring down the regime in Afghanistan which they controlled, thereby denying them any place where they can overtly train.<br>
<br>
You can kill or capture nearly 65% of their leadership.<br>
<br>
You can kill or capture 3,400 suspected operatives.<br>
<br>
You can bring down the regime you judge most likely to help them acquire the weapons that would help them accomplish their explicit goal of killing you.<br>
<br>
You can end the provocative presence of your troops in Saudi Arabia, and move those troops to where they can provide a menacing reminder to the regimes of Syria and Iran of the consequences of aiding al Qaeda.<br>
<br>
You can humiliate them repeatedly in direct ground battle.<br>
<br>
You can make the humiliation so bad that they begin to blame their less zealous Muslim brethren for their failure, and begin to target these apostates for horrible massacres as well, such as the bombings in Ankara and Riyadh.<br>
<br>
You can believe in Arab democracy.  You can help make the Arab world a place where the choices aren't between tyrannical theocracy and tyrannical despotism, but between tyrannical theocracy and the prosperous freedom which much of the world has already found.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wrinsylkenhand>Wrin Sylkenhand </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle> the fury</span><br>  Posts: 1393<br> <font color=#330000>(12/1/03 11:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=45>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hypothetical Question</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don't evade the point, which I outlined, simply answer these questions...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->'<br>

No.  And yes it proves my statment about MY views of human nature.  As your staments prove YOUR views of human nature, and on this as with most things you and I are on different sides....and I can't tell you how much easier I sleep at night knowing that my thought patterns are so radically different than yours.<br>
<br>
Now answer my questions.  If you think you can do something, but are not TOTALY sure, and you are not even totally sure that you acutally care, and the  10 persons that try it before you get the shit kicked out of them because they tried it, you are saying that you would still try it?<br>

<br>
That's what I said.  I didn't say don't do anything.  The reason there are so many terrorists is because of our foreign policy.  There will always be terrorists but what we're doing now is multiplying them a lot.  <br>
<br>
And note I said &quot;Less likely.&quot;  As I said, terrorists hate us because of how we have to have our goddamn hand in everything going on in the world.  If we stopped friggin sticking our noses into everything, there would probably be less terrorists, which is what I'm saying.<br>
<br>
I never said don't do anything.  As I said, the world doesn't know what it wants from us.  There's always someone in the world that wants help from us but we'll end up pissing someone off.  <br>
<br>
What's the right course of action?  I wish I knew 100%.  But I'm not a political science major and I really don't keep up with politics as well as some others here.  You can only make a truly right decision with 100% information and knowledge, which will never be possible.  I guess it's called trial and error.  If we find a massive increase in terror attacks after doing this, then maybe we should back off and see what happens.

My view is that what we are doing now is decreasing them.<br>

And, shock!, we disagree.  We could talk about it till the end of time (and that may also be something we could disagree on) and it is very unlikely that either of us would change our view on the situation.  Our view is just that, our view.<br>

Before I begin, though...<br>
<br>
I'm intentionally trying not to be confrontational with you. I'm not making these points to say, 'hey, you're wrong, nanafufu, so there...&quot;, but rather to point out things that you didn't say and may not have thought about. I'm not the enemy here, so you shouldn't be surprised if there are parts of my response that agree with you.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lets look at that :<br>
1.) Iraq had massive stock piles of weapons<br>
2.) It's fairly accurate to assume that the full focus of the US intelligence gathering operations was on Iraq at the time. If it wasn't, then I'll point out the 'Incompetence' bit.<br>
3.) Colin Powel presented Information at the Security council about Chemical Trailors and Telephone conversations. For this evidence to be accurate, you need effective human Sources in Iraq.<br>
4.) A Weapons program the size that Iraq allegedly possesed could not be effectivley 'Buried in the desert without anyone knowing' it was too big. It wasn't just one barrel to bury on a sunday afternoon, we're talking thousands of tonnes of stuff at the very least. To not even be able to trace one single barrel of chemical weaponry under the microscope of a major Intelligence operation is how likely exactly? All the evidence that was gained directly on any hide operation was a sattelite image of one small bunker that had supposedly been cleaned.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
<br>
1. Massive compared to what? Certainly a significant amount, but if you're meaning &quot;impossible to hide due to sheer volume&quot;, I'd have to disagree.<br>
<br>
2. U.S. intelligence is everywhere, all the time. There's no such thing as &quot;full focus&quot; on Iraq, since they're watching many dozens of places worldwide on a constant basis. <br>
<br>
3. True but doesn't support any particular point. Yes, we had ground intelligence in Iraq. Apparently an insufficient amount. I'd imagine gathering intelligence by a country with a history of antagonism, to use against an authoritarian regime already in place, would be a daunting task regardless of competence. It's not like we have Eye of Zomm or anything. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
4. I haven't seen any indication of absolute size of any WMD stockpile. All the references I've seen were qualitative, not quantitative. I can't agree or disagree with your conclusion that it must be &quot;thousands of tonnes of stuff at the very least&quot;, as any estimate on my part would be a WAG.<br>
<br>

<br>
So it's okay with you if U.S. planes get shot down enforcing the NFZ? Taking out airstrips and radar installations had nothing to do with public opinion, and everything to do with force preservation. Asking patrolling forces not to defend themselves seems a bit incredulous.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Re-read the point about the Camp, and then demonstrate how this particular concern is unjustifed.

<br>
I'm having trouble parsing this. The original assertion was that Iraqis were not using bases within the northern NFZ, and my response was that they were in fact being used to further subjugate a significant minority in the country. It was a long reply, so my response was a bit clipped.<br>
<br>

Um, maybe because they didn't exist at the scientists' homes?<br>

I snipped the part about media hype, because I didn't follow what you were trying to say. Sorry for that.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I have pointed out a logical pattern in events that led up to the war, tried to show how, and why that evidence does not make sense, how that evidence is the pillar in the justifcation for the war, how that evidence itself either by accident, or by design was given undue precedence in the justification for the war, then drawing that conclusions. You'll actually find, that I have not assumed any peice of information is 'true or false', just whether it makes sense with what has been said, not by the press, but the US administration.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Whether or not this is true, the point I was making was that the evidence we've seen to date is sketchy at best, and that making conclusions such as &quot;the administration lied&quot;, or &quot;this war was totally unjustified&quot;, are specious if based only on the evidence that's been released publicly. <br>
<br>
You said in your original post that you had little confidence in the veracity of the evidence publicly released to date, but then immediately based your conclusions on this very same evidence that you've disabused. My response was a polite way of saying, &quot;ok, which is it?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This is a nice argumentative deflection, what I am attempting to point out, is that 'Saddam being a bastard' was not a prominent justification compared to some of the other points.

<br>
That's a distinction without a difference. No one's ever said &quot;this is the one and only reason to get Saddam&quot;, so relative emphasis is meaningless.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Seeing as I'm specifically talking about things happening in the run up to the war and not things that happened 10 years ago (unless relevant), using this particular sentence to show how I'm wrong isn't a valid point.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's all relevant. Making temporal distinctions like these are meaningless, since justifications for action go back not only to Gulf War I, but to the coup that brought the Baath party to power. The West has botched relations for at least the last 60 years, and we're reaping what we sowed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Terrorism and it's relationship with Iraq was one of the main points listed as justification for the war.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
True, but Saddam's link to terrorism need not go through Al-qaeda. That seemed to be a common red herring -- we'd identified Al-qaeda so strongly with organized terrorism that there seemed to be a need to link any terrorist activity to them. In Saddam's case, that's not necessary.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'd agree with you there, that would make sense.

You're asking the same questions many have asked in the States.  I don't have an answer any more than anyone else. I'm not sure how that morphs into &quot;we should have just left him alone&quot;, though.<br>

<br>
There's a distinct difference between having the theoretical capability, and being a practical threat. NK is not (yet, anyway) a practical threat to the U.S. mainland. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why is North Korea not worse than Iraq?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because NK to date doesn't have the power to reliably export terrorism regionally, and don't represent the same threat that Iraq did.<br>

That's not to say that I supported the attack on Iraq. <br>

I'm just upset that you're taking my words and twisting them around to make it seem as though I don't want to do anything.  What you're giving the impression of is that you think I'm saying that we should do nothing at all.  That we should let them bomb us and shoot us and we should just sit there and take it.  I never said do nothing at all, I said do not INVADE.  You're totally focusing on the &quot;don't&quot; and not &quot;invade&quot;, which is the action that I think is increasing the number of terrorists.  <br>
<br>
Yes, we disagree, but don't twist my words to make them something you can argue with.  Don't stretch so far as to whip out a dictionary and start substituting words, trying to find some hidden depth in my opinion.  When I say &quot;don't invade&quot; in that sentence, I meant it literally to be &quot;don't invade&quot;.  The way you're arguing you're saying that I said &quot;Do nothing at all&quot; and that's wrong and you know it.  I never said to do nothing at all, there are other possibilities than just invading every country you know =/.<br>

All I'll say is this: using my own personal beliefs and morals, I would have invaded because I'm that kind of person.  I believe that everyone has a right to life and that no asshole dictator should take that away.  But I also think we handled the situation very poorly with the rest of the world with this &quot;Fuck what you think&quot; attitude we are so easy to use.  I'm happy Saddam is out of power, I'm happy his crazy-ass sons are dead.  I'm not happy about the 400 soldiers we've lost or the fact that we spit in the face of the world.  Yeah, we exposed France and Russia for being assholes, but that's it.  <br>
<br>
We just need to wake up and start realizing we're a part of the world, not the leaders of it.  We can't just go invading SOVEREIGN countries just cause they've got an asshole leader.  It makes us look like assholes and the terrorists will be more likely to attack.  You have a &quot;Bring em on&quot; attitude that you share with bush.

I do not believe that either way would have been better overall.  <br>
<br>
When I say if we invade that terrorists will multiply, I mean that we will kill hundreds of people whose sons and daughters will probably grow up hating America for making them fatherless.  For every one terrorist you kill, you have the potential of making another 2.<br>
<br>
Also, have you heard what we're doing over there now?  If there's even a rumor about a possible terrorist cell or something like that in a place, they bomb the shit outta it, even if there are innocents there.  This is how far we're willing to go and I guarantee the terrorists are willing to go another foot farther.  I believe that we are multiplying terrorists.  (and before you call bullshit on what we're doing, I have a buddy over there in Iraq right now that I chat with whenever I can, he is the one that told me this)<br>
<br>
To answer your question I don't know what I would have done, ok?  You wanna hear that?  I'm sure you do.  I don't know, ok?  I don't have all the information and therefore cannot have made any kind of rational conclusion about it.  A situation like this is very precarious and requires information that I do not have.  Were I to go purely on instinct and my morals and feelings, I would have invaded, which you obviously didn't read in my last post.  But the situation is MUCH MUCH more complicated than a simple &quot;feeling.&quot;  I wish it were that easy, but it isn't.<br>
<br>
I can, however, tell you what I wouldn't do though.  I wouldn't snub my nose at the world, stumble around trying to get a gov't in place in Iraq, and scream &quot;Bring it on!&quot; bravely behind a podium 10,000 miles away from the action while the troops that I sent over there are over there dying by the dozens. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=113883">Landale Palemoon (THE KING OF PANTS!!!)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
I read it and figured it was a typo based on your other posts.<br>
<br>
Thank you for answering my question.<br>
<br>
Yes I too have friends over there right now.  I have more friends going over in Feb, to replace the friends that are over there now. Innocent causalities are an unfortunate cost of war. <br>
<br>
As far in information, may I suggest you go and read the UN resolutions. <p>Wrin ~Benevolent princess of the Bouncy Grrlz
