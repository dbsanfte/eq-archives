<br>
By Rush Limbaugh: <br>
<br>
I think the vast differences in compensation between victims of the September 11 casualty and those who die serving the country in Uniform are profound. No one <br>
is really talking about it either, because you just don't criticize anything having to do with September 11. Well, I just can't let the numbers pass by <br>
because it says something really disturbing about the entitlement mentality of this country. If you lost a family member in the September 11 attack, you're going <br>
to get an average of $1,185,000. The range is a minimum guarantee of $250,000, all the way up to $4.7 million. <br>
<br>
If you are a surviving family member of an American soldier killed in action, the first check you get is a $6,000 direct death benefit, half of which is taxable. <br>
<br>
Next, you get $1,750 for burial costs. If you are the surviving spouse, you get $833 a month until you remarry. And there's a payment of $211 per month for <br>
each child under 18. When the child hits 18, those payments come to a screeching halt. <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that some of the people who are getting <br>
an average of $1.185 million up to $4.7 million are complaining that it's not enough. Their deaths were tragic, but for most, they were simply in the wrong <br>
place at the wrong time. Soldiers put themselves in harms way FOR ALL OF US, and they and their families know the dangers. <br>
<br>
We also learned over the weekend that some of the victims from the Oklahoma City bombing have started an organization asking for the same deal that the <br>
September 11 families are getting. In addition to <br>
that, some of the families of those bombed in the embassies are now asking for compensation as well. <br>
<br>
You see where this is going, don't you? Folks, this is part and parcel of over 50 years of entitlement politics in this country. It's just really sad. <br>
Every time a pay raise comes up for the military, they usually receive next to nothing of a raise. Now the green machine is in combat in the Middle East while their families have to survive on food stamps and live <br>
in low-rent housing. Make sense? <br>
<br>
 <br>
However, our own U.S. Congress just voted themselves a raise, and many of you don't know that they only have to be in Congress one time to receive a pension that is more than $15,000 per month, and most are now equal to being millionaires plus. They also do not receive Social Security on retirement because they didn't have to pay into the system. <br>
<br>
If some of the military people stay in for 20 years and get out as an E-7, you may receive a pension of $1,000 per month, and the very people who placed you <br>
in harm's way receive a pension of $15,000 per month. <br>
I would like to see our elected officials pick up a weapon and join ranks before they start cutting out benefits and lowering pay for our sons and daughters <br>
who are now fighting. <br>
<br>
&quot;When do we finally do something about this?&quot; If this doesn't seem fair to you, it is time to forward this to as many people as you can.If your interested there <br>
is more....................... <br>
<br>
This must be a campaign issue in 2004. Keep it going. <br>
SOCIAL SECURITY: (This is worth the read. It's short and to the point.) <br>
<br>
Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during election years. Our Senators and Congressmen do not pay into Social Security. Many years ago they voted <br>
in their own benefit plan. In more recent ears,no congressperson has felt the need to change it. For all practical purposes their plan works like this: <br>
<br>
When they retire, they continue to draw the same pay until they die, except it may increase from time to time for cost of living adjustments. For example,former Senator Byrd and Congressman White and their wives may expect to draw $7,800,000 - that's Seven <br>
Million, Eight Hundred Thousand), with their wives drawing $275,000.00 during the last years of their lives. <br>
<br>
This is calculated on an average life span for each. <br>
<br>
Their cost for this excellent plan is $00.00. These <br>
little perks they voted for themselves is free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan. <br>
<br>
The funds for this fine retirement plan come directly <br>
from the General Fund--our tax dollars at work! From our own Social Security Plan, which you and I pay (or have paid) into -- every payday until we retire <br>
(which amount is matched by our employer) --we can expect to get an average $1,000 per month after retirement. Or, in other words, we would have to collect our average of $1,000 monthly benefits for 68 years and one month to equal Senator Bill Bradley's benefits! <br>
<br>
Social Security could be very good if only one small change were made. And that change would be to jerk the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under the Senators and Congressmen. Put them into the Social Security plan with the rest of us and then watch how fast they would fix it. <br>
<br>
If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve. WE, each one of us... can make a difference.. <br>

WTF are the families of the victims of Sep 11th getting money for?  1 million?!  Shit, that could last me the rest of my life just sticking it in my student savings account (with like a 2-3% interest rate) lol.  That's kinda stupid.  Don't get me wrong, I mourn the deaths of those people every year.  Knowing that I will never have the chance to know them, knowing that the kids in that building won't have the life I have, it just sucks and I hate it.  But come on, 1 million on AVERAGE?!  And who the fuck is getting 4 million?!  I mean, ok, a little compensation would be nice for something like that, but COME ON.  ONE MILLION!?  Our military people ought to be paid that much for the services they render.  Though I myself would never join, I do support them.  This country is gimpy atm.  That's all I can say.  Where employees can vote for their own pay raises (oh yeah, which congressman is gonna vote no to that shit eh?).  <br>
<br>
It's just gimp.  The hardworking little guy always gets the shaft while the rich just get richer for doing less than the little guy.  As much as I love capitalism, it really can suck sometimes. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=113883">Landale Palemoon (Primary Gear, WITH NEW AND IMPROVED PANTS!)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
But where is this money coming from?  Isn't a lot of the financial support towards &quot;9-11 families&quot; coming from donations?  If so, then the big gap can be explained by the overwhelming publicity that the 9-11 victims got.<br>
<br>
If anyone's complaining that a $1 million donation isn't enough, then I say it's about time to dispel the holiness that surrounds these 9-11 families.<br>
<br>
Rush Limbaugh also seemed to imply that our soldiers and their families were more deserving of money than the 9-11 families.  I doubt that.  <br>
<br>
Soldiers: Chose to risk their lives, died serving the nation<br>
9-11 victims: Didn't choose to risk their lives, didn't die serving the nation<br>
<br>
How do you decide who deserves more money?  Does money even have anything to do with it?<br>
<br>
The overpayment of Congress members seems corrupt to me, but it really isn't anything new.  Leaders should never be paid more than followers.  The only reason why leaders are overpaid is because they control the money. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168753"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://i.xanga.com/zniffynifty/Rasc-sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I mean technically a soldier that dies in the battlefield falls under this condition, but at least these soldiers risk their lives day in and day out.

<br>
The people that died on 9/11 did so in a very tragic way and that is sad but it in no way measures up to the death of a military person who gives their life so that we may live the lives we do.<br>

The fact is, our military personnel get shit for pay and benefits, with alot of the obscure benefits not having been updated since Vietnam.  Their heroes not only for fighting for their country, but for the fact they sacrifice financial well-being as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.showPrevMessage?topicID=33.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.showNextMessage?topicID=33.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.emailToFriend?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.threadControl?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=33.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub228.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="xevserverboardsfrm1">General Discussion<option value="xevserverboardsfrm7">Marketplace<option value="xevserverboardsfrm2">Raiding<option value="xevserverboardsfrm16">Poll Mania<option value="xevserverboardsfrm4">Epic Quests<option value="xevserverboardsfrm13">Trade Skills<option value="xevserverboardsfrm3">Tactics<option value="xevserverboardsfrm5">Questing<option value="xevserverboardsfrm9">Looking for Guild<option value="xevserverboardsfrm12">Guild Leading and Officership<option value="xevserverboardsfrm11">Guild Link Submission<option value="xevserverboardsfrm6">Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm26">Political Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm10">/ooc<option value="xevserverboardsfrm21">Rant Polls<option value="xevserverboardsfrm19">Archives<option value="xevserverboardsfrm15">Moderators Forum<option value="xevserverboardsfrm23">Über<option value="xevserverboardsfrm27">Ask the Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards>Xev Server Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26>Political Rants</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
