The Eagles</span><hr size=1> Taken in context, Rush, who has been all over the NFL for the fact that they FINED Detroit for $200,000 for NOT HIRING A BLACK COACH (gasp the team hired a white one), this is more about the NFL culture and the media and less about McNabb.<br>
<br>
I too am an eagles fan.<br>
<br>
McNabb sucks, and in Philly we let him know that we feel that way.  McNabb has been over-rated by the national media for sometime now.<br>
<br>
I do not think that Rush was saying that McNabb got or keeps his job because he is black, just that the media is over-hyping him because of that reason.  <br>
<br>
I don't agree with that assessment, though I have NO clue why he has been ranked as high as he has been. <br>
<br>
The NFL does has some race policy problems.  Part of the policies are due to being threatened to be sued by a certain famous lawyer whose name begins with a J, and who was instrumental in throwing race into the mix to get a certain murderous ex-football player off the hook.  <br>
<br>
But hey what do we expect from the NFL, if that same lawyer was coming after you, I am sure you would be asking how high he intended to raise that bar you have to jump. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/Barnes101/sordiaspear.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morriganx>Morriganx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#330000>(10/2/03 6:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.admin.mtu.edu/urel/breaking/2002/images/flag.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rush Vs.

<br>
If you think Donovan McNabb is so good try this on for size.  When McNabb got hurt with like 4 or 5 games left in the season last year the backup QB stepped in and went undefeated, then he got hurt and the 3rd string QB stepped in and *gasp* went undefeated.  Then their 1st game in the playoffs McNabb says he is ready to play so he starts and plays the whole game and *gasp* guess what happens, they lose.  All that showed is that the  good record of the Eagles last year didn't mean dick in regards with McNabb.  Don't get me wrong I think he is a decent QB especially with his running threat, but HE IS OVER RATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

Yeah, I used listen to them because they were great up until the Black Self Titled albumn (Enter Sandman).  I don't listen to em much anymore, I didn't even know they had a new albumn out until a few minutes ago so I now have all but St. Anger.  Load and Reload blew, for a while I thought they were going country on me.  Garage Inc. has a couple good ones in there.  S&amp;M was kinda neat, but ultimately prefer the original songs.

<br>
Something I meant to say in my first post (but yesterday was rought and I was teh tired).  I still think Rush was wrong about the media overhyping McNabb because he's black.<br>
<br>
At the same time, Rush is ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION, AND CAN FREELY STATE IT IN THIS COUNTRY.  WTF is this happy horseshit that any time someone's opinion &quot;offends&quot; someone, they have to apologize for it?  Grow a pair and fight back with facts if you don't agree with the opinion.<br>
<br>
I personally don't even think it was racist.  He didn't say McNabb was bad because he's black.  He said the MEDIA (which if I recall has all sorts of colors in their little liberal world) is overhyping him because he's black and they want him to succeed.  I don't buy it, but no way this is racist.<br>

<br>
Rush has a history of making race part of issues that may or may not be race related. But I think the sports media also does have a history of finding minority players in any number of sports and giving them decent face time. Most or all have been exceptional players, though. You hear that, though ... 'first african-american this' 'first hispanic this', if sports are so colorblind, why do you hear these things at all? Race is wrongfully part of the issue in sports because of both sides of the fence. Not just Rush. In the case in specific? I don't know, but I lean toward, 'I don't think so.' I consider myself a good guage - I don't follow any sports (outside of auto racing... yah yeah, throw your yuks) because if I've heard about them, chances are they're either REALLY REALLY good or they're getting a ton of media treatment (or both).<br>
<br>
An anecdote I heard not too long back was about an announcer that was attempting to be PC said that during an international event, that the winner was 'the first African-American' to win on the German team. Now WTF is an american doing playing on the German side?<br>
<br>
It's likely not true. I couldn't find anything to back it up online (though I couldn't find anything on snopes to the contrary), but it's very believable in this day and age of political correctness to think such a thing happened. That, I think, speaks volumes.<br>

The Eagles</span><hr size=1> Sure Rush is entitled to his opinion, I'll totally agree there.  I just think his comment was boneheaded.  Also he's being paid by a network that is owned by a company that donates large sums of money to the Democratic party (They give to the Republicans also, but not near as much as the Demos).  Common sense says you try not to say something that pisses people off, especially if they are signing your pay check.  Rush should have just said &quot;The Eagles defense has carried this team for three years now, and McNabb received a lot of undeserved credit for his teams success.&quot;  Or something along those lines.  But no, he saw an opportunity to attack the &quot;liberal media&quot; and he just could not resist.  That's where he fucked up.<br>
<br>
Also Chiana, you bring up many good points.  Yes the media does bring race up a lot in American sports.  America in my opinion is still a very racist country (racists are not just white people), and race dominates much of this country's domestic history (unfortunatly).  That is why such things are brought up.  I think it's something we have struggled with in the past and still struggle with today.  People denounce Political Correctness, which I myself am not too crazy over, but fail to realize why this correctness exists.  It's not because we are a diverse nation, but it's because we are haunted by our nation's struggle with race.<br>
