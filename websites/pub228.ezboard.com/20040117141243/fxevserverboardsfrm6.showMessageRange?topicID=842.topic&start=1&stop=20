SCANDAL OF THE CAMP X-RAY TRIALS <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Jul 6 2003<br>
<br>
 <br>
Before British al-Qaeda suspects are even tried Death Chamber is being built<br>
 <br>
By Barry Wigmore<br>
 <br>
  <br>
IN a stark, sterile room in a windowless concrete block is a padded chair, with straps for arms, legs and waist.<br>
<br>
Next to it is the equipment that will control the drugs used to kill the person on it.<br>
<br>
This is the fate that awaits the two Britons held at Camp Delta, formerly X-ray, Cuba, if found guilty of being al-Qaeda terrorists after a secret trial before a military tribunal.<br>
<br>
Work is under way already to build the Death Chamber.<br>
<br>
The US government has decided it will be an exact copy of the one pictured here in which Oklahoma bomber Timothy McVeigh was put to death last year at Terre Haute Federal Prison in Indiana.<br>
<br>
In the US base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the method of death will be lethal injection.<br>
<br>
Prosecutors, defence lawyers, judge, jury, and executioner will all be from the US military.<br>
<br>
And the condemned men will have no right of appeal to any other court.<br>
<br>
As the storm grew yesterday over the revelation that Britons Moazzam Begg and Feroz Abbasi are on a list of six alleged al-Qaeda members picked by President Bush to be the first to stand trial before military tribunals, a Sunday Mirror investigation revealed that plans have been finalised for Guantanamo to be turned into a top-security death camp.<br>
<br>
The island base - known as GITMO - has been chosen because it is a virtually impenetrable fortress, and it is outside the reach of American civil courts.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
HELD: British student Feroz Abbasi<br>
<br>
The only other military Death Row is at the new Fort Leavenworth jail in Kansas, which was built last year. Leavenworth is also a copy of the Terre Haute facility, which was built 10 years ago when the US government - as opposed to individual states - resumed executions.<br>
<br>
But terrorist suspects, called &quot;unlawful combatants&quot;, will not be taken to Leavenworth because it is on the US mainland and puts them within reach of civil courts and the long appeals process.<br>
<br>
In fact, even their defence lawyer will be from the US military, and it is likely to be US Air Force Colonel Will Gunn, 44.<br>
<br>
He said yesterday: &quot;The job is not a position that I relish, from the standpoint of being perceived as the bad guy, but I'd rather look at it as an opportunity to both serve my country and also to serve human beings.&quot;<br>
<br>
So Guantanamo Bay would seem to be the perfect choice. The building contract was awarded last month to the US company Kellog, Brown &amp; Root, a Houston-based subsidiary of oil and construction giant Haliburton - which was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney before he became President Bush's right-hand man in the White House.<br>
<br>
Work is due to be completed by June next year.<br>
<br>
The £7.8million contract, called Task Order 0038, is part of a huge GITMO expansion scheme. As well as the execution chamber, and a death row cell-block, it will include an adjoining building for a new custom-built jail for long-term prisoners convicted of terrorism by American military tribunals. US military records stipulate only that the total building bill must not exceed $300million.<br>
<br>
President Bush last year praised Brown &amp; Root's team of 199 Filipino workers for the fast and efficient way they built GITMO's Camp Delta, a range of cells in concrete buildings that took over from the wire cages of Camp X-ray.<br>
<br>
Today Delta houses nearly 680 prisoners. Begg, a 35-year-old father of four, from Birmingham, and Abbasi, 23, a computer operator, from South London, are among them.<br>
<br>
The pair have been held for more than a year in what have been described as &quot;inhuman&quot; conditions in caged camps, first in Afghanistan and then in Cuba.<br>
<br>
Seven other Britons are also detained at GITMO. No decision has yet been made on whether they will face military trials.<br>
<br>
But for Begg and Abbasi, time could be running out.<br>
<br>
They will be &quot;tried&quot; in &quot;courts&quot; which are nothing more than spruced up old offices on another part of the 45 square mile outpost. It has been leased from Cuba since 1903, to Fidel Castro's frustration.<br>
<br>
Most civilian legal observers believe the result is a foregone conclusion - Begg and Abbasi will be found guilty. If they are condemned to die, President Bush, as joint forces commander-in-chief, must approve their death sentence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<br>
<br>
There is little doubt that he will. As Texas governor he signed 151 death warrants, and reprieved only one man.<br>
<br>
For the Britons, the end is likely to come quickly after that. There will be no protracted legal battle with 10 or 15 years of appeals as there is in civilian courts on the US mainland. Those avenues are blocked to Guantanamo prisoners.<br>
<br>
Next stop will be &quot;Old Sleepy&quot; as the execution gurney has been nicknamed. Begg, arrested 17 months ago, has written to his wife Sally that he wishes he could end it all.<br>
<br>
Mrs Begg, who was pregnant at the time of the arrest and has given birth to a son her husband has never seen, said: &quot;He's such a loving, family man and knowing his children had no father was tearing him apart.<br>
<br>
&quot;He told me he wished he could end it all there and then.&quot;<br>
<br>
And his father Azmat added: &quot;We know Moazzam is innocent and we want him back home here with his family where he belongs. We have prayed for that for almost a year now, and we will continue to pray for it every day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lethal injection was first used in the United States in a civilian execution in 1982 as a humane alternative to the electric chair and hanging. Both had been criticised for mistakes which caused several lingering, painful deaths.<br>
<br>
The last US military execution was at Fort Leavenworth in 1961 of a soldier convicted of raping an 11-year-old girl.<br>
<br>
In a bid to ensure every death goes smoothly, the US government has drawn up a 56-page instruction book, called the Death Row Protocol. Designed for civilian use, it is also the model for military executions, which are likely to be a little more streamlined. The protocol details everything from the last meal to which spiritual advisors can see the condemned prisoner, and who will witness the death.<br>
<br>
In civilian executions that is usually about 30 people, including the condemned's family and lawyers, victims' relatives, and newspaper and TV reporters. They look into the execution chamber through three large windows.<br>
<br>
But it was not clear last night if any outsiders will be allowed to go to GITMO to witness military executions.<br>
<br>
Begg will be escorted into the room and strapped down on the gurney by volunteers, probably drawn from military police stationed at GITMO at the time.<br>
<br>
He will be allowed to have a Muslim cleric with him if he desires. But it is likely to be one of the US military's handful of Imams who work a rotation at GITMO, rather than a cleric of his own choosing.<br>
<br>
Death should be quick, painless, and relatively peaceful. It took McVeigh less than five minutes to die. One witness said: &quot;It simply looked as though he fell asleep.&quot;<br>
<br>
But critics say there is no perfect way to humanely execute a person. Death penalty expert Prof Michael Radelet, chairman of the sociology department at Florida University, said: &quot;We've had about 22 lethal injection cases now where it's taken over half an hour to find a good vein.&quot;<br>
<br>
Under current rules only non-American citizens, such as the Britons, may be tried by military tribunals.<br>
<br>
The other Britons held in Guantanamo Bay are Shafiq Rasul, 24, Asif Iqbal, 20, Ruhal Ahmed, 20, all from Tipton, West Midlands; Martin Mubanga, 29, Richard Belmar, 23, and Tarek Dergoul, 24, all from London; and Jamal Udeen, 35, of Manchester.<br>
<br>
The US Justice Department caused a storm earlier this year when it proposed that the Attorney General could strip people of their US citizenship so they could be tried and executed at GITMO.<br>

its not a concentration camp or a death camp. its what is called a prison. many prisons have death rows and execution chambers.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thedosiusdreamtwister>Thedosius Dreamtwister</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.rogers.com/shadowgovernment01/thedhead.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 230<br> <font color=#330000>(7/11/03 4:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=842.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camp X-Ray</span><hr size=1> Uh huh.<br>

Nobody made mention that these where the people of the same organization that MURDERED 3700+ Men Women and Children (i know there were more than the official numbers) in the World Trade Center attacks.  Now you people have the balls to stand up and say, oh ah..they're not being fucking nice to those terroristic assholes.  How about this.  Lets haul over a female firing squad from that raghead country that they came from. Let those women shoot their collective asses.  Then we take the bodies and put them in some high rise building that we're going to destroy and then ship them back the home land in pieces.  <br>
<br>
We owe those fuckers NOTHING. Have you people forgot.  We werent at war with them.  They got picked up as terrorists.  They're no better than the palestinian car bombers.  At least i have a tiny bit of respect for the palestinians.  They're fighting for a land they lost.  But the Al'Queda fucks...they just like to kill for killings sake.   <br>
<br>
Better yet. since they have this thing about pigs.  Remember the scene in the movie Snatch.  Kill the fucks, the cheapest way possible.  Then feed their asses to the pigs.  That way you know they'll never get to heaven.  They'll just come out being what they always were.  Just big pile of pigshit.<br>
