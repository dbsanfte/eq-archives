You asked for an intelligent response.  I gave you one.  Your profanity laden remarks directed at me as a person was your only response.  Which, makes everything you have ever said on this board devoid of validity. Because when it comes down to it, your only defense to intelligent debate can possibly be &quot;waste of fucking skin.&quot;<br>

You asked for an intelligent response. I gave you one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bzzt. What you gave were some snapshots of what they were doing when they were our buddies.<br>
<br>
What I'm curious is what the criteria for accepting that the statements prior to this latest conflict being incorrect would be.<br>
<br>
The statements were not &quot;they used 'em in 1988'. If that had been the rationale, then your post would have been relevant.<br>
<br>
I totally accept that you hold the *belief* that if we had not invaded they would have done it again. That's fine! I'm not addressing that.<br>
<br>
I don't care what you believe now. I don't care if you believe they had them, or they didn't have them.<br>
<br>
What I'm asking is: whatever your belief, what criteria, if any, would you accept as proof you were wrong.<br>
<br>
It's a wholly seperate, unrelated question and your continued failure to grasp that is baffling in it's idiocy.<br>
<br>
now. try. again.<br>
<br>
And if I call you stupid it's because you failed to fucking read the question before you answered.   <p><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=187472>Shadowleaf Silentfall</a>,

If he says &quot;If bush admits it was false I will accept it&quot; as his only criteria for being proved wrong, that's fine<br>
<br>
If he has no criteria for being proved wrong, that's fine too.<br>
<br>
What is not fine is taking an attempt to get people to think about their preconceptions, and using it to trot out the same tired old shit that doesn't have a fucking thing to do with the question in the first place.<br>
<br>
But to see someone whining about people getting flamed for doing stupid shit in rant is worth a laugh. <br>

<br>
For Iraq to first be believed to have WMD's, they must have, at some point, used WMD's in the past (see picture above)<br>
<br>
This proves they have the capability of manufacturing WMD's and the penchant for using them.  Personally, I don't think that you make one VX gas bomb and use it and then say &quot;Oh goodness, I just killed 5000 innocent people!  Oops!&quot; and never make any again.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it is likely that more were manufactured.  And would have been used had nobody intervened (I don't need to remind you that Iraq has effectively been monitored by the international community since 1991).<br>
<br>
The question is more, did Iraq remove it's weapons of mass destruction between 1991 and 2003?  Perhaps.  But it would be terribly irresponsible not to at least try and find them and destroy them.  And if we don't find any (to directly answer your question), it would still not prove that I am wrong, because it's not a question that can be answered in terms of black and white.<br>
<br>
Effectively, I just took your post one step further.  What you asked was &quot;What would prove to me that I was wrong?&quot;  Honestly?  Nothing, due to the above.  All I said is that if we had decided that we were wrong, and never went to Iraq to find WMD's...how long would it have been before Saddam Hussien proved we were right?<br>
<br>
And to me that is relevant.  I am sorry you don't think so, but you are entitled to your opinion and I respect it. <p>Tyan Ukvel'Usphlith<br>

<br>
That's the answer I was looking for.<br>
<br>
I don't give a flying fuck *why* you are convinced you are right.<br>
<br>
The critical point was there's no criteria that could possibly convince you that you're wrong.<br>

Actual stockpiles of parts that could be turned into NBC weapons, but not just evidence of progarms that could possibly be geared to producing them at some later date.(neither of which have been found, might I add).<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
It is somewhat depressing that you get this much outrage for asking what I think ws a pretty simple and level-headed question.  The flaming may be a bit much, but oh well.<br>
Perhaps you should add a third option :<br>
3) It doesn't matter if they had WMD's becasue the United States invaded and whipped their towel-head asses! Huah!<br>

<br>
Firstly it has been posted by a spanner who is spamming the boards with the same old shit in every thread.<br>
<br>
Secondly this is a contentious topic with a lot of strong views held by political hard liners with both extremes of the political spectrum having already been very vocal on the subject for the last two years.<br>
<br>
Thirdly we've discussed the topic before.  We already know Aal is pro war, and we're now well aware that Sleaf is anti war.<br>
<br>
Personaly i'm anti anything American.<br>
<br>
None of this is new to xevserver readers.<br>
<br>
Now a rant about peridot's in Magelo profiles, that would be original.  Crap i'll grant you, but original.<br>

<br>
As said before many times. Repeated here. This isn't a debate about what you believe. It is a question about what, if anything, would change your mind.<br>
<br>
It is simple, but apparently not simple enough for you. Mea culpa.<br>
<br>
If someone has posted this before, please point me to it and I will gladly use that.<br>
<br>
If not... shut the fuck up already you whiny little cow. Since you're clearly too dumb to read, leave the board to those who aren't.<br>

<br>
Well, yeah, but you could deduce that figure from the copious other topics.<br>
<br>
Most times people aren't at all shy about saying why they believe what they do. As shown by their repeated attempts to do so in this topic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I'm really just curious about whether or not people are coming to the debate prepared to be convinced of something the don't already believe, and if so, what will change people's minds.<br>
<br>
I don't care whether they're pro- or anti- war, believe in WMDs or not.<br>
<br>
Just really curious about the numbers.<br>
<br>
Maybe this is horrendously perverse of me. I'm just curious about how many people in the debate are actually debating vs flapping their mouths.<br>

Think about their stance, whether or not Iraq had WMD's, the invasion was not only justified, it was NECESSARY.  As you yourself stated, to debate, you must be ready to admit when you are wrong.  This stance seems to be &quot;America was right, damn it, there is no wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
As I stated in another thread, show me WMD's and I will admit that this was a justifiable war.  However, if none are produced, I cannot say that.  Furthermore, with the TIGHT watch we kept on Iraq, don't tell me they could move these weapons to other countries and we would just not notice it.  Sorry, I wouldn't believe that either, especially since the head of the FBI said TODAY that the mistake in intelligence concerning buying plutonium from Africa was HIS fault.  The whole thing stinks like yesterday's dung-heap, and until I see WMD's, IN IRAQ, that were actually a threat AND COULD HIT BRITAIN IN 45 MINUTES, this war was illegal.<br>
I said stockpiles, and I am willing to accept that, but it would be a dubious admittance that the invasion was justifiable.  As I remember it, Britain’s allegiance was largely based on that 45 minute threat.<br>
