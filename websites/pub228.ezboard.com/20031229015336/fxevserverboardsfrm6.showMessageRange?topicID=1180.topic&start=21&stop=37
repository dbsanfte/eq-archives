<br>
untrue.<br>
<br>
The rest you have got me on, of course!  Well almost...  You see, it's not my fault i'm so bloody famous that the moment I post in a thread it descends into a discussion about me.<br>
<br>
I would rather come here and debate, as I could when I first changed my main over from Pneu to Flab and not everybody knew I was the same person for a while, that was fun for a while, because for once I could discuss points objectively without the merest sight of my signiature causing an outpoor from very well qualified psychiatrists such as yourself.<br>
<br>
Of course I don't mind being tied to the history of the Pneumatic character, not in the least, infact I never tried to hide it and for a long time had both toons in my signiature, and I often spoke in SK threads and named my toon when I was posting as Pneumatic.<br>
<br>
I'm actually quite proud of the history of Pneumatic.  Somebody like Tib who only knows me through these boards, and has the generic xevserver attitude (Insults rule, but debate? What the fuck is that dictionary.com is down) is of course going to immediately think 'proud of being a [insert generic rant insult here]'.  Well I am sorry I was not there for you ingame Tib, and the rest of you.  For those who's paths I did cross i'm glad I contributed to some great times and i'm glad you where there to share it with me.  In the case of BC, well, each on an individual basis...<br>
<br>
So about the cleric epic thing Gnip and Tib have both raised in recent threads.  I was in a guild of KS'ing bastards who did indeed do the dirty on Ragefire, I left the guild over it.  They flatly deny that of course, and they also are quite happy to let me take the rap for it.  For your information: I was not there.<br>
<br>
I was so heartbroken over the events and actions surrounding that incident that I did not even bother to complete my epic for another year.  When I did, I didn't even equip it except to rez for several months, infact I only ever used it as my primary weapon after it was already common as muck, for fear that seeing me wielding an epic may upset somebody.<br>
<br>
Did anyone ever stop and wonder how that made me feel?  After having gone through a damn-sight more than most clerics to actually get the flipping thing in the first place courtesy of the actions of several xevserver rants boards members who have all since realised they where wrong [they dont admit that of course] and all now agree I did not KS my epic.  Cheers guys, I love you too.<br>
<br>
So you see Tib.  I'm quite happy to come here and be as pompous and as arrogant as I damned well like, I have earned the right to shout about how bloody good I am, and how I saved the day for some random stranger, because i'm owed a little respect that i've never damn well received.<br>
<br>
Does it really bother me?  No not in the least.  My attitude over the past may be bad, but then bad attitude is the lifeblood of this board!<br>
<br>
As for my style of play, you never witnessed it yourself, so how you think you've earned the right to comment on it i'll never know.  Why don't you ask somebody I played with regularly what I was really like and THEN come back here and try to argue I am not at least twice as good as you?<br>
<br>
I have insight into your style of play, I've seen you post endless reems of pages on your tactics of play.  You do everything pretty much technically correct, a little different to some SK's in places, but overall you play your SK the way SK's are played.  I never did.  I was also highly regarded for throwing convention away, and being just the little bit more fun to be around as a consequence.<br>
<br>
Did I wipe groups out more often?  Perhaps a little,  however most of my groups earned 3-4 times the XP that they would without me, apparently.<br>

<br>
Sorry Flabby ... that was the wrong answer.<br>
<br>
If you like, we will grant you a letter and let you try again for half the prize, however.<br>
<br>
b---<br>
<br>
There was one thing you did say, however, that you were ALMOST right on.  Yes, I DID explain the technically correct way to play a SK.  Unfortunately, you were quite mistaken on thinking I was telling you how I played my SK.  I was explaining EXACTLY that ... the technically right way to play a SK.  You were very perceptive to ALMOST figure that out.  I almost feel like I should give you a cookie.<br>
<br>
Almost.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I have to improvise.  If I was going to actually tell you how I play every time, I would have to get my own board and explain every group I have ever been in.  No thanks, I'm not going to put in that much time.  You, however, told mehow you play, and you play EXACTLY like every person I know.  Snare, hit, repeat, wait for heal.<br>
<br>
I have won LDoNs with no healer, I have been the only tank, and I have had to use all non-nuke spells.  In case you can't read, let me assure you that people HAVE come forward and said I know what I am doing ... and I have yet to see the same for you.  The fact that I am asked to join so many pickups by people that know OF me speaks for itself.  Let me tell you, I am flattered every time.  Is it my playing skill?  I doubt it... I think they just like having someone in their group that is genuinely fun to be with.<br>
Every game is a little different, and I have to adjust every time.  There have been groups in which I only would cast, there have been groups in which I would never cast.  That you think you can tie some explanation of spells to my actual playing style shows your ... not stupidity... but gullibility.<br>
I almost never wipe my group, since I will die trying to get them out first.  Usually I sound the evac and they won't go.  Nine times out of ten we kill them all.  <br>
Difference between you and me is obvious, but I will leave you to figure it out for yourself.  Trust me, Flabby, you have no right to brag about anything.<br>
<br>
Well, except your obvious lack of ability.<br>
... at a great many things.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and you play EXACTLY like every person I know. Snare, hit, repeat, wait for heal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When I am puller mobs do not need snaring because there is never a situation when there is a last mob.  I dont wait for heal, I pray my cleric is good enough to realise when it is needed, if they aren't I go ahead anyway in the knowledge the next pull may be difficult in the hope that they will learn/wake up.<br>
<br>
When I tank I use snare purely for agro as my favoured high agro spell, if there's a better snare floating about I dont.  It is rare I actually need to cast anything to get agro because my offensive gear is good for my level, infact I consider my auto-attack key to be auto-agro.<br>
<br>
If I have any confession to make at all, it is that I often forget to snare when mobs actually do run because it is quite an alien experience for me for this to happen.<br>
<br>
So there's a very brief insight for you, unfortunately it completely disproves your argument of how I used to play.  Now please, if your going to slander my play style go and find out about it first; or continue to make wild accusations in the good 'ole spirit of xev server that are, in accordance with these boards traditions, as shallow and empty as the minds reading this.<br>

And then finally it can have its own world where just like in its own mind it is the most important thing around.<br>

Or just make a board for penu/flab to ramble on all day long about what a great player it is and you would get about the same effect.

Banshee Studios is not my companies page, I work for Interaction.  It is my page.  I dont own a company.<br>
<br>
Banshee Studios is the team name of myself and my brother, it is our contribution to the internet, and a personal page for the pair of us.  All the games are free, we just do it for the fun of writting games.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Yes the page does have somewhat of a professional look and could be mistaken for a company and that's why I haven't flamed you for assuming so, this is a side effect of our success in freeware.  If you look a little deeper you will notice the pages are only .html, hardly the work of a professional company - between us we haven't a clue how to make proper database driven web pages, and dont much care.  We make games.  We like doing it.  We're famous for it.<br>

I just ask you to compare them to other freeware games and not commercial titles.<br>
<br>
Asteroids is the teams current flagship game but it is rather old now and not really an indication of where we are at, I dont like it much myself, although it is quite playable I dont find the game very addictive.<br>
<br>
Transfusion is due out imminently and will be our new flagship game as soon as I get the bansheestudios.com email workng again after moving hosts.<br>
<br>
The team are moving forward very quickly, but of course it takes between 3-6 months for the improvements to become noticeable with a finished game.<br>
<br>
Our new TerraX engine is happily running a 1.8 billion polygon world object with ~20,000 polys onscreen at over 100fps on a lowly GeForce 2 MX graphics card, compare that to binary space partitioning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The problem of course is that you wont see the potential of this system until ASpace is released, some time next summer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

so, not only can't you spell, nor can you figure out a VERY easy word puzzle, NOR can you actually rise to a challenge, you ALSO have no command of the english language, delight in taking credit for the work of others,  and the attention span of a gnat.<br>
<br>
The answer to your math puzzle is 00.<br>
Moving the first number to the back gives you 00 which doubled is still 00.<br>
