<br>
I just wanted to send an open letter to whoever it was that decided in the past few weeks that it'd be cute to undercut the market on solstice robe prices.<br>
<br>
The robe is only useful for the xanthe/solstice quest. Customers either need a robe, or they don't. Nobody is sitting out there waiting for our prices to hit a magic number and then they'll buy... it's not like &quot;BD 2500&quot;, pass, &quot;BD 2000&quot;, pass, &quot;BD 1500&quot;, now I'll buy that instead of farming em myself. The market is limited to the people who are doing the quests, and the supply is likewise limited to no more than a dozen tailors willing to put in the time to make these for resale.<br>
<br>
Sure, by being 50pp cheaper than others, if someone plans to buy a robe anyway and they check /bazaar, you'll probably pick up more sales than the people you're undercutting. But those people -- myself and several other high level tailors that I talk to occasionally and have (as far as I know) an amicable relationship with -- will generally give a mental shrug and match your price. We like all being at the same price, because then our share of the buying public is fair... it's either random luck, or where you choose to set up shop, or perhaps buyers who've dealt with you before or prefer dealing with one guild over another, etc. Customers need robes, and all of us holding the same price will eventually sell robes.<br>
<br>
Start undercutting prices, and everyone else drops to match. Now, personally, I think that 3k was a fair price for the time, up front costs, and skill involved. But hey, if you don't that's fine. Is 2750 fair? 2500? Cause I'm here to tell you, I can sell these suckers at 1k and still make a profit. Do you really want your little undercut -&gt; price match -&gt; undercut war to end you up at 1k for robes?<br>
<br>
Customers who read that might be thinking &quot;holy *&amp;%^ she makes money at 1k and I've been payin 3?&quot; Well, yes. But my skill is 228... tailors in the 190s barely break even at 3k, and 188 is a reasonable skill to start working on robes. I don't want to ruin the market for them by indulging the pricewar dude who's been running around lately. And even though, yeah, I make nice money at 3k, I do think it's a fair price for my time. (I also do free combines with materials provided, so it's not like I'm trying to fleece anyone, just charging for the convenience factor.)<br>
<br>
Looking into my crystal ball, I can tell you what's likely to happen if the pricewar continues. I want 242 skill desperately, so I can make my Tunarean armor. I want 250 so I'll be set to go on the new stuff with PoP. Robes are my easiest route to this, because I won't pay inflated bazaar prices for acrylia ingredients (again, I have the cash and the success rates, but I won't teach sellers that it's ok to fleece tailors). I can forsee muling off all my robes rather than take the time to play headgames with whoever's undercutting prices. When I get filled up and/or when I hit 250, there's gonna be one big 'ol sale on robes. Even while trying to be a responsible tradesman and telling customers that this is a one-time deal to get rid of the inventory that got me to 250, I bet folks (especially those kit makers who are our best customers, eh?) will start saying &quot;robes are only worth 1k&quot;... and then where will you be?<br>
<br>
I really had the urge here to say &quot;wanna play games? I guarantee you that you'll lose&quot;. I could buy components and give robes away FREE to get to 250 if I really wanted to. But as much as the little undercutting games irritate me, I really truly don't want to spoil the economy. There are half a dozen tailors with higher skill than me who wouldn't be affected much, but well over a dozen below me who'd also like to make 250 some day. So please, if you've been playing the undercutting game, think about whether eroding prices while gaining no new customers to the market, really is in your best interests.<br>

Well said, this is exactly what will happen and is what happened to the market for Acrylia studded gear. <br>
<br>
Cloaks and Tunics selling for 1k the only people who can make money selling them are the ones who farm there own acrylia, (not to mention that the bazaar prices of acrylia are way overpriced). Thus destroying the economy that would have been created through the making of such tailored items (people sell ingredients, tailors buy them and use to improve there skills, then we sell for a small profit (for most of us just enough to make up for a failed combine)) <br>
<br>
Again using the acrylia studded as an example, the amount acrylia studded items are sold for is very low, making it so no one would want to make acrylia items for sale/improvement of skills, thus decreasing the demand for acrylia pieces, and Superb rock hopper hides.<br>
<br>
If everyone sold them for the same price, we all could improve our skills from making them without accepting massive losses, and all us tailors would be happy in the end.   <br>

It is all supply and demand.  I'm sure you heard it all before and don't want to hear a lecture on economics.  Given that, something you might want to consider:<br>
<br>
1) The same item marked with the cheapest price will get sold first, doesn't mean the other ones with higher prices won't get sold at all.<br>
<br>
2) Those who sell it cheap probably have different motivation than you.  You might be in it for the profit.  They might be unloading a bunch after skill up sessions or just trying to get them sold and be done with.  If something is not profitable to you, its probably not profitable to them.  That's means they have no reason to do it perpetually just to screw you.  So just wait it out.<br>
<br>
3) There is an unlimited supply of components so there are potentially unlimited supply of whatever you are making.  Don't bet your livelihood in one thing.  Everything gets cheaper over time (except 1. after Verant add focus effects on them, and 2.  some off-server maniacs start to play around to jack up the prices 2x or 3x, then the rest of the residient merchants stupidly join in and buy off of each others unknowingly and can't bring the prices back down because they'll lose a big chunk of change, a la Fungi Tunic).<br>
<br>
4) If you want to fix prices (if you care, that's illegal in RL), just buy up all the cheap ones and sell them at your price.<br>
<br>
Not sure if you are around for the GVD duel between Aalandan and Zarianna (/wave /hug to both).  Same thing.  GVD was going for 20K.  Zari was doing skill ups and start selling them for 5k to fund her tradeskills.  Aalandan jumped up and down wildly and whine and complain on every boards that care.  So what happened?  Aalandan drop his to 5k, got a lot of customers.  Guess what?  Prices of GVD are back up.  Zari is done with tinkering so supply of GVD went back down.  What's the cost of the components?  400pp not counting the farmed ones.  <br>
<br>
Its pure economics.  Its not about your cost or what it cost you to skill up to 250.  Its not about how much its worth to the buyer or how much it should be worth based on how it compares to other items.  It is all about supply and demand.  <br>
<br>
I'll make a prediction, a few months from now, PotC set will shoot back up to the 15K range when all the tradeskill people got tired of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/uhollierth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hollierth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arbitor of Xev</span><br>  Posts: 273<br> <font color=#330000>(9/11/02 8:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Solstice Robe Prices</span><hr size=1> Stop cryin, all you gm crafter are why folks like me tryin to learn a skill can't , going into zones and offering crap like 40pp for a stack of silks or 40pp per padding.<br>

I do need acrylia, but we'd have to see if we can come to an agreeable acrylia/robe exchange rate. I'm unwilling to pay inflated bazaar prices for ingredients (ANY ingredients), but I don't mind barters that value ingredients higher than I'd pay pp for them.<br>
<br>
And for the prior flamer in this thread... with acrylia, I won't pay bazaar prices because A) it teaches people that tailors can be scalped, and B) I can't break even with those ingedient prices and the way tailors have eroded finished acrylia prices by undercutting each other. With silk, even if robe prices erode I'm still making big money, sure. If all I looked at was robes, 50p per silk swatch might actually make sense. But in respect for the people making raw silk, or cured silk, or wu's, I WILL NOT pay inflated prices for silk. Whether I can afford to is irrelevant. Silk is the primary skill progression path, and I'm not going to contribute to ruining that for others by paying people more for silk than a full set of wu's would sell for nowadays. So not sure where you got the attitude from, but I posted with the big picture in mind, not my personal loss/gain ratio. In other words, if you've got less than 201 skill, it's YOU I'm trying to look out for, so you might try being a bit less rude.<br>

<br>
Given the number of clicks involved in making the Robe the 3k price is actually a bargain compared to the 2k price of a Golden Idol of Tunare which takes alot less clicks (i.e. time to make).  <br>
<br>
The problem is you can't get to 250 making Tunare Idols and you can with the Robes, which means that there is gonna be ALOT of Robes to sell if you plan to skill up on them.  You're not gonna sell them to a vendor, so what do you do with them all?  <br>
<br>
I've gone the slow steady appraoch, but after 2 years of Tailoring I'm sick of it.  I have a max price I pay for Acrylia and Hides, but some days (after doing a combine session and not getting any skill ups), I feel like just going into the bazaar and buying ALL the acrylia no matter the price.  I haven't put alot of effort into it lately cause all the high end tailoring stuff sucks - the New Tunare Armor??  compared to the new smithing is so bad it makes me sick.  I wish I was an Erudite right about now!<br>
  <br>
Anyway, I'm not the one under cutting, but if I ever decide to do a huge run on Robes, I will sell at whatever price it takes to move them (it too costs me about 1k to make a robe depending on how successful my jc friend is at making chains).<br>
<br>
I just laugh at the baking people.  Misty Picnics are down to like 20pp (sure they only cost a few plat to make, but the number of clicks involved is insane!).<br>
<br>
I really can't believe how tradeskillers screw themselves.  We spend so much time and money (while other people are out exping and getting loot drops), don't we deserve a similar payoff?  The first 2 PotC Earring Sets I sold for 50k each.  Then a handful at 40k.  Now they are under 10k.  That's 30-40k per earring of potential profit to tradeskillers GONE.  <br>
<br>
I wish I could trade all my tradeskills in for exp so I was level 60 like my friends.  Oh well,    <p>Serill

Blessed Fishing Poles still sell pretty steadily and they don't have any other use than for the earring. It's also not a skillup item so there isn't the market flooding you see with the robes. But there's still pricing competition; I guess there always will be with bazaar stuff. <p><b>Bittleaye Arkades</b><br>

Here in June 03 the situation has indeed changed a lot. There's New Tanaan Crafting Mastery now. There are many more tailors thanks to that and to the Ykesha robes and ribbons. Chains are cheaper now that people have enough spare aa's to spend on JC mastery. Hell, I'm a 250 tailor and I've started buying robes for my kits from other tailors, because I don't have that JC mastery and the 300-400 pricetag is better than I'd do making them.<br>
<br>
When I was skilling up tailoring, I sold my robes to kit makers. Now that I'm done tailoring, I make my own kits while skilling up pottery and blacksmithing. The profit margin on kits has shrunk considerably... frankly, I don't see how anyone makes money at all unless they can do multiple tradeskills themselves, and personally I'll be out of the market as soon as I get my other 250s. All I really care about is breaking even, so I don't erode the money I'd made on robes back in the day.<br>
<br>
There used to be a small niche market for people who look for kit components at bargain prices and resell to the lazy. I guess there still is, and 500-1k profit for a bit of your time and bank space is nothing to sneeze at. But basically, the PoP and Ykesha expansions have done a lot to change the tradeskill economy from when I'd first posted this.<br>
