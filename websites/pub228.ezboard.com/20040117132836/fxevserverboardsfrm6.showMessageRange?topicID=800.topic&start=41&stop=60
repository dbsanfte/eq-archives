Black citizens weren't granted the right to vote until 1870. In fact, they weren't even considered citizens until 1868. Women were still considered the property of thier husbands until 1920.<br>

Are you trying to imply that women and blacks should never have been considered people, entitled to constitutional protections?<br>

There are a few you can go to that for the right price you can be arrested and put to death with no trial right on the street. Or better yet have the government take 50% of your earnings.

<br>
I was in the US Navy for 8 years and went all over the world as well. People that have not had the chance to travel and see other places can only base their opinions on the news, books and what their peers tell them. They are given to form opinions by hearing family members views that may have grown up under the same circumstances. Vicious circle of the uninformed raising the uninformed. Is this bad?..not inherently but it can lead to some interesting board reading../em grins<br>
<br>
Each country has issues..I will not deny that. Here in the US we have a way of dealing with government problems. It is called<br>
<br>
The right to Vote...<br>
<br>
It just happens to be that the people that do not vote and use this RIGHT are the ones that throw the biggest fits because the person that is in charge is doing something they do not like. How can you not vote and then bitch is beyond me.<br>
<br>
You may think that the President is a person that is elected to go and have dinners in other countries while being a big bully ....but in a nice way &quot;most&quot; of the time.<br>
<br>
What you do not see is that he is the person that is heading up the biggest money making machine in the history of the world bar none. He is there to make sure that we continue to make money and to stop in anyway possible all opposition to this cause... The job he has been given by the American people keeps him in the spotlight 90% of the time but most of the work he does happens while not under the eye of the population. <br>
<br>
Some elected officials are good at keeping the money rolling in while keeping the assholes of the world at bay. Some are not. The latter we vote out as soon as the chance comes. Most other countries have a hard time controlling or cannot in any way influence anything in the top tiers of their governments....and that is sad<br>
<br>
This president we have now I believe came in with more than enough drive to hit Iraq. The jerk there tried to have his father killed. If this happened to you and you were put in a position to get back at him. Would you not??? ..Who cares what excuse he gave for going in. As far as how we fight other countries...This is not a game...This is not a 17th century duel one on one thing... It is a &quot;you have done us wrong and now you die as fast as possible by all means possible&quot;.<br>
<br>
The actions against the men living and plotting against us in the area of Afghanistan/Pakistan/Iran..continues and will continue until they are dead.<br>
<br>
Please...if you live here in the US and are throwing a fit about this that and the other...Take a look at the blessings in your life. From the people living in dumpsters to those in mansions the main thing you take for granted but is the most important of all is that<br>
<br>
You are Free...<br>
<br>
Free to speak your views in opposition to anything you want...Free to do just about anything at all except hurt others. If you do not like the fact that the people in the government are all rich and getting richer on the pennies on the dollar that they take...Go on TV and say so...print it in the news...Yell it from the highest mountain...Have marches in support of your feelings...<br>
<br>
You can...because your Free.<br>
<br>
That freedom is guaranteed and supported by the government that we as a nation put into power.<br>
<br>
Sure we have problems...but overpopulation is a big cause of this as well. I wont go into this though...It speaks for itself.<br>
<br>
Just take a look around...try and become more educated on how others are forced to live and what others are forced to put up with.<br>
<br>
Then if you need to speak your mind on the same issues. You will be able to put them before us in a way that makes sense. I do not equate dOOd speak or EQ slang with knowing what the hell you are talking about. I believe that it shows you know very little because of age and a lack of education.<br>
<br>
<br>
Take care<br>

I was more trying to impress upon people the fact that YOU as a single person can affect change up to and including the very highest office in this country by using your right to vote.<br>
And In doing so effect changes both good and bad in your immediate surroundings.<br>
<br>
Not that some are voted in for reasons unknown to you and this is a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Hell, You could have Stevie Wonder voted in as the president of the American Optometry Association if you campaigned for him hard enough to swing the views and the mind of the general voting public.<br>
<br>
That does not mean what you did was correct in doing such a thing...nor that him being there is in everyones best interest but I hope you see my point.<br>

I'm not trying to flame anyone for their patriotism.  I'm not saying patriotism is bad.  But, this statement struck me as absolutely asinine, especially from former Navy.  I come from a military family, I was an ROTC nerd in school.  I was in the deployed entry program, myself, until I was medically disqualified.  I do not, for one minute, support the idea of a war to get back at someone on the basis of vague threats made years ago, while at the same time support the people that actually pay for said action - ShrubCo didn't.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477450" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://66.116.79.57/stormwind/ninevehowns.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gyphontherogue>Gyphon The Rogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#330000>(6/28/03 10:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=800.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: USA</span><hr size=1> Well...sorry for the delay in getting back to you on your kind comment...didn't check the board since Thurs night..<br>
<br>
anyway...<br>
<br>
(First a response to you about my so called asinine statement.)<br>
<br>
What I wrote does not have to be liked by you..nor do I care if you think that my views should be a certain way after being in the Navy. <br>
<br>
Nor do I care if you were in the delayed entry program and didn't get in...Hell for all I know you could have been in the delayed entry program for the salvation army and your mom called them up and said you couldn't go.  <br>
<br>
(Mean response over)<br>
<br>
What goes on in the military and how things are really done are not what you hear on TV...Hell you being from a military family...I'm sure you heard a bit more of the things that actually go on in the world than most people. What happens in reality and what is reported as happening are usually 180 degrees apart in most cases.<br>
<br>
What I wrote about us going to war in Iraq were not my only views on the subject..I was being long winded about other things and only put those comments in. I will not spend the rest of my evening debating over everything that &quot;I&quot; think went into what happened but let me ask you a question. Are you upset about my comment because it brought to light something NEW you had not thought of? <br>
Or <br>
Did the fact that I brought up the fact that he could have had this on his mind as one of the driving factors for the US going to war and that it offends you that I would say something about it?<br>
<br>
Too be honest..I do not really care what his reasons were. Do I think that we will find any WMD there?...Who knows..But let me put it this way... If we do...it would surprise me <br>

On this one I really had to laugh.......<br>
<br>
I was asking you if you had really put any thought into the fact that this may be an idea that you had never come up with.<br>
<br>
Actually what I was saying about the whole issue was that no matter what the reason he said we were going in there for.. it actually needed done just to get the fucking camel jocky out of there. The man and his bitch ass friends had eather killed anyone that would ever say anything against them or had driven them out of the country. They had that one man so scared for his life he lived inside his house inbetween the fucking walls for 22 years.<br>
<br>
So for WHATEVER fucking reasons we were told ...&quot; Yes I am very upset that some of our troops had to die &quot; <br>
<br>
It needed to be done no matter what the cost...<br>
<br>
As far as the Full Metal Jacket comment....<br>
<br>
I would imagine that movie is new to you...because your probably just fresh out of that special school where they take the kids that ride the short bus. <br>
<br>
So...you soft skull ...probably wearing head protection tied to your chair fucking retard..have someone wipe your god damn chin..clean off your sponge bob shirt or the nice pretty pink and green sweater you grandmother knitted for you...**or did your grandparents drop your parents like a rock when you were born**...from the drool that has soaked it..do a print screen of what I wrote..and read it to you.<br>

<br>
Your statement about bush, was fairly ignorant, and even stupid.<br>
<br>
Either <br>
<br>
a) Bush actually did use his fathers attempted assasination as a reason to go to war.<br>
<br>
or <br>
<br>
b) it didn't come into the decision.<br>
<br>
The easy one, B). Quite simply, it was fairly stupid to even mention this because it would have been irrelevant.<br>
<br>
If it was a) however, it's fucking scary.<br>
<br>
Now, I know that for most people, the amount of persuasion needed for someone to change their opinion is orders of magnitude more than the amount of persuasion it took to get them into it. Which is probably why the majority of people will still support bush.<br>
<br>
The thing is, I supported the war, mainly because Saddam was an evil bastard.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>It is not, however, Hypocritical to agree with the war but disagree with Bush, and Blair about the reasons.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Agreeing with Bush, and agreeing with the war, are not the same thing. Which i'm thinking you seem to argue that it is. Justifying the war on any level, is not the same thing as justifying bush.<br>
<br>
If Bush actually used his fathers assasination as a reason for war, then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>His decision to go to war is not completley based on the best interests of the american people</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
I don't really care if a politician lies about healthcare reform (a little), and taxes, but when it comes to a decision that requires him sending potentially thoasands of british Service men and women to their deaths, he better fuckingwell be doing it because of me, and my countrymen, and no other reason.<br>
<br>
Now, my understanding of the matter is that we went to war because of <br>
<br>
a) Iminent threat<br>
b) Weapons of Mass Destruction<br>
c) Links to Al`qaeda<br>
z) Saddam was a bastard.<br>
<br>
Now, A,B,C are turning out to be relative bullshit. I'm keeping an open mind, but it seems that as time progresses they are becomming less and less true.<br>
<br>
Now, z. There are more reasons for us going to war in iraq, however, I do not wish to think about any of them long or hard, because they are too scary to contemplate.<br>
<br>
IF, America wanted to depose saddam for being a bastard, but didn't think they could get the support from their own people, or the world without the WMD thing, that, in a way is justified.<br>
<br>
But.<br>
<br>
I still feel misled about the whole situation. And not only that, I don't think a right-thinking individual in either the US, or the UK could have POSSIBLY dissagreed with the war, if it was based souly on saddam being a bastard.<br>
<br>
Either way, we were misled into a war. No matter how much justification you think you can make about that statement, It is not justifiable. Because the bottom line of the matter is, that President bush, and Tony blair are looking more and more like they lied to the people of the UK and US about one of the only things they should not have lied about.<br>
<br>
