I enjoyed playing tanks more than caster-classes (always have, even since my D&D days) and after grouping with a chanter, I wanted to see what it was like playing a pet class.  This led to the birth of Tib.

I was well into Tib's 20th level area (forget exactly where, but remember it was when I started hunting in OT after Tib hit level 20) that I started noticing people with guildtags over their heads.  I didn't know what the big deal with a guild was, but was curious to find out, so I went about learning about guilds.  This led me to QuEllar dOloth, Tib's first guild.  
In QuEllar, a role playing guild, I developed Tib's personality as a fantasybook character.  He was evil to the core, but not hateful (a hard combo). I developed the idea of being lawful while still being loyal into his character.  His time in QD saw him use the guild mostly for socializing while spending most of his time solo or in pickup groups, until he broke into his 50s.  At that time, most of my friends in the guild had moved on to other places, but some remained, and guild groups just weren't happening.
So Tib left QD and sought bigger and better things.  This brought him to Knights of Reverence.
The relationship was not entirely bad, but mostly not good.  KoR was (at that time) a very cliqueish group that wasn't all too interested in the good of all over the good of the few.  Still, They has some great people, and it was those people that I kept Tib in KoR for.  To this day, I still stay in contact with a few of them, and to this day they are some of the best people I have met in EQ.

After Tib was out of KoR, he joined Ancient Fellowship and FINALLY discovered the power of teamwork in EQ.  As of 68 levels and 243 AAs, Tib is FINALLY coming into his own as a tank and DPS class.  He has been on raids with AF and has been able to form groups with enough regularity and force that targets have fallen when the request was made.
So ... who is Tib?
Though I Never would have thought this when I created him, Tib is a tool through which I have been able to learn about people playing EQ.  Some people, like Arkarna, Mento, Tomahawke, Modred, and Kareja (to name a few) are probably some of the best people I have ever met... even though I have never actually MET almost any of you (I did meet Ark ... she is a great person).  Others, though you may be good in person, you just don't seem to have the right idea when it comes to "team" work.  

So who is Tib?
Well, I am Tib.  He is the embodiment (cybernetically) of my sense of humor, my love for challenge, and my nervous energy when I listen to the news.  He is the mainfestation of my fun-side attitude and creative spasms of jargon.  He is my love of jokes (good and bad ... especially bad) and my love for helping people.  

And I guess that is who Tib is.</span></div>	</div> 	<div id="contactinfo">		<h2>My Contact Information</h2>		<div id="email"><span class="title">Email Address ::</span>  <span class="privatevalue">private</span></div>		<div id="pm">		<span class="title">My Inbox ::</span> 						<span class="value"><a href="" title="Send a message using the ezboard inbox feature" >Send me a Message!</a></span>				</div>		<div id="im"><span class="title">IM ::</span> <span class="value">None - </span></div>		<div id="link"><span class="title">Personal Link ::</span> <span class="value"><a href="http://tibultelgghinvlos.o-f.com/page1.htm" target="_blank">Who is Tibult?
