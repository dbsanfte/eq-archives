However, I think people are missing some things on this.<br>
<br>
Now, any computer program can only do what it is told.  In a game like everquest, there are saftey measures programmed in.  For example, a max time limit put on the sleepers rampage so that it doesn't continue to run around forever.  That would be reasonable to believe.  My question is simple - why is it that the sleeper stayed up more than 3 and a half hours on other servers rampaging around?  As a matter of fact, I believe I spent more time than that on Xev waiting for it to show up in SS while people kept zoning into ST to see what it would do.<br>
<br>
It is possible it was a combination of the warders trying to respawn and the extended time of the script that reset it.  It is possible that it could have been many things - EQ has some very complicated code.<br>
<br>
However, think about a couple of things.  1) It was not just the sleeper who despawned - all pets in the zone respawned as well.  I have only ever seen my pet despawn automatically twice before - BOTH times involved a full zone reset done by a GM.  2) The 4th warder repopped - that has not happened on any other server when the sleeper despawned to my knowledge.  3)  There have been several reports that the GM present gave a reason to people that HE despawned he sleeper. 4) The parties in question are beng offered 2 AA and loss of exp back - something I have never heard of being done for a bugged encounter which are far more common than you'd believe.  High end guilds deal with these all the time.  FoH, AL, and others virtually beta tested VT, Time, the Elemental Plans, ect.  Sony has a record of intentionally sabotaging an encounter they are not ready for a guild to beat.<br>
<br>
All of these amount to nothing more than circumstantial evidence.  However, put together, I still think it points to a GM following orders and Sony realizing what type of shitstorm this would kick up and covering their bases.  They provide a technically viable solution that can never be verified and allow another chance.<br>
<br>
Now, let me clarify this by saying that even if I am right - Sony did the right thing in this case.  While I think they have really dropped the ball in the past, this is a decent action.  Therefore - whatever the motive for their action, they should be given the benefit of the doubt in this case.<br>

I think the reaction is wonderful (putting sleeper back, giving 2 AA's and fixing it and giving them another go at it).  I'm just saying that people have every right to jump down the GMs throats even if the GM didnt reset the zone (which you have pointed out very well they most probably did) because of the past BS we've been forced to deal with.  This wasnt simply a bug, it was poor programming and/or a deliberate GM sabotage.  Either way it sucks for the gamer and the GMs are there to take the heat.    But yah Xalion I agree with you 100%, it's pretty obvious what happened.  But at least they are being fair and helping the players out and letting them have another chance (only took 8000 petitions) instead of past responses along the lines of &quot;uh well we're sorry, we fixed it now&quot;....this time they made a smart move at least.  So kudos on that I guess. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
I have no idea how it's all implemented on the server side, but I think that due to the zone orientated structure of the server it would it unlikely the the sleeper was one individual script (which would require it to be outside any 'Zone' program) More likely, it is implemented that all the scripts are in each zone's program, with simply one interface function, or whatever they have to trigger the next. So instead of having one script for sleepers, skyshrine, ww and whatever, you have several different scripts, with an easy 'trigger' from one zone to the next.<br>
<br>
Here the time limit makes sense, and is quite an easy thing to take into account to make sure bad things don't happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>One problem Ram, it isn't impossible and never was. If it was, it would have been written in such a way that you could never damage it, it would never move below 99%.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have heard not one, single peice of evidence from any player on any server that had ever said that killing the sleeper was possible. I'd pressume that this has been the case up to one month or less ago.<br>
<br>
It's like saying for 2 years that going faster than the speed of sound is impossible, then shouting how you knew it was for many years.<br>
<br>
Now, the 'They should have known about it' attitude, is rather cute, but as a programmer, I'll tell you it is absolutley impossible.<br>
<br>
For example, a month ago, I was designing and writing a peice of software to test a GPIB Regression system for a product my company designs, it's purely for in-house development intended to make it easy to tell what random things we screw up with a parituclar code modification.<br>
<br>
Someone came up to me 2 weeks ago and asked if it would work for another product we designed. The answer was that it didn't, because I'd tailored the system to work for another system, but with some minor changes, it worked.<br>
<br>
I can name another dozen times in the last 6 months this has happened. <br>
<br>
You have to. HAVE to, make assumptions when writing programs. If someone breaks those assumptions, you have to go back, and re-do software.<br>
<br>
This program worked. It did everything it was supposed to do, it solved our exact problem and fullfilled everything it needed to. Until.....<br>
<br>
SOMEONE TRIED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT INTENDED BY THE PROGRAM.<br>
<br>
This isn't my fault, It worked, It did everything I, and everyone else wanted to, I didn't think about it, because no-one had challenged my assumption.<br>
<br>
Telling me I should have gone back to analyse what went on, and that I should have known what would have happened is like saying I need to know everything that could possibly ever change in the future.<br>
<br>
Thats called reading the future, and is something I do not do.<br>
<br>
What I do, however, is make it so that any changes are easy to make, and try and deal with things ahead of time. I gaurentee you that for every situation where this type of thing has happened to me, I have written a dozen peices of code where I have allowed for something along those lines.<br>
<br>
Now, the thing is, that that analogy only works if the person who wrote the scipt is the same guy who fixed it. but...<br>
<br>
Now, another analogy that I think would be particularily apt, <br>
<br>
I was recently working on function for the same program, that used GPIB (a remote interface, like RS232, or Ethernet) to transfer massive amounts of data from this machine to my PC.<br>
<br>
I had enourmous amounts of problems trying to do this, as each time I attempted to do so, an error was thrown (thanks to the program, the machine kept on running with 0 problems, it just meant the function didn't work).<br>
<br>
The problem stemmed from a simple assumption a guy who no longer works for my company made almost 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
He assumed that I would not be trying to send more than 512 bytes of data at once. Thats a fair assumption as the most data sent in one block from this machine is about 50 bytes. <br>
<br>
I had not paid any attention to this assumption, because It worked, I had no problem with it, and it did everything I wanted to.<br>
<br>
I only realised the assumption was fundamentally false because I had tried to do something that broke it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, you will say it's obvious that the sleeper would have been killable. I call bullshit. <br>
<br>
Everquest is probably many, many powers of ten larger in terms of code size than the software I am writing for this machine. Expecting every single person, or even any single person to always question the validity of assumptions designed into the program is ridiculous, and foolish.<br>
<br>
I will always work out that some assumptions are false, and should be rectified ahead of time, I have done and will continue to do so. <br>
<br>
A Software team, will never, ever, ever, ever be able to isolate every single false assumption before they are prooved false. Ever.<br>
<br>
The more mundane the assumption is, the less likely they are to proove false.<br>
<br>
Your seat belt analogy is flawed, because it was actually discovered the same way, because people died, not because they worked out the seat belt needed upgrading before.<br>
<br>
A simpler analogy to proove my summation.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you walk into your house, and try to turn on the lightbulb, and it doesn't light up, you do a quick check to see if the lights are on in the house (hence not a power failure) then check the light bulb to see if it's blown, then check the fuse.<br>
<br>
You have assumed up to now, it will turn on.<br>
<br>
What you are suggesting, is before you switch on the light, you check to see if the lights are on in your house, check the bulb, check the fuse, THEN switch on the light.<br>
<br>
It is neither practical, nor even possible to do this, saying otherwise is idiotic.<br>
<br>
<br>
A final Summary<br>
<br>
Good programming is not making a system work for every concievable situation all of the time with no work, because that would require so much time as to be stupid.<br>
<br>
Good programming is making the system work with any concievable change with the minimum amount of effort. Which, correct me if I'm wrong, was what has happened here.<br>
<br>

Maybe I said it wrong.  Let me break it down a bit better.  You seem to think that I am saying that they should have known this was going to happen 3 years ago or whenever sleeper was first written.  NO.  I am not saying this.  So please. drop that argument.  What I AM saying is that SINCE then, changes have been made to the game.  Now...when sleeper was first written, it was set up to have a certain number of HP's and a certain amount of regen, and given the amount of DPS possible by a large zerg force AT THE TIME, the sleeper was for all intents and purposes impossible.  I agree with you there.  BUT.  The DPS possible and the skills available have been changed by SOE since then.  So now, it is VERY possible to kill sleeper (obviously now) with the changes they made to the game.  They SHOULD, if they wanted it to truly be IMPOSSIBLE, made it so that it was.  <br>
<br>
Since they didnt change the sleeper to accomodate the DPS and abilities of the current EQ, only two assumptions can be made:  1)  They don't want it to be impossible anymore or 2) They just forgot to even look at it.<br>
<br>
Now, if it's number one, then the script should have been changed.  If it's two, it's still a fuck up.  I'm sorry but if your'e going to market a product, especially expansions of a previous product, then yes..you should and ARE responsible for anything you fail to update of the previous versions.  Now, I can somewhat understand them missing it, the game afterall is very complex.  But my problem is that there have been times when parts of the game certainly werent finished and purposely sabotaged, which you know damn well have happened.  I personally fail to see how they could miss the fact that they needed to update the sleeper since it's the only &quot;impossible&quot; mob they designed (even though that term obviously doesnt apply).  But if they did, fine.  But it's still half-assed.  And I dont buy the fact that it was a script error when everything in the zone reset, not just sleeper.  But whatever.  You say its unfair for a company to be expected to update their own product they are expanding.  I say its unfair to the consumer to do anything else.  And shipping products that arent updated and in some cases, unfinished, is just shitty in general.  <br>
<br>
And in terms of your analogy, it'd be like if your company made a new version of the particular product and then failed to have you update your software.  All of a sudden, it doesnt work anymore but that's just a normal software scenario?  Nope, sorry.  I can understand.  But this isn't something SoE is giving us out of the kindness of their hearts.  This is a service they make a fucking shit load of money on.  This is a product we pay for and while bugs are expected, unfishied...sabotaged...or major non-updated content is not just part of the game.  Blizzard sure doesnt seem to have these sort of problems.  I dont expect perfect.  But I expect reasonable. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

1)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Some GM decided (as a renegade OR under orders) that Sleeper would not be killed, so he laughed manically as he repopped the zone, then watched as the entire zerg force was wiped out.  When he was done, he sat back and popped open a root beer to celebrate.<br>
2)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a problem (or perhaps problems) in the script. <br>
3)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp SoE write Sleeper so it would only last 3.5 hours after it started the rampage.  Knowing that nobody would kill it, and knowing that walking indefinitely would only make people never go to Vellious again, they took action to help prevent this.  After 3.5 hours … no more sleeper.  If this is the case .. everything was working fine.<br>
4)&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We dreamed the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Except for 1 and 4, I am willing to believe this.  Let’s SUPOSE the GM had not poofed sleeper, and let’s PRETEND it passed the 3 hour limit with no despawn.  Just for fun, pretend that the warders popped in and something, ANYTHING went wrong and the zerg force started to fall apart.  If Sleeper gets out there is no safeguard (since the three hour limit has passed) and Sleeper will just walk along killing everything for as long as (s)he likes.<br>
<br>
I/m not a programmer, I wouldn’t pretend to be, but I have a very minimal understanding of the complexities we are dealing with here.  The reason the GMs are able to repop a zone is because some programmer (team of programmers, probably) installed a switch that allows them to do it.  Reason, safeguard.  It is a fast easy way to reset a zone without having to go blind digging through script … OR a easy way to reset a zone after you already HAVE.  <br>
It sounds to me like the Sleeper script wasn’t working.  SOMETHING happened and it wasn’t functioning properly and after the allotted time, the GM knew that he/she would have to repop the zone to prevent a massacre of any NONuber person that still wants to PLAY Everquest… instead of simply dominating anything that crosses their path.<br>
<br>
Now I am making a LOT of guesses here, but when I try to think of the number  of variables involved in this game, it’s mind blowing.  JUST between faction, vendors, skills, weapons abilities, and enough bool switches to make a calculator want to shit its microchips, you are talking about more variables than I would EVER EVER want to deal with.  This isn’t the work of one lazy programmer, this is hundreds of programmers doing the best they can so we can play a video game.  To think that they can dig through this MONOLITH of a program to find individual bugs is sadistic.<br>
Now, I agree, if they didn’t want Sleeper to be killed, they should have made sleeper impossible to engage.  They didn’t. When they wrote Sleeper, there probably was NO fucking way in HELL any team of people could kill it, so they didn’t bother.<br>
Now, YEARS later, and 3, 4, 5(?) expansions later some of you have the people, the abilities and the gear that can take this best down.  Unfortunately for you … MOST of us don’t.  Don’t sit there telling me what a minority I am because I still want to enjoy playing this game instead of seeing how high I can get my numbers.  I do /whoall (class) 65 from time to time just to se how many there are.  Yeah, there are a lot more now than there were a year ago, but there STILL aren’t NEAR as many as there are on lower levels.  If you aren’t showing up on a /whoall, then whatever, but you will NOT convince me that you are the majority when I overflow on lower ranks and almost NEVER overflow on 65s in ANY class.  If the game isn’t hard enough for you , fucking wah.  Start a new toon and level him/her up the old fashioned way.  No exploits, No twinking, No Pling… straight playing.  Trust me, if you actually want to PLAY the game, there is still plenty to see.<br>
From what I have seen so far, Sleeper did EXACTLY what sleeper was supposed to do.  I remember when it was woken on our server, and 3.5 hours later (roughly speaking) it despawned.  That there is a safeguard written into the script for this makes perfect sense to me, and just adds another dimension to the fight.  You have 3.5 hours to kill it.<br>
FURTHERMORE… if you think you can break into that code and clean up their mistakes and bugs, by ALL means, please do.  I still struggle with flash when I bother with it… and that to EQ is like Legos to a rocket scientist.  I might not agree with what happened, and yeah, I think RZ got fucked.  BUT … I think you are acting like a bunch of old women by sitting here bitching about it.<br>
You tell me I have been heard, well, so have YOU.  So god damn much, as a matter of a fact, that I threadjacked a thread EXACTLY like this last time you fuckers wouldn’t quit bitching about it.  If I remember correctly, YOU, Usildor, were one of the ones asking people to chill out and let it go.  <br>
The GMs did more in this case than I have ever heard of a GM doing before.  You DARE sit there and say that you fault them because their programming doesn’t meet your strict standards?  Give me a fucking break!  I am SURE that if you can fix it, they will be HAPPY to hire you so to do.<br>
Of course, I KNOW You said you aren’t a programmer.  In that case, I find it the biggest load of smoking horseshit that you have the balls to fault them for it.  GMs can’t just take action, everything they do has to go through an unreal system of checks, and their hands are usually tied.  Do you have any idea how enormous this game is?  You talk about it like it is some program written in basic:<br>
<br>
10 CLS<br>
20 Print “EQ is Cool”<br>
30 goto 10<br>
40 end<br>
<br>
… oops, forgot the ;. <br>
<br>
Trust me, it is a bit more complicated.  There are probably more variables controlling the appearance of ONE TOON than you have ever dealt with in your life.  Yeah, when we hit a bug, they can go back and fix it.  Once we trip over it, they can identify it and go fix it.  I wouldn’t expect them to be able to look at it and KNOW where all the mistakes are.  That is just an unreal expectation.<br>
<br>
Your comparison with the car is a good one, but far too simple.  This is more like figuring out the genetic code for Kwip… then trying to change one variable so he isn’t such a lame fucktard.<br>
Yeah, MAYBE it is possible… but would YOU want to get stuck with that job?  I would rather just despawn him after 3.5 hours.<br>

<br>
You seem to have my examples going over your head.<br>
<br>
I'll give you a better example.<br>
<br>
About 33 years ago, a very large vehicle was upgraded from 24 volts to 42 Volts for purposes of compatability.<br>
<br>
Most aspects of that vehicle were upgraded to work with the higher voltage.<br>
<br>
<br>
One critical part of that vehicle, a thermostat for a heater was not upgraded. This was not a problem on it's own, as it wasn't really big on the scheme of things.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, the error was compounded, because the thermostat wasn't really intended to be used very often, if at all (as it was a cut off for a temperature that was never intended to be exceeded anyway). There was a small problem with a tube near the thermostat that meant that the heaters in the tank the thermostat was at needed to be turned on to heat up and boil off some of the stuff in the tank.<br>
<br>
Now, the thermostat hit the cut off temperature, and fused shut, meaning the temperature of the tank was never regulated, and it just kept heating up and heating up.<br>
<br>
This would have been okay, but no-one realised that the temperature gauge for that tank didn't go past the maximum intended temperature.<br>
<br>
The temperature of the tank, was so intense, that it burned off all the insulation inside the tank, exposing the wiring for all components inside the tank.<br>
<br>
Four days Later, Jack swigart, pushed a button to perform a Cryogenic stir of the oxygen tanks that this thermostat was regulating, the wiring create a spark, and the oxygen exploded, it took out a chunk of side of the vehicle, and left it without any oxygen for it's 5 day journey around and back from the moon.<br>
<br>
If you hadn't guessed, this Vessel was apollo 13.<br>
<br>
<br>
This sleeper incident, is the same deal.<br>
<br>
In the sleeper, there was one design flaw, two unlikely occourances, and one half likely occourance.<br>
<br>
These are :<br>
<br>
The sleeper despawned after 3 hours, people thought to wake/kill him, he was still spawnable, and that they were still fighting after three hours.<br>
<br>
The particular likelihood of any of these happening are extremely unlikely, if it hadn't been for any single ONE of those incidents, this problem would not have occoured.<br>
<br>
Saying it should have been solved when players reached that particular point, is wishful thinking and hindsight at it's best.<br>
<br>
It's not practicle, and certainly it isn't anyones fault.<br>
<br>
I've been showing how unlikely it was thought to be, how unlikely the programmers are to actually think about it, and how low on the radar it would have been.<br>
<br>
From a programming perspective, I would have expect a million times more things of this sort to happen, in fact, I CAN name a million other things that are the same design and planning wise to this that haven't gone wrong.<br>
<br>
However, the programmers are satan, for thinking of those million but not this unlikely occourance.<br>

<br>
Let me explain why - I think some of you misunderstood the events of the night.<br>
<br>
First, the guilds prepared for and woke the sleeper.  Now, this was almost certainly spurred on by a recent attempt by a japanese guild to kill the sleeper.  In their attempt, all 4 warders respawned on them as they got to about 20%.  Just to clear up a lot of crap going around - this was done on an asian server with only velious installed.  So, the Japanese guild killing the sleeper (they did manage this) automatically shoots down a large portion of the arguments I am seeing here - the sleeper was not designed as unkillable - he was designed to get 1 shot.  The japanese guild did it with ONLY velious equipment and experience.<br>
<br>
That being said, the guilds fought for around 3.5 hours.  At this time - SEVERAL things happened.  First, the sleeper despawned.  This by itself is unremarkable - the result of a script.  Second, all pets in the zone despawned.  This is remarkable - I'll get to it later.  Third, the fourth - and only the fourth - warder respawned.  This happened after the sleeper had already despawned.  Fourth, several people have reported being told that the sleeper wasn't to be killed, he was too important from the perspective of EQII.  Note that this was not a &quot;wipe&quot;.  That was the Japanese guild, not the events in question.<br>
<br>
After that got around, a lot of petitions hit Sony.  We then get a paper cutter explanation from Sony - but with actions they have refused to take for nearly 3 years on any other encounter.<br>
<br>
Looking at this from the standpoint of a programmer - we do not know exactly how the script was written.  However, we have numerous examples of the script running on other servers.  It has been known for a long time (ever since they revamped SS) that the script did not function properly.  Take what happened on Xev for instance - the sleeper was up for longer than 3.5 hours - and never got to SS.  Also, look what happened to the pets.  Pets are not affected by scripts running in a zone normally.  The only thing I have seen despawn a pet like that is a zone reset.  Note what I said - a zone reset - not a mob despawn.  You can take the Rallos Zek event as an example - fake Rallos despawns at between 30 and 60% life and the real Rallos respawns.  Pets do not despawn at that time.<br>
<br>
It is possible that at the time Velious was written - this type of dynamic scripting did not exist.  However, every time the sleeper has not been allowed to finish his script by something stopping it from completing that I can think of, he has had to be /killed by a GM.  I can think of at least one instance that he was reset back to his unwoken state because of a bug in the script that didn't allow him to finish.<br>
<br>
Now, I believe the key was the 4th warder.  The 4th warder could have only respawned as part of the script - there is no other explanation for it.  Had the zone just been reset, everything would have respawned.  Had the Sleeper just despawned, the script would have been considered completed and the server wouldn't have respawned him.  <br>
<br>
There are 2 possible explanations for this - first, that the event is not a single script.  That instead, it is a series of scripts.  The script taking care of the sleeper executed.  When he got to a certain percentage life, the script dealing with the 4th warder ran.  He then despawned before the scripts dealing with the 1-3rd warder could run.<br>
<br>
The second explanation is that when the GM saw that they were prepared for the warders and realized they weren't going to wipe, he did a zone reset (either out of panic or following orders) - which stops all scripts from running.  As the sleeper is a 1 time thing, upon the zone reset, server would have registered him as down and left him down.  The 4th warder however very well could have been left up - until the zone updates to the revamped sleeper's tomb, the server has no way to know he is supposed to be down.<br>
<br>
Now, I was not arguing that the programmers are lazy or that their job is easy.  When you get to millions of lines of code, a bug can be incredibly hard to find and when you make a change, you never know what else it might break.  What I am arguing is that those who went off saying Sony is angelic and everyone is paraniod is not looking at the facts.  This would not be the first time Sony has done something like this.  It would only be the most wide reaching (almost everyone wants to see what happens when the sleeper dies - its human nature, we don't believe there is anything that &quot;can't&quot; be done).  Furthermore - Sony has NEVER reacted like this to this type of problem.  If it really was a problem in the script, Sony would have been much more likely to post a public explanation of the script on their front page and leave the RZ folks to deal with it.  However, they had a huge problem.  That explanation does not explain why the GM in question told the guilds involved that it was done intentionally.<br>
<br>
In my mind, the most likely scenario is that a late night GM was watching and told someone (a programmer or lead GM on staff) that the sleeper was going to get beat.  As it was late night, a large portion of the administrative staff wouldn't have been there, and for a game like EQ most certainly wouldn't have been on call.  As this had never been done before and really wasn't envisioned, the person in charge wouldn't have had much in the way of guidelines.  He made a hasty decision, the deed was done and the EQ community blew up.<br>
<br>
The next day when the actual programmers and PR staff arrived, they were met with the shitstorm that had been created.  Between arguments with the programmers of what was supposed to happen and the PR people, they came up with this solution on the fly.  The AA points and exp regain will make the guilds involved happy and forget anything the GM on staff that night might have said (admit it, people in large groups are sheep.  Toss them a bone and they'll forget all wrongs).  They then reset the script.<br>
<br>
I imagine most of the programmers would actually love to see the sleeper killed.  Why?  Well, then they have a model for the next expansion's ultimate boss.  I think they are more than secure in the knowledge that if they wanted too - they could make an unbeatable encounter.<br>
<br>
Either explanation could have happened - we'll never know.  One way or another, maybe this will change the way they treat the top guilds when they are &quot;beta&quot;ing encounters that have not been tuned nor tested and sometimes, not even finished.<br>

Sleeper should have been updated for PoP.  Lots of entire zones have been revamped.  The Sleeper is their one big major mob.  It's not some little guage on a heater...one out of 200,000 more major moving parts.  This is the only mob never beaten.  It's a crown jewel.  I refuse to believe that it never got into anybody's head at SoE &quot;well, if we're inventing 5 more levels, more spells and AA's, increasing max dps output by X%....what happens when the next zerg fest goes after sleeper?&quot;  Sure, some of the less major zones had to be revamped after a while.  I dont expect attention to every detail.  But failure to look at the sleeper scenario is more like failing to replace the electrical fuses of the control panel on a spacecraft, not the guage for one of the heaters.  We can agree to disagree.  I dont expect perfection like I said, but I expect reasonable.  And this wasnt some miniboss in a pre-luclin zone.  This was the fuckin sleeper.  I dont believe the thought never occured to them, and if it didn't....that's even worse.  And as Xalion has done a good job of pointing out, the whole script error thing sure looks like a crock of shit.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
And if you did...anyone who is NOT completely new to the game, would know damned well you didn't take uber_mob_001 alone.<br>
<br>
And I hope everyone would have the sense to realise that if he adds that line to his sig, that he is not trying to claim that he did it alone. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
Even if our little baby-guild took Vindi down and EVEN IF I got the last shot in and EVEN IF I was lucky enough to get the BP, I STILL wouldn't get some twisted satisfaction about being the last one to hit him.  To tell you the truth, I almost never even look.<br>
<br>
As you know, I seem to MT more often than not when we raid (and I go).  As a matter of a fact, for a while, I was sometimes the ONLY melee there, so having the last hit was pretty much a given.  All the same ... take the clerics out and I am probably not going to live long enough to land a third hit, much less a last one.  I have seen some people mention it, sure ... it is funny when a chanter drops a mob with a dagger stab for 7.  I do get a laugh when my necro whaps a mob for 15 dmg and kills it.  Sure, it's funny, but unless I am soloing, I see it as pretty damn cheap to claim some badge of honor becasue you &quot;hit it last&quot;.  But like I said ... maybe it's just me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tryphyna>Tryphyna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#330000>(11/18/03 9:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1140.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.angelfire.com/games5/tryphyna/images/gothav1.gif HEIGHT=131 WIDTH=67></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: m</span><hr size=1> I agree with you Tibult, with two exceptions.<br>
<br>
1) I wouldn't call us a baby-guild...sure we're no raiding guild but we are good sized and have been around a while, which is more than you can say about a lot of tags you see.<br>
2) Personally, if i got a kill shot on an uber_mob_001 on a raid, i would put it in my sig...simply because it'd be funny as hell that a druid got a kill shot in on said mob =P<br>
<br>
...and you're a damned good MT, you're even kind and considerate enough to provide entertainment for the healers/rezzers ;P <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
