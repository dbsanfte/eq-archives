When I took the reigns, we were a low 40's guild with around 30 members.  What's below are just things I've noticed with my, admittedly, still newbish guild while slowly plodding our ways to the upper levels and growing in both numbers and levels:<br>
<br>
We made a conscious and deliberate decision to focus on quality of members (with the emphasis on character) rather than on the UBERness of their gear or prior EQ exploits.  With this in mind, we started a rather thorough system of applicants and applications which consist of applying at the website, a guild application email, a personal interview, grouping and raiding with the guild, three reports on the individual's character and skill, and then a guild wide vote requiring at least 50 percent of the total vote.<br>
<br>
The key to keeping the guild running is discipline.  Sure, some people will argue (and their point is valid) that Everquest is a game, nothing more, and they don't want to have to leave their bosses at work and come home to listen to me ordering them around.<br>
<br>
However...<br>
<br>
Everquest is a team game, a guild game, and if it weren't for your guildmates, you'd likely not be where you stand in the game.  You wear a tag above your head for a reason, and the tag stands for something- it means you are an integral part of something larger than just yourself, and should instantly instill a sense of team pride.  So when you commit to joining a guild, you commit to working TOGETHER as a team, and like any team game, you need leadership and you need direction.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to discipline- you need discipline.  Anytime I've backed off on my guildmates fearing I was being too rigid or demanding, I'd see guildmates slouching in GFay doing nothing, unwilling to lift a finger to help someone after exp or finishing off a quest.  So when I let my guild just filter off and do whatever they want, we lost the team/guild focus.<br>
<br>
You need to keep people in line- if this were a fantasy world (hey wait, it is, dammit), people would naturally fall in line and always think with the guild in mind.  But they don't, and that's why you need to keep at them, constantly reminding them (if necessary) of the guilds goals and intentions, and always keep trying to keep the guild moving in a forward, progressive direction instead of merely standing still.<br>
<br>
Only way to do this is by being fair, I think.  Some people you're going to be better friends with in the guild, and some people will get on your nerves- this is inevitable.  The key is to remain fair with everybody no matter what.  Being fair may mean going against what you WANT to do, but maintaining a definitive line of what's right and wrong will keep the guild focused.<br>
<br>
In the end, it depends on where you want your guild to go.  Some guilds crave server worship and the title of &quot;UBER&quot; next to their names.  They want items of prestige, mobs of prestige and so on so they can argue over who's killed such and such more times and with how many people.<br>
<br>
That's all well and good, and props to the guilds able to accomplish the above- it's tough to do.  But other guilds (Covenant of Valor for instance) focuses on the behavior and integrity of its members, avoiding any sort of &quot;level cap&quot; designed to keep a guild's recruits high and strong.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd much rather have someone on Xev say &quot;FE are nice people&quot; than &quot;FE are leet!&quot;.  We're learning the endgame, having fun with it, and hopefully we'll be able to aid with CR's in the planes instead of merely requesting help time and time again. =)<br>
<br>
But anyway, guild leaders in the mid-levels, I recommend you to be strict and focused.  You may lose a few members, but having a core of disciplined, polite and gracious folks can take you a whole lot farther than a group of greedy, loot-motivated individuals who care about nothing but their own EQ status.  IMHO.<br>

It's also a pretty good commercial for &lt;Four Elements&gt; - but I don't think anyone will blame you for promoting your guild.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Warning:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I'm about to descend into a black pit of autobiography.  The stuff which follows is only really going to be of interest to people who are trying to run a mid-level guild and are looking for thoughts from someone who's done it, or to people who're vaguely interested in the history of &lt;Blood Cult&gt;.  Anyone else is going to find this pretty dull...<br>
<br>
I'm the founder, and former leader, of &lt;Blood Cult&gt;.  In its present form, the guild has existed since the summer of 2001 and I led it for about six months before passing leadership on to Nogi for personal reasons.  I'm still an officer and active participant.<br>
<br>
I was lucky enough to start with some pretty good people on board.  We had all previously been members of the &lt;Blood Cult Clan&gt;, which ceased to exist when its leader went out of contact for over three months.  We'd decided that we all wanted to stay together and make a new guild rather than go our separate ways.<br>
<br>
There were a dozen people in the guild in its first incarnation.  I think the highest level person was about 52, and ranged down to the 30's.  We'd never raided the planes, and our idea of a major raid was to get half a dozen people together and head to Sebilis.<br>
<br>
My initial choice of officers was fairly simple... I chose those people who had been successful officers in &lt;Blood Cult Clan&gt;.  I think there were four officers initially.<br>
<br>
On recruitment, I chose not to have a formal application policy, but I did insist that the officer who invited a new member took responsibility for spending time with, and coaching, that new member.  The officer was also accountable for that new member's actions... so if someone was invited to the guild, and their actions subsequently brought the guild into disrepute, then the officer who invited them took some stick from yours truly.<br>
<br>
(Nowadays, it's a little more challenging to get into &lt;Blood Cult&gt; - but then, we're not exactly a `mid-level guild` any more.  We've got a formal application procedure and a list of requirements which you can view at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.bloodcult.net.">www.bloodcult.net.</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> )<br>
<br>
The result of this policy was that recruitment was slower than some of the officers would like.  However, it also led to the recruitment of some very good people.  Also our members, by and large, have remained with us and continued to contribute strongly - and it's relatively rare that a guildie's actions reflect badly on &lt;Blood Cult&gt;.  I had practically no disciplinary work to do.<br>
<br>
I delegated the tasks of raid leadership and recruitment/coaching (I feel that recruitment and coaching can't really be separated), but I kept personal control of loot distribution.  I'm glad I did that - the sad fact is, that if there's one issue that causes guilds to argue with each other, it's loot.  I worked on a system of /randoming off most items but reserving a few bits and pieces to award to people who'd made an outstanding contribution to the guild.<br>
<br>
I won't say that was perfect - it still led to disagreements and bad feeling on occasion.  But then, I guess that loot always does.  I'll discuss the three most popular systems of loot distribution below.<br>
<br>
Although I made the majority of strategic decisions personally, I did make sure that I consulted the guild membership where I could, by means of polls on our website or direct discussion.  I wanted to run a guild for the benefit of the membership rather than for the benefit of the leadership, and I think that our members sensed that.  If you look at every successful guild on Xev, you'll see that although the details of how it's run do vary, they are all the same in that the members <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> trust</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the leadership to run the guild for their benefit.  If that trust ever falters, you're sunk.<br>
<br>
The guild was reasonably successful, and we soon decided that our main focus was on what we saw as the high end of the game (which we defined - don't laugh - as raiding places as uber as the Plane of Growth).  That meant that there was no value in inviting people below level 46 to the guild because they couldn't join in the majority of guild activities.  So we put a minimum level restriction of 46.<br>
<br>
By the time I handed leadership of the guild over to Nogi about six months later, we had about 45 members, several level 60's and several with epics.<br>
<br>
In summary, I found that leading a mid level guild successfully came down to the following five things:-<br>
<br>
1.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Recruitment and coaching.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You have to make sure that you only accept reasonably good players into your guild, and you have to ensure that they have someone in the guild who spends time with them developing their abilities further.<br>
<br>
2.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Raiding.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  A guild that raids together frequently becomes a tight-knit, disciplined force which is greater than the sum of its parts.<br>
<br>
3.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Dialogue.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The guild leader makes the final decisions, but the membership is consulted where possible before decisions are made.<br>
<br>
4.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Trust.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The membership can see that the leaders are, by and large, working for them rather than the other way around.<br>
<br>
5.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Loot.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Some people aren't motivated by loot, but many people are, and those people to whom loot matters feel that their chances of getting the items they want are enhanced rather than diminished by their membership of the guild.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>The three main methods of loot distribution</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Every method of loot distribution has its dedicated supporters.  They all have upsides and downsides - but you do need a clear policy on how it's done.<br>
<br>
I'm not going into a discussion of NBG (`Need Before Greed`) or CAWU (`Can And Will Use`) here.  These are very slippery subjects and you usually see them used as arguments by people who want to exclude others from having a chance at receiving an item.  Every guild which employs these concepts needs to establish detailed principles on precisely what they mean and how they can be employed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Random:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Generally items are /randomed off.  It's for the individual to decide whether or not they roll - sometimes people may choose to `pass` on a roll, for various reasons.  In some variations, once someone has won one roll, they are expected to pass until everyone else on the raid has received a drop.<br>
<br>
This method can lead to someone who has made a big contribution to the guild being passed over in favour of someone else who has not made such a big contribution.  However, it has the benefit that it is seen to be fair - the leaders cannot be accused of arbitrarily assigning items to themselves.  It also means that people who attend the most raids are statistically likely to receive the most loot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Leader assigns:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The guild leader, raid leader or other loot distribution officer decides who receives items.<br>
<br>
Where the loot distribution officer is trustworthy, this system is certain to give the greatest rewards to the people who make the greatest contribution.  However, it has the drawback that it can lead to accusations of the leaders assigning the best items to themselves.  For this reason it can lead to arguments and bad feeling, particularly in situations where the leaders have not yet proved beyond all doubt that they can be trusted.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DKP:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Guild members earn points (DKP stands for Dragon Kill Points) by participating in guild activities.  They can then spend those points to `buy` loot.<br>
<br>
In practise this system faces challenges about which items are worth which amount of points, and there is also the problem of several people wanting to buy the same item.  Sometimes people can accumulate very large amounts of points without being able to spend them - and with some DKP systems, uber items can rot because nobody wants to pay the points cost for them.  Finally, the amount of record-keeping required can become very large.<br>
<br>
Famously, the uber guild &lt;Afterlife&gt; use the DKP system heavily.  By contrast, &lt;Fires of Heaven&gt; are on record as describing DKP as `gay`.<br>
<br>
In summary, there is no perfect method of loot distribution and I've found that it's best to use a mixture of methods depending upon the drop and the raid.<br>

Blood Cult's policies on recruiting and loot are PERFECT.  What an attractive guild for people in search.  For me being a recruit several months ago, I felt it a priveledge to be part of such a thing.  One thing I did notice before I left to start my own guild (also the raiding times didn't coincede with my rl schedule) is that you guys are starting to add in more Euro players, which is a very good thing for you all since the base and majority of the guild is European.<br>
I urge you not to change a thing.<br>

<br>
1. Expect to do a LOT of the work yourself. <br>
<br>
Obviously you should deligate as much responsibility as possible onto your other officers as well, to keep you sane, but you will still have to carry the majority of the workload yourself.<br>
<br>
2. Choose your officers carefully.<br>
<br>
If you are just a casual group of people, this isn't very important, but if you aim to go beyond the Hate/Fear/epics stage of the game, you are going to need strong, intelligent officers who can take charge of a situation. No matter how dedicated you are, SOMETHING is bound to come up while you are offline and it is up to your officers to lead in your place.<br>
<br>
3. Guild resources must be communal to be effective.<br>
<br>
(Disclaimer - This is in direct opposition to the current EULA) Resources such as guild banks, scouts and porters should be available for use by several, if not all officers. If a_porter04 goes to visit thier brother in Iowa for a week and he's the only one in the guild who can port to Cobalt Scar, you are crippled. Likewise, accounts with scouts on them (and don't pretend you don't know what scouts are for, everyone uses them) should be accessable by at least all of the officers.<br>
<br>
4. Know thy enemy.<br>
<br>
There is a lot of competition at the mid level on our server. As it stands now, any group of 65's can drop in and kill Kunark dragons fairly easily. Even some important Velious mobs are doable with 1 group (or in some cases, less). Keep an eye on what the competition is doing. If 30 members of a_guild06 show up in an underused zone like DN, you know they aren't there for a picnic.<br>
<br>
5. Trust is built through fairness and discipline.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what your own guild's rules may be, apply them to everyone evenly, INCLUDING YOURSELF. If your members feel that certain members of your guild are recieving special treatment or are being singled out for extra punishment, they won't trust you. Sun Tzu said it best:<br>

<br>
What I try hardest to do is to work with other guilds about our size these days. Guild alliances to work together on raids are great. They have the effect of also getting folks to know each other, so that when an LFG is up, you don't have the same sense of a pickup group if it's a guild you've raided with.<br>
<br>
About the work-load. Don't expect anyone to be able to do any one job forever. Ask them to do it for three months, then find someone else if they want to turn that over. If you delegate with a fixed time, people don't mind as much putting in the time.<br>
<br>
Some GLs are benign dictators, a model that has a lot going for it if the &quot;benign&quot; really is there. In our guild, we do run almost everything past membership for final review and comment. And we're serious about it, it isn't just a formality to keep the rank and file thinking that they are participating. Slows down getting things done, but worth it. We also now have votes of confidence on our slate of officers about every six months. We don't believe in officers for life. <br>
<br>
More important than anything, your guild's reputation is worth everything. No camp, no disagreement, no loot, nothing is worth tarnishing your guild's rep. I'm not saying that people should roll over to folks who bully their way into their camp. But there's almost always is a way to come to a meeting of the minds. We ask our members to watch their manners in ooc, shout, even on other boards. At least most of the time. We may be the very last guild to ever see the endgame once everyone else is tired of EQ or has gone on to EQ2, but we'll get there with our values intact. That matters to us a lot. <p> <font face="Arial"><div align="center"><font color="Red"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=359805" target="_blank">Epix</a></a><br>64 Sorcerer<br>Guild Leader, Grey Council on Xev<br></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub228.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="xevserverboardsfrm1">General Discussion<option value="xevserverboardsfrm7">Marketplace<option value="xevserverboardsfrm2">Raiding<option value="xevserverboardsfrm16">Poll Mania<option value="xevserverboardsfrm4">Epic Quests<option value="xevserverboardsfrm13">Trade Skills<option value="xevserverboardsfrm3">Tactics<option value="xevserverboardsfrm5">Questing<option value="xevserverboardsfrm9">Looking for Guild<option value="xevserverboardsfrm12">Guild Leading and Officership<option value="xevserverboardsfrm11">Guild Link Submission<option value="xevserverboardsfrm6">Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm26">Political Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm10">/ooc<option value="xevserverboardsfrm21">Rant Polls<option value="xevserverboardsfrm19">Archives<option value="xevserverboardsfrm15">Moderators Forum<option value="xevserverboardsfrm23">Über<option value="xevserverboardsfrm27">Ask the Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards>Xev Server Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm12>Guild Leading and Officership</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
