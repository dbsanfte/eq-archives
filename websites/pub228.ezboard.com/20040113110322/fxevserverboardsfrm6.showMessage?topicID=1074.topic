<br>
Lack of any decent rants lately and as I am not in game any more I am probably not the best person to start one (well maybe I am <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) but this old rant was bumped on the bard boards recently and is one of the better ones I have seen there<br>
<br>

Sunday rant. <br>
<br>
Had the worst time ever trying to get the last 7% I needed to get baron. Those ass-tards over at SOE started out my wonderful day with a nice easter surprise. Was wacking away at the entrance mobs in akheva. Pluggin away for about an hour and a half. Went from 74% into AA #6 to 93% into AA #6, with only a few close calls. Damn Transient patrollers, rooting dotting bastards. <br>
<br>
Um, well it was going good, that is until some half brained idiot at SOE, trying to pull easter eggs out his pie-hole, decided to trip the cord to VZ and drop the server on me. Oh yeah, way to start off my easter by logging back on after server reset to see I was F****IN rolled back to frickin 83%. <br>
<br>
After refereeing a spectacular battle between my fists and the keyboard, one in which I almost went Tyson and chewed off my spacebar, I convinced my girlfriend to join me in my &quot;gameplay experience&quot;. After all, nothing like dragging loved ones into your grief right? I was happy she agreed. Usually she doesnt like playing with me when im upset, but she saw how bad I wanted baron. <br>
<br>
Its hard to find competent players nowadays in this land of the lvl 1 monk fungi twink running around asking for 3 pp to buy his &quot;spells&quot; because he doesn't know the value of the gear his &quot;RL friend&quot; gave him/her (hello you have a fungi!), let alone the fact that &quot;you don't get no spells jack!, you're a monk!!&quot; <br>
<br>
Oh, and don't let me forget the joy of arguing with a lvl 24 necro when I was on my 24 monk alt, who swore to the grp he had 265 INT. Made all the more great when the grp took his side because they were all first toon n00bs who thought this guy was a god because he had a robe and a sickle and his name was Nekro. <br>
<br>
Way to go on picking a name bro. 2 thumbs up for originality. Bet he has a pet named Cat at home. <br>
<br>
We attempted to do akheva again after grabbing a c3, only to find that 2 n00b grps had set up at both zonelines, one on akheva side, one on maidens side. They would zone every add at every pull attempt, successfully training each other every five minutes when each grp would try to zone at the same time only to find themselves face to face with each others mobs. Way to go retards, maybe if you are lucky, the mobs on each side will cancel each other out. Oh, nothing like summoning a pet getting it buffed and then zoning it.......x5. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ho hum. Where to now?&gt; <br>
<br>
Hey, heres a great idea, lets do POD! WEEE&gt;. Cant begin to express my newfound hate for this zone, compounded by the rejected inbreds we gathered along the way. We succeded in rounding up a grp of gamers who seemd to have progressed directly from playing pong to playing EQ. Zone into this delightfull little zone that looks like a closeup of the Brundle Fly's balls, and could already see the way it was gonna go when within 2 seconds we hear &quot;train to zone!&quot; <br>
<br>
Well, mages are at the top of my hate list now, simply for the fact that they loathe their own classes abilities. After hearing this eurudite mage complain about resummoning his pet and his pet's gear after the 5th time we had to evac, I began to get a little perturbed. I ended up lashing out at the a**-tard, letting him know in plain terms that if he didn't feel like summoning pets or gear anymore, I didn't feel like pulling, slowing and hitting mobs anymore. <br>
<br>
That silenced him. Obviously he wasn't smart enough to notice the last 4 times we evaced it was his damn fault. Don't know what he was smoking on but I swear there were times his pet never even touched a mob for the length of a fight, those usually being the ones I called evac on. Very nice of him to use his AOE 3 wave nuke also when we have a shorty and a elf in the grp. Im sure they enjoyed the 3 waves of 600 damage coming down on them mid fight and almost whipping us. How in the hell he made it to 60 on this server without knowing its cross team pvp I don't know. <br>
<br>
I swear he also had a hot key that said &quot;another one?&quot; everytime I asked for a mod rod. Well sh*t you a**whipe, seeing as how im doing all the work and using all my mana, your damn right I want another one. <br>
<br>
Woo, then a cleric joined us, oh happy day. A guild cleric for that matter. Not my guild of course , thank god im unguilded. But one of those pompous guild clerics leaving the grp every five minutes to &quot;rez a guildie&quot; and expecting his place to be held. <br>
<br>
So, we got a mage that hates summoning pets and gear, a cleric that is so busy leaving the gpr every five minutes to rez guildies that we'll probably end up needing rezzes when he does choose to come back, and , the icing on the cake,.........a bard joins who immediately announces ,&quot; I don't really feel like twisting, can I just melee?&quot; <br>
<br>
Why surrrree you can, go right ahead. And while your just meleeing, im going to sit here and summon food, yeah!, and maybe the druid can forage a bit. Oh, whats that? The cleric just wants to nuke? Right on! Hey hey guys, lets get a shaman who doesn't want to buff, a wizard that doesn't want to nuke and a warrior that doesn't want to tank!! WE WILL BE UBA!! RAAAA!. We will be the anti group, scoffing at our roles and leaving a trail of corpses to the zoneline. What a truly new and unique idea. <br>
<br>
To add insult to injury, there was a same level bard swarm kiting over the hill from us, easily swarm kiting 8 mobs around and making godly xp im sure. I felt like grabbing our bard by the scruff of his neck like a dog who just crapped on the carpet, dragging him over to the other bard, sticking his nose in her mobs and saying , &quot;LOOK!! LOOK AT WHAT YOU CAN DO! LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL!!&quot; <br>
<br>
Well after killing a few rats and some of those upside down cow udder looking piles of whatever goo with my anti group, me and my girl decided to move on. It was not a day for us to be babysitting lazy players waiting on their Easter ham. 20 minutes later while in baz, the cleric tells me &quot;where you guys go?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;we are rezzing a guildie &quot;......there, let him think on that one. <br>
<br>
Finished the day off being followed around by some n00b beastlord who knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that as long as he asked politely and was persistent, I would gladly give him every piece of gear I was wearing. <br>
<br>
After all, im red to him so im Donald F-ing Trump right? Make way for Steve Forbes cause I con red! To add insult to injury, I gave him 20pp and he responded &quot;that's it?&quot; OMFG. Let a beggar on the street say &quot;that's it?&quot; to me if I give him change, ill give him a good boot to the dome to make that bottle of wild turkey he buys all the much more useful in &quot;easing the pain&quot;. <br>
<br>
The only joy I had was the fact that I logged back on at 9pm and got my baron. It was surprisingly quiet in Akheva by that time, guess the street lights had come on and all the n00bs had to be home. <p>Formerly Pizzicato<br>
