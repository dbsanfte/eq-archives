<br>
And that we did, we scored a house in one of the nicer neighborhoods in Phoenix (Awhatukee, for you locals), things have been working out great, the neighborhood is nice, the nieghbors are understanding about parties, things have been great.<br>
<br>
... Then the shit started happening. One night after carpooling to a movie, we arrive home at about 2am and my car had been egged. I was extremely pissed off ... I wanted to find the bastard that perpetrated on my property and showed complete disregard for the feelings of anyone else. But I understood at the same time, that things could have been worse, and that I should have appreciated the fact that whoever the dumbshit was, didn't decide to break into my car and steal my stereo, my disc changer, my subwoofers, or my CD's, instead they just chose to take the dumbshit fucking highschool route and egg it.<br>
<br>
I dealt with it, and in time I really wasn't upset anymore. I mean, I didn't like the fact that my car got egged, but hell, it was just teenagers being teenagers. (Being almost 21 myself, I understood that we all do stupid things during that very ackward time of our lives)<br>
<br>
A few days ago, not one, not two, not three, but FOUR of my roommates (there's 6 people total in our 5 bedroom house) had their car broken into. We lost everything from subwoofers to University text books ... and the lack of respect for other people's property really hit me then. I've had my stereo stolen back in Tucson, but a few weeks after it happened, I realized that it was a fact of life of living in the big city. <br>
<br>
But this time it's completely personal, whoever the punk ass kid was that stole the shit out of (at least) 4 fucking vehicles parked in our neighborhood knew what they were doing, they knew that they were hitting a household of 19-22 year old guys, and stealing their shit.<br>
<br>
What gets me is that they came back TWO NIGHTS in a row. Maybe the little fucker that stole my roommate's stereos, debit cards, credit cards, and school books wasn't the same guy that egged my car to begin with, but it doesn't matter, I'm sick and fucking tired of this complete lack of respect for the belongings of another human being, tonight I take it into my own hands.<br>
<br>
If this guy is fucking stupid enough to come back and make yet another attempt at stealing any of our belongings, he'll be in for a suprise.<br>
<br>
We won't hurt him, but imagine the look of embarrassment on his face when the police roll up to arrest him, as his hands and feet are zip tied together, and he's lying on our tile floor.<br>
<br>
To any fuckers out there that have ever stolen someone else's personal belongings out of their vehicle, house, or anything else, I wish the same shit upon you.<br>
<br>
Die in a fucking fire, slowly, motherfuckers.<br>

They broke lights in the park, and knocked over at least one of those engraved stone memorial things, which shattered it into pieces. How shitty can people get?? <br>

To top it off, things like this and your story, Rinq, just trashes the reputation teenagers have even more. <br>

Now I know that the sort of people that pull this kind of shit must have at least the social responsibility of a Hawkestone member but doing that brings the whole thing to a new level of depravity. I think it was two years ago when an old peoples home was burgled and they lost everything, a local tv company ran an appeal for them and they were able to buy alot of the stuff back and get some presents again and may have restored their faith in humanity a little when they were burgled again. The police think it was the same people who had followed the coverage of it and had seen on the tv that there was now more stuff to nick.<br>

And, I say take the &quot;won't&quot; out and hurt him a little bit. It doesn't have to be punching or whatever, but squeeze the zip ties down a bit more than needed. Hog-tie the bastard(s), gag him and maybe mess with his head a bit. It just might do the trick to even the score. Then after a couple of hours hog tied and being fucked with he might just think twice about burglarizing anyone in the near future.<br>
