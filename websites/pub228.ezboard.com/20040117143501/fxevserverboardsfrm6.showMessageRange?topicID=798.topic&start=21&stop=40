First some back ground so people will understand where I am coming from. I am a former member of the military, my father and grandfather were also in the military and we all served in combat (as a note none of us stayed in for more then 6 years). After my time in the military I went to college at SDSU (San Diego State University). SDSU has a large student body of mostly minorities ( only about 30 % is white). The campus has a free speech are where pretty much anything goes. One day the schools MeChe organization ( Mexican, Chicano, Hispanic) was holding a protest where they walked around with coffins drapped with Mexican flags. They ended there protest by burning the American flag in the middle of the free speech area. One of my friends that I was walking with asked me if it upset me that they were burning the flag that I had spent so much of my time fighting for and had lost good friends while doing so. My response was that even though I personally don't like to see the flag burned, I see it as their right to do so and that it is people like me that have given them the right to do it. So with that in mind just take the email listed above as the joke it was ment to be. But please remember that the people who serve in the military do so for us, because they feel that the freedoms we all enjoy are worth fighting and sometimes dieing for.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.flamingtext.com/ezb.html"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://ezb.flamingtext.com/ezb/2003/03/24/flamingtext_com_1048561474_25464.gif" style="border:0;"alt="Image by FlamingText.com"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

first you scroll through the text you want to copy..then do ctrl-c or edit&gt;copy to copy the text.<br>
<br>
then hit  Reply like normal to reply<br>
<br>
then you hit the quoted button on the left of where you would normally type your reply. then hit ctrl-v or edit&gt;paste to paste inthe quote OR if you just want to handtype it it is this<br>
<br>
[ quote ]paste the text in here[ /quote ]<br>
<br>
<br>
but you need to leave the space out before and after quote (i had to put spaces in so it didnt actually use the quote commands)<br>
<br>
hope that helps. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/88/88432/pages/232123/ggpp11.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=daemuniscariot>Daemun Iscariot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#330000>(6/21/03 8:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=798.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An email I liked but I am sure most of you will rip apar</span><hr size=1> 1. Fuck the National Anthem. when it was written, it meant something. now, it is a pretty song that no longer holds true, describing a country that no longer exists, if it ever did. in school i refused to say the pledge of allegiance. at a singing of the national anthem, i have heard it enough times, i will talk, fuck, take a shit, do whatever the fuck else i want while its being sung, including possibly crankiing up my stereo to play &quot;International Hate Anthem&quot; if you have a problem with it, feel free to step up so i can...kick your ass. <br>
<br>
2. if i buy a fucking flag from WalMart, i will burn it, wipe my ass on it, use it to clean up messes my kid made, or hang it upside down outside my house. its my flag, i bought it, and it means dick anyway. i will do what i want with it . if you dont like it, feel free to report to Missouri, where i will...kick your ass and use the flag to mop your blood from my floor before i deposit it where it belongs. in the trash. <br>
<br>
3. i have every respect for veterans of wars that defended our country and others from attack. however, a war like that hasnt been fought since my grandfather was young.  every war our country has been involved in since after world war two was a sham, a fake, and all about money. respect that ? no fucking way. if you blindly followed orders and got shot in your ass its your problem. if you have a problem with it, feel free to drop by and tell me about it. i wont bother to kick your ass because its already been kicked by someone whos country you were blindly following orders and invaded. <br>
<br>
4. i'll petend to be whatever the fuck i want. if i want to dress up in a fake looking uniform and say i lost my leg in nam i'll goddamn well do it. if you dont like it, feel free to drop by, where i will stick the aforementioned lost leg up your ass. <br>
<br>
5 and 6 are stupidity and i wont bother to respond. <br>
<br>
7. Roseanne can sing whatever the fuck she wants, whenever the fuck she wants. and as we have already covered, the national Anthem is just a song and a meaningless one at that. dont make such a big deal out of it. <br>
<br>
8. if the flag goes by me in a parade, i will be fucking amazed and wondering how the fuck i got to some patriotic parade anyway. so my parents happened to fuck here, so what ? i wish they had fucked in france.  i will never stand, raise my hand to my heart or show any respect until a reason is given to show it. i respect the past of this country and what it could have become. but i do NOT respect what it is now. the biggest bully in the world. <br>
<br>
9, 10, 11 are all unworthy of comment. <br>
<br>
12. ask the government where Osama is. he was their agent for the longest time. he never could have built his network or armed his people without government support. our government. <br>

13. i'll call you whatever the fuck i like, jarhead. <br>

Your funny man.  All you folks think you are being all tough saying how fucked up America is and that you hate this place and how there are so many other places you would rather be.  <br>
<br>
Well, get the fuck out if it is so bad.  Canada isn't too far away, nor is Mexico.<br>
<br>
Everytime you spout of that shit, you just reaffirm to us that it is a great place and you do like it.  Your just too fucking ignorant to understand that you, by talking all that crap, and by your actions alone, you epitimose (i know I fucked up that spelling) what it is to be American.  You can say what you want, and do what you want (to some extent, there are boundaries to saying and doing what you want).  <br>
<br>
Knucklehead, you are what makes America great.  Just keep spouting all your ignorant rhetoric.  <br>

<br>
Veterans fight for our rights to have freedoms. Unfortunatly some of those freedoms are ones that they may not like, but they should respect them since that is after all what they are fighting for. Then again, people &quot;should&quot; respect those that fight for those freedoms. Even though they have the right not to respect them for whatever reasons.<br>
<br>
That email sounds overly republican to me, and I wonder if the person who posted that was actually fighting in a war, or if they were just a rich meathead, lookin for a fight or talkin big to be cool. Because most of my uncles who have served, wouldnt wish it on their worse enemies to go through half the stuff they went through in vietnam. So kicking some ass wasnt one of their wishes when they returned. More like, lets have some peace and quiet over here. Because in reality, war is hell! Its dirty, unforgiving, and is foul smelling to say the least in many situations. <br>
<br>
1000's of irreplacable lives are lost in the names of 2 leaders who probably wont see a day on the actual battlefield. Yet all we do try to back them as if its some game we play to entertain ourselves. WAR IS NOT A GAME! Quit making it sound like that, and quit trying to glorify it. Dying on a battlefield with your intestines hanging out of your stomach, stinking of the foulest burned flesh/feces/intestanal juices, not to mention prolly the most severe pain you could possibly imagine is NOT very honorable, nor would any soldier wish to die in such a fashion. And now imagine if that was your friend out their. Your trying to save him, but you cant do anything about it, because some random stray bullet coming from some nameless guys gun, hits your friend who has never met that person before, and hell might even be friends with him if they werent told to hate eachother. Standing over your good friend who stinks of rotting corpse and all of the above smells, imagining that it could be you there if that bullet were only pointed a 1/10th of a degree to the right. Thats the harsh reality's of war, and all your bullshit &quot;lets kick some ass&quot; holds no ground. America shouldnt be about kicking some ass, because kicking some ass in terms of WAR is not going out and having a boxing match. &quot;Kicking some ass&quot; costs countless lives. And individualistically, each one of those who lose their lives had friends and family back home who deeply miss them, and if they were to see the way that person died, theyd be damaged for life. Heads ripped in half by bullets, limbs blown clean off from landmines, bodies vaporizing in plane crashes. Each one of these people had deaths unimaginably gruesome, yet we think of them as nothing more than a few loses while &quot;kicking some ass&quot;<br>
<br>
So lets stop kicking so much ass, and be a little more tolerant eh? Maybe because my uncle who was in vietnam im a little more against war than most. He cant wear shorts because of the amount of shrapnel scars he has on his legs is to repulsive for most people to handle. And the fact that he had to witness countless crew members on his PT boat die while he laid waiting to be rescued in the jungles after the boat was destroyed from a mortar round. He never seen who shot that round either. All they could hear was a round being shot off, then seconds later, his world was blowing up around him. 10 years of night terrors later, he finally was able to talk to people about the incident. So when you start talking about &quot;kicking some ass!&quot; lets remember what becomes of it. And make sure the sacrifices individual people are going to make, is going to be worth all the trauma they will be going through. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=639331">Uthyr Pendragyn 65 Warlord of &lt;Stormwind&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aalandandustbone>Aalandan Dustbone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>My Epic Procs Babies</span><br>  Posts: 564<br> <font color=#330000>(6/22/03 5:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=798.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://users.ev1.net/~stang73/aalpics/aalwarlockrobe.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An email I liked but I am sure most of you will rip apar</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Authored by Father Dennis Edward O'Brien, Sergeant, USMC <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Oh and Daemun, lick the underside of my exwifes colon hairs, you self righteous selfish anti-american prick.  <br>
<br>
Only a lame ass fuck monkey with the IQ of the geneticaly manipulated lovechild of Bill Clinton, Al Franken and Barbara Streisand would have any possible stretch of agreement with you in your ferret-shit covered opinion.<br>
<br>
People like Daemun need to let me know when they are running thru Houston next so I can shove a full 100% size 11 american boot up their self righteous asses so far that when they open their mouth next to stick out their tongues at yet another flag, people will see &quot;Oil-resistant&quot; on it from the bottom of my boot from 25 feet away.<br>

Why not move to some communist socialist marxist country with Crylin and the other liberal fuksmokers....Canada is close, but when we move in and take over cause we want paper and firewood, you will be right back where you started, so you might consider other options.<br>
<br>
I suggest buying one of the extra Japanese islands they have for sale.  Gather up all the losers who feel the same as you.  Then let us know here in the US when you get there so we can toss a couple hundred ICBMs your way.  Obsolete as far as the arms race goes, they will more than serve their purpose in wiping your diseased-covered baboon-cock-smoking asses.<br>

i'm anti patriotism. until i have a reason to be proud to live here, i choose not to be. and the people who act so proud make me sick, because face it, there is nothing to be proud of. i wish there was. i wish i could put a flag outside my house and believe that what it stands for is reality. but its not. <br>

if i could redesign the american flag now, to make it more properly represent what this country stands for, it would just be a black background, with a big, white $ right in the middle of it. <br>

In your previous post you said that that you think people are funny because theythink they're all tough by the talk shit saying how bad the country is. <br>
I was saying that there are people who talk shit about the country all the time and would like to move, but show up to a parade or have a flag on their house and think they're the most patriotic people around. <br>
Voicing your problems with where you live doesn't mean that person has to leave. Simply means they've chosen to live with it.

<br>
It's probably something to do with not being forced to salute my flag each day and recite the pledge of allegience. But still.<br>
<br>
Patriotism to me, Is being proud that you are British. To accept that the fact that we all live together on this little rainy island and as such, while we may not always agree, we all have something in common.<br>
<br>
Patriotism to me, is being able to accept that your country has flaws, and isn't perfect, but love your country all the same.<br>
<br>
Patriotism is Embracing your country.<br>
<br>
A flag is just that, a fucking flag, it's a piece of cloth. No matter what you say about it. The peice of cloth however, means something different to everyone.<br>
<br>
In Bradford (a racially diverse town in north England) The Union jack can symbolise racism.<br>
In Buckingham palace, it represents the monarchy.<br>
<br>
In Wembly (as was). The English flag symbolises David Beckham.<br>
<br>
If you burn a flag in any of those places, they all have a different meaning. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to bitch at anyone for burning a flag, because your just burning a peice of cloth.<br>
I will bitch at people at their reasons for burning the flag.<br>
<br>
Now, England, is probably more patriotic than america in many ways, or at least was before 911.<br>
<br>
We just don't display it with saluting flags, hanging them in our back garden, or hacking al jazeera displaying patriotic messages. <br>
<br>
We muddle a long our every day lives and come together, where patriotism has no real relevance, then when something comes a long where we need to, everyone bands together and demonstrates how patriotic they are.<br>
<br>
But, however, were edging towards nationalism, because in all honesty, we all think, deep down that the british could do it better. <br>
<br>
The yanks are fat, arrogant and stupid,<br>
The frogs, are well french and loosers,<br>
The towel-heads and slitty eyes are inferior. (phrase coined by the Duke of Edinborough)<br>
And the australians are only good for making day-time TV programming and the occasional popstar.<br>
<br>
This is all well and good, because there's never really been anything coming from it, asside from the occasional 'how many yanks does it take to change a lightbulb' joke.<br>
<br>
Now, when it slides, as I have started to see in america, it becomes a whole lot scarier. Fierce Nationalism is one of the worst precidents in history.<br>
<br>
It seems, to me as lowly johnny-foreigner that :<br>
<br>
1.) You are right. always<br>
2.) You can do no wrong. Ever<br>
3.) The whole world should Shut up and thank you when it's all done.<br>
4.) you have the power, you should use it.<br>
5.) People always criticise, they are always wrong.<br>
<br>
Now, some of those will be correct. It's the whole aura that people I have talked to Excude which gets me.<br>
<br>
Because :<br>
<br>
1.) You will not always do the right thing.<br>
2.) You will occasionaly be wrong.<br>
3.) the whole world, maybe wrong, but it never hurts to listen. <br>
4.) You have the power, use it when you really need it.<br>
5.) Sometimes people who criticise are right.<br>
<br>
A lot of people will generally say they accept the second list, when they really don't. <br>
<br>
This is nationalism, and it's fucking scary. <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, As for troops.<br>
<br>
I will always be behind my troops 100%, on the pre-condition that I can find a glimmer of justification with the general orders they are given.<br>
<br>
My troops protect my freedom. As long, as in some way, they are doing so, or protecting someone elses, I will be behind them.<br>
<br>
However. The charge of american troops at least is to 'fight the enemy, both foreign and domestic', or words to that effect, I don't see it as being that different in the UK.<br>
<br>
If, they are given an order, which there is no glimmer of justification, the person giving that order, becomes a domestic enemy, and while the best course of action isn't to bayonett that person, it's up to the soldier not to follow that order.<br>
<br>
As for consequences, any man who joins the armed services, is risking his life for something he beleives in. Refusing to risk his life for something he beleives in, is no worse morally.<br>
<br>
I am fiercly patriotic. I love my country. I love the people. I love the monarchy. Fuck, I even enjoy the rain.<br>
<br>
This is my little Island, I consider it my own (and 62 million others), If I had nothing, I would still have my country.<br>
<br>
I don't care that people don't know all the verses of God Save the queen, or don't fly a flag outside, because it really doesn't mean shit. I don't care that people aren't proud to call themselves british.<br>
<br>
Calling yourself british doesn't make you a friend, saying your not doesn't make you an enemy.<br>
<br>
I am. I'm British, and I'm proud to say I am. <br>
<br>
In my opinion that is patriotism. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Freedom is wasted on the free.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
