They can range anywere from: Anything that mildly annoy's. too things that accually make you plan out someones kidnap, tortue, and eventual death.<br>
<br>
1) People that feel the need to  /hail, the damn magus everysingle goddamn time they need to goto one of the adventure camps. I accually stood in North ro camp and watched a whole 35 person raiding party /hail the magus. Yes everysingle one of them felt the need to /hail that slut. You know where you need to go, you know the camp name so why spam the camp?<br>
<br>
2) Clerics and gem loots: Peridot=11ish plat. Average gem drop cost 46ish to 240ish plat. Casting HP buff on group anywere from 1 to 6 peridots. At most you have spent 66ish plat. I dont see why you need 4 Blue Diamonds 6 diamonds and 7 fire emeralds, just cause you casted 1 freaking 11 plat buff on me. Hell for that matter I dont see why you even need 2 gem drops. 1 diamond or BD for example more then covers the cost of the buff you gave me or group. I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU RICH.<br>
<br>
3) Toon names: Ran into a Shadow knight the other day with the name &quot;Dontkillmepleze&quot;. Shadowknights lords of fear and hate, spreading destruction and chaos in there wake named &quot;Dontkillmepleze?!?!? And a bard named &quot;runninglesbolicker&quot;. I can understand wanting to have a funny name or a name that has something to do with you class but WTF were you thinking?<br>
<br>
4) Bazaar: Some of you people I would like to grab by the ear's and puke in your face. Aside from the folks that sell bread or cloth armor for 1 million plat, its you assholes that will undercut someones cost by 10 plat or 1 plat. Sorry but if you want to make  your product a good buy then make it a good buy. I will and have gone out of my way to buy the more expencive item for 10 plat more just to spite you. Example: bought a Wide bladed greatsword the other day. There were 2 for sale one was for 8000, the other was for 7999. Guess what mister 7999 your not makeing a sale today. Now if it was for 7800 or even 7900 I would have bought yours, but sence you desided to be a cheep ass money grubbing pawn broker I bought the other one.<br>
<br>
5) PvP arena: If your going to go and PvP that is fine, but I am getting real tired of you vaginal drips out there that feel the need to grief someone by nukeing/dispelling then running for cover behind the gates outside of the PvP arena. Moral of the story is DONT BE SUCH A PUSSY. Walk in and get <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :owned --><img src=http://members.cox.net/skoriksis/smilies/owned.gif ALT=":owned"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  properly. I meen what have you really got to lose? Its not like you can be looted by someone.<br>
<br>
6) Shammy/chanter vs BL slows: I have alot of respect for our shammys and chanters for what they have to do and put up with. When I first started playing on rallos zek server in 1999 the word mez and slow were unheard of, most didnt even bother casting them. But I swear that some of you have taken a personal dislike to Me and other Beastlords slowing. Had a chanter in one of my LDON groups he is a good chanter dont get me wrong but it really annoyed me when he said &quot;ill be slowing everything ok?&quot; And in truth I didnt have a prob with that , other then the fact that my slow is 1.9 casting time 150 mana and 65%. We had 7 adds on a bad pull, I had them all slowed by the time he had 2 of them slowed. I do this for good reasons. <br>
A) Pre slowing to reduse agro. When a BL slows do you ever notice that the shammy/chanter dosnt take agro after they land there better slows, mez, debuffs?<br>
B) Pre slowing to reduce INC ouches. Sorry but on a bad pull its much better to have 7 pissed off slowed mobs then it is to have 7 pissed off unslowed mobs.<br>
C) This is for chanters: Instead of spending mana on mez's and slows, why not just spend mana on mez's. Your slow is only 5% better, not exactly a huge difference. You can then spend mana on mana taps, nukes, cripple or what ever. Moral of this story: LEARN TO WORK TOGATHER.<br>
<br>
7) /hail: Dont freaking /hail me. I'm not a quest NPC. If you want to say hi then say hi.<br>
<br>
8) beast crack prz: Guess what? There is no spell in the whole of EQ history called beastcrack, pussycrack, or kitty crack. Call it by its name or appropriate abbreviation. Example: SD please, Spirtual dominion please. Ask me for beastcrack? Ok here ya go.../moon. I once made a guy logg off and go look up the name of the spell, I refuse to buff you if you cant show respect and call one of my abilities by what it is called and not use lazy slang.<br>
<br>
9) Soandso is inspecting your underwear: Dont come up to me inspect me then ask for buffs and or links to my stuff without asking first. People will say &quot; Well its not like they are looking down your shirt or pants now ar they?&quot;..Umm I have rings on I also am wearing gloves, how can you see my rings unless you take off my gloves? Yes I know some of you say so what. But hey this is a peeve's and annoynace thread, and that annoys me. Moral of the story SHOW RESPECT AND ASK FIRST.<br>
<br>
10) Bards: Bards that play only one song at a time, or bards that only play songs and that is it, no melee no nothing, they just sit there and finger fuck there flute for hours.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :321 --><img src=http://www.computerpannen.com/cwm/contrib/geno/321.gif ALT=":321"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
11) Can I get away with one more bard hate?: Bards that play there songs in heavily populated areas. You know what im talking about. Those used tampons that love practice there horn skills at the banks in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
Well thats it for now I think. I'm shure there is plenty more that I havent thought of or cant think of yet.<br>

They're only out of their minds if they don't sell for what they are putting them up for.  How do you &quot;judge&quot; whether a price is too high or not?  These things don't have an inherent, objective measure of worth; they are worth whatever someone is willing to pay for them.  If you put something up for sale at 10K when there are people willing to pay 80K then you need your head examining. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sajinta>Sajinta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>wtt c5 for cyb0rz</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#330000>(11/14/03 8:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1136.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Game related Peeve's and annoyance's</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>C) This is for chanters: Instead of spending mana on mez's and slows, why not just spend mana on mez's.

WHAT the fucking hell is up with these anal plugs asking 18K for Dark Forge armor (the SK epic stuff)?  I walked into the bazaar one night, looked to see what sorts fo prices it would be ... and HOLY SHIT!!<br>
<br>
Unless I miss my guess, the only use for this stuff anymore is the SK epic.  Unless I have not read the card right, the ENTIRE GODDAMN EPIC isn't worth the 54K this shitstain was asking for the three pieces of armor needed to BEGIN the quest.  Now I have heard others tell me that the stuff usually runs for 500p for the entire set, but for some reason, I NEVER see this.  THe lowest I have seen it so far was 5.5k for the helm and 8k for the BP.  Granted, 13.5 k and the grieves (which I have yet to see again) was MUCH better than the 54, but I can STILL think of HUNDREDS of things I would rather have than outdated armor to begin a quest for an outdated weapon that serves little more than a bragging right.  ESPECIALLY for that much money.<br>
<br>
But ... it is the bazaar, and if they want to let a toon sit on their account offering items that nobody in their right mind would buy, (/shrug) more power to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnipgnoppikpok>Gnipgnop Pikpok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Yucky, yet Yummy</span><br>  Posts: 850<br> <font color=#330000>(11/14/03 9:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1136.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/88/88432/pages/316024/ghandi.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Game related Peeve's and annoyance's</span><hr size=1> 3 words: supply and demand <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.bellsouth.net/coDataImages/p/Groups/88/88432/pages/319302/211b.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Also, I was on my Rogue alt on a mid 40's lvl LDoN adventure.  The group was trying to decide who was gonna pull.  I say how about the bard?  The bard, named Karryokee, for those that always wonder, then informs me that &quot;Are you crazy? Bards dont pull!! We dont have the hit points.&quot;  I sat there stunned for a moment.

Please outlaw random rolling in the following zones:<br>
<br>
1.  Bazaar<br>
2.  PoK<br>
3.  Nexus<br>
<br>

About hailing the Magus.  I've noticed sometimes the magus won't pay attention to a port request, especially if you're not standing right in front of them or they haven't been hailed in a while.  I've said a zone three or four times in front of one without getting ported, then had to hail it.  Spamming it is a different story, but they apparently have to be hailed once in a while to be active.<br>

Look, if you are gonna single pull all day, don't tell me to just med and heal.  I can't med past a full mana bar, so let me nuke, stun or melee at the very least.  When people start needing heals, I know how to back away from your single pull and cast a heal.<br>
<br>
Now, if you are gonna make it challenging by pulling multiple mobs then I will be happy to just med and heal.<br>
<br>
And by the way, I don't ask for gem drops.  If I get some, fine, if not, fine.<br>
<br>
And by the way, that goes for xp groups...if we are raiding something, then I'll do as the Raid leader says.  If I'm one of the main healers, I'll stick to that role.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=558439" target="top">Lledier Hosen</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Dwarven Cleric of Brell - L53 - Dragons of Xev.<br>
