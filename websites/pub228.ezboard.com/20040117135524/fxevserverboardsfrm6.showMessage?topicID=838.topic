BBC world affairs editor John Simpson has called on the US government to investigate why more journalists were killed by American soldiers than by any other means during the Iraq war.<br>
Simpson blamed the deaths of many of the journalists - what he called &quot;the ultimate act of censorship&quot; - on the system of embedding, which meant that journalists operating independently of US and British troops became &quot;potential targets&quot;.<br>
<br>
Of the 16 journalists who lost their lives within the space of just 21 days in the Gulf conflict, five died as a result of &quot;depressingly explainable&quot; accidents, three were killed by the Iraqis and seven died at the hands of the American forces, according to Simpson. <br>
<br>
The sixteenth, Australian photojournalist Paul Moran, died when a suicide bomber blew him up in northern Iraq.<br>
<br>
&quot;In this war, the Americans were more than twice as dangerous to the proper exercise of journalism, the freedom of reporters to see for themselves what was happening, as the Iraqis were,&quot; said Simpson, delivering the Reuters memorial lecture today at St Catherine's College, Oxford.<br>
<br>
The veteran war correspondent was himself injured in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; incident, in which the BBC's Kurdish translator, Kamran Abdurrazak Muhammed, was killed by a bomb dropped by a US warplane.<br>
<br>
Simpson insisted he was not pursuing an anti-American agenda, but warned: &quot;I do think it's incumbent on us to try to find out why the Americans killed so many journalists, if only to persuade the Bush administration and American public opinion that something went very wrong this time, and that in the next war - if there is another one, that is - the US military should be a great deal more careful.&quot;<br>
<br>
The decision to embed reporters with US and British troops was &quot;at the root&quot; of the problem, Simpson said. <br>
<br>
&quot;It was clear that the only journalists who impinged on the conscience of the American soldiers and pilots were those who were 'embedded'. Anyone out there in the open was a potential target,&quot; he added.<br>
<br>
Of the 11 journalists killed by military action, only three were embeds, while the other eight were reporting under their own steam as unilaterals.<br>
<br>
American soldiers did not kill journalists on purpose, said Simpson, but out of &quot;a mixture of blind panic, inadequate street training, and complete and utter ignorance&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;When journalists are killed by soldiers who panic or fail to exercise proper judgment, this should be rigorously investigated, and those responsible punished,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not because journalists are so wonderful, not because they are special in any way, but because their activities have a direct bearing on some of our most important liberties and the general health of our society.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think journalists the world over have a right to expect that the United States government will examine these cases and take action where necessary,&quot; Simpson added.<br>
<br>
The only incident that raised questions over whether it was deliberate or not, according to Simpson, was the bombing of the Baghdad offices of Arabic satellite television channel al-Jazeera, in which the station's correspondent, Tariq Ayoub, was killed.<br>
<br>
It was not the first time al-azeera has been attacked by American forces. The Qatar-based channel's Kabul office was bombed during the war in Afghanistan in 2001.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am profoundly disturbed by attacks on news organisations which broadcast news which the generals happen not to like,&quot; Simpson said.<br>
<br>
Other journalists who died as a result of action by the US military include ITN's Terry Lloyd, who was killed in a &quot;friendly fire&quot; incident on March 22.<br>
<br>
Lloyd's colleagues, French cameraman Fred Nerac and Lebanese driver/ translator Hussein Osman, who were with him when he died, remain missing presumed dead.<br>
<br>
Reuters cameraman Taras Protsyuk and Jose Couso, a cameraman with the Spanish TV station Telecinco were both killed on April 8 when a US tank opened fire on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad, which was the main base for foreign journalists in the Iraqi capital.<br>
<br>
Simpson's speech in Oxford opened a weekend of discussions on the reporting of the Iraq war<br>

It's the men and women in the Armed Forces who allow that liberty.  Now we're the bad guys eh??  I guess FlyBoys like me can't be blamed...we just load the planes w/ bombs...now if an entire tent city of reporters got wiped out by and &quot;accidental&quot; bomb being dropped from a US plane, then i'd worry.  <br>
<br>
These reporters knew that there was a risk in war, and conflicts.  They give their lives, just like we do when they put themselves in that position.  Except, they don't realize that in more peaceful times, especially in wars like the Gulf/Desert Storm, and even in T.W.A.T*The war on terrorism* the most casualties, meaning not only death, but any type of casualties such as incapacitation, etc., come from some form of complacency in the field.  Don't forget guys that we are not robots, we're humans, flesh and blood.  We have the same capabilities of being complete and utter idiots as anyone else.  You'd be surprised how many troops come in from Korea, Japan, the Middle East, etc. that have fallen off of the back of a Humvee that was going full-speed because he decided to moon some citizens...or other cases like Private Johnny accidentally shooting Airman Bob in the foot because he forgot there was a safety on his 9mil...I'm not saying these guys are not to be blamed, but before anyone passes judgement on myself and my comrades in arms, just know that anyone willing to step out on a battle field, armed are not is basically gambling w/ his or her life.  The men and women in the armed forces, both British and American are highly trained and not to be fucked w/...obviously the media left some tid-bits out of the story as usual, and saying something like this is Media Censorship is such bullshit...are they saying troops took 8 or more reporters out in the desert and shot them execution style or something??  It's all bullshit...until i get the real story i'm not going to take this as easily as they'd like to shove it down our throats.  Just know all, that we are the good-guys, not the enemies, and when the nation comes under military take-over, aka MARTIAL LAW, you'll all be handled accordingly /jokes off<br>

US soldiers.</span><hr size=1> SL, I lub j00, but I have to reply.<br>
<br>
More media were killed in the war by US soldiers than by any means.<br>
<br>
Let me single out one of the words in that sentence.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>War</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
Accidents happen. Bullets and explosions and grenades are going off everywhere - the mission is to kill the enemy, generally. Those reporters went to the front lines knowing the danger they were placing themselves in - if they didn't, then they were incredibly ignorant.<br>
<br>
To get to my point(eventually) - As someone who serves in the military(albeit very bitterly, I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sign the damn dotted line), I live less than 30 miles from the DMZ in Korea. I know that if North Korea decides to make an attack, I've got approximately 7-8 minutes to live. Eventually it's a certainty that US/RoK forces would drive them back, but those of us up as far up north as I am would die, really no question. We're very easily within artillery range - hell, Seoul is also, and many of us are much farther north than that. The first thing I was told when I got to my camp was &quot;Ok, that way's North&quot;. Because that's the way I'll probably be shooting, if I even get time to draw my weapon after an initial attack. And with all this hanging in the air every minute of every day as long as I'm there, I can say that even this is nothing compared to what goes on during the real deal - you've seen the movies, and they don't come close to touching the actual events of battle.<br>
<br>
I'm normally not one to say &quot;That's the way it is, deal with it&quot;...but if you're not on the front lines fighting the enemy and bleeding to death, then you've got absolutely no place to critisize those who do. If you think the small number of deaths that we've seen so far in the desert is catastrophic, then I don't know what to tell you. Our forces are fighting one hell of a war over there. I'm very proud that they do what they do - and believe me, coming from someone who detests serving in the military as much as I do, that means something <p><HTML><center>

I for one was never for the embedded journalist crap in the first place - I don't really think live war should exist any place other than where it's actually happening, let Jerry Springer own the airways. Men and women fighting for their lives is something so personal and impersonal - it's something that just doesn't belong on TV. No, I wouldn't deny free knowledge to the world's public...but it wasn't ever, on any news channel that I saw, reported in an honest, informative way - it was all about the ratings, melodrama, and who could catch the most interesting, most fucked up story to use to color the entire war with.<br>
<br>
Maybe CNN isn't carrying this crap for a reason - everyone's opinion doesn't get shown on CNN, not even on the little scrolling text bar - and I see why this guy's wasn't either. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadowleaf>Shadowleaf</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#330000>(7/11/03 5:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=838.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Main danger to journalists?

Anyway. There's no way in hell that story would be on CNN. Can you imagine it?<br>

&quot;US soldiers kill more of their own guys than anyone else. Pictures at 11!&quot;<br>

So it makes NO sense to think these journalists were anything but casualties in a war.  The ugly truth is that when wars are fought, people die, and sometimes those people aren't the ones our &quot;president&quot; has told us to label enemies.  Yes, journalists went to the frontlines, and they were killed by American troops that had never seen a combat situation and likely were scared and made mistakes.  As tragic as I think this is, they knew the dangers going in.  If you are so anxious to get a Pulitzer that you will put yourself in that situation, then you should already know the risks.  I actually DON'T blame the American System for this one.  Maybe the war shouldn't have happened in the first place, but it did.  Don't be so stupid as to stand on the front lines and think that that camera will make you immune to the dangers of the present situation.<br>
It don't work that way.<br>

US soldiers.</span><hr size=1> The incident in which Simpson was injured and the BBC translator was killed was when the BBC film crew were travelling with Kurchish and US Special Forces in Northern Iraq.<br>
<br>
There was an accidental US air strike against the group in which quite a few of the Kurdish forces were killed and several US Special Forces were injured along with the BBC injuries.<br>
<br>
The footage of the incident is quite disturbing. The full footage having not been shown during the war itself for various reasons which were largely to do with the BBC being &quot;responsible&quot; and not being overly critical while the war was going on... the BBC was quite circumspect in a lot of its reporting while the war was going on, and only started a full bredth of reportage once the war was announced to be over.<br>
<br>
They showed the full footage (their claim, we can't know), edited only to remove US Special Forces from shot.<br>
<br>
The US Special Forces on sight were said to be quite embaressed at having to explain to the Kurdish troops they were supposed to be assisting that it was a US strike they had just sustained.<br>
<br>
Now, the sustained shelling by tanks of the hotel that was putting up the journalists in Bagdad, and was known by allied forces to be housing the international press is a completely different can of worms, and on a completely different scale, and quite frankly should of had somebody up on charges. <br>
<br>
Now in the States you have your own reportage, which is your business, and fair enough. Over here in the UK (and indeed many people around the world that might choose to rely upon the BBC World Service rather than CNN), it's hard to convey how well respected John Simpson is.... As Ramshutu points out, this chap has seen one hell of a lot of combat across the globe over a fair few decades.<br>
<br>
Just be mindful of the fact that there's a lot of stuff you don't get on CNN. <p><hr />

This may have looked like Mike Tyson vs. Mr. Firley (from Three's Company for you younger people that might not know), but it was still a war.  In wars. people die, that is part of why we call them wars instead of an occupation.  Whether they died from friendly fire or enemy fire, they knew the dangers going in.  After all, it's not called Hazard Pay because of Tom Wopat and a real fast car.<br>
