<br>
I understand that some places, even after conquering, require much more visitation before literally moving on, but the fact that a group of people are strong enough to wipe through the hardest challenge an expansion has to offer in a few days when just a few months ago it seemed nearly impossible is a miracle in itself.<br>
<br>
So what's the next miracle? Following the standard route of progression, what comes after Velious (say Luclin and I'll stab you with a pitchfork) - more specifically, what would you say a guild's first move into the next expansion should be?<br>
<br>
Moving from ST and NToV right into VT in a day obviously won't happen, and common sense tells me that VT is the stopping point for Luclin, but as far as entering the realm of being a raiding guild in Luclin, well I'm at a loss.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I'm being very coherent (blame the beer) - but does anyone have some sort of suggestion or advice?  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:black;font-family:helvetica;font-size:x-small;">Rinquist 65th Level n00b</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shadowfrostxev>ShadowfrostXev</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www-und.ida.liu.se/~johro897/flags/uk.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>8/6/03 - we will remember</span><br>  Posts: 398<br> <font color=#330000>(8/30/03 5:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I blew through Velious and all I got was this shirt</span><hr size=1> You have two real choices.<br>
<br>
First, you can go through Luclin.  That would mean farming the assorted Luclin zone bosses like Grieg and THO while racing for the still-heavily-contested spawns in the Ssraeshza Temple initially, while working on the various items for your VT keys.  (The phrases &quot;Comm 2&quot; and &quot;ME shard&quot; will fill your soul with a kind of horrid apathetic loathing before long, if you decide to go down this route).<br>
<br>
Personally, I couldn't stomach it.  The mind-numbing tedium of Luclin farming was one of the major reasons why I decided I would no longer be a part of a raiding guild; for me, Luclin was where the reward ceased to be worth the effort.<br>
<br>
If you decide to go the Luclin route, you need to appreciate that Luclin critters tend to be unrewarding.  Many Velious critters have a habit of dropping four loots; many Luclin ones have a nasty habit of dropping only two.<br>
<br>
Second, you can skip Luclin entirely and head directly to PoP.  If you've &quot;completed&quot; the Velious expansion, you're more than ready for the early PoP critters.  Again, you need to appreciate that PoP is a place where you can generally expect two loots per critter, but if you're serious about continuing through VT, then you're gearing up for PoP in any case.<br>
<br>
Whichever way you go, the future is in the Elemental Planes and then the Plane of Time.  That means raids of ten groups or more, raiding for five to eight hours on end, killing a succession of critters with two drops plus runes.  Most guilds at this stage of the game seem to raid like this four or five days a week, and the guild rules or charter will tend to say things like &quot;raid attendance is mandatory if you are online&quot; - so you have a raid commitment of something like thirty hours a week to look forward to.<br>
<br>
It's a far cry from Velious, where you can raid with four groups for two or three hours and expect to walk away with a meaningful number of upgrades. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=162740">Shadowfrost</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=abitoo>Abitoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#330000>(8/30/03 8:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I blew through Velious and all I got was this shirt</span><hr size=1> There have been a few posts on this on various boards, especially a few months after PoP came out.  Basically the premise was, if you have already farmed about half your emp/VT keys for your guild, than go ahead and finish. If you havent started, dont waste your time.<br>
<br>
Getting into VT requires almost 50-100hrs per key in addition to your normal raiding to get the upgrades to continue your progression.  If I was in your shoes, I'd be tempted to clear NToV an extra time or two to make sure you have all the best drops where you need them. (Ody only did NToV 2-3 times, SM did it the same before moving on to luclin).  Also, I would start hunting the less contested luclin mobs such as THO, Burrower, Greig, Shei, and maybe the odd Ssra mob.<br>
<br>
In addition, I'd start expanding my wings on PoP. The lower PoP mobs have a 3 day respawn and some have very nice loot. AD's loot is so-so but may be what you need... TT has some good loot.  POI mini's have some focus for your priests; Behemoth's loot isnt bad, and the zek twins have nice things. Also, save the girls has a few nice items including a monk fist and enchanter de-agro tash stick.<br>
<br>
You will be killing these same mobs for a long time to get the gear you need, but hey, would you rather kill snakes over and over or go raiding? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/abitoo/Abitoo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

The high end guilds on this server have made EQ a job, and it is. The game takes dedication, lots of time, and lots of people - at the high end game.<br>
<br>
Frankly, not every guild will reach Elemental planes, and fewer will reach PoTime. Many guilds won't be able to stomach the trials and tribulations of the high end game - even after getting there, a guild can fall quickly.<br>
<br>
It is also not feasible that the Xev server can support very many High end raiding guilds. Currently we have 5 guilds in the Elemental planes, 1 of those also being in PoTime. The Elemental Planes can be kept dead with 2 guilds, and were done so for some time - Now there are 5. (though Harm mostly moved on).<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
There is plenty of content that is not at the end game but Xev has become inflated with Raiding guilds, and these encounters are not easy to get very many shots at.<br>
<br>
In Luclin, all of the expansion can be done with 3 groups, and in most cases, less - if geared appropriately. For guilds moving into this content, 5-6 groups should be more then enough to win anything. Since Luclin caters to lower numbers, guilds will find themselves very successful but will also find many frustrating moments when progressing from Luclin to PoP.<br>
<br>
If your guild is not ready to expand and put in the time required to become a high end PoP raiding guild, then Luclin is where you want to be.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
PoP is aimed towards the best. Until Elemental Planes, almost no encounter prior will have any loot worth taking - or at least the loot will help very little towards advancing to the next step.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of Luclin-Equivalent raiding encounters, however, the equipment upgrades cannot match that of Luclin. If you raid PoP, your roster will need to grow as you progress, or eventually your guild will hit a brick wall. Your guild will need to reflag constantly for all new members - which can lead to burnout.<br>
<br>
BoT, HoHa, and Innovation are the only 3 zones worth considering if you intend on being a casual guild and don't want to have to progress through PoP right away. These 3 zones offer encounters that do not require many people, have good rewards and no need to reflag, but the drawback is - the encounters also offer no progression in terms of flags (except HoHa only if you defeat all 3 trials, and a casual guild isnt going to be killing Rydda so the point still stands).<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
Expect lots of competition no matter what path is chosen. And although it may hurt to admit, some guilds just need to realize that they are a stepping stone for a lot of people...<br>

I would call that a fair analysis of the situation.<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm not sure I would agree with this. Your point of view is slightly skewed by the fact that, when you personally started doing lower end PoP mobs, you were already coming into them with top-end Luclin equipment. The picture is a little different if you are coming into those encounters with the majority of your guild in NToV quality gear.<br>
<br>
There are quite a few lower end PoP encounters which provide very good upgrades for a guild who has not gone the Ssra/VT route (BoT tower bosses spring to mind).<br>
<br>
Make no mistake, going the Ssra/VT route will definately provide you with more raid quality gear in less time, but you have to decide if the hundreds of man hours spent keying for the events in question (Abitoo isn't exaggerating here) will actually save you any time over heading straight to PoP.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PoP is aimed towards the best.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That I would agree with 100%. One encounter with an XP mob in any tier 3 or higher zone will tell you that in no uncertain terms. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Thedosius Dreamtwister<br>

<br>
&quot;or at least the loot will help very little towards advancing to the next step.&quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;the equipment upgrades cannot match that of Luclin&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
First off, all PoP encounters have 2 item drops, Luclin has 3. Many PoP items pre-Elementals do not have the FT, Vengeance, and focus effects that Luclin will offer. Just hp/mana upgrades will not suffice. And also you are lacking weapon drops for the majority of melee classes, therefore you lack tons of DPS. <br>
<br>
And I did mention Bot bosses, as well as Innovation / HoH as having some decent rewards for a casual PoP guild. <br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
When Harm went through all of the PoP encounters, not very much rotted at all, but that doesn't mean the items were actually good items. Especially considering the encounters took 40+ people while a mob in VT takes 10.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The VT key is not very hard and doesnt take 100 hours. I completed an entire Emperor key for Faahy (ring, idol, insig, bag) in 6 hours, I duo'd everything cept the Insignia - had 4 people for that.<br>
<br>
Then I camped VT key shards which might have taken 20 hours at the most (again, duo). <br>
<br>
Anyone with a brain can get a key just as fast, I did 2 VT keys pre-PoP mostly Duo and there are other people in this game who've done 6+ keys by themselves. Pre-PoP we had a necro (faah) solo his entire VT key except emp source. Course not everyone is a necro...<br>
<br>
The only 2 shard camps that require any amount of time are ME and FG - in my experiences. If you get ME and FG you can have the rest done in a day. <br>
<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
If you are a casual guild, would you rather spend time doing keys that require less then a group to complete (except emperor piece) - realizing VT itself takes less then 40 people to complete for an upcoming guild Or waste time killing mobs in PoP that require greater then 40 people, lots of reflagging, and worst loot. <br>
<br>
PoP just isnt a fun place for a casual guild imo, that is why my first sentence was - your guild needs to ask itself what it wants.<br>
<br>

If, for instance, you can catch com2 when it is up on server ups, ect - it takes you 10 minutes to clear to him and kill him.  When I was camping mine, we had 2 groups clearing almost the entire second floor and it took over 4 hours for him to pop.  Multiply that times 12 (needed one for everyone in the two groups of course) and you are already far over 20 hours.  Of course you do not need 2 groups, but the more people you have clearing, the more chance you have of him to pop.<br>
<br>
Also, some shards can be deceptively long.  I spent over 60 hours in ME camping that shard.  We had groups clearing all 5 of the possible spawn points, and only 2 other shards dropped in that time for the other groups.  I hear they have since upped the drop rate - however, people still spend a lot of time there.<br>
<br>
All in all, 100 hours for each key is about right for a guild doing them the first time.  Remember that some of that time is spent helping others at camps that will not further your key.  Many of those hours are spent helping others after you have finished your key.  For a guild who is gearing up for emp, you also have to add on ore farming time for bane weapons.<br>
<br>
For a VT capable guild, I'd say 20 hours is about right for the time it should take any member to get a key.  For a guild in the elemental planes, you should be able to solo most everything for a key, or duo it at the worst.  But for a guild just starting, VT is a HUGE time investment.  That isn't to discourage people from doing it - I think the Luclin route is better than farming early PoP.  My main reason for that is the equipment you get from VT normally doesn't get replaced until elemental planes or time.<br>
<br>
All in all, it comes down to where you want to invest the time.  Do you want to farm snakes or would you rather raid in early PoP for a while.  You'll probably end up spending about the same amount of time either way.<br>

It'd make a lot more sense to farm pre-vt luclin a lot, I can't imagine there are a lot of guilds that do ssra or the other luclin spawns like burrower/shei.

From raiding Mistmoore, The Hole, Kael Arena, Fear/Hate, epics, Kunark dragons, HoT, WToV, low Luclin (RC/DS a ton), first brood, NToV, ST, Kael bosses, lower Ssra (AL/XTC), Upper Ssra (HP/Cursed), lower PoP, Emp/VT, mid PoP and now one encounter away from high end PoP.  We didn't skip anything.<br>
<br>
Is that the best way nowadays?  Hell if I know.  When I became an officer of OoD we were just like any other random low level guild.  Fear and Hate were long term goals.  Kael arena farm sessions with 30+ people wiping to single pulls were common for us.  But we got focus and told ourselves &quot;ok, we want to be a real raiding guild&quot;.  Of course there was resistance and some big scuffles along the way.  I remember very clearly major arguments about progression, tons of people wanting to &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot; (farm things to death).  But we didn't.  When we did something, we looked at it as a goal accomplished and looked at the next goal.  And I think PoPs introduction really helped us out.  The new levels and AA and increased leveling rate gave us that push that sent us flying up through the ranks.  We passed by all of those guilds we used to look up to as the &quot;next step&quot; rather quickly while they floundered around in ToV type stuff still.   Within a few weeks we killed Grummus (when only Harm/AV/OC/Hand had killed him), AL, etc. and all of a sudden guilds were looking at us with a vastly different eye and we started getting apps out of our ears.  Lots of fluff came and went but we got a solid group of folks from that initial blistering progression through the ranks.<br>
<br>
As for specific advice for DP, I'm not sure but I don't think you guys can field 50+ person forces can ya?  PoP really requires that, and it sucks.  I hated and continue to hate having to recruit ad infinitum to keep up with the rising requirements of encounters.  Start out with something like TT, ok we need 35 or so people, thats pushing it from the 26-30 we used for Velious but we could pull that.  Now we're looking at Grummus/AD... alright push that 35 up to 42-45.  Behemoth?  Push it up to 50.  Alright, cool, we can do all that, kill TZ/VZ with a little lower numbers, do HoH trials, carprin, etc.  Now Bertox/RD/MM... add another group or two to your raid numbers.   We've more than doubled our average raid size and thats not all.  RZ?  Hell, a full raid of 72 sometimes isn't enough.  Without some publicity and a solid source of recruitment, a guild can't do recruitment like that.  Sure if you farm enough (especially VT) you can cut the numbers on some of the stuff but it becomes difficult to keep up with the crazy number requirements that PoP is throwing at you.<br>
<br>
I think from Luclin on up, they fucked up raiding.  The challenge stopped being 'Can we kill this mob?' and became 'Do we have enough flags/keys to kill this mob when it pops?' and PoP added a 'Do we have the zerg force...' to it too. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=340675">Lich Daedrea Darksoul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->65 Arch Lich<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.orderofdraconis.com">Order of Draconis</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nogithemonk>Nogi the Monk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#330000>(9/1/03 3:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I blew through Velious and all I got was this shirt</span><hr size=1> luclin is 7 day respawn, pop 3 day. a determining factor for competition.

<br>
we had several discussions in BC if a guild should skip VT if they raid a lot and plan to crawl through PoP. i am personally on the side that says &quot;no&quot;:<br>
<br>
resons:<br>
<br>
- VT key quest and VT raids will shape your m,embers and you see if you have enough determined of it<br>
- VT loot is still very good and hitting EPs with non VT training and gear is definitly tough when not having a full raid (72)<br>
- the way is what makes it interesting, not the goal. the desire to see the zone fully.<br>
<br>
to have fun raiding in PoP you should have 50 ppl, really. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=67678"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nogi</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

<br>
I have keyed up like 4 chars. 2 of them as part of keying up the guild, and 2 of them later on, not camping much and checking spawns for the so called PITA zones/mobs (ME, comm1, comm2). Everything else is really not an issue.<br>
<br>
So realistically i would put it to 20 to 40h per char, considering you want to key up your guild. Lots of it can be done parallel (for a guild). <br>
<br>
The real hard part will be getting Emperor, since he is a bottleneck mob.<br>
<br>
Beside all that, it all depends on if you wanna be uber fast or explore the game. You can easily skip Luclin and go to PoP asap, which would require a large roster though. On the other hand, you dont want to do VT with 30 anyways in the beginning, so the roster size is not really changing between the 2 paths.<br>
<br>
AAs make a huge difference and can compensate lack in gear to a certain degree as well. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><br>

Let me put it a different way - perchance we are talking about different things.<br>
<br>
If a key took on average 20 hours per member, and your average member spent 3 - maybe 4 hours a night online, you could key your entire guild in 5 days.  Take 2 hours a night off for rading, and that still only goes up to 10 days.  And that is for Vex Thal - not just emp key.<br>
<br>
40 hours would be 20 days, that is getting closer to reasonable.  80 hours would then be 40 days - about what I think it would take to key most guilds.<br>
<br>
Now, there are other factors involved - however, as a crude estimate 80 is probably much closer than 40.    There will be characters who get their keys in 10 hours.  There will be those who take much longer.  My key took nearly 160 hours between time farming for myself and time farming for others.  My first alts took 15 hours - it can vary greatly.<br>
<br>
The whole point is - if you are planning on keying a guild for VT - don't plan on having it done in 5 days.  Plan on spending 1-2 months in Ssraa camping key parts, ore, and some of the other spawns you will need to kill emp (can anyone say RGC).  Plan on spending another week scattered around Luclin camping shards.  That may or may not be worth the time you spend depending on what your guilds goals are. <br>

VT really isnt required to advance through PoP. But right now, a guild that doesnt care about advancing to elementals or time would probably have more fun being able to do Luclin Encounters with 5-6 groups, rather then needing 8-9 for the lower end PoP encounters and reaping less reward.<br>
<br>
VT will become less crowded as guilds spend more time in Elementals, and eventually it will become less farmed. A guild doesnt need to rush to finish VT keys, and with more levels and mudflation, it takes less people (thus less keys) to be successful in the zone. But for guilds that dont want to put in that time, Ssra, Burrower, Shei, Seru, etc are still good luclin encounters.<br>

There are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>loads</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and I think it's fair to say that the lower-end raiding zones that Harm finished with years ago are more heavily contested now than they've ever been.<br>
<br>
The new and upcoming guilds now have different obstacles in their way.  Take Zlandi... no doubt, once upon a time, Zlandi was such a tough encounter that he could only be killed by those few guilds who could muster adequate force and technique to do it.<br>
<br>
When I was killing Zlandi the first time around, the problem was that five or more guilds were farming him, and our difficulties had a lot more to do with the fact that he wasn't available to be killed than the difficulty of the encounter itself.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, can you imagine how many guilds are farming Zlandi?  It's not just guilds... any bunch of four or five raid guilders can go and toast him so as to get a ST key for someone's alt and maybe a quick Cowl of Mortality to sell in the bazaar.  And some of them do just that.  If they don't, then there are at least a dozen guilds who'd like to kill him.<br>
<br>
Today, when a young guild wants to go out and raid Velious, early Luclin and PoP, their scouts go out and they find that there are two classes of critter available for them to choose from:  (1) the fast respawning encounters, e.g. Vindi or Dain or Xanamech, and (2) things like Tunare that are such a pain in the neck that they're rarely taken down.  The relatively quick kills with the decent loot for the difficulty (Tormax, CT, Zlandi, etc.) are dead within an hour of popping.<br>
<br>
Ssra was a sort of horrible clusterphuck of competing guilds towards the end of last year, and I think it's noticeably worse now.<br>
<br>
From the point of view of someone who's repeating content which I've already pretty much completed once, nothing in EQ now is any less farmed than it was before; quite the reverse, in fact.<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to instanced content.  I didn't buy EQ to play a PVP game, and spawn-racing is a little too close to PVP for my liking; it's a constant headache for any guild that raids, even a little bit.<br>
<br>
Besides, spawn racing isn't the stuff of heroic fantasy, it's just pathetic.<br>

Sure, there's incidents of madness here and there, but mostly people have been ok about stuff. Certain spawns can stay up for hours without anyone taking them.<br>
<br>
That's not to say that I don't think instanced content is way way WAY better than what we have today. That said, I think instanced stuff is going to have to be a lot harder or have a lot rarer drops (I'd prefer it be harder vs more of a timesink, but knowing Sony it'll be timesink all the way).<br>
<br>
Reason being, look at Stromm for how fast a guild without any competition can move up. One guild has raced through all of EQ, all the way into Elemental Planes and maybe even Time by now (I'm not following their progress). Harm has always been in the position of pushing through an expansion and then farming the hell out of it, but we've never seen what a guild that plays that way could do on a new server until Stromm. <br>
<br>
Using that for your design guidelines, instanced stuff is going to have to be either relatively trivial upgrades, major timesinks, or very very difficult (or all three). And it'll still be quickly exhausted by the ubers, who will clamor for more content within 2 months of LDoN being released.<br>

&quot;There is plenty of content that is not at the end game but Xev has become inflated with Raiding guilds, and these encounters are not easy to get very many shots at.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know how crowded VT and other Luclin bosses are first hand. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=abitoo>Abitoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#330000>(9/2/03 12:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I blew through Velious and all I got was this shirt</span><hr size=1> While I agree that a VT key can be obtained in 20hrs or less, I do not feel for a GUILD that will be anyplace near average.<br>
<br>
Ring 6hrs - group of 6 people, 1hr per com (hehe.  yeah.  right)<br>
Idol 6hrs - group of 6, 1hr per idol<br>
Insignia - 6hrs - 18 people, 20min per named<br>
Ore - for the sake of arguement, lets say everyone spends 1hr at this camp (being an enchanter, I've probably logged 100hrs here alone)<br>
Pouch - 0hrs. Lets pretend you manage to get this doing Cursed cycles<br>
<br>
Ssra shard - 0hrs. Farmed while farming ore<br>
Deep shard - 1hr<br>
ME shard - 6hrs - 1 group 1 hour per shard<br>
Acrylia, Seru/katta, SD, DSP, Grey, Akheva, FG - 4hrs total<br>
<br>
Ok, this idealistic farming is 30hrs per key. However, we all know that these camps are not that fast. Also, just because you can get 1 key in 20hrs by scoutting for named, you cannot key an entire guild in that maner without taking months.<br>
<br>
The problem I saw with the 20hr example is, that person played 2-3 characters the entire time, so to me, thats 40-60hrs NOT 20 because not everyone bots 2+ characters.<br>
<br>
While I can see 20-30hrs as feasible for a single key (even perhaps 10hrs), I do stand by my 50+ hrs per key for farming the guild as a whole. It doesnt matter who's the fastest to get the key, its who's the LAST (required for kill) that matters. 50hrs per key at 4hrs per night = 2-3 weeks depending on other raids. Most guilds I know spent at least a month or more. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://webpages.charter.net/abitoo/Abitoo.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
If you count Emp key towards VT key you'll see I mentioned that as taking 6 hours to complete. And VT &quot;Shards&quot; took roughly 20 hrs.<br>
<br>
There are guilds that have manage to get keyed up in 2 weeks now. <br>
<br>
All shards can be camped with 2 people, you dont need 6.<br>
