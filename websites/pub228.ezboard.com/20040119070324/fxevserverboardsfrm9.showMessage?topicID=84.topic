<br>
I am a level 60 enchanter with 22 aa's who has recently found himself without a guild.  I'm on EST. I have farmed Kael extensively and have max ally faction with both Thurgadin and CoV.  I have experience in HoT raids.  My unbuffed resists are still being fine tuned, but at this time, Fire/Cold/Magic all are above 100.  I have keys for Sebillis and Howling stones.  I am not yet flagged to go past tier one.  I love tradeskills with jewelcraft(250 with trophy) as my main. Fishing, Pottery, Brewing, Baking, and one other that is escaping me atm are all 190-199.  Smithing(129) Tailoring(159) Fletching(133).<br>
<br>
I have completed all of my epic except Plane of Fear and Plane of Hate.  I would like to complete this, but understand that as a new member to a guild, that these desires would be on hold for a while. Here is a link to my crappy gear, its not the best in the world, but I have earned every piece of it.  Not a copper has gone to bazaar vendors to get it, so while its not the best in the world, I'm still very proud of it. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=573481">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=573481</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
The AC is not right, I haven't gotten around to making sure that its exactly correct, but the gear is correct.<br>
A gimpish 52 ranger is my only real alt at this time.<br>
<br>
I am a 32 year old single male.  I play pretty much everyday and attend 95% of my guilds' functions.  I'm a somewhat mature person, but am still a kid at heart.  My intangible assets are that I am free to raid as long as I like, I listen WELL, I do not fill raid channels with inane blabber, I know when its time to goof off and when its time for business.  I help others far more than I ask for help with my own goals.  Some of my faults tend to be that I can be a bit over honest at times.....especially with someone who wrongs me.  I dont mince words.  However, that is not something that I would display in a public manner and bring scrutiny on my guild.  I handle myself in a proffesional manner for the most part in the Xev community.<br>
<br>
I have been guilded since my original character was a little old level 7 newb ranger.  In that time, I have only been associated with 2 guilds.  The first was a newb guild in its truest form.  Legion of the Moon was its name and I served as an officer in it from level 12 up until about 9 months ago.  This guild and its offsprings came to its ultimate demise as we outgrew the low end of the game.  <br>
<br>
A couple weeks after I deguilded, I joined my second guild.  I very much enjoyed my time in this guild.  I learned much about raiding and playing this game that I was truly oblivious to before I had joined them.  As I grew in experience, my guild grew as a force in the community.  I loved being an integral part of our guild tackling new challenges and achieving things for the first time as a team.  Unfortunately, I was recently placed in a position to chose between my loyalty for my guild and my loyalty for a close friend. It was not an easy decision, but nonetheless, I am now unguilded and in search of a new home.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :depressed --><img src=http://smilies.crowd9.com/otn/sad/osigh.gif ALT=":depressed"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What I am looking to for in response to this thread are some guilds I can look into that I might enjoy.  I wish to join an organized group of folks who raid on a semi-regular basis. Thats 2-5 times a week I suppose with raid participation encouraged, but not required.  As I said, I attend 95% of functions, but I don't expect everyone in a guild to enjoy those aspects of the game as much as I do.<br>
<br>
I would like to find a guild that is in a similar content level that I am, perhaps slightly ahead of myself, but I am not looking to skip past the things this game has to offer.  When the guild I decide on takes down Mob x for the first time, I would like to be there for it and be an important part of the success.  I'm not interested in being a warm body to throw in the masses.<br>
<br>
If you know a guild that would be a good fit for me or are a representative of a guild that could use a good enchanter.  Please feel free to post below, e-mail me at iliak31@hotmail.com, or contact me in game.  I'd love to learn about what your guild is doing.  Thanks for your consideration.<br>

Since people aren't helping you out, I will share some of my thoughts which you can take or leave. Guilds that I would look at if I were you (you can eliminate them based on your own opinion) In no particular order:<br>
Dominion<br>
Divine Prophecy (yay!)<br>
Cult of Setekh<br>
Wake of Oblivion<br>
Peritus <br>
Last Exodus<br>
Four Elements<br>
<br>
of course, you could rejoin FoJ  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I looked into all of these guilds of varying degrees before choosing to app with DP. It was very important for me to find the right guild and I am very happy with my choice.<br>
Best of luck to you as I know it is not an easy thing to do. Let me know if you have any questions or need any advice.<br>
<br>
See ya,<br>

I would add/delete a few personally, but most importantly I would advise you to attend raids with whatever guilds you are looking at and group with many different guilds while you look.<br>
<br>
I would advise you to visit the guilds websites, and read their charters.  I would also advise you to ask trusted friends about reputations before you make a final choice.<br>
<br>
Last Exodus was mentioned on that list, and while we do raid and are as you requested slightly past the level of content that you posted, we are first and foremost a roleplaying guild (Well Chakkan says that we are 50/50 raiding/roleplaying guild, but the point is that we roleplay, even on raids *grins*).  <br>
<br>
If that interests you, even if you have not roleplayed your character before, then you are welcome to check us out.  Hangetsu and I did not roleplay our characters prior to being in LE (and we joined at 56), and have found that we very much enjoy the roleplaying aspect.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I understand the difficulty of looking for a new home after leaving one you have been a part of for such a long time.  It gets discouraging, but once you find where you fit, you will know.<br>

<br>
Thanks for the suggestions and kind words.  I do plan on raiding and grouping quite a bit before I actually app with someone, but I'm just trying to narrow my focus a bit and see if there are any guilds out there who I would enjoy that I might not be aware of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rotlomxavier>Rotlom Xavier</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#330000>(4/8/03 1:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guilds to look at</span><hr size=1> Sordia- I looked at Last Exodus as well and didn't feel comfortable with Role Playing being of primary importance. You guys have some of the nicest people on the server. <br>
As far as reputations go, I gave what was in my opinion an objective listing. People need to form their own opinions based on their interactions with a guild. (at least I do).<br>
At any rate, this should give him a good base to start his search. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157603">Rotlom Xavier</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
My words of advice are simply also those that I followed when I began my search.  I have very personal reasons that I do not agree entirely with your list, and well, if this thread went there, the positive advice I was trying to give would have been lost.  So I choose to stay away from listing any personal suggestions. (note I didn't say WHAT I disagreed with in your list just there would be some additions/deletions).<br>
<br>
Just an aside, RP isn't as hard as everyone thinks it is.  I know that I was very intimidated with it, and that at times, I still am, but it can be a lot of fun when you get over the self-conscious aspect of it, and just run with it.<br>

The Shadows of the Chosen are just entering the stages you commented on.<br>
<br>
We will be starting HoT in a few weeks.<br>
<br>
We have the gear and man power, currently we have aqquired a few new additions that are causing us to rework old strategies to play to our new strengths.<br>
<br>
I believe from your post, you are very much in sync with where we are and where we are trying to head.<br>
<br>
From reading our boards you will see some of the results of our &quot;retraining&quot; as it were.<br>
<br>
We are not on the level of numbers and strength of some of the above named guilds, but we will be soon.<br>
<br>
We have completed 2 epics in the last month( our goal was 2 by the end of March, we succeeded).<br>
