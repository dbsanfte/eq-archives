Any lines copied were not modified in anyway except for certain channel names changed throughout. I tried to leave out anything I felt unnecessary while including as much as possible. Some may consider this biased but I think you'll see what I include is well rounded.<br>
<br>
The reason for me posting this is to show why things are done a certain way. A way that Peritus apparently does not understand and I hope that one day they do understand. An early lesson I learned in EQ is that 2 raids in 1 zone can often lead to problems no matter how good the intentions are at the beginning. This is usually why only one guild is found raiding in each zone unless the spawns they are after are far apart and guilds entry into the zone is planned to avoid confusion. Apply some common sense and I believe most would agree with me. As an example, Azure Legion's last Chardok raid was delayed for several hours because Dominion was either headed to the royals or were already there. Azure Legion dispursed to do other things while I kept in touch with their raid leader. As it neared time for them to leave Azure Legion assembled in Chardok and got CoHed down to the king room by a Dominion mage.<br>
<br>
As an added note on August 29th Azure Legion entered Fear to obtain the Shissir for an enchanter epic. It was nearly a full hour before Pertius showed up, moved past us, then pulled and killed the Shissir. All the while ignoring any attempts to communicate with them. This matter still remains unresolved with Verant and may never see any action taken.<br>
<br>
And now we have this past Saturday...<br>

<br>
At this point I talk to Silguss with Ivorry on my other account. Silguss says they would rather have the next king spawn than wait 2+ hours for the following spawn. Further negotiations take place which includes me working with my guild on the decisions as much as possible. Silguss turns down our return offer to loot just the scroll on the next king kill prefering to kill the king with his own guild. Before I can continue negotiations with Silguss, Guide Alandara answers my petition.<br>
<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:48:37 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Greetings, this is Guide Alandara, how may I assist?'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:49:09 2002] You told Alandara, 'hi Alandara.. we're having a hard time with Peritus again.. trying hard to work it out.'<br>

[Sat Sep 21 17:49:29 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Let me come to visit!'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:49:33 2002] You told Alandara, 'would be nice if you would come ask them to leave but here's the story'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:52:44 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Okay, who are the raid leaders?'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:52:55 2002] You told Alandara, 'myself and Silguss'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:53:22 2002] You tell raidchat:2, 'please kill the king.. do not loot the singed scroll'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:53:42 2002] You tell raidchat:2, 'warriors be rdy for spawn.. enchanters get rdy to mezz pops'<br>

[Sat Sep 21 17:54:51 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Which groups are you here with?'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:54:57 2002] You told Alandara, 'azure legion'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:55:08 2002] Alandara tells you, 'And which groups is he here with?'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:55:14 2002] You told Alandara, 'Pertitus'<br>

[Sat Sep 21 17:56:22 2002] You told Alandara, 'it's rather simple.. we came down here before them.. well before them and told them we would rather they stayed away. And Silguss refuses to go.'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:56:55 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Okay, well, here's the deal. I can watch both of your guilds work it out peacefully, or, I can work a spawn out for you. '<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:57:18 2002] You told Alandara, 'if you could explain the spawn method?'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:57:47 2002] Ivorry tells raidchat:2, 'i'll loot the singed scroll.. silguss doesn't want the scroll without the kill'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:58:01 2002] Alandara tells you, 'You have to abide by the play nice policy and come to some sort of an agreement. I was not here to see who engaged what first.'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:59:10 2002] You told Alandara, 'i have a report showing Silguss's attitude. i did a report about 4hours and 30min ago that i believe was his alt.. Nitena'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:59:18 2002] You told Alandara, 'that kinda explains it'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 17:59:46 2002] You told Alandara, 'i offered him a singed scroll after we killed the king but he wants the king kill as a matter of pride for his guild'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:00:03 2002] You told Alandara, 'now he insists we KSed the king from them ;/'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:00:12 2002] You told Alandara, 'at least Nitena does'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:01:27 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Are you okay with them taking queens and you're taking Kings?'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:01:57 2002] You told Alandara, 'we are ok with them taking king but we don't know how to deal with the queen except to pull her to the king pit.. we can try though'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:02:24 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Okay, this arrangement sounds fair to me. Let me talk to him.'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:02:28 2002] You told Alandara, 'k'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:02:46 2002] You told Alandara, 'we need queen much more than king'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:03:27 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Okay, let them have the Queen, you guys take the King. '<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:04:20 2002] You told Alandara, 'Alandara, we need the queen much more than king.. we were easily here first. You have a report showing their attitude. I have a very hard time understanding this. ;/'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:06:01 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Decision is this, you guys take the King, they take the Queen. If there are any more problems, please do send another petition. And use the /report to report any offending parties.'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:06:15 2002] You told Alandara, 'thanks'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:06:32 2002] Alandara tells you, 'That way we have something in our system. I am sorry it could not be worked out more peacefully.'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:06:51 2002] Alandara tells you, 'Anything else I can do for ya?'<br>
[Sat Sep 21 18:07:03 2002] You told Alandara, 'no thanks'<br>
<br>
We stuck to the decision of Guide Alandara and stayed in the King room. For the next two hours Peritus and a few others occupied the queen room. They were able to kill the queen in her room with minimal loses as she spawned. Two hours later when the queen again spawns they are not so lucky and wiped out. We moved in, finished her off and helped Peritus with CR by bringing them to the king room. A short time later we killed the king when he spawned, let Peritus know we were going and we left the zone.<br>
<br>
We may have stayed longer but everyone was rather tired from the whole ordeal.<br>

<br>
Some people think they are the most important thing in the world. They think the sun and moon revolve around them, and nothing you ever do will convince them otherwise. They have no consideration for anyone else and no respect for anyone. Guilds full of people like that make their own reputation and bring in their own destruction. I'm a big believer in Karma, the assholes of the world will get theirs, it's just a matter of time. Peritus is quickly building a reputation for being a bully type guild who has no respect for anyone or anything. It will come back to haunt them.<br>
<br>
Can this really stay civil enough to remain in the general section? *grin<br>

AL, has done some Pretty rotten things to other Guild's, For Instance, Ragefire, Who AL Deliberately stole this spawn from another guild, Then Ragefire OWNED them. AL decided then to help the Other  guild Kill Rage, Nice of them wasnt it, This happened &gt; (before the last patch where they Finally fixed the Spawn Issue in Skyfire). <br>
 Seem's to me, AL got what they Deserved, another Cleric Epic Piece, Which they seem to have Gotten alot of them lately. My Piece was Given to another Cleric which was in guild less time then me. I also recall another party that &quot;Led&quot; a raid and The VS piece  was given to another person, and That was Totally unfair to the Person that led it. BTW, Seem alot of People go to AL for Epics, and when they get them they leave. The Cleric that guy my piece from Overking Left AL.<br>
But I wasnt that Smart I left way before I got my Epic.<br>
 Well I need Overking and Ragefire, Anyone up for some King and Dragon smacking Lol.<br>
/sarcasm on <br>
AL wanna donate that cleric Piece.<br>
/sarcasm off<br>
Another Deal was where a certain party was after Last Epic MOB and was told NO Dice, your not getting your Epic untill you can prove that you deserve it, Char is lvl 60. and stayed with that guild for a year or more.<br>
So anyways, What goes around comes around. <br>
FLAME AWAY.<br>

No I dont have Epic yet to state that again, Dont need it with lvl 56, Just takes mana is all. Always do FREE resses, when and if Im able to, Donations are not Necessary, but will be Accepted, of course Lol...<br>

Hey, did you ever get to read the sad, sad messages from the guild board when you left?<br>

My favorite was &quot;don't let the door hit you on the way out&quot;<br>

<br>
Oh well.;(<br>
<br>
BTW exactly how many times did you leave AL over loot, and then beg to come back later when there was something else you needed?  Seems like we always took you back - but people never forgot the way you'd left before, again and again.  Might be why you didn't get a cleric epic drop over someone else who had been there a shorter time - you had lost your claim to seniority (if you ever really had one).  Plus you'd just pissed enough people off that they didn't trust you anymore.<br>
<br>
I always thought you were a pretty cool guy, but your post just proves what a gullible sh*t I have been.  I'm not disappointed in you, seems like you've just behaved the way others always expected you to - I'm disappointed in ME for believing you had some sense of loyalty to the guild that kept taking you back time and again.<br>

The conversation is polite until you they are told no then the 10 year comes out. (Don't correct me silguss if you are 11, you act 10)<br>
<br>
Why Good memebers of Peritus are you following a bunch of 10 year olds around? Common decency, would you want another guild coming down and doing the same to you? putting another 20+ people in the same area of the zone, messing with the spawn times?<br>
<br>
From this day forward, why should I respect a peritus camp since they repeatedly do not respect others?<br>

<br>
Correction for you guys though: Nitena is Anna's bot chanter.<br>
<br>
To Elanarii, I'm guessing you are referring to me. Well you may have been in AL longer(not really you left 3 times) but my raid attendance was stellar and frankly made yours looks silly. Never once did you hear me say &quot;Nothing drops for me there&quot; which is what you said with reference to Kael raids. I went where the guild needed me unlike you. You went where stuff dropped for you.<br>
<br>
Now with reference to me leaving AL. This had nothing to do with my epic but mostly due to burnout.  When you do what I did my last 5 months in AL and more specifically the last 3 weeks you tend to get a bit testy.<br>
<br>
Btw Eladnarii would be nice if you tell people how you ripped off a guildmate for a bracelet of sense.<br>
