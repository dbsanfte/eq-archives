Are They Weird or Is Something Wrong With Me?</span><hr size=1> Ok firstly let me introduce myself, most of you knew me as Xrathos in EQ, but that was a long time ago, I have since quit but still read the message boards to see how all my old buddies are doing and talk about none-EQ related topics.. that being said, let me introduce my real life self.<br>
<br>
My name is Mike, I'm 19 years old, and I have very bad luck with relationships it seems hehe.  I don't think I'm a bad looking kid, I'm 6'1&quot;, 185 pounds, deep blue eyes, dusty blond hair, a very nice tan, and I think I'm in fairly good physical shape (note: I look 16, not sure why, I just do).  Now then, as far as personality goes, I'm a very deep logical thinker, I always think things through before acting, I always look at the consequences before doing, etc, as a result, I have never touched drugs, very rairly drink (I drink some, but I never drive after drinking), and so on.  I treat women with the utmost respect, I am very nice to them and very much a gentleman, when I go out with a girl, I ALWAYS pay, and if they offer, I say that I appreciate the offer, but I wouldn't be much of a gentleman if I let them pay.<br>
<br>
I don't really go out of my way to meet women, I figure that when I meet the right one, I'll know it and it won't be at a bar or someplace like that (no offence to bar women, but there's no way I could spend my life with the kinda girls you meet at most bars), I don't even go to bars or most &quot;teenage hang out points&quot; because being around drugs and such just isn't my style.  I usually meet people by like a friend introducing me to a friend, or something like that, and that's how I meet girls for the most part.  I'll often hang out with friends and stuff, see a cute girl, flirt a little, but never ask for her number or anything, because it's just not &quot;my style&quot; to hit on every girl or ask every girl out.. Basically I'm a &quot;one woman man.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now then, as far as relationships go, it seems as though I'll find out from someone that a girl likes me and wants me to ask her out or something, so I will, and this is how my last girlfriend went:  She was hanging out with a group of my friends one time when I wasn't there, and like no one talked to her, so she was complaining to my buddy Zak that no one talked to her, so he gave her my AIM screen name and said &quot;this guy will talk to ya&quot; and told her about me, we talked and stuff and she told him she hopes I ask her out, he told me, so I decided to take a chance and basically go on a &quot;blind date.&quot;  We meet, she's about 4'11&quot; and pretty damn cute, so we go out to a movie and dinner, then come back to my place and hang out... well there's like nothing to talk about so we end up making out for a while then I take her home.. really good first date I figure.  I could tell she was REALLY into me, and I really liked her but I didn't know anything about her, but I figured I'd learn more about her and give it a shot.. By the way, she had just turned 17 like 2 days before.<br>
<br>
Ok, I take her home and tell her I had a good time and such, she says she had a REALLY good time, kisses me good night, and asked me if I'd mind getting on AIM when I get home so we can talk some more.. I say ok, and get online when I get home.. we didn't talk that much but we kinda &quot;talked through my friend&quot; because there are awkward questions you don't wanna directly ask the other person.  Anyway, I said I was very scared of getting hurt again (I had just spent 2 months of the worst depression of my life trying to get over my last girlfriend), and she was saying how much she liked me and felt so right about me, etc.  Well I finally told my friend that I'm gunna take a chance with her, she seems like a good enough / nice enough girl, so the next day we went out again and became official.  A day or 2 later we were talking about sex, and I found out she's a virgin.. good news to me, because my biggest fear was that she would be easy.  I find out a number of other things about her, and realize she's pretty much what I wanted in a girlfriend, so I tell her that I really like her back and I'm not afraid of moving too fast anymore, she's really happy and we basically turn into a fairly serious relationship, very fast.<br>
<br>
All's well for several days and we're having a lot of fun together, I'm really starting to get into her but there's still no love of course, everything seems well, she keeps telling me how much she likes me and feels so right, then all at once, without warning, she breaks up with me.. This is line I get &quot;I'm sorry, I just don't feel it anymore.. You seem like a REALLY nice guy and any girl would be lucky to be with you, but I just don't like you as more than a friend anymore.. can we start over as just friends?  It's nothing you did, it's nothing you said, you're a great guy.. it's not you it's me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, this seemingly is the story of my life.. I have NO trouble meeting women, talking to women, getting them interested in me, being a good boyfriend, treating them right, etc.. but somehow I have a very hard time holding onto a serious relationship, it seems like shortly after it gets really serious, they suddenly don't like me anymore, yet they REALLY want a serious relationship with me days (or mere hours) before.. I always get &quot;you did nothing wrong, you're a great guy.. I just don't feel that way anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
So, to all the women out there (or men who know an inordinate amount about women), is there something wrong with me?  Is it just that I happen to get weird women that have emotional issues or are really unstable?  Is it that I'm too nice?  What is it?  I've never had a fight with a girlfriend at all.. I play fought with em sometimes or had a discussion about something, but never even raised our voices at eachother.. is that the problem?  We got along too well that they got bored?  Or is there something wrong with me?  I need help! lol<br>
<br>
Anyway, I know this was long, and I apologizing, but I guess I just needed to vent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

When I was your age (god, I swore I would never start saying that!), I found that the women (in retrospect, they weren't women at all, they were girls) around me couldn't concentrate on ANYTHING for more than a couple of weeks at a time. That was fine though, because neither could I.<br>
<br>
Apparently, this is not the case for you.<br>
<br>
All I can say is, things will improve. Until then, you have to be aware of the fact that most 19 year old girls don't know what the hell they want (no offense intended, most 19 year old boys don't either). <p>Thedosius Dreamtwister<br>

Are They Weird or Is Something Wrong With Me?</span><hr size=1> Mike, first off you are young and they are young.  Not many 17 year old girls are looking for a serious relationship.  I know I wasn't at that age, I was looking to hang out and have fun, if a guy came along and wanted to date me great, if not oh well still having fun.<br>
Maybe you are trying to get too serious too fast and they are freaked out.  I know I dated a guy and like a month after I met him, these talks started coming up about how he wanted to marry me.  I put an end to that really fast, I was 16 and a serious relationship was the last thing on my mind.  I am still friends with Nate and he did end up getting married to one of my friends 3 months after meeting her. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That was fine for them but not what I wanted.  Anyway, back to the point.<br>
The whole you are a really nice guy, its not you its me line is a classic.  And it is partly you otherwise they wouldn't be saying it.  You sound kind of shy.  I am not sure how chatty you are but I know I hated trying to carry the conversation on my own, it was the one thing that really used to drive me crazy.  Maybe the whole &quot;talking through your friend&quot; thing wasn't a good idea.  She could have taken that as you being too afraid to talk to her, and that is never a good sign.<br>
I think the problem is with this one and maybe others you just moved too fast.  You are young slow down enjoy it, have some fun, and I know you said you are a logical thinker, but hun love is the least logical thing on this planet.  Just let things happen.  If there were no sparks then no big deal, from the sound of it you didn't have a ton of time invested in this relationship and maybe she was just testing the water, you weren't her type of water.  It happens. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For some reason something I have never understood about young women, and don't get depressed about this, but some of them just love jerks.  Nice guys usually do finish last, but if you were to talk to a 34 year old divorced woman I bet you she would tell you about the nice guy she let get away and how she wished she could have him back.  There are some girls who go through bad boy phases, I was guilty of that myself.  But after dealing with the bad boy/jackass attitude I realized that was not what I wanted for my life.  Give it time, the older you get the more you will find women will be ready for a serious relationship, you are just really young right now and most girls your age are not thinking about long term relationships.<br>
I think you just haven't found the right one yet, but you will.  Keep the faith and have fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Are They Weird or Is Something Wrong With Me?</span><hr size=1> Ok here's some things from me<br>
<br>
1)  Serious relationship?  You're 19.  You ain't ready.  I grew early too and I realize now that I wasnt ready for a real relationship at that time.  YOu dont even fully know yourself yet (though I'm sure your'e saying to yourself right now that you do.  You don't.)<br>
2)  17??  Ok lets go over a few facts here.  98% of women have, as far as I'm concerned, multiple personality disorders.  They have various personalities fighting for control at all times which is why they dont know what they want on the majority of subjects for any real length of time.  The younger the woman, the more predominant the symptoms of this.  Also, as Aiaka said, many women like jerks.  Women and love are illogical.  They want what they cant hang onto or what is a challenge rather than a good thing very often.  Again, the younger they are the worse this is.  <br>
3)  Stop letting your friends hook you up.  They're probably not as intelligent as you and won't pick the best types of women.  Either find your own women or better yet, stay single till you accomplish the things missing listen in item 1. <br>
4)  If you're looking for a relationship to be logical and make sense, give up dating altogether and stick to rosy palm.  <br>
<br>
Now I understand you're probably like me, a hopeless romantic, dead set on finding that true love.  Newsflash:  you're 19.  Also, true love is rare.  Have a good time, date, meet new people, quit looking for love.  Assume it's not gonna come to you for a while.  It may show up, then it can be a surprise, but the more you look for it the more it will elude you.  <br>
<br>
Life's a bitch.  Shit happens.  Either it breaks you or you break it.  I suggest just working on getting yourself where you want to be socially, emotionally, financially and spiritually.  When and if you get to a point in life where you are truly content with being single and are happy with your life and independent, you will be ready for love.  And...NO MORE 17 YEAR OLDS!<br>

You say the spark's gone<br>
Well get an electrician<br>

I had my first seriuos boyfriend at 16 and we dated exclusively until we were 18.  I went for a year sort of dating, and then my next serious boyfriend for another year and a half.  Then another year of sort of dating until I met my husband at 21 (he was 20 by the way).  We have now been togther for 9 and a half years, and are still extremely happy.<br>
<br>
The problem is that while there are other people who are like you, there are not a lot of other people like you.  So just don't sweat it.  Take your time, and when it is right (for then, because I went through two Mr Rights for right now) you will know, and when it is REALLY right, you will really know. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/Barnes101/wintersbane.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub12.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tibult>tibult</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.gue.ca/Smilies/afro.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered Member</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#330000>(6/27/03 3:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=815.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~ewasan/sig/tibult01.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Women... Are They Weird or Is Something Wrong With Me?</span><hr size=1> *sighs*<br>
I remember 19... I think we were listening to the jungle drums in South Africa as they told us about the Monguls that invaded China several planting seasons earlier.<br>
<br>
Anyway, first and foremost, you seem like you have a good head on your shoulders (to coin another pharse) and you will do just fine. There are, however, a few things you say that I remember saying myself, only to find out that this happens way more in Halmark Cards and Julia Roberts movies than in real life (sorry Roberts fans.. I'm jaded). <br>
First of all, the idea of a lover that will hit you like a mystical lightening bolt from the sky is a nice fantasy, but hardly EVER true. Yes, it does happen sometimes, and I have seen ONE couple that had that take place. ONE. I have known THOUSANDS, and it only happened to ONE. The truth is that you will likely find someone that is your friend, and later becomes your lover. Perhaps one of the strongest relationships I have ever seen was a couple that got together and were friends for years before their first kiss. <br>
This isn't like shopping for a mini-van. You don't make sure the tires are inflated properly and the muffler doesn't rattle. If you are talking about a lasting relationship, you are talking about something that will continue to grow and develop with you as long as the two of you are together. Sometimes you will find out that you are better friends than lovers, it's just the way it is. To wit, my very best friend right now is a former lover. It happens.<br>
Now, if what you say about your drug/alcohol use is true, bravo! If possible, I would shake your hand and congratulate you for making a very hard and extremely wise decision. At your age especially, you need to avoid making choices that will make your life even more difficult than it already is. Yes, I started binge drinking when I was 18 (that was the legal age then) and quit when I was 25, but I have also been told time and again how rare that is. What is more, I made MORE stupid choices becasue of that action than nearly any other I have made over the course fo my life. Luckily, none of these led to an unwanted pregnency or incurable STD. Don't put yourself in that position if you can avoid it. You have made some wise decisions, I salute you for them. Keep it up.<br>
Finally (and this could be more cultural than anything else), you seem very concerned about the outside and not to worried about the person. Whether or not she is a virgin will not made a whole lot of differance if your personalities are compatible. Her height and physical appearance is a VERY temporary atribute, as is yours. If you want to develop a lasting relationship, it has to go beneath the surface. Discover who you are, find out what you like, learn about that which intereasts you, then talk to people about those things. If there is any path to the &quot;star crossed lovers&quot; I would say this is it. I have seen people take up a habbit to &quot;meet chicks&quot; only to find out that they don't like the activity and like the &quot;chicks&quot; even less. Moral of the story, don't take up Nude Square Dancing to meet women, do it because you want to square dance in the nude. Chances are there will be other women there that also enjoy nude Square Dancing, and you are going to be infinately more likely to get along with them because you share an intereast.<br>
And finally, the magical element. The one factor that will make any relationship fail (if it is missing) is comunication. BASICALLY, tell so-and-so to tell such-and-such will never last. If the two of you can't talk to eachother, how can you ever expect to live together in a meaningful and fulfilling exchange? If you are looking for a lasting relationship, you need to offer more than a charming smile and trendy phrases (bling-bling... WTF does that mean?). If it is going to work, you need to be able to share yourself with her, and let her share herself with you... AND be secure in doing that. Kissing, petting, sexual games and parties ... it comes in time (pardon the pun) if that's what you want. The physical aspect is VERY easy, but the emotional is WAY harder. What is more, you can go through the motions and get the physical easy enough. You can only fake the emotional for a short time, and once the facade starts to fail, there is NO saving it. <br>
<br>
Now, I am sure there are those out there that will say I am full of shit, to which I say ... fine.  I have comforted enough of the girls who's hearts were broken by caloussed SOBs like you to know what I am talking about. (bling bling?).  I see in Xanthus a person that wants to do the right thing, just isn't really too sure what that thing is.  To him I say Keep doing what you are doing now.  You are going in the right direction, just have a little more patience.  If you want a course of action, then I offer you this advice: <br>
As the saying goes, &quot;Know thyself.  No single aspect of thine is more important.&quot; <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Are They Weird or Is Something Wrong With Me?</span><hr size=1> Everyone is telling you to have fun, LIVE your life. No drugs, rarely drink, no unnecessary chances, you sound like a rational down to earth kinda guy. Take that advice! <br>
<br>
As a woman, one who is almost 40 years old, I can look back on my life, and I can say, &quot;I've done that!&quot; There are very few things that I've lacked in my life. The reason being, I have a list, (ok, I KNOW that sounds corny, but still... ) on my list is everything I want to do. I call it my LIFE LIST. Everything I want to do/accomplish/see/feel/etc in my life is on that list. There are still several things to be checked off, but for the most part, I've done alot of the things I wanted to accomplish in my life. I have 4 great kids, I've loved with all my heart and soul, and I've been loved in return, those are the things that are pretty rare these days. And while we ALL want to know love, true love, it's a rare commodity in today's world. The only advice I can offer you, is to stop lookin' for it. Be open to it, and when it's meant to be yours, it will find YOU.<br>
<br>
In the meantime.... enjoy life. And don't let the lil things get ya down.... <br>
<br>
And FFS NO more 17 yr olds!!! They have problems deciding day to day whether to wear the blue blouse, or the red one to school, they absolutely have NO CLUE what they want in a life mate!!  <p>&quot;Rational thinking is overrated&quot;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
When I read this, it reminded me how lucky I was to find Hang the way that I did.  We were not friends first.  We met in a very chance circumstance.  <br>
<br>
He was in a Fraternity, I was in a sorority.  His Fraternity held a party called 'strangers in the night' where the brothers had to invite a date for someone else.  I was invited for another brother who I did not get along with at all once I got there (I had never met the person I was asked for so for me the only compelling reason to go was that I had friends who were going to be there).  <br>
<br>
Hang was working that evening, and was not going to go to the party, so no one invited him a date.  He knew my friends from his dorm and he came over and chatted with us (we were hiding from my date in the kitchen).  The two of us enjoyed each other's company so much that I ended up staying past the last shuttle bus to my area of campus.  He walked my home in a blizzard over a mile in the snow, and we talked the entire way.  <br>
<br>
I felt like I had known him my whole life.  I would say that the biggest thing that attracted him to me was that we have very similar morals and very similar views on life (when it comes to the important stuff that is).  He got stuck in my apartment for three days due to the snow.  Luckily my 4 other roommates liked him too, and he was a complete gentleman.  He also will say that the fact that I did not sleep with him is why he called me back after being actually dug out three days later (little note for the other ladies, the better men, the ones that you want to be with long term, do not appreciate woman who do not appear to respect themselves.)<br>
<br>
I told my sister in law two weeks later that I had most likely found the man I would marry.  This is entirely different from the way that I was in the other long term relationships that I was in.  I had dated other men for very long periods of time, and even while I was in the relationships, I knew that they were not leading towards marriage.  <br>
<br>
Another the thing that I will say is that if Hangetsu and I were not married and lovers, we would have been friends.  We LIKE each other as well as love each other.  I still enjoy talking to him and being around him.  He makes me laugh, and he makes me feel lucky every day.<br>
<br>
So I guess my point is, that while we may not have met and become friends before we became lovers, the reason that almost 10 years later we are still happy is because we are friends.  Without that aspect there are times in every relationship that you want to throw in the towel.  Times get tough no matter how happy you are, but if the friendship is true, there is no way that you won't work through those times, and come out the other side happier and stronger.  The friendship (and communication which goes WITH a true friendship) is what you should be cultivating.  And quite honestly if you cultivate friendships and they do not developed into relationships, it is not a wasted effort.  You have a new friend, and if it is a true friendship, it was worth the time you invested anyway.<br>
<br>
Oh, and on a side-ish note: keep to the not drinking too much and staying away from drugs.  I didn't do drugs, I still don't regret it.  I did drink heavily and there are things that I regret due to that, which would have been different if I had been only a moderate drinker.  Have fun and enjoy yourself, you don't need alcohol or drugs to do it, and it sounds like you are the type of person who already knows that. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/Barnes101/wintersbane.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=815.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=815.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=815.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=815.topic&start=81&stop=97>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=815.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=815.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=815.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=815.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.threadControl?topicID=815.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=815.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=815.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub228.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="xevserverboardsfrm1">General Discussion<option value="xevserverboardsfrm7">Marketplace<option value="xevserverboardsfrm2">Raiding<option value="xevserverboardsfrm16">Poll Mania<option value="xevserverboardsfrm4">Epic Quests<option value="xevserverboardsfrm13">Trade Skills<option value="xevserverboardsfrm3">Tactics<option value="xevserverboardsfrm5">Questing<option value="xevserverboardsfrm9">Looking for Guild<option value="xevserverboardsfrm12">Guild Leading and Officership<option value="xevserverboardsfrm11">Guild Link Submission<option value="xevserverboardsfrm6">Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm26">Political Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm10">/ooc<option value="xevserverboardsfrm21">Rant Polls<option value="xevserverboardsfrm19">Archives<option value="xevserverboardsfrm15">Moderators Forum<option value="xevserverboardsfrm23">ber<option value="xevserverboardsfrm27">Ask the Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards>Xev Server Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6>Rants</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.3e<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
