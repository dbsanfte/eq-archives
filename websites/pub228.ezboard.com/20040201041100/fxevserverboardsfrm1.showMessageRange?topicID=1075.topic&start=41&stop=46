It has been done this way for years.  Sure somethings are fair game, and competed for.  But when it comes down to it, they are all close and tight knit.  Why do you think people get thier reps ruined so easily on Xev.  A guild says some one has cheated them.  The others either dont allow app or use caution due to words of advice from the others.<br>
<br>
For many many years on Xev Sleeper had the ability to be woken.  We have a rather huge list of guilds capable of taking all 4 warders and waking him up.  But all the guilds on Xev played nice and let him sleep cause at the time, PoP was a bigger challenge, and because they liked the current loot table that exsisted in ST.  <br>
<br>
Trust me when I say if Hawkestone said, &quot;Guys, we are gonna wake Sleeper.&quot; Everyone would snarl a moment and say why??!!  But when it comes down to it they would realize they could not stop them from waking him.  So now, here, is where its stupid to claim that our server wouldnt have all pitched in to help try and be the game's first to do so. <br>
<br>
It wasnt so much that they woke him.  It was that they didnt notify any one, and ran from him after he woke up.  Everyone wanted to be part of it, but how could they when they had no knowledge?  So please, before you say that, know more about how much of a positive server Xev is.  Smaller challenges unite them regularly, Im confident that a big challenge like Sleeper would have drawn them even closer.<br>

<br>
Then prlz sir, explain to me why such a fuss was made over hawkestone waking the bitch up?, it certainly wasnt because the top end guilds wanted to make an attempt on the sleepers life, seeing as they all thought it was an UNFCUKINGKILLABLEMOB. It was for loot. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br>
<br>
Shadow, please by all means post your rant, have this thread moved to to rant forum, and boy will i give you one hell of a whipping because,<br>
<br>
FACT 1: EVERYONE THOUGHT THE SLEEPER COULD NOT BE KILLED, i know people through there lives away at raids all the time, but there they know the mob CAN be killed. Are you really going to tell me you would let your self die 70  times when for all you and the rest of teh server knows the mob CAN NOT BE KILLED?<br>
<br>
FACT 2: If xev took down the sleeper, which i have no doubt we could have with a rag tag zerg force, we still would have been on a band wagon and shunted as LAME.<br>
<br>
FACT 3: ANY RAG TAG GROUP OF NOBODYS COULD HAVE AWOKEN THE SLEEPER, as proveen when hawkestone did it, so why did guilds who where so far beyound have a cry? many would say its because the younger generations wouldnt have had a swing at the sleepers tomb, which is fair enough, i know i never would have seen it, but that doesnt bother me, as you said most people who raided sleepers tomb are beyond the loot anyway. Go take down a god or something, do an LDON raid, who gives a fruck about 2 year old content anyway?<br>
<br>
It may be late, and i may be tired, but i will stand by what i have said here, and if it pisses you off so much <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.undergroundguides.com/everquestemu.htm" target="top">HERE</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> go play on a player run server and solo teh bitch if you want. <p>Kwip - 39 ranja<br>

<br>
Let me spell it out for you in detail.<br>
<br>
Several weeks ago, a Japanese guild playing on a server with only Velious installed zerged the sleeper and got him to 24% - they made a video of it and installed it.  Now, up until that point, the sleeper had never been woken with a server wide effort.  The only servers that had a chance - like Xev - had had him woken by immature guilds seeking to make a name for themselves by showing they didn't care about the rest of the server.<br>
<br>
The folks on RZ got their idea from THAT encounter - not from any of their own thinking.  It didn't matter - they still organized and killed the sleeper.  Xev would have gotten the same idea from the same video - and probably would have been the first to give it a go.  The high end guilds on Xev have always been semi-civil.  Many of them had probably kicked around waking the sleeper several times before he actually was.  It wouldn't have been hard to organize and do.<br>
<br>
Now on to your facts:<br>
<br>
1) See above.  Yup - whoops, you lose.  RZ knew the sleeper was killable before engaging.  Time to get a new fact.<br>
<br>
2) Pure and utter nonsense.  First, see above for why Xev probably would have had a go before RZ.  Second, many of us still play everquest to beat seemingly impossible encounters.  Third, how many people do you see shunning FoH or TR?  AL did every encounter but Quarm first (and that only by the space of some 20 minutes or so).  Just because you are lame enough that its all about dick stroking doesn't mean the rest of EQ is.<br>
<br>
3) Why did older guilds complain?  Yeah, anyone could have done it.  The point was that it took cooperation between some of the largest competitors on the server NOT to do it.  That in itself means something.  It was never about the loot for many of us.  You sound just as selfish and immature as their actions that day when you spout BS crap like that then claim it is a &quot;fact&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just because you are too immature and selfish to see that EQ is a COMMUNITY as well as a game does not make it untrue.  Real people play are playing the characters around you.  They have real feelings and believe it or not, how you act can affect how they are feeling.  Noone likes to log onto a game for a bit of enjoyment and have some retard go out of his way to ruin their play time.  While I would be the first to say that it is just a game and you should remember that - I am also the first to say that you should remember that characters are real people and act accordingly.<br>
<br>
Also, you wont give anyone a whipping in a rant.  The only half decent efforts you've made have been jumping on the band wagon when others have already turned the target into a rotting carcass.<br>
