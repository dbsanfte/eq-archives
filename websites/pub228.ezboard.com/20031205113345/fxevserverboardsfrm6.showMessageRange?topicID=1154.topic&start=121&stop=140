Do you even know what this is about?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> But my point was which you missed and I quoted you, you hardly ever use darkness, that was the point I was trying to make but it went way over your head, tell me since you know SK's so well, How much hate does this generate, Festering Darkness + Terror of Thule + Touch of Inny without using taunt compared to Terror + disarm + bash<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
GOD MAN PUNCTUATE!<br>
<br>
FD uses twice the manna, so I don’t drop it just for agro control.  To prevent pong, sure I will use my darkness line, but if I can get by with a terror only line (and lets not forget my 2 procs I keep running) that generates greater than or at least equal hate with half the manna ... why not do this?  Sometimes I do snare pull with festering, but if I am in a group that needs to move fast and has the DPS, it is much faster to just hit a jolt instead.<br>
<br>
Also, if you are TRYING to take agro from me, I let you have it.  I just move behind the mob and kick its ass while you take the damage.  If it turns on me, I hold off spells a few rounds to see if you want it back.  Ya see, I am ALWAYS happy to let you get hit instead of me.  I'm not going to waste manna trying to take agro unless we are just dicking around.<br>
This is obviously way over your head, so just smile and go back to your TSR novels.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tell me oh great knowledge of sk's, How would you transfer hate to a warrior when you just pulled a mob with lets say CD?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Many ways, up to and including the old tried and true FD.  But we are forgetting a few things.  FIRST, if I am pulling and NOT tanking (otherwise your question is dumber than shitcovered raisins) I don't snare pull, dumbass.  Second, as I said before, I don't USE my darkness line unless I have to.  Third, you are too fucking stupid to understand if I ACTUALLY did explain my strategy to you ... so I will spare you the pain.  Go back to your TSR novels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Tell me one other thing since this post was on warriors.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Once again, hukeded on foniks wurks for u<br>
The post was about tanks holding agro.  ALL tanks.<br>
<br>
Now, to the ONE thing you said that seems to have some merit, the CD/FestD issue.  I use FestDark too, since it actually has some purpose.  IF the mob starts to pong this makes it easy for me to keep track of it and get agro back on me almost immediately.  There have been a number of people that have been claiming that this wouldn't work because CD is better.  My point (which you actually seem to agree with) is that the terror line is better than any of them, more manna efficient, and more versatile (aka casting on a mezed mob).  If you THINK I am ONLY using my terror/disarm/bash, the reading thing is getting you again.  <br>
<br>
Take your time and read very slowly.<br>
<br>
I ... don't .... have .... problems .... with ..... agro.<br>
<br>
What is more, I have been told by several people that I do tank better than many 65SKs.  Yes, I was flattered.  I never considered myself that good.<br>
Others do.<br>
<br>
So .....<br>
I ... don't .... have .... problems .... with ..... agro.<br>
<br>
You seem to have serious problems with reading comprehension.  You seem to heve REALY missed the part where I explained that :<br>
I ... don't .... have .... problems .... with ..... agro.<br>
so let me tell you again <br>
I ... don't .... have .... problems .... with ..... agro.<br>
<br>
I am telling you what works for me.  This also seems to work for my group since they don't have problems with agro either... considering it is usually on me.<br>
<br>
just for fun<br>
I ... don't .... have .... problems .... with ..... agro.<br>
<br>
now, go back to your TSR novels, child.  You bother yourself.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :owned2 --><img src=http://www.gue.ca/Smilies/sign-owned.gif ALT=":owned2"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

<br>
huh? what? where?<br>
Tibs, if you were answering kwip...I think he was trying to insult you<br>
*shrugs*<br>
<br>
And if someone actually does think we are the same person....well, they just need some help.  I dunno where they'd even start thinking that...we aren't even the same gender in game or irl....<br>
<br>
Kraktor *shakes her head* read carefully....and try not to embarrass yourself so much with misquotes and false assumptions next time.  Sure Tibult can be confusing the way he words things sometimes....but even I understood what he has been saying, and yes, I do play an sk alt so i have a half a clue.  Granted she is not nearly high enough level for me to barge into the spell-for-aggro discussion, but I spent a LOT of time talking with high level sks I've hunted with, and doing some simple research, that I can at least understand what is going on.<br>
<br>
And if you want a true contest of who can hold better aggro...limit yourself to only the spells Tibult has, and account for the difference in mana.  A spell may cost you only 7% mana...but just given your guild I'd assume you'd have more of a mana pool to work with <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Red dress ... your avatar has a red dress ... I just did the best I could.<br>
<br>
If you are confused, then ask questions.  But if you are actually confused, I would think you at least TRIED to read the thread ... which Krackhead didn't..... obviously.<br>
<br>
The only thing I don't actually KNOW for sure is how much hate the darkness line generates.  I can see how finding this out would be useful, but as long as I don't know, I stick to what I do.  2 jolts is the same manna and seems to work better than one snare.Sure, it takes longer, UNLESS we consider the fizzles or interupts in combat in which case the jolts are WAY faster.<br>
If the mob turns off of me, a snare holds him still AND lets me get agro back.  If you are using your snare for agro control and it works for you, great.  I don't hve the manna to do that, but I CAN use my terror spells AND keep agro AND keep manna.<br>
<br>
I think a certian Pally said it best when he explained that &quot;any wannabes can throw 30-70 people at a mob and take it down.&quot;  When we can do it with two groups (thats 12 people, Krackhead, VERY few of which are 65), that shows the power of our guild.<br>
<br>
and in case you forgot, <br>
I .... don't ... have ..... problems .... with .... agro.<br>
<br>
Also, since I KNOW You will need it explained to you (not known for your intelligence) FD can be festering darkness or Feign Death.  Perhaps you can figure out which one I mean when it is used, but I am sure I will be explaining it to you later.<br>

Trust me, it matters not whether or not we are in the same time zone since I am likely to be on at any time I choose.  What does matter is that I like to joke around and actually have fun with the people I play with.<br>

You strike me as nothing but bitter, obnoxious, self absorbed, and conceited.  You telling me you would never group with me is more of a blessing than a curse.

Yes, his clever trick of VoT for Voice of Thule was picked up, but I didn't notice that I have referred to the voice line as a terror line.  Sorry for the confusion.<br>
Also, I have a nasty habit of asmuing that you understand things that you perhaps don't.  When I said &quot;I hardly ever use my snare&quot;, I meant after the jolt in order to gain agro.  If we are talking about overall, you will see that I use my snare QUITE often, just not for agro control as much as mob control.  If the mob starts to run, yes, I snare it to hold it in place and prevent adds.  If it starts to pong, I snare it to stop it and usually can get agro right back without even using a jolt.  Overall, I use my snare line quite often, but if we are talking about spells used only for keeping agro, &quot;I hardly ever (have to) use my snare (after a jolt)&quot;.  Did that make a little more sense?<br>

Any fool can out taunt the main tank, but only a fool does so.<br>
<br>
The Terror line has it's place, mostly in ACC and pre-mezz break taunts.  Certainly my SK level was a little lower when I stopped playing, but Hoschie here seems to agree on the ultimate all-rounder in getting agro on an SK, Clinging Darkness.  As does every other SK i've ever spoken to about it.  Your the first I have personally met who does not use CD as their main agro tool.<br>
<br>
Is this because Tibult knows something we dont? Or is it because Tibult doesnt know something everyone else has figured out?<br>
<br>
Your success with the terror line could be as much down to those who compensate for you as it is your own play 'style'.<br>
<br>
Sure CD can be overwritten by other spells, and in some groups therefor CD is not a viable option - but as your first choice for agro/cast time/mana efficiency... Well, I would say you are unique...<br>

I had to learn it from someone, or I still woudn't do it.  I didn't even USE my hate spells until I was well into my 50s (probably close to 57 or 58) since I always snare pulled and nuked as they were coming in.  If I could, I would lay in the DoTs and have them half dead by the time they got to my camp.  Now, at higher levels, I need to move faster and don't have the time to generate so much hate, so a  spell like a hate spell does the trick. Personally, I think that Fest Dark generates MORE hate than my hate spells, but since it uses more manna, I tend not to use it for hate control.  Also, I think CD does generate considerable hate, but the 57 terror (terror of Terris I think) just works a little better.  If the mob is mezzed, I can cast it and not break mez.  If I am fighting, I can cast it and have little chance of it failing and NO chance of it being resisted.  <br>
I did try the CD for hate, and early on it worked fine.  When I started using my hate spells, though, I noticed that they did work a little better.  Not JUST becasue they cast faster or generate more hate, but becasue I can use them more often (less inturupts and fizzles).  You use CD and most other knights do ... good for you.  I use Fest Drk as my snare (since it works as a snare) and Terror as my hate (since it works and fits my style).  The end result is that my group never has problems with me as a tank, I never have problems with agro, and if I need to change my spells, it is usually to add CD/fear/disease cloud so the casters can do more insane DPS or to up MY DPS because the caster aren't doing enough.  Sometimes I switch to my Blackened Sword that procs a terror spell to generate MORE hate.  Now, if I am using taunt, disarm, hate proc, hate spell, CD, snare, fear, DC, AND Mental Coruption, there is no way in HELL you are getting the mob off of me. Honestly, I hae NEVER had to go this far.  It's all about adjusting for every group, and that is why I enjoy the game.  I really would like to know what the numbers are for CD, however.  If it actully DOES generate more hate than my 57 Terror spell, that would be nice, but yet another of Verrant's idiotic little quirks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kwipdapimp>kwip dapimp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 291<br> <font color=#330000>(12/1/03 9:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1154.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tank Rant!!</span><hr size=1> this is becoming very repetitive, cant we all just get along? <p>Kwip - 39 ranja<br>

other nice thing with CD..  2AA points in the Spell Casting Expertise and it will NEVER fizzle again. I use Festering Darkness only in real nasty raid environments where you mana regen is insane anyways and its usual critical to get/hold agro.

Sure it gives you agro, but there is still a difference in just AGRO and AGRO+DMG. Means if you just agro the mob with terror and someone is makin dmg to the mob (let it be a pet from you or someone) somehow you can chaincast a pure agro spell on the mob over and over and it freakin doesnt matter. This wont happen if you use some dot. Even CD which does only 5dmg per tick seems to be enough to force the mob to come to you, even when under attack from the pet. <br>
<br>
Try it out, use a pure agro spell vs. a agro dmg spell.<br>
<br>
Edit: The chaincasting terror example of course only works if you dont do any dmg just cast the pure spell trying to get agro while something(pet) is actually hitting the mob. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527146" target="top"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">DreadLord</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;">Hoschie Mondschatten</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

CD is one way, jolts are another, spears, dots, taps, the list goes on and on. Each way has its strengths and weaknesses. And really there's no point in badgering Tibult for not using snare, or him badgering someone else for using snare (which he's not, actually).<br>
<br>
As for my personal tastes, I find that Festering is useful for very many things. One, it is far less resisted, by my experience, and is thus extremely beneficial for snare-splitting spawns when that's needed.<br>
<br>
Festering also has a very quick cast time and I rarely, if ever, get interrupted casting it. I also rarely fizzle, but that may just be luck.<br>
<br>
Festering is also 50 per tick dot. That is a good boost to your DPS contribution to a group, and as such I've grown into the habit of using Festering like it's going out of style even when grouped with druids + rangers.<br>
<br>
As for hate, Festering along with proper use of Taunt is more than enough to maintain aggro if you're meleeing a mob in any group where people actually have enough skill to know not to mash taunt when you're tanking.<br>
<br>
If I'm grouped with people who generate more aggro I'll toss in Fear. Our first fear is fast casting, relatively low mana, and is worth 4 or 5 jolts in my opinion. And I'll explain why.<br>
<br>
To my experience the jolts work wonders when you're in the mob's face, and when something other than jolt is on their hate list. If the only thing on a mob's hatelist is our jolt line, 1 stray nuke, snare or other taunt spell has ample chance of taking that aggro from you, becouse for some reason debuffs + dots + nukes + fears are given a much stronger kind of hate. It's the only way I can explain it but I've seen it in action.<br>
<br>
If I'm holding aggro with just fear on a mob, people dont' pull it off me as fast when I pay attention to another mob. When I use festering + fear on a mob, it's more like glue and the mob rarely leaves me (a mob I'm not meleeing). If I'm meleeing a mob and use festering and fear, I rarely have it leave me, and usually only when a pally/shad is casting + meleeing on the mob (and probably taunting), or when a caster spams a high aggro spell that SHOULD take aggro.<br>
<br>
I don't waste my time spamming hate spells when I don't have to, I cast what I feel is necessary for the group. Though I usually hold well enough aggro that nobody gets hit but me (in normal situations, or at least what I consider normal). But I also don't freak out if shaman01 takes a few hits, or wizard02 throws in one too many 4k crits.<br>
<br>
As for mana, well I've done fine playing this way in LDoN, and other zones, using Festering and Fear for aggro with nothing more than my meager FT4 and Pact of Hate. No bard, no ench, no magician. I've also done all of this through an entire LDoN with spot heals from a ranger and chained Drain Soul + Touch of Volatis when our only healer went LD. I've done that with BST heals + my taps and gone to win an assassination that way, with no &quot;healer&quot; class in group (went LD zoning in and didn't get back till we were done). And I don't consider that anything special. I see that as simply &quot;what an SK can do&quot;.<br>
<br>
Normal groups I festering and fear up front, I don't call for assist everyone jumps in the same time I do. I zevfeer's whenever it's up to pump 200hp 100m to everyone in group constantly, I tap to suppliment heals this making more use of my HP, and if able I Aura of Hate to add some minor DPS by way of attack boosts. If mana is REALLY flowing (KEI/Quellious, Mod Rods, and lord forbid also having a bard) I also toss in Blood of Hate, tap even more, and might even start throwing in spears.<br>
<br>
But generally speaking, since I'm usually tank, I'd rather tap than spear. I'd rather fear than jolt. And I almost always keep festering on the mob, and spam Zevfeer's. And only rarely do I have an issue with mana. If I do, I just drop out Aura of Hate, maybe slow down the taps, and as a last resort leave off Zevfeer's every other time I would normally cast it. But as I've said, Pact of Hate has helped me sustain this kind of pace before for an entire LDoN (took about an hour, since no healer and no KEI on half of us).<br>

I have tried the CD instead of terror and it just didn't work as well.  Maybe you are using something I don't have, maybe you know something I don't, but my spells are cast while in combat.  The fast cast times mean I don't lose as many hits and can get back on target (in case I had to switch) much faster.<br>
More often than not, I am the highest in the group.  That means that IF a mob breaks away and goes after a caster, I need to snare it and/or get agro back IMMEDIATELY.  Sometimes I can just switch targets while the rest of the group stays in the original target and tell another melee (usually a pally friend) to take over tanking while I tank mez.  This happens VERY seldom, but does happen.  Sometimes the wizzy doesn't know how to use his/her spells and nukes the holy fuck out of the mob and there is NO WAY ANYONE would hold agro against that.  I try to keep these snared so I know that at LEAST the wizzy will not be killed before I can get it back, but I NEED to chain cast to keep them (aside : I think the wizzy was playing like shit and had no idea how to control his own agro, but THAT'S not the point.  He wasn't going to listen to us regardless of what any of us told him, so I was just trying to kep him from getting smushed ) and the terror line works.  I can't snare and use CD, it just bounces off and has no effect.<br>
<br>
I'm NOT 65 and will probably never be.  I don't have 15 million AAs and (more than likely) never will.  I like the fact that zones still challenge me and I enjoy having to taylor my playing style to every pickup group.  If you want to come in and join up with the same 55 people to raid the same zones and kill the same mobs for the same loot, more power to you... I don't.  I enjoy the challenge of a new group every time with a new adventure and having to fit my style to a new group of people.  It doesn't mean that any of us are wrong, just that I don't use the same stratagey every time.  What I DO need more often than not, however, is a spell that I can cast fast and often to hold agro, and that won't break mez.  For that, the terror line is perfect.<br>
PERHAPS fear would work, but I don't know if that would break mez ore not, since I have never tried it.  Botom line, I don't have problems with agro.  IF a mob turns off of me, it almost ALWAYS turns to another tank and is right back on me in a tick or two.  IF it tears off after a caster, it gets snared (Fest Dark) and is RIGHT back on me.  IF terror isn't enough, I have aonther slot open to add CD or whatever else I may want to add.  I also have a choice of weapons I carry around with me so I can use a faster or slower 2hs (both with procs) or a 1hs and a shield.  When I have 2h bash (soon) it will change again.  This is why I enjoy playing my SK and will probably enjoy my pally alt (if I ever get her going) just as much.  I have to adjust my tanking style for every group, and that's what makes the game fun for me.<br>
<br>
If this offends you in some way, then you know my name, race, and class.<br>
Avoid me.<br>
<br>
I can't make it any easier than that.  Hell, I bet even FLABBY/PNEUB understood it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1154.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1154.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1154.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1154.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1154.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showMessageRange?topicID=1154.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showPrevMessage?topicID=1154.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showNextMessage?topicID=1154.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1154.topic&index=140><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.emailToFriend?topicID=1154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.threadControl?topicID=1154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/traditional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub228.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="xevserverboardsfrm1">General Discussion<option value="xevserverboardsfrm7">Marketplace<option value="xevserverboardsfrm2">Raiding<option value="xevserverboardsfrm16">Poll Mania<option value="xevserverboardsfrm4">Epic Quests<option value="xevserverboardsfrm13">Trade Skills<option value="xevserverboardsfrm3">Tactics<option value="xevserverboardsfrm5">Questing<option value="xevserverboardsfrm9">Looking for Guild<option value="xevserverboardsfrm12">Guild Leading and Officership<option value="xevserverboardsfrm11">Guild Link Submission<option value="xevserverboardsfrm6">Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm26">Political Rants<option value="xevserverboardsfrm10">/ooc<option value="xevserverboardsfrm21">Rant Polls<option value="xevserverboardsfrm19">Archives<option value="xevserverboardsfrm15">Moderators Forum<option value="xevserverboardsfrm23">Über<option value="xevserverboardsfrm27">Ask the Moderators</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#330000>- </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/bxevserverboards>Xev Server Boards</a><font color=#330000> - </font><a href=http://pub228.ezboard.com/fxevserverboardsfrm6>Rants</a> <font color=#330000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246k<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
