<font size="4">On this great day we witnessed the advancements of Balein and Okami to the ranks of Dragon Prince and Princess.
Also being recognized were Korin and Bianca who were named as advisors to the Lords and Ladies.  Congratulations
to all of you on very well deserved promotions!<p>
Since our last site update (shaddup!) we've had <i>several</i> people reach milestone levels so if I forget someone
please forgive me.  Congrats to Constella for attaining 20th level, Mnemeth and Lielack have reached 30th level while Corenado
has reached the big 35.  Zyla has reached 40 and Asif has hit the final EQ proper level of 50!  Shantue, Bjoseph and
Volka have all achieved 51st level.  Wolfmoon recently scribed his 52nd level spells, Korin his 53rd and Vaskyre has written his 54th
smash hit single.  Finally not to be outdone, Gvinn has reached his 57th (wow!) level.  Great job to all of you!
<p>
There have been some troubles with our BBS lately and Korin has assured me that he will of course do his best to get
those bugs worked out.  I'm putting a hold on any special events/gatherings that I personally am organizing; ie the Paw
 getogether we've talked about for the last couple of weeks.  Once the board gets fully operational again I'll resume
organizing events.  That doesn't mean any of you can't take charge and set something up in the mean time though.
<p>
Finally in light of the BBS being down I'll go ahead and use the main page here to announce the upcoming wedding of
Druvanos and Okami.  Any and all are welcome to attend the ceremony that will be held at the Arena off of Lake Rathe on Sunday
March 4th beginning at 8PM PST (or immediately following our Sunday meeting.)  Following the nuptials there will be a
drunken Arena brawl and some other surprises I'm sure.  I'm told a GM/Guide will be performing the ceremony so let's all
dress to impress. ;)

<P><FONT SIZE="4">Last weekend was a big weekend indeed, first on Friday night Norrath saw the fall of Cazic-Thule,
which I got <A href="/graphics/expcazic.jpg">the exp</a> for it.  Muhaha!  Then on Saturday we marched into the Ocean of Tears
and proceeded to claim Allizewsaur Isle as our own, taking down the giant leezard several times over the course of the afternoon in
 search of valuable gems.  While there that big dumb corrupted seafury happened to wander too close to our isle so we showed him
that trespassing on DW property is infact, unlawful.  Congrats to Balein on being one step closer to his Monk .. err Druid epic quest.
Then on Sunday we proceeded to storm into the dreaded Castle Mistmoore and show those evil inkies how DW does things.  Of note from that trip, both
Seladar and Kmork walked away with the hilts required for their Soulfire quests.  Outstanding work by all throughout the weekend I'm glad we all got to
 get together and had a lot of fun.  This coming weekend we will taking a trip to Kaesora, further details TBA.
On the leveling side Bjoseph has reached not only the milestone level of 50, but the first milestone of 30 with not one, but TWO of his alts.
Wow!  Gvinn blasted his way to 56 and Slamp has sliced and diced his way to the big 40.  Great work to all of you.

<P><FONT SIZE="4">I'd like to make a quick site update to congratulate Zyla on her completion of the Paw of Opolla quest.
I'm glad to see all of your patience paid off in the end.  Also on the leveling front I'd like to send out my congratulations to Wolfmoon,
Balelan and Balein for all achieving level 51 .. nice work guys and welcome to eternal hell levels.  Also hitting key levels were Decotti who
just released his 40th smash hit single and Kengo and Kence who have reached the big 30.  Nice work to all of you.  Keep it up!
<P>I'd also like to send out special congratulations to our guild's newest Knight Errants Slamp, Zannia and Llinoi!  Way to go and congrats
to the three of you all on promotions well deserved.

<FONT SIZE="4">Today three groups of us marched into the Frontier Mountains in search of adventure and rare spawns.
We got just that.  I'd like to thank all of YOU that attended today's event and helped make it in my opinion a success.
It's always nice when you've built up such a presence in a zone that people stop and take notice.  18 of us there did that.
I think that, for the most part, once we got the ball rolling things were going along really smoothly .. until of course
that dastardly Goblin Chieftan showed up twice.  I think we're going to have to put him on our "DW Most Wanted" list.
I'll take responsibility for the waste that he layed to our goblin group.  I didn't realize he could be so powerful.
When I went to kill him myself it turned out he was blue to me at 53 so to expect you guys to be able to kill him, clean pull
or not, is a lot.  However once dispatched we did relieve him of his prized Cheiftan's Headdress .. a nice +3 WIS head
item that went to the woowoo kid, Binjammin.  Congrats to you Binj and anyone else that came out with some of the prizes
received today.  It's only a shame that Blugtign didn't turn up .. however more often than not, he isn't around. =(
<P>Please everyone thank Decotti and Zyla for their efforts today .. I put them on the spot in asking them to take
charge of their respective areas and I think they handled it as well as could be expected.  Like me, they are learning how
to be a better leader.  I'd like to think I improved a lot than we did Crystal Caverns and all of that can be attributed
by your actions.  Everyone for the most part did an excellent job of listening up, following directions, not runnning off .. etc.
  Those were the things that upset me in past events.  I'd like to do FM as a guild again in the near future .. I think we
can all agree that it's a pretty fun, and RELATIVELY safe (I'll have goblin group better prepped next time) time once the
cycle gets rolling and rolling quickly.  Plus, I'm willing to bet our WIS casters would really like to go back and take
 another look for Blugtign.
<p>
Once again thanks all of you for helping make this a fun event.  Next week I'm asking for ALL level 35+ that can be on Sat at 10am EST.
(Time subject to change) to turn out for <B><I>KEDGE KEEP.</I></B>  We will meet outside Unrest in Dagnor's Cauldron.

<P><FONT SIZE="4">Well they say the third time is the charm and I guess it proved to be the case last night in
the Plane of Hate as the dastardly Maestro of Rancor went down on the third attempt.  He surprised all of us in
attendance by dropping his highly prized "Kelin's Seven-Stringed Lute", which was awarded to Vaskyre. (Yay me!)<P>
More impressive and more significant to me personally was that Asif was awarded with the most elusive prize known
to bards in all of Everquest .. The Imbrued Platemail Breastplate!!  Congrats Asif, welcome to the club!  There are
many bards that go through their entire career without seeing one of those.  We just happen to be two of the lucky ones.

*Cheesy Don Pardo voice*<p>
But wait there's more ... to cap off this great run for DreamWalker bards our own Decotti Van'Dree collected his
sixth and final ancient coin from the depths of Dalnir last night.  After turning all six coins into Wellford Fargin,
the Firiona Vie banker he was rewarded with the coveted Nostrolo Tamborine!
<p>
Congrats to us bards.  I'm so proud of all of us.  I've also been very proud of our presence in Hate the past few days
as well.  I believe there has been as many as six or seven of us up there at once during the past week.  This presence
will only continue to grow as our younger brothers and sisters grow in level and strength.  I'm really excited about
what the future is holding for us.
<p>
Finally, speaking of levelling .. I'd like to send out congrats to Druvanos on attaining level 30 and Llinoi on
reaching 40!  Great job to both of you, 60 is right around the corner. =)<p>
