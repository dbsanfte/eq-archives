<p><font size="4">While that classic line above may not be pulled from EQ lore I think that it's still an
appropriate sentiment regarding that portal in the Feerrott.  Last night was a big night for us, for many of us it was the first time stepping through 
that (in)famous portal.  Many hard battles were fought and many lessons were learned.  Kudos for Horaxe for putting together 
the whole ordeal.  I think we can all agree that he did about as well as could be expected for someone who had prior to that
 no Fear experience whatsoever.  Also I know a ton of you literally busted your humps to be able to be high enough to 
participate and show your support, good on you all for that as well.<p>
Congrats to Prince Balein on winning that very nice belt.  The prizes really started dropping after most of you left (including
an SK breastplate, Cleric boots and Monk gloves.)  It's just a shame that more of us didn't pull anything in.  Next time =)  Stay tuned 
for future events.  I'm told Horaxe is planning a couple of trips up to Hate soon and I plan on giving us a crash course in
 the Plane of Sky very very soon so keep your eyes peeled.<p><p>

MOVING ON UP!  SEEKING A VOLUNTEER OR TWO (OR THREE)<FONT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG src="/graphics/dragonright.jpg"> </TD> </TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE="4">I wanted to make a brief update to congratulate the folks who have achieved milestone levels recently.  So without
further delay, a big cheer for Mnemeth who has reached 35, a triple sized hurrah for Horaxe, Luni and Llinoi who have all pushed into
45, cheers for Ienyen who made 51, simultaneous salutations for Wolfmoon and Balein who have
 both reached 53 and last and certainly not least congrats to Gaea for hitting 45.  Way to go all of you!  Nice to see all this progress being made.  As usual, if I forgot you or someone just let me know,
I've barely played at all in the past week so I'm sure I missed something.  I didn't do it on purpose I swear! *BONK*<p>
<P>I am looking for a volunteer or two.  I am considering creating an officer position for an event/raid coordinator or two.  With a ton
of RL commitments hitting me I'm finding it difficult to find a good chunk of regular playtime for the time being, let alone try to schedule
an event or raid for all of you.  So if anyone is interested please email me at abneyesq@texas.net or icq 31893683 and we'll talk further.<p>

20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA .. IENYEN GETS THE BIG 50!!<FONT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><IMG src="/graphics/dragonright.jpg"> </TD> </TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<p><center><img src="/graphics/kedge.jpg"></center><p>	<font size="4">
First off I want to send out a special congratulations to our own Ienyen for achieving the final EQ proper level of 50.  It's a long
road traveled but seeing that "Welcome to level 50!" message always makes it worthwhile.  I'd also like to take a quick moment to send
out a salute to Ienyen for his never ending assistance towards anyone at any time.  He went well out of his way to port a couple of newbie
rogues to Tox the other night.  Turns out they (the rogues) were visiting from the Rathe while their home server was down.  They were
learning The Hole in preparation for a future raid.  The Rathe folks got ahold of me and wanted me to share their thanks with all of us and
that they wished there were more helpful people like Ienyen and us on the Rathe.  *Salute*<p>
Also attaining milestone levels are Dusoir who hit 30, Dalstar who reached 45 and Volka who hit 52 since our last update.  Great job to all of you.<p>
<p>Today we donned our scuba gear, grabbed our harpoons and headed into the murky depths of Kedge Keep.  Unfortunately as usually is the case on our
wonderful world of "*/rude* Tarew Marr" (tm), someone decided not to respect our raid wishes and left us with no Phinigel or Estrella to fight.
Aside from that we fairly effortlessly swam our way down to the staging area for Phin's lair.  Unfortunately his absence put a damper on the whole thing
in my book but besides that I still had a good time, especially while clearing the path down there, and I hope those of you brave enough to attend
did as well.  I was on edge most of the time down there due to the lack of respect shown by our serverwide comrades and trying to FD pull for
the first time anywhere, and what a place to start with Kedge Keep eh?<p>
Finally if you'll look at the latest member page update you might notice some names now missing.  I have removed some names of people who have been long standing members
and not been around in sometime like Komax or Dezian, and I've removed names of people retiring from the game like Decotti and Corenado.
I have NOT removed them from the guild, I am just cleaning up the page a little bit to try to give a more truthful depiction of our active roster.  I still have
these names stored in a guild database (www.guildboss.com) so should they turn up active again it's a simple set of keystrokes to reinsert them to
the members page.<p><p>

<p><center><img src="/graphics/boddragger.jpg"></center><p>
<font size="4">Today we assembled three groups of our bravest adventurers and set forth into the dungeon now known
as "The Hole."  Our goal was to reach the entrance to the ruins of Old Paineel, which we achieved. =)  Someday we will
return and set our sights on clearing through the city and to the undead tower.  Everyone fought bravely and was key in
our success here.  Well done to all of us.  I hope you are all as pleased as I was with our turnout.  I hope to return sometime as I now have a score to settle with that
overgrown pet Master Yael. ;)<p>
Also of note big congrats to Bianca for reaching 40th level, Lanhoff for attaining 45th level, Asif for reaching 51st level and
 Jcwine for reaching the big 55!  Way to go!<center>

<font size="4">Today we set out into the lair of the Splitpaw, or rather formerly of the Splitpaw clan gnolls as they
have been ran over by a much tougher clan of the furry beasts.  Pacing our way through we encountered many of the rabid dogmen.
Unfortunately for them, our blades were way too strong for them to be able to put up a fair fight.  After proceeding through
literally the entire lair we settled our final destination in the lair of the fabled Ishva, who eventually met the same fate as
it's gnoll brethren.  Upon searching the fallen Ishva's remains we were happy to discover a valuable "Summon Corpse" scroll, which
will go to the next Dreamwalker Necromancer or Shadow Knight able to scribe it for use.  Congratulations to all on a fun event.<p>
<p>But wait .. there's more....<p>
<center><image src="/graphics/okamiwedding.jpg"></center>
Later on in the evening we proceeded towards the Arena and rejoiced in the marital union of Druvanos and Okami L'Assundre.  After
the two dedicated themselves to each other and were joined in matrimony a "Royal Rumble" was held in the Arena with our own <a href="/graphics/wolfmoon.jpg">Wolfmoon
Risingson</a> taking the honors as the sole survivor.  The event was unfortunately, not without controversy as a childish pair of
brigands thought it would be cute to repeatedly attempt to slay the younger members of our family and yet, run at the first sign of any
trouble or death.  I have attempted to contact the guildleader of Symphony of the Night regarding his member's actions with no response
from him as of yet.  I'll keep you all up to speed on any response if/when received.<p><p>

<font size="4">On this great day we witnessed the advancements of Balein and Okami to the ranks of Dragon Prince and Princess.
Also being recognized were Korin and Bianca who were named as advisors to the Lords and Ladies.  Congratulations
to all of you on very well deserved promotions!<p>
Since our last site update (shaddup!) we've had <i>several</i> people reach milestone levels so if I forget someone
please forgive me.  Congrats to Constella for attaining 20th level, Mnemeth and Lielack have reached 30th level while Corenado
has reached the big 35.  Zyla has reached 40 and Asif has hit the final EQ proper level of 50!  Shantue, Bjoseph and
Volka have all achieved 51st level.  Wolfmoon recently scribed his 52nd level spells, Korin his 53rd and Vaskyre has written his 54th
smash hit single.  Finally not to be outdone, Gvinn has reached his 57th (wow!) level.  Great job to all of you!
<p>
There have been some troubles with our BBS lately and Korin has assured me that he will of course do his best to get
those bugs worked out.  I'm putting a hold on any special events/gatherings that I personally am organizing; ie the Paw
 getogether we've talked about for the last couple of weeks.  Once the board gets fully operational again I'll resume
organizing events.  That doesn't mean any of you can't take charge and set something up in the mean time though.
<p>
Finally in light of the BBS being down I'll go ahead and use the main page here to announce the upcoming wedding of
Druvanos and Okami.  Any and all are welcome to attend the ceremony that will be held at the Arena off of Lake Rathe on Sunday
March 4th beginning at 8PM PST (or immediately following our Sunday meeting.)  Following the nuptials there will be a
drunken Arena brawl and some other surprises I'm sure.  I'm told a GM/Guide will be performing the ceremony so let's all
dress to impress. ;)

<P><FONT SIZE="4">Last weekend was a big weekend indeed, first on Friday night Norrath saw the fall of Cazic-Thule,
which I got <A href="/graphics/expcazic.jpg">the exp</a> for it.  Muhaha!  Then on Saturday we marched into the Ocean of Tears
and proceeded to claim Allizewsaur Isle as our own, taking down the giant leezard several times over the course of the afternoon in
 search of valuable gems.  While there that big dumb corrupted seafury happened to wander too close to our isle so we showed him
that trespassing on DW property is infact, unlawful.  Congrats to Balein on being one step closer to his Monk .. err Druid epic quest.
Then on Sunday we proceeded to storm into the dreaded Castle Mistmoore and show those evil inkies how DW does things.  Of note from that trip, both
Seladar and Kmork walked away with the hilts required for their Soulfire quests.  Outstanding work by all throughout the weekend I'm glad we all got to
 get together and had a lot of fun.  This coming weekend we will taking a trip to Kaesora, further details TBA.
On the leveling side Bjoseph has reached not only the milestone level of 50, but the first milestone of 30 with not one, but TWO of his alts.
Wow!  Gvinn blasted his way to 56 and Slamp has sliced and diced his way to the big 40.  Great work to all of you.
Also added some more screenshots.<br><Br>
