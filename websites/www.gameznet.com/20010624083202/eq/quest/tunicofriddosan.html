              Paineel.<br>

            <br>

              This is the quest for the <a href="../equipment/tunicofriddosan.html">Tunic
              of Riddosan</a>. It is NoDrop any only wearable by Eru/SK. Only
              Erudite SKs should do this quest! Anyone else is wasting his or
              her time.<o:p>
              </o:p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This quest begins in Paineel in the palace.
              After completing the molar quest, the NPC will prompt you to speak
              with Royal Guard Sheltuin who is directly below the NPC for the
              Molar quest on the first story.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, “What more important task?”<br>
              <br>
              Royal Guard Sheltuin says ‘According to the evidence we’ve
              uncovered, it appears the kobolds are nothing but pawns to harass
              us. Or perhaps even all of Odus. If they wish to play these games,
              then we’ll humor them. We’ll take their pawn with one of our
              knights. Will you be the knight, Terroria?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘I will be the knight’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Royal Guard Sheltuin says ‘Then you will
              deliver this chest for us. Don’t worry about what’s inside it.
              Although we enjoy our solitude, we do make allies. We also make
              use of those allies. We will do so now. Take the chest to Lyris
              Moonbane below the human city of Qeynos. You will then follow her
              instructions and complete any tasks she assigns you. In return,
              she will send you back with what we wish. Fear is our armor.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now take the chest you will receive to the
              Qeynos Aqueducts. Find Lyris Moonbane. She is the necro
              guildleader and is in the room with the glowing circle on the
              floor with the candles. Give the chest to her….</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lyris moonbane examines the lock on the chest
              and pulls a black key from a pouch at her hip. The lock clicks
              open. Her eyes widen as she carefully opens the chest, revealing a
              pile of platinum coins and a small note. After admiring the coins
              she takes the note and reads it. The Necromancer glances up, then
              at her spectral pet who then hands you a Glass Jar. She says,
              ‘Are you ready for your first [assignment] Erudite?’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘What assignment?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lyris Moonbane says ‘We have just the thing
              for your friends back home. It will take some doing, but the pay
              off will be lovely indeed. In that jar you must combine 4
              substances. You’ll need two portions of a [goblin..source], one
              portion of [green river sludge], and one [portion of an
              experimental nature] that an agent of ours is working on. Bring
              the mixture back to me and we’ll speak again.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘What goblin source?’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lyris Moonbane says ‘The goblins of
              Antonica are known for their filthy habits and unclean practices.
              They often carry a menagerie of diseases and conditions. A more
              concentrated form of this aspect of goblin life cannot be found
              anywhere else but in the sewers of their citidel in the Serpent
              Spine. They must have workers who maintain the sewers. Find them
              and find the substance.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘What Green River source?’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lyris Moonbane says ‘The ogres of Oggok
              don’t spend much time on sanitation, so naturally their kind
              harbors many diseases. This is easily apparent in the river that
              runs near their city, Greenblood. Down at the very bottom of the
              river is where the ancient plagues have come to rest and
              hibernate. Once the sludge is mixed in with the other substances,
              those glorious blessings of Bertoxxulous will most assuredly
              awaken.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘What portion of an experimental
              nature?’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lyris Moonbane says ‘We have an agent
              studying in Freeport. Well, she actually isn’t in Freeport
              proper but rather under it, in the sewers. Her name is Driana
              Poxsbourne. When you find her, tell her I have sent you for the
              substance. She will most likely have a task for you to complete
              before she can give you the fourth portion. Obey her.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now head off with the jar (four slot
              container NoDrop) to Runnyeye. In the sewers locate the goblin
              janitors. Kill them enough to obtain two “a vile substance”
              the aren’t nodrop and are pretty worthless so hopefully you can
              find someone with some already ( thanks Tranex!).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Next head to the Feerrott. You’ll have to
              take a swim in the river for this one. I found the sludge on the
              bottom of the river on a rather flat area approx. at loc (137,
              704). The Sludge is NoDrop!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Next visit Driana Poxsbourne in the evil
              guild under East Freeport. Very easy to find once you’re down
              there.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘Lyris has sent me for the
              substance of an experimental nautre’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Driana Poxbourne says ‘Did she now? Well
              before I can give you the substance I have a task you must
              perform. I need [reagents] for my experiments to continue, and the
              merchants up in the city don’t’ appreciate my kind..I can’t
              imagine why.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘What reagents?’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Driana Poxbourne says ‘The infamous Mage,
              Najena employs several apprentices. These apprentices are most
              likely well equipped with just the reagents I need. Perhaps you
              can relieve them of their burden for me? Bring me 3 pouches of
              reagents from the Mages and you’ll have the substance.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now head over to Najena and start killing
              mages. If you’re lucky, a mage will be camping the mages for
              focus and/or epic items and may have 3 already. If not prepare for
              a boring camp. The pouches are fairly uncommon….not as uncommon
              as the focus items though. When you have all three of the pouches
              return them to Driana for the fourth component for the jar.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Driana Poxsbourne says ‘Ahh wonderful work
              Terroria. Here is the substance….don’t spill it
              HAHAHAaahhahehehe…yes……you don’t want to spill that heheh.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Your faction standing with BloodSabers got
              better.<br>
              Your faction standing with GuardsofQeynos got worse.<br>
              Your faction standing with OpalDarkBriar got better.<br>
              Your faction standing with PriestsofLife got worse.<br>
              Your faction standing with CorruptQeynosGuards got better.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now combine all four components in the jar
              and return them to Lyris in the Qeynos Aqueducts.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lyris Moonbane’s eyes light up with
              childish glee as she takes the jar containing the disgusting and
              deadly substance. From her pouch she removes a gob of putty, a gem
              carved into the likeness of a flying insect. After sticking the
              putty to the lid of the jar, she mashes the carved gem into the
              putty and hands the jar back to you. She then says, ‘This is the
              Harbinger of Bertoxxulous. When the gem is brought near the kobold
              lair it will enchant the substance. You must then [deliver] the
              substance.’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You say, ‘Where do I deliver the
              substance?’</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Lyris Moonbane says ‘You’ll need to find
              the source of the kobold water supply and pour the substance into
              it. Once you do that, the disease will infest whatever living
              organisms it comes in contact with so do yourself a favor and
              leave the area quickly. You can then take the empty jar to your
              master for your reward.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now head over to The Warrens and find the
              water source in the water near the price room on the left side.
              Just give the bottle to the water source and you’ll get an empty
              jar. Return this to Royal Guard Sheltuin for your reward.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Royal Guard Sheltuin says ‘Well done,
              Terroria! Now we need only wait for the kobolds to start dying off
              and our plan will be complete. Should only take 8 years or so. One
              such as yourself will wear this ancient armor well. The Tunic of
              the crusader Riddosan is now yours. He shall watch over and praise
              you in your triumphs..your defeats on the other hand..well, never
              mind that.</p>
