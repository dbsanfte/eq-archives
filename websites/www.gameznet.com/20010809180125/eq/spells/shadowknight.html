            spell.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Spook The Dead</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            This is an undead fear spell. When can upon the undead it will
            cause them to turn and run away. This can be a useful spell when
            used in conjunction with lull as you can lull one of the undead
            to prevent him from attacking you and spook the other one away
            from the area and get a chance to fight it one on one.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Vampiric Embrace</FONT><BR>

            2 minutes) you will randomly lifetap when in melee combat. The

            is an important spell to a shadowknight. Once you reach this
            level and gain the ability to ward undead you will be a powerful
            force versus undead monsters.</P>

<BR>

            and regain hit points and then get up and run.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Gather Shadows</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            Gather shadows is an invisibility spell that can only be cast
            on yourself. This is very important to ogre and troll shadowknights
            as it will allow you to travel places you previously were cut
            off from.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Heat Blood</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            This is a damage over time spell. The importance of it is that
            it can be stacked with the clinging-&gt;engulfing darkness line
            of spells which will allow you to do a lot more damage stacking
            the two of them.</P>

            cast on you or your party members. It's great to eliminate damage
            over time, charm or root spells.</P>

<BR>
            Shield skin grants you a temporary(60 hit points or so) invulnerability.
            This may not sound like much(and is often only 1 hit at this
            level) but its same as adding 60 hit points via a buff. Also
            while invulerable you can not be stunned.<BR>

<BR>
            </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Siphon Life</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            Siphon life is a 75 hit point lifetap that takes 73 points of
            mana. I know what you might be thinking. Don't we have a 280
            hit point lifetap already? Yes we do but this one is different.<BR>
<BR>
            First off it is more mana efficient than life leech. Life leech
            requires 1.125 points of mana for every hit point healed where
            siphon life requires only 0.973. Not a huge difference but it
            is a difference nonetheless.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            Life leech also has a two minute recast delay where you can chain
            cast siphon life until you are out of mana.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            On the flip side siphon life has a slightly longer casting time.<BR>
<BR>
            So what does this all mean? Basically life leech is still your
            life saver during combat. Siphon life should be used for reducing
            downtime or for stepping back out of combat and self healing
            in an emergency if life leech is already gone.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            This is not a great spell but it is still a useful one.<BR>
<BR>
            <FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Level 52<BR>
<BR>
            </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Malignant Dead<BR>
            </FONT><BR>
            Malignant dead is a new pet spell. It is a big step up from your
            level 49 spell. This pet is the level 39 necromancer pet spell.
            It can dual wield as your last pet could but has quite a few
            more hit points and can hit for up to 39 points of damage each
            hit.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            In the eyes of some this is the first shadowknight pet that can
            actually be considered a good pet. It dishes a pretty decent
            amount of damage and can take a few hits without dying.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            I personally love the level 52 pet. I keep him up at all times
            unless I am fetching(in which case pets tend to screw up things).<BR>

            </FONT><BR>
            Rest the dead is an upgrade to the numb the dead spell. This
            is a calm spell which works against undead beings.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            This can be used in dungeons such as Sebilis(undead side), City
            of Mist or Karnor's Castle to isolate single undead mobs out
            of groups without having to resort to a feign death.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            I have found it to be quite useful when pulling in these zones.
            Be warned however that if this spell fails you may be jumped
            by the mob and any other mob near it. So don't de-memorize feign
            death.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            You will know this spell is succesful when it reads, &quot;Soandso
            looks ambivolent.&quot;<BR>

            <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Boil Blood<BR>
            </FONT><BR>
            This is an upgrade to the heat blood spell. It will not stack
            with heat blood but it will stack with the darkness and heart
            flutter lines.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            Boil blood will do over 500 points of damage over a very long
            duration.<BR>
<BR>

            </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Banshee Aura<BR>
            </FONT><BR>
            Banshee aura is a self only damage shield. For the duration of
            the spell(about 10 minutes) any being that hits you for melee
            damage will suffer 12 points of damage from the shield.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            12 points of damage may not soud like a lot when you are getting
            hit for 100 points from the mob but believe me it adds up. This
            is one of the most mana efficient ways of dishing damage that
            you have and the damage will add up on the mob quickly.<BR>
<BR>
            This spell requires pearl as a reagent but it will not use the
            pearl. You simply need to keep one pearl in your inventory to
            cast this spell. The reagent will never be used.<BR>
<BR>
            <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Panic the Dead<BR>
            </FONT><BR>
            Panic the dead is an upgrade to the spook the dead spell. It
            is a very mana efficient fear spell with a very long duration.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            Using this spell in conjunction with dooming darkness you will
            be able to solo extremely effectively in zones such as Burning
            Wood or Trakanon's Teeth if you stick to undead.<BR>

            </FONT><BR>
            This is a slightly scaled down self only version of the necromancer's
            spell Dead Man Floating.&nbsp; It will cause the caster to levitate,
            water breath and also will add to his poison resistance.<BR>
<BR>
            This spell is very useful for fighting mobs which might poison
            you such as Wyverns. It is also useful for taking shortcuts through
            zones(you can fly over an area quicker than you can run and you
            take no damage from falling). Lastly it makes it safer to explore
            a dungeon without worrying about falling into a pit trap.<BR>
<BR>
            <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Expel Undead</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            Expel undead is the last in your line of anti undead spells.
            This spell does up to 273 points of direct damage to undead beings.&nbsp;<BR>

            </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Spirit Tap</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            Spirit tap is an upgrade to your lifetap line of spells. It is
            a 150 hit poit lifetap for 144 mana. This is the exact same ratio
            as your level 51 spell with a slightly longer casting time but
            it allows you to tap more hit points at a time.<BR>
<BR>
            Life leech is still a life saver but spirit tap will make you
            more effective at self healing if need be.<BR>
<BR>
            <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Steelskin<BR>
            </FONT><BR>
            Steelskin is an upgrade to the level 39 shieldskin. It can absorb
            a much greater amount of damage however. Somewhere in the neighborhood
            of 250 hit points.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            It has the same pitfalls as the original however in that it is
            a one time damage absorber that only works for melee damage.
            It also requires Jasper as a reagent which can run a bit expensive
            to use in every battle.<BR>
<BR>
            It is much more useful than the original in my opinion. I would
            recommend using it before large battles.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
            </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Vampiric Curse</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            Vampiric curse is a DOT lifetap. It heals you for roughly 200
            hit points of damage over time. Even if a monster dies you will
            still gain the hit points. It is by far the most efficient lifetap
            you will ever receive.<BR>
<BR>
            That having been said it also is more of a taunt than your normal
            lifetaps. Because the hit poits take a while to be transfered
            to the caster it is probably not your best bet for healing during
            combat especially when considering the taunt factor.<BR>
<BR>
            I would recommend using this spell for downtime healing.<BR>

            </FONT><BR>
            This is your final pet spell. It summons a level 44 necromancer
            pet. This pet can hit for up to 47 points of damage and can also
            lifetap. It is a great damage dealer and can take a decent amount
            of damage before dying.<BR>
<BR>
            <FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Nullify Magic</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            Nullify magic is an upgrade to the cancel magic spell. By this
            level cancel magic will fail to cancel most spells without multiple
            casts. Nullify magic does a much better job.<BR>
<BR>
            <FONT COLOR="#00ffff" SIZE="+1">Level 59<BR>

            </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Cascading Darkness<BR>
            </FONT><BR>
            Cascading darkness is the last in your line of darkness spells.
            It will stack with all DOTs other than previous darkness spells.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            This spell can do around 1150 points of damage over a long duration.
            It also slows as well as a snare spell.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            The downside to this spell is an extremely long casting time.
            This means that if you plan on using it for fear kiting you need
            to use it to open your fetch and you better hope it is not resisted.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            It would be wise to keep dooming darkness memorized as well for
            fear kiting in case cascading is resisted or in case it wears
            off before the mob is dead. Otherwise you will have a hard time
            getting the spell off again while being hit.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>

            </FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Asystole<BR>
            </FONT><BR>
            Asystole is an upgrade to the level 39 spell heart flutter. It
            will stack with all DOTs other than heart flutter.<BR>
<BR>
            This spell does 69 points per tick over 10 ticks(one minute)
            for a total of 690 damage. It also debuffs(lowers) your targets
            strength by 40 points and its armor class by approximately 20
            points.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            When used in conjunction with boil blood and cascading darkness
            a level 60 shadowknight can DOT for around 2300 points of damage
            in addition to their other abilities.&nbsp;<BR>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#ffff00">Drain Spirit</FONT><BR>
<BR>
            Drain spirit is the last in your line of lifetap spells. It lifetaps
            for 226 points of damage for 189 points of mana. This is a 0.836
            ratio compared to the 0.973 ratio of previous lifetaps and the
            1.125 ratio fo life leech.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
            The weakness of the spell is it's long casting time.<BR>
<BR>
            This spell makes you a decent self healer if you step back or
            if you are not the primary tank. Life leech is still your best
            option as life saving spell however because of it's casting delay
            which is less than half as long as drain spirit.&nbsp;</TD>
