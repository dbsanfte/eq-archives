<P align=center>How to get from Qeynos to Freeport </P>
<P align=center>by Ceeb the travelin Monk </P>
<P>Introduction Travel from Qeynos is relatively safe once you know the pitfalls 
facing you and how to navigate some of the more confusing areas. The most 
dangerous areas on this trip are West Karanas and Runnyeye the goblin caverns. 
Most of the creatures are more than a handful for level 4 - 7 players and some 
creatures giving level 18 characters a run for their money. Qeynos Gate to 
Qeynos Hills Ok so you are ready to make your run(and I do mean run) from Qeynos 
to Freeport. </P>
<P>First thing you should know is that this takes a really long time. If you are 
successful your first attempt plan to spend a couple of hours making the trek. 
Before you leave have at least 4 water and 3 rations. You can restock in 
Rivervale.....if you make it. Ok head south out of Qeynos. You won't go far and 
you'll hit the Qeynos Hills zone. There is little to no danger here unless you 
are level 3 or below. Qeynos Hills to Western Karanas Once you zone into Qeynos 
Hills follow the path towards the Karanas. This part is also relatively safe. 
Follow the path until you hits the Western Karanas zone. Be careful of the rabid 
gizzly's that sometimes happen upon the path. They attack anything! </P>
<P>Western Karanas to Northern Karanas Ok, now the fun begins. The Karanas are a 
vast plain upon which some very nasty stuff hangs out. Be prepared to see Hill 
Giants, giant spiders, giant beetles, bandits, grizzly's, and scarecrows (be 
careful, from a distance they look like normal players with a torch, up 
close.....well....I've never seen one up close). Once you enter this zone you 
have two choices, path or river. Paths are extremely dangerous. Lots of nasty 
things spawn near them, hang out on them, or cross them. However the river is on 
the edge of the zone and as you will see exploiting the edge is the best way to 
go. Head south to the river and turn left keeping the river on your right. 
Follow the edge of the river. This is where you can put your character on 
autorun and make a few minor course adjustments from time to time. Generally I 
have not found alot of baddies on the river's edge but always be on the lookout 
(dont go make a sandwhich while you're autorunning the edge!). You will (i 
promise, although it will seem like forever) eventually reach the Nothern 
Karanas zone. Zone through!. </P>
<P>Northern Karanas to&nbsp;Beholder. Well congratulations, you are a third of 
the way there. Now it gets tougher. The river edge still offers alot of security 
but you need to be more watchful. There are two bridges across the river in this 
zone. The first one you come to leads to the South Karanas zone (if you consult 
your map you will see where it is, south and to the right of Qeynos). Don't take 
this bridge. Also be careful prior to reaching it as a band of raiders are 
permanently camped on the rivers edge before you get there. </P>
<P>Travel on past the first bridge until you reach the second one which is wood. 
Cross the bridge into the&nbsp;Beholder&nbsp;zone. Canyon 
of&nbsp;Beholder&nbsp;to the Runnyeye Once across the bridge turn left and get 
next to the river again. Follow the river until you hit the edge of this zone. 
Sometimes there is a cyclops standing in the water so go around him. You'll know 
you've hit the edge of the zone when you see a druid camp to your right at the 
base of some mountains. Climb up these mountains as high as you can and follow 
them east (as you climb up turn right, turning left will dump you into the 
river). Follow the mountains until you come to the entrance of the canyon. At 
this point you should be "forced" down onto the ground. Enter the canyon and 
stay to the right. At your first opportunity to turn right do so. In this part 
of the canyon you will see goblins, muddite men, and whoa! minotaurs!. This is 
not confirmed but I believe the minotaurs will not attack unless provoked but I 
would not try to find out. Instead climb up the canyon wall on the right side. 
You will be forced down in a few places but thats ok. Make sure nothing bad is 
below you and quickly run past that spot. Get back up on the side as quickly as 
you can though. </P>
<P>This is a tough part and you will most likely have to time creature crossings 
below you to navigate successfully. If you run through here with no thought to 
planning you will die. When you reach the end of the canyon you will see an 
entrance in front of you. This is the entrance to Runnyeye, the goblin caves. 
</P>
<P>Runnyeye to Misty Thicket Ok, now is where I make everyone who says Runnyeye 
is a terrible place to cross through mad. It isn't. It isn't even close to 
terrible. It's a 3 on the danger scale. The problem is if you make a wrong turn 
you can become lost and even build up a goblin train behind you. Here is the 
secret. When you go into the caves make all left turns. It takes less than 30 
seconds to run through here. Which means even if you pick up a goblin upon 
entrance unless your HP is really pathetic youll make it ( I know a level 2 
wizard who made it and they have very low HP). When you hit the next zone you'll 
come out in Misty Thicket. Misty Thicket to Rivervale Can you say cakewalk. 
Misty Thicket is very open but can be very dark at night. However with careful 
planning you'll be able to avoid most everything. Head east. You should see the 
entrance to Rivervale after a little while of running. If you get lost don't 
worry. You have returned to the land of players and someone will be happy to 
point you in the right direction. Oh by the way, congratulations, you are 
halfway there! </P>
<P>Rivervale to Kithicor Woods While your in Rivervale pick up some provisions 
if you need them. I don't take anything with me when I go but I'll usually slay 
a couple of fire beetles along the way so I can pick up some water. Find the 
exit to Kithicor Woods and zone into Kithicor. Kithicor Woods to West 
Commonlands When you come out of the cave turn right and follow the zone edge 
like before. Be careful here, especially at night. I have found ghouls up high 
on the zone edge before. Follow this around, you'll be "forced" to the ground. 
There will be a rocky canyon entrance to your right. This is the entrance to 
High Hold Pass. Now if you are level 15 and above by all means go in have some 
fun. If you aren't, go in and commit suicide. The only people I have heard of 
who have navigated this successfully had invisibility or some kind of speed 
spell. Keep going straight to the other edge of the Kithicor zone. Be watchful 
of HG's as they sometimes end their patrol here. Climb up the zone edge and turn 
left. Your sense heading should indicate east. Follow this edge all the way to 
West Commonlands. </P>
<P>West Commonlands to East Commonlands Continue to use the zone edge formula. 
Watch for griffins, skeletons, ghouls, and pumas along the edge. Zone into East 
Commonlands. East Commonlands to the Freeport West Gate You are basically home 
free at this point. You will see and inn to your left. Feel free to come off the 
edge and down to the inn. You can then follow the path to the West Freeport 
zone. Once you zone keep running and you'll hit the west gate. Congrats! you 
made it. Hopefully you didn't die and only had to do this once. Now last but not 
least.....BIND TO FREEPORT!! Unless of course you are sick in the head and want 
to do this again! </P>
<P>Be careful, Ceeb </P>
