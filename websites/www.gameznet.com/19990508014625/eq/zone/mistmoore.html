<p>Mistmoore Castle is one of my favorite zones in the game. It is a great zone for
characters level 20 all the way to level 50. The entrance can be found in the zone of <a href="lesserfay.html">lesser faydark</a>.<br>
<br>
In the entrance area you will find several level 20ish dark elf guards. Beware that most
of these are casters. At night time undead <a href="../beastiary/skeleton.html">skeletons</a>
and <a href="../beastiary/zombie.html">zombies</a> will spawn in place of these guards so
it is wise to kill the guards off during the day. More importantly in these spawn
locations you may also have the opportunity for the much sought after <a href="../beastiary/werewolf.html">werewolves</a>. <br>
<br>
This is a general consistancy in this zone. The night time monsters are much stronger and
more powerful than the day time ones. Lower level characters would be advised to leave
this zone at night. In the graveyard and castle area you will find <a href="../beastiary/gargoyle.html">gargoyles</a> and <a href="../beastiary/vampire.html">vampires</a>.<br>
<br>
The head honcho in this zone is Lord Mahong Mistmoore a level 53 vampire who spawns in the
tower near the entrance. This tower must be entered through a secret passageway near the
graveyard. Lord Mistmoore is no pushover he can punch for 160 points of damage and he once
cast an area effect spell which did 320 points of damage to our entire party. Lord
Mistmoore only spawns occasionally and always spawns at night. During the day a level 31
vampire by the name of Tisnya Darvie spawns in his place. Also guarding the tower are two
level 31ish Ritualists who are vampires as well and can charm.<br>
