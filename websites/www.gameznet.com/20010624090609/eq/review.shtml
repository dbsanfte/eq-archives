        <strong>Everquest Review</strong> 
      </center>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">I 
        will never forget the first time I played a pen and paper RPG. I was 10 
        years old and my older cousin handed me the AD&amp;D Players Handbook. 
        He promised me that if I read the book and learned the rules he would 
        allow me to play in his next session. For the next 5-6 years I played 
        pen and paper RPG's at least twice a month and I knew the rules by heart. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By the time I was 12 computer RPG's were beginning to flood the market. 
        Games such as Bard's Tale, Ultima, Wizardry, and Might &amp; Magic will 
        forever be engraved in many players minds. In the years to come we would 
        see the overhead tile based games turn into tile based three dimensional 
        games. Years later games such as Ultima World and The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall 
        would move our genre to the world of free scrolling 3d.<br>
        <br>
        However it was not until the launch of Ultima Online and Meridian 57 that 
        we began to realize the potential of large online role playing games. 
        There is something about actually being a part of a persistant world. 
        In old CRPG's we would hear of the legends from the past. In an online 
        RPG we were given a chance to be those legends. Not only could we participate 
        in a persistant and changing world but each time we would log in we would 
        notice the same players crossing out paths. Friendships were sparked and 
        teamwork could greatly enhance your productiveness and your survival rate.<br>
        <br>
        These early online RPG's were not without their problems however. Lag 
        was horrible, Ultima Online was using cartoonish graphics from a third 
        person perspective. Player killers(PKers) ruined the game for many by 
        preying on new players and stealing their items. The artificial intelligence 
        was anything but and it these online worlds were reduced to a neverending 
        game of Quake leaving many players asking for more. There really was little 
        to do in these early titles. You could learn trade skills to make money 
        that you really didn't need or you could hack and slash monsters with 
        little to gain. In the longrun your characters skills were maxed, the 
        dungeons were repetitive and boring and the only danger was from PKers 
        outnumbering you and stealing all of your goods.<br>
        <br>
        Well this all stops now. <a href="http://www.sonyinteractive.com">Sony 
        Interactive</a>'s Everquest is a breath of fresh air for the online role 
        playing community. Rather than go through a long review that will wind 
        up exactly like every other review on the market I have decided to list 
        all of the features which makes this game superior to games such as Ultima 
        Online.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>A 
        Large 3D World</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well 
        the most obvious advantage are the graphics and the immersion factor. 
        Everquest's graphics are fully three dimensional. They are 3d accelerated 
        and allow you to view they game from several programmable camera views. 
        This is a big step up from the cartoonish look of Ultima and Meridian. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The engine is top notch and handles large outdoor scenes very well using 
        a heightfield based engine. Indoor scenes are of acceptable quality though 
        they can not match the indoor scenes from popular 3d action titles such 
        as Unreal and Quake 2. The textures are the only part of the graphics 
        which I do not feel is top notch. Some textures are very well done but 
        there are some places in the game(such as the basement of Unrest) which 
        have a somewhat cartoonish look. Believe me though when you are running 
        through those hallways to escape the hordes of undead beasts who are breathing 
        down your neck you will not pay much attention to the textures.<br>
        <br>
        Graphics aside the world is large enough to keep you exploring for quite 
        some time. There are three continents currently in the game, several islands 
        and four alternate planes of existance. The first couple of times travelling 
        throughout Norrath you will be in awe of the graphics and the well thought 
        out maps. When you feel up for some indoor excitement you can travel to 
        one of the many dungeons in the game. There are 18 different dungeon zones 
        in the game for characters of all levels. <br>
        <br>
        Speaking of zones the game is split into many different zones. Each zone 
        is in essence it's own seperate server though you can contact players 
        from other zones and keep track of them. However monsters can not chase 
        you from one zone to the next. This is similar to the way the dungeons 
        in Ultima Online were handled except it is a bit more apparent in Everquest.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>A 
        Lag Free Playing Experience</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
        one thing that worried me about Everquest was lag. I played Ultima Online 
        in the early days when you would take 3 steps and then wait for about 
        15 seconds to be able to move any further. I was wondering how Verant 
        would be able to handle a large 3d world with a large number of players 
        in a single zone. Anyone who has played Quake or Unreal can attest to 
        how badly a server can bog down with more than 32 players. <br>
        <br>
        I am happy to tell you that Everquest is virtually lag free. Of course 
        there will always be lag and if you have a poor ISP you might notice some 
        lag spiked and packet loss. However for the most part lag does not affect 
        gameplay. I believe the biggest reason for this is the high quality prediction 
        engine in Everquest. The way prediction works is by sending updates at 
        so and so intervals and then morphing position a to positon b on the fly. 
        It is a very effective technique but it also causes a few anomolies that 
        you will notice from time to time in the game.<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes you will be following a party member and lag will hit. He will 
        appear to run around in circles if he was previously turning which might 
        cause you to get lost. Thankfully several classes can track and usually 
        you will not be too far away by the time you realize what happened.<br>
        <br>
        Another situation that you will notice is that other players and monsters 
        health bars will not always be updated immediately. Sometimes you will 
        notice a party members health drop rapidly due to the intervals between 
        the last update. After a while you will begin to anticipate about how 
        much damage is actually being dished and this will not be a problem however 
        you should know of it's existance.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Class 
        Based Gameplay &gt; Skills Based</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">One 
        of the largest problems in Ultima Online was the skills based gameplay 
        system. Traditionally in pen and paper role playing games you choose a 
        class from a group of templates. These classes could be a warrior, cleric, 
        wizard etc. In recent games such as Daggerfall and Ultima Online the trend 
        was to allow players to customize their own players. In Ultima Online 
        if you practiced your spells your magery went up, if you practiced with 
        a bow your archery improved. While this is perhaps more realistic it hurts 
        game playability.<br>
        <br>
        First and foremost by not having set classes you reduce the need of players 
        to depend on one another and grouping becomes unneccessary. In Ultima 
        you had players who were grandmaster mages yet they wore full platemail 
        and could wield any weapon which they desired. In Everquest you will NOT 
        see this type of inbalance.<br>
        <br>
        The classes in Everquest are extremely well balanced and will need to 
        depend on one another for survival. Higher level monsters will require 
        a well balanced party to overcome them. Grouping is really not an option 
        in Everquest it is a neccessity if you wish to conquer the games most 
        powerful beasts and win the ultimate prizes.<br>
        <br>
        There are 14 different classes in Everquest: Warriors, Paladins, Shadowknights, 
        Rangers, Monks, Rogues, Bards, Magicians, Necromancers, Enchanters, Wizards, 
        Clerics, Druids and Shamans. Each class has it's own unique advantages 
        and carries with it it's own flaws which will be undesirable. At early 
        levels you can get away with solo playing however at higher levels it 
        will become a neccessity to group if you wish to remain competitive. This 
        is a major plus because group play is much funner than solo play. By grouping 
        you will meet new friends and you will need to depend on them for survival.<br>
        <br>
        In addition to having 14 different classes to choose from you can choose 
        from 12 different races. Each race has it's strengths and weaknesses. 
        Depending on the race you choose you will only be able to choose from 
        certain classes. Some races also have special racial abilities such as 
        the ability to hide or tinker.<br>
        <br>
        Another throwback in Everquest is the return of levels. In Ultima there 
        were no levels and there was no need for experience. In Ultima if you 
        wanted to become a grandmaster warrior you could grab another player go 
        into the forest and slash at one another for a period of time and become 
        one. In Everquest you will need experience to reach new levels. Each level 
        grants new mana(if applicable), hit points and skill points. Some levels 
        will grant additional skills or spells. Experience can be gained in one 
        of two ways: by killing comparably matched monsters(easy monsters will 
        not grant any experience) and by completing quests.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Group 
        Play Is Simply Funner</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 
        the above paragraph I mentioned that group play was much funner than going 
        solo. In this portion of the review we are going to explain why group 
        play is funner and what Everquest how Everquest game play is different 
        than other games.<br>
        <br>
        One of the things that made teaming up in games such as Ultima Online 
        was the notoriety system was geared towards whoever got the last hit. 
        The last hit got the entire notoriety boost from a monster. The largest 
        weakness of UO's system however was the looting system. Anyone could run 
        up to a monster and grab all that they wanted. People who weren't even 
        part of the fight would often run and try to grab the loot off monsters 
        that you worked to kill.<br>
        <br>
        Everquest solves these problems and more. First and foremost if you wish 
        to team up with some other players you can invite them to join a group. 
        There can be up to six players in each group. Every competitively leveled 
        monster that your group fights will give experience. This experience will 
        be divided among every member of the group. Anyone in the group can then 
        loot a monster that the group kills. If everyone has the autosplit option 
        turned on the monsters coins will be split among party members, though 
        items will not. Another great feature in Everquest is the fact that only 
        the person or the group which killed a monster will be able to loot it 
        for a certain period of time(a few minutes).<br>
        <br>
        There are a few limitations to grouping however. Group members must be 
        within comparable level ranges. Anyone who is blue to the highest group 
        member will be able to join the group and get experience for kills. This 
        ensures that level 1 characters will not be able to group with level 50 
        players and get free experience for doing nothing. You can still join 
        a higher leveled players group and you will still be able to loot monsters 
        that the group kills and collect your share of the loot, but you will 
        not gain any experience.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>To 
        PK Or Not PK</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 
        games like Ultima Online and Diablo player killing ruined the fun for 
        many players. It was discouraging for many players to be killed by much 
        more powerful characters or by large groups of others and lose all of 
        their items. Other's felt that Player Versus Player combat was the most 
        challenging and fun part of online gaming. In Everquest the system is 
        aimed to please all players not just one group or the other.<br>
        <br>
        When your character is created you will be given a PK Note. If you turn 
        this note into the priest of discord you will receive a small amount of 
        experience and you will become +PVP. What this means is that you will 
        be able to kill or be killed by other +PVP players in your level range. 
        The level range limitations insure that high level characters don't run 
        around and pick on low level players thus ruining their gameplay experience. 
        +PVP characters can be distinguished by the red text above their names. 
        +PVP characters can be looted by other players. All your cash can be taken 
        but a looting player can only grab one item off of your corpse. There 
        is no experience granted in Everquest for PVP combat which is keeps it 
        from becoming exploitable. <br>
        <br>
        Players who elect not to turn in their PK Note will be immune to this 
        aspect of the game. There is no way that a +PVP player can do anything 
        harmful to a -PVP player under most circumstances. <br>
        <br>
        There are certain areas in the game however where anyone can be killed. 
        These areas are the arenas which are located in the cities and also an 
        entire arena zone which is hidden away in Lake Rathetear. In these locations 
        everyone is free game however you can not be looted and no experience 
        will be lost. <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes even -PVP players will want to settle their differences or spar 
        with others. This can be accomplished by dueling. You can challenge other 
        players to a duel and if they accept you can fight until the death. If 
        you do not wish to fight until one player is dead then the duel will be 
        ended when one of the players runs to the nearest zone. The winners and 
        losers of each duel will be broadcast to the entire world. Those fleeing 
        through zones will be labeled in the broadcast as cowardly dogs!<br>
        <br>
        One disadvantage of the game is that +PVP players can't have helpful spells 
        cast on them from -PVP players. This caused many players who might otherwise 
        go +PVP to remain -PVP and simply fight against the environment. For this 
        very reason Sony has created a special PVP server where everyone is marked 
        +PVP. If you do not wish to participate in player versus player combat 
        it is recommended you choose one of the games other servers.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Artificial 
        &quot;Intelligence&quot;</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">One 
        of the largest shortcomings in other games was artificial intelligence 
        or the lack thereof. In Ultima one could hit a monster run a few steps 
        away and the monster would get stuck on an obstruction and simply stand 
        there while you used your bow or spells to destroy him. Easy money and 
        easy notoriety boosts. If you ran into trouble in a fight you could simply 
        outrun any monster in the game. If you had to do a corpse recovery you 
        could simply do an &quot;Eric Dickerson&quot; ducking and dodging monsters 
        easily and getting them stuck onto obstacles. <br>
        <br>
        You won't see much of this in Everquest. First off monsters often run 
        as fast as you and some can actually outrun you. They hit hard when they 
        hit you from behind and have a greater chance of stunning you(preventing 
        you from moving). Monsters will rarely get stuck on obstacles. They will 
        run when in danger and get help if need be. The artificial intelligence 
        in Everquest is by far the best I can remember from any computer role 
        playing game past or present.<br>
        <br>
        That having been said the AI is far from perfect. Some NPC spellcasters 
        will follow patterns of casting spells which can be used to your advantage. 
        For example some shamans will insist on casting root and drowsy on every 
        group member before casting anything else. If your group has high resistance 
        that can make these easy prey. However these problems are being stamped 
        out every day and they may not even exist by the time you read this review.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Spells 
        Galore</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">One 
        of the most impressive aspects of Everquest is it's large variety of spells. 
        There are over 700 spells in the game and many spells are class specific. 
        There is far more variety spell wise in this game than any of it's predecessors.<br>
        <br>
        You can levitate, become invisible, root monsters in place, damage monsters 
        with a variety of offensive spells(some which effect a wide area), cast 
        a variety of healing and buffing spells, not to mention summoning pets 
        or creating illusions.<br>
        <br>
        The spell effects are very well done and quite varied throughout the game. 
        There are several circles of magic some are more important to a class 
        than others. For example a magician will specialize in conjuring and summoning 
        beasts, weapons and equipment. To a magician conjuration will be an extremely 
        important skill however divination will not be used very much. <br>
        <br>
        Travel will be a bit more difficult in Everquest than other games. In 
        Ultima you could mark a recall rune anywhere in the game and instantly 
        teleport yourself or party members to that location. You would often have 
        many different recall runes stored in the bank. In Everquest all pure 
        casters can bind a spot(drop an anchor) and then gate back to it. However 
        any other class will need to rely on a caster to bind them and they will 
        only be allowed to be bound inside of a city. Once you are bound to a 
        spot you will return there any time you die or gate and you can only have 
        one bind spot at any given time.<br>
        <br>
        There are only two different classes in the game who can teleport to other 
        locations. These are druids and wizards. These classes will be able to 
        teleport to specificed areas throughout the game and will be able to teleport 
        their party members with them at higher levels. Wizards will also be able 
        to teleport into alternate planes of existance. However you will never 
        be able to mark spots all over the world and deep inside dungeons to instantly 
        teleport back to that spot on a whim. <br>
        <br>
        Another important spell is the ressurect spells. Clerics are able to raise 
        players from the dead and restore some of that characters lost experience. 
        Only high level clerics are able to accomplish this feat.<br>
        <br>
        There are two ways to raise your spell skills. One is to practice by using 
        the spells from that particular cirlce. The other way is by traning at 
        your local guildmaster. Guildmasters allot you 5 training points per level 
        and they can add up over time. You will want to save these until you need 
        them. You never know if you will get that prized weapon or spell and if 
        it will be of a type that you are not adept in.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The 
        Price Of Death</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">One 
        problem in online rpg's in the past was the price of death. In a game 
        like Ultima if you died you lost no experience or skills. This was important 
        because if you did pker's could quickly drop your skills in a night. The 
        cost of death in Ultima was usually a loss of all items however. In UO 
        this was not a huge problem as a full suit of platemail could be bought 
        with the cash from an hour of adventure. In Everquest money is hard to 
        come by and it would take you a month or so to buy a suit of plate. Let's 
        not even get into the amount of time you would need to invest to get a 
        nice collection of magic items.<br>
        <br>
        In Everquest death will cause you to lose experience. If you just gained 
        a level you are likely to lose that level as a form of punishment for 
        dying. However your corpse will remain where you died until you are ressurected, 
        until someone else loots your corpse for you(which requires you to give 
        that player permission to loot your corpse), until you return and loot 
        all the items off of it or for eight hours after which it will dissapear. 
        This means that in the most cases you will not be forced to lose all the 
        items which you were carrying due to death. The experience penalty and 
        the travel time to get back to where you died however will keep you from 
        taking unreasonable chances.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Notoriety 
        And Reputation</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ultima 
        online had one of the simplest and most exploitable notoriety systems 
        that any game could have. If you killed evil stuff you became more good, 
        if you killed good stuff you became more evil. Depending on how good or 
        how evil you were you received titles. If you looted, robbed or attacked 
        a &quot;good&quot; person it would make you more evil. There were many 
        problems with this. Players would run through your fire walls and flag 
        you as grey then attack you and be able to PK you. If your friends hit 
        them it made them evil. Fact of the matter is half of the &quot;good&quot; 
        players in the game were in actuality evil or pkers.<br>
        <br>
        In Everquest there are literally hundreds of different factions. Depending 
        on the race and class that you start as your factions will be different. 
        For example ogres and trolls will be killed on sight by most other races. 
        Necromancers and rogues are often not killed by their own races(or the 
        allies of their race) but they will often not be sold or dealt with. With 
        hard work and a lot of patience you can raise your factions with any other 
        group by killing their enemies or doing quests for them. Keep in mind 
        however raising your faction with one group often entails lowering it 
        with another.<br>
        <br>
        This is one of the more interesting aspects of the game. You must choose 
        your friends and associates wisely. There will always be enemies lurking 
        in the distance. For example if you are a noble paladin of freeport your 
        mission will be to seek out and kill the corrupt freeport militiamen. 
        These militiamen are actually the guards of the city. In killing them 
        you are going to make things rough on yourself as the guards will kill 
        you on sight. Even by doing quests for the paladins guild in freeport 
        you will slowly start losing favor with the freeport militia. </font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>New 
        Mountains To Climb</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">By 
        far the largest shortcoming of Ultima Online was the lack of purpose. 
        After a while you were reduced to either running around and killing innocents 
        or running around and killing those who killed innocents. It simply became 
        boring to kill the same mindless monsters with little danger and little 
        reward. The treasures were always similar and the magic items were nothing 
        special. You never wanted to become too attached to any item because it 
        would likely be lost on your next death. More importantly there was no 
        real option to killing(except at early stages when you practiced your 
        trade). There were very few quests and they all involved take npc x to 
        place y or something similar to this.<br>
        <br>
        Everquest is a long way from Brittania. There are over 650 quests in the 
        game at press time. Many of these quests are small tasks such as take 
        item x to npc y similar to Ultima and have little reward so it seems. 
        However the reward is often what is going on behind the scenes. As you 
        do these quests npc's will change the way they look at you and you will 
        raise factions(or lower them) by completing various quests. They will 
        also open the doors on more powerful quests in addition to giving small 
        cash or item rewards. The more difficult quests will grant powerful magic 
        items or spells which make the quest worth the effort.<br>
        <br>
        Questing isn't your thing? Have no fear. There are monsters in dungeons 
        which carry nice magical items that you are going to want to claim as 
        your own. The large variety of different magic items, many of which have 
        unique and useful effects, will keep you busy even after level 50 trying 
        to add the next piece to your collection. The main gripe with the magic 
        items placed on &quot;named npcs&quot; is that we know which NPC's carry 
        these items and can keep killing them over the course of days until they 
        carry it. This causes what is known as item camping and is one of the 
        weak spots of the game.<br>
        <br>
        Fear not my friends for many of the most powerful and rare magic items 
        are actually found on rare npc's which will spawn from time to time in 
        the countryside. You will probably want to bring a ranger, bard or a druid 
        along to track for these NPC's as they only spawn once a day or so and 
        there will only be one at a time usually even in very large zones. The 
        items on these NPC's are often worth the effort of killing them if you 
        can find them however and because of how rarely they pop you will find 
        very few other players who will have the same item as yourself.<br>
        <br>
        Perhaps the thing that will most keep your attention is the wide level 
        of difficulty of the monsters. In Ultima by the time you reached grandmaster 
        status you could more or less kill any monster in the game and usually 
        make it out alive. In Everquest you will find that each level you gain 
        will simply bring more monsters that you can fight for experience. I remember 
        back in mid september when I seen a level 17 character looting his corpse 
        asking him, &quot;You still die at level 17?&quot;. His reply was, &quot;Yea 
        I fought tougher monsters.&quot; Well even at level 50 you will still 
        find the game a challenge because there are many monsters in the game 
        who rank higher than level 50. These monsters will require a well balanced 
        group of characters of the highest levels to conquer and will still be 
        quite a risk indeed. However the reward on these monsters goes beyond 
        bragging as they will carry the ultimate prizes in terms of items.<br>
        <br>
        Around level 30 you will find it a neccesity to find groups if you want 
        to make the most out of the game. The monsters at these levels are very 
        tough to solo and it's usually better to have a group to mow through them. 
        This is what promotes group play and sparks friendships in the game. After 
        all this is a team game...</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>No 
        Game Is Perfect</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">All 
        that having been said no game is perfect. Everquest is not without it's 
        share of problems and we will attempt to describe them here. <br>
        <br>
        As we stated earlier some of the textures are a bit cartoonish and indoor 
        zones suffer from low polygon counts. What we haven't mentioned is that 
        music is only available for sound font compatible sound cards. These leaves 
        a whole slew of users without music. Hopefully Sony will remedy this problem 
        sometime in the near future.<br>
        <br>
        I am a big fan of group play. I have spent a lot of my time in the game 
        solo and find that I have the most fun in a group. However there will 
        be some times when you will not be able to find a group or will be doing 
        something where you are better off solo. The main gripe here is that after 
        level 30 or so there are very few classes that are viable solo. Wizards 
        remain viable when fighting one target at a time because of their ability 
        to dish a lot of damage in a hurry, but they will have to rest after the 
        fight. Clerics and necromancers will be able to solo some undead beasts 
        due to their strength versus undead beings. Most other classes will find 
        it very difficult to solo at all past level 30. It is still possible but 
        it will be much less efficient than playing in a group. Melee classes 
        will be able to solo some things but will then be forced to rest for obscene 
        amounts of time while they heal.<br>
        <br>
        Another problem is what leads some players to call the game(tongue in 
        cheek) EverRest. After each battle you will need to regain your hit points 
        and mana before you continue. In pen and paper and single player rpg's 
        you could simply rest and time would instantly go by. In Everquest you 
        will need to sit and rest as a warrior(or get healed by a priest type) 
        and sit and meditate as a spellcaster. It takes much longer for a warrior 
        to restore his hit points which makes them totally unviable at higher 
        levels. It will take a level 40+ warrior over 30 minutes to regain himself 
        back to full hit points. It will only take a spellcaster 5-10 minutes 
        even at high levels to regain back to full mana but you will be unable 
        to see any of the action during this time as you will have a spellbook 
        in your face.<br>
        <br>
        The last major problem is with camping. After a while most players will 
        know where the good magic items are in dungeons. Players will begin camping 
        these items waiting for them to appear on an NPC. The NPC's that carry 
        them don't always spawn and when they do they don't always have the item. 
        The problem is that if another party is already there camping for it you 
        might have walked 20-30 minutes only to find that your out of luck. Even 
        worse there is anti-camping code implemented into the game. If you are 
        resting too close to a monsters spawn point the desired monster will not 
        appear and a lower level monster(without magic items) will appear in it's 
        place. This is a problem as you can't control where other players go and 
        they won't always be happy if you kindly ask them not to go near a monsters 
        spawn location.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The 
        Verdict</strong></font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 6; margin-right: 6"><font face="Arial" size="2">Regardless 
        of the aforementioned problems Everquest is the funnest online game I 
        have ever played. I have been addicted to online games in the past beginning 
        with Quake. I was utterly addicted to Ultima Online for about 3 months 
        until I realized that it was a shallow game and I quickly became bored 
        of the title. However I have been playing Everquest for six and a half 
        months and I must say that I have never become bored with the game. There 
        is always another mountain to climb and beast to conquer. <br>
        <br>
        The only thing I must warn you off about is the addiction. Everquest fans 
        are like crack addicts. In the four days since the beta ended and this 
        review was written I can't stop thinking about the game so I wind up writing 
        about it in the meantime. I have dreamt about Everquest in my sleep and 
        I have thought strategies over in my mind. In the beta when the server 
        would go down for upgrades the chat rooms would be filled with people 
        simply waiting and chatting. It was not uncommon for people to sit in 
        the chat room for hours waiting for the server to go back online so they 
        could get another fix. Players often will play into the wee hours of the 
        morning when they have to be at work in a couple of hours. The only warning 
        I can give about this game is not to buy it if you don't have a lot of 
        spare time on your hands. <br>
