The necro epic quest was completed. The reward is a very nice 1hand blunt scythe. How that works I have no idea but it's a fine weapon. Zrazzt was also kind enough to write up a step by step spoiler for the quest which has been posted here. Also have two other items, a spawn and an updated quest thrown in.<br><br>New 1HBlunts: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/scytheoftheshadowedsoul.html">Scythe of the Shadowed Soul</a>(NEC).<br>New 1HSlashs: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bargrynnsdigger.html">Bargrynn's Dagger</a>.<br>New Arms: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/fieldplatevambraces.html">Field Plate Vambraces</a>.<br>New Quests: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/scytheofshadowedsouls.html">Scythe of the Shadowed Soul</a>(NEC).<br>New Rathe Mountain Spawns: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/rares/blackwing.html">Blackwing</a>.<br>Updated Quest: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/solrocleric.html">Solusek Ro Cleric Quests</a>(CLR).

Hey guys :)  Well I don't do this often but I'm going to do it now.  The bard epic quest item, the singing short sword, needs some serious work... It isn't that this weapon isn't as good as bards were expecting it is that the sword actually reduces the effectiveness of bards, so even if it is obtained it won't be used.<br><br>I would like to see everyone support the threads on the official boards that are going on about this problem.  One of the main ones is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019941.html">here</a>, and another big one is right <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022085.html">here</a>.<br><br>For anyone that goes and supports these threads, I thank you... for the rest of you, please reconsider.... your musician friends will love you for it =)

Just a quick update before I head out for the night. Much of this equipment is being dropped form Loathesome Individuals. These individuals have replaced the rude invividuals in various zones(most notably Qeynos and Qeynos Hills). They are dropping some half way decent items. <br><br>In addition to the items posted below they also dropped various sword's such as the Initiate's, Apprentice etc Swords. I'm banking these are part of a quest some place as their stats are not that good in comparison. The casters are all dropping Damask Robes as well as occasionally dropping a 4 slot container book and words. I'm banking that you can combine the words that they drop into the book and get an item as a result. Thus far I have only been able to find 3 of the words however.<br><br>Anyway I need to head on out.
