            Necromancers, after all the changes made (most especially the pet weapon delay
            &quot;fix&quot;, noted with derision by most mages and necros as a 'nerf') what are our
            strategies now? This is purely my own personal opinion, how *I* play, I'm sure that there
            could be any number of improvements but this method of play means I am alive and gaining
            experience. Necromancers have (or are about to) gained and lost several old strategies and
            gained new ones, both when grouping and when soloing. I won't list &quot;we used to&quot;
            items, merely what we can effectively do now.</font><div><font size="2"><p>Group tactics
            for the high level (44+) necromancer:</p>
            <p>Here are spells to use and why:</p>
            <p>Drain Life: Emergency life restoral. Plain and simple, you got hit one too many times
            but are (hopefully!) no longer being attacked, heal thyself.</p>
            <p>Direct Damage: Outdoors, Ignite Bones. Indoors, anti-undead spells in Lower Guk, or
            stay with IB. EXCEPTION: Necromancers effectively have no DD spells in Solusek B. See
            below.</p>
            <p>Life Drain DOT spells: Slow, but effective at restoring life at a far more mana
            efficient rate than using Drain life, excellent at countering the effects of Pact of
            Shadow and Mana Creation DOTs. Basically you should always have this effect up--remember,
            if there is another necromancer (you are 45 and he is 49) you can only have ONE of these
            doing damage (though you will both get life) so let the higher-level necro cast his first.</p>
            <p>Mana Creation Self-DOT spells: Better than clarity when in non-stop combat. When combat
            is not nonstop and mana regeneration is not a priority you are doing something wrong or
            are in a relatively &quot;risk-free&quot; zone. Basically you should always have this
            spell up, getting mana constantly.</p>
            <p>Venom of the Snake: This is your primary offensive spell, and in conjunction with your
            pet is your real damage contribution to the party: 540 damage in 30 seconds. NOTE: Now you
            know *exactly* when your spell has worn off. Use this knowledge wisely!</p>
            <p>Asytole: In a group environment, this is your secondary offensive spell. Be careful
            when you use it, it REALLY makes them mad (STR, AC are lowered, and it does 540 DD over 60
            seconds) which can get you dead in a hurry. Note it is *very* similar to IB in terms of
            damage/mana ratio, so I see many necromancers use IB instead. Don't make the same mistake!
            You are *not* a burner. Even our primary feeding ground (Lower Guk) our anti-undead spells
            take 1-2 bubbles of mana to kill one mob, same in our secondary feeding ground (OOT) as we
            can not effectively do enough DD quickly enough with IB (long recast delay) nor can we
            survive ANY mobs &quot;anger&quot; at us for trying to kill them so quickly no one can
            pull them off us without doing quite a bit of burning themselves, in effect saving us by
            putting themselves at risk. This effectively excludes most melee types from the short list
            of people that can immediately pull a mob off of us and onto themselves.</p>
            <p>Augment Death: This spell makes your pet far more effective. Keep it up--I did some
            checking, and only SLTW (49 ench spell, high mana cost with a high recast time as it wears
            off quickly) can do what this does--don't ask anyone else to speed buff your pet for you.
            Soon this will not wear off every other fight so it need not always be memmed. </p>
            <p>Pact of Shadow: An excellent spell, this slowly heals a PC or a pet for 350 damage over
            30 seconds or so, being able to cast it every 12 seconds means for 10 mana you can really
            pump out the healing. Of course, it takes this healing from your life bar! This is where
            trust and group tactics both enter a higher level. Did you know that using this spell does
            *not* put you on the mobs agro list? Here is how I understand healing agro to work: Mob
            does 300 damage. Cleric removes that damage. Cleric gets beaten on. Necromancer removes
            the damage, slowly over time (think like this: Necro Heal DOT is equal to Necro Damage DOT
            in agro list as Cleric Direct Heal is to Wizard/Mage Direct Damage) and does not ever get
            attacked for it. This is critical in places like lower guk, where you absolutely can not
            let your cleric die but must absolutely have healing available at all times. Which is
            where our strategy comes into play. YOU become the healer, in effect, of EVERYONE else in
            the party except yourself. As you should have 1200-1400 HPs with the appropriate
            cleric/druid buffs on, the Cleric can instead heal you when your life drops to 200-300
            with 1 CH and he will NEVER get attacked. This means the Cleric can, if needed, STILL do
            emergency healing on other party members, and keep buffs up, without the usual problems
            where they run out of mana or get beaten on by a mob, heal themselves, and get beaten on
            AGAIN. It is *very* critical you make the cleric understand. Most of the high-level
            clerics sitting in lower guk that I have grouped with on Povar are absolutely
            delighted--they can keep almost FM, and only need to watch MY life bar unless something
            like the Frenzy, Hand, or Lord pops (they simply do too much damage for us to keep up with
            all the damage but do NOT stop healing!). In Sol B or in OOT the mobs simply don't DO
            enough damage to outpace our heal. Anything past Kobolds in Sol B, like the various
            spiders and giants, will do so much damage you would have to die several times to keep
            even 1 person full. So you need not try--most people going into these areas are in a large
            raid anyway and there are either enough clerics or you are all dead anyway.</p>
            <p>Screaming Terror: An excellent spell. Use it, even WITH an enchanter in the group. Its
            a short term mez, with a memory wipe built into it. This spell has limited use in OOT,
            where the Seafuries just shrug it off--so don't bother. However, in Sol B or Lower Guk, it
            works just fine. Here are times when you using this spell can be *very* effective.
            Enchanters mez breaks on a mob, the rest of the party is fighting a named (say Frenzy) and
            really can NOT break off to assist, and the Enchanter can't get a spell off to nuetralize
            the mob. Cast ST on it. Most times it will work. Many enchanters say to me &quot;don't
            cast that spell I can't override it&quot;. To which I reply: STUN THE MOB. This breaks my
            mez, and gives you the time needed to re-mez it. All ST is in this situation is breathing
            room for your enchanter. I highly recommend that in Lower Guk you go nowhere without one,
            or you will find YOU are required to mez. You CAN do this, but you aren't very good at it,
            and if you fail to mez one it jumps right on you. Where else is this spell useful? Why, to
            wipe the hate list. Most people don't think of this, and watch their poor burner or
            enchanter get hacked to pieces. You HAVE cast VOS on the mob, no? You DO have a pet on it,
            no? And its STILL going after your wizard, cleric, enchanter, etc? Cast Screaming Terror
            on it. You'll mez it for a second, and most likely wipe its agro list. Suprise, YOU are
            the first to damage it (DOT+Pet) so it beats on your pet until the melee class(es) beat on
            it enough for the mob to switch to them. It works well, try it.</p>
            <p>Darkness line: I use engulfing darkness--most fights don't last so long that the spell
            will wear off (clinging darkness is too short, dooming and up cost too much mana). Explain
            to your rangers, druids, mages, and wizards; to NOT root or snare. Why? Darkness wears off
            after a set period of time. Once on, it doesn't &quot;break&quot; until its time is up (60
            seconds). Snare overrides Clinging and Engulfing, Dooming and up overrides snare. Root
            overrides both. Most 40+ mobs break snare and root in seconds. So don't bother to use them
            unless you are *pulling* with it (usually a ranger with snare). Once in your designated
            &quot;we fight here&quot; area, stop casting (Mages: Get anything but an earth pet unless
            you don't have another pet for your current max pet level--we DO know Mages have a hard
            time getting all 4 pets for their level, right people? Well you do now!) root and snare
            UNLESS you see the mob running off (meaning Darkness wore off at a bad time) once its been
            beaten to low life. In case you don't know, Darkness is the same as snare except &lt;A&gt;
            its a DOT [the lower 2 don't do alot of damage], and &lt;B&gt; cannot be broken--so it
            slows the mob just as effectively as snare/root but won't &quot;break&quot;, just wear
            off. Many times, if you have a good group killing things efficiently, you don't have the
            mana to spare for this spell so let the rangers/druids cast snare--if they flub it enough
            times your group will usually help them figure out what they need to do (casting snare
            once at the beginning of a fight does NOT mean the mob will still be snared at the end of
            it).</p>
            <p>Scent line: I don't usually use these spells, however in the following situations you
            SHOULD. Lower level Mages (fire), Shamans (disease, poison) and even lower level Necros
            (fire, disease, poison) are having a hard time getting their spells to 'stick' or are
            getting alot of full/partial resists--help your party out. This is a very good resist
            debuff (25-29) on Fire, Disease, and Poison resists which should allow your party members
            to &quot;get through&quot; where before they would not. NOTE: For some reason, when this
            spell is RESISTED, you become #1 on the agro list for a moment. Doesn't take long to get
            the mobs off, just keep that in mind. When its not resisted they don't seem to care. </p>
            <p>Covetous Subversion: You have mana--fill up the others who don't. Most critical are
            your CLERIC, then your other casters. You can get your Cleric out of a mana-low and give
            your other casters a needed boost when everyone else is full or just alot higher. Always
            let people know when you are approaching FM so they know you have mana to give. I usually
            swap out Augment Death with Covetous Subversion as needed.</p>
            <p>So there you have it, where to use spells and why. Now, when grouped with certain
            classes here are a few tips:</p>
            <p>Shaman: Have the Shaman cast VOS. Why? He most likely has it memmed, and knows how to
            use it. If he can't get it to 'stick', then help him out with Scent, less resisted than
            his resist-debuff. Regen/Chloro. Get it, keep it, love it. Effectively keeps the damage
            from our Mana Generators to a minimum. Not as effective when Lich is up (you'll be turning
            it on and off far more than Call of Bones) but still, ask that they keep it up at all
            times. Ask for STR+AGI buffs for pet at all times. SOW if outside.</p>
            <p>Druid: Same as the Shaman, except you'll have to do the VOS, and Druids only have a STR
            buff. Wolf form? I guess. Doesn't do much for us, honestly--but I have jboots, many newer
            players wouldn't (and in lower guk SOW is a moot point anyway). Explain Darkness so they
            know when and when not to snare.</p>
            <p>Cleric: Explain Pact. Make sure he/she understands they are responsible for keeping you
            alive. Let them know exactly how many HPs you have PER bubble so they know what to cast
            and when. Let them know when buffs are going--without their buffs you have effectively
            1/4-1/3 less HPs with which to pact.</p>
            <p>Enchanter: Explain you'll ST *only* mobs that attack them directly, and how they can
            break your mez (if they don't know yet) to implement their own. Ask them to clarity you at
            any time you are not in skeleton form (enchanters are a good reminder that you aren't,
            they clarity you and you refresh it). Note: Clarity and Call of Bones/Lich do not stack,
            with the Necromancer spell taking priority. The two lower versions it works in reverse,
            with Clarity overwriting them.</p>
            <p>Wizards: If they nuke too early (it happens) ST the mob immediately. Saves them the
            damage they'd normally get. Always make sure the Wizards/Druids/Rangers in group KNOW who
            has the slow/stop duty.</p>
            <p>Rangers: Explain darkness if you are going to use it, otherwise just nag them about
            keeping it up at the *end* of the fight. NOTE: Rangers can't take damage, so expect to
            have to heal them several times in a fight. In all cases, ask them NOT to taunt--it just
            makes things worse.</p>
            <p>Warriors/Paladins/SKs: If they are getting ripped up, calmly ask them to stop taunting.
            Say this &quot;My pet can die and I can just get another&quot;. If that doesn't convince
            them to stop, take it to tells and explain it during a non-combat situation.</p>
            <p>Mages: They can summon you weapons for your pet. Saves you the effort to carry some or
            give your pet some from Mobs. They have pets that are slightly worse than yours. Explain
            darkness/root problems, if they don't have a 44 or 49 non-earth pet accept the limitation
            and use the max pet they have. However if this is the same mage you grouped with a month
            ago and he STILL doesn't have a 44/49 non-earth pet tell him off--lazy mages need a good
            kick to get motivated and get those other pets! </p>
            <p>Rogues: When the Rogue (and the rest of the party) can't get off the Agro list of a mob
            hes really hurt then ST the mob and hopefully the Rogue will back up for a breather.</p>
            <p>At 44+, with the overcrowding, you'll find places to get experience in a good group is
            not easy, so being as useful as you can and knowing your strengths is a big plus. Lower
            Guk Dead Side and Ocean of Tears Seafury Island are the places to go for the high level
            necromancer. At 47+ you can go to the planes, but don't expect to gain experience there
            (they're just places for high-levels to die and lose exp but maybe gain great items).
            Lower Guk Dead Side you are more effective with some really good loot, but Ocean of Tears
            Seafury Island is better cash and experience--not to mention generally safer. So LGDS is
            your &quot;primary&quot; feeding ground, with OOTSI your &quot;secondary&quot; feeding
            ground.</p>
            <p>In OOT at 49+ you don't have to do much to kill a Seafury. At 44-48 you do. So 49+ is a
            solo experience, just as lower guk can be (most popular place in lower guk for the solo
            49+ necro? Reanimated hand.) though if you want good loot you'll group. 44-48 you must if
            you want a decent shot at survival. I personally prefer a Shaman to pair with--you both
            get about the same experience in OOT as you would solo since your pet isn't taking his
            chunk anymore, and with just 1 other person you do well. And Shamans just complement you
            perfectly.</p>
