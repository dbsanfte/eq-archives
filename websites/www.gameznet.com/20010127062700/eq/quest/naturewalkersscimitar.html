                - Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods:&nbsp;<br>
                Ask &quot;what action&quot; and you will get a note. if not,
                then your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by
                doing the muffin-quest in Freeport<br>
                <br>
                - Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark:&nbsp;<br>
                Give her the note and you receive a ring. Faelin roams the
                northern part of the zone near Crushbone. She is a rare spawn
                and can have orcs as placeholders. After giving her the note she
                depops.<br>
                <br>
                - Giz X'Tin Kithikor:&nbsp;<br>
                Give him the ring, get a dark metal coin. Giz roams along the
                path. After u hand him the ring a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns
                and attacks but u can run away with SoW.<br>
                <br>
                - Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. He will
                give it back to you as worn metal coin. He tells you to find
                Athele.<br>
                <br>
                - Athele in East Karanas:&nbsp;<br>
                Give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. give this amulet to
                Sionae, then to Nuien and finaly to Teloa. The last step is the
                trigger for the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkelf Reavers (I
                think all about lvl 48 to 50) to spawn.<br>
                <br>
                - Find the Corruptor and kill him fast on the hill north of the
                river. He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2
                Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and kill them. You dont need
                to kill the Reavers. Just kill the corruptor and loot the tome.
                The best way is to have one or two friends on the hill that can
                start fearkiting him. If the Druids die, never mind....Athele
                spawns again in about 1 hour. Give Athele the tome and get an
                earthstained Note. Bring this to &quot;she who walks the land in
                service blabla...&quot;.<br>
                <br>
                - Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women that
                wanders the zone. Give her the earthstained note and she will
                tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing
                bowl. It is a Container so you need a free slot in the
                Inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she
                needs.<br>

                <br>
                - You must forage 4 items<br>
                that you have to combine in Ella's mixing bowl.<br>
                <br>
                - Frozen Tundra<br>
                Root from Everfrost Peaks<br>
                <br>
                - Sweetened Mudroots from Misty<br>
                Thicket<br>
                <br>
                - Speckled Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp<br>
                <br>
                - Heartfruit<br>
                from Greater Faydark<br>
                <br>
                - This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items in the bowl
                and you get a Hardened -Mixture.<br>
                <br>

                <br>
                - Go to the Chess Island (succor will take you there when you
                have enterd the zone) in Timorous Deep and ask Alrik Farsight
                &quot;how do you make an ancient bowl?&quot; . He gives you a
                crushed pot and sends you to Felwithe to talk to Farios Elianos.<br>
                <br>
                - Talk to Farios Elianos in Felwithe south. If he dont respond
                to you then your faction with Keepers of the Art is too low. You
                can build up faction fast with the batwing- quest in Felwithe
                south. If Farios talks to you, give him the pot and you receive
                a grocery list. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you
                do a job for him.<br>
                <br>
                - Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora in Felwithe north and
                she gives you in return a bag of Provisions. Bring it to Farios
                and he gives you the receipt for the ancient bowl.<br>
                <br>
                - Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep . He will give
                you an ancient pattern when you give him the receipt.<br>
                <br>
                - The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece of
                echanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel.
                NO skill in pottery required.<br>
                <br>
                - Platinum speckled poweder can be obtained through another
                subquest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to
                Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The old wooden painting
                that you receive has to be brought to the human skeleton that
                roams the western part of Frontier Mountains. Head back with the
                silver chained locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall
                Galdes and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the
                platinum speckled pouder.<br>
                <br>
                - Enchanted clay can be obtained through<br>
                Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's Everhot Forge. If you ask him
                &quot;what mud&quot; and &quot;do it for me&quot; he will tell
                you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service.
                This is a Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist.
                Hand him the axe and you get the enchanted clay. I am sure if
                you are kos to the dwarfs then you can do this part invisible.
                Just go to the Everhot Forge and hand Kinlo a Jade Reaver to get
                the clay.<br>
                <br>
                - Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery wheel
                to make the Rune Crested Bowl<br>
                <br>
                </font><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#00FFFF"><b>The

                <br>
                - Go Back to Misty Thicket<br>
                and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture and the rune
                crested<br>
                bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone from it.<br>
                <br>
                - Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids
                this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie.<br>
                <br>
                - Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself? &quot;, &quot;what
                answers?&quot; and &quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot;. She
                tells you to bring her the stone you already have from Ella and
                the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir.<br>
                <br>
                - Kill Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle and loot the gem he
                drops. Venril is a very tough lvl 55 Necromancer that can only
                be beaten by very strong guilds.<br>
                <br>
                - Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal
                Stromforest and get a warm pulsating stone. Now this is the time
                where the quest splits up into the Druid and the Rangerpart.
                Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path.<br>
                <br>
                - The Druid's path leads back to Ealla in Misty Thicket. Give
                her the stone and you will get the Elaborate Scimitar (10/30
                9wis 10mana 5sv poison and disease)....now you have one of the
                four final pieces. She asks you to collect the Cleansed Spirits
                of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark and hand them along with the
                scimitar to Xanuusus.<br>

                - The withered treant in North Karana tells you to find the
                corruption in the land. He means the Corrupted Mammoth (below
                lvl 30) in Everfrost Peaks (pops near Permafrost, Mammoth Calfs
                are PH), the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman (mid lvl 30) in Lake
                Rathe (PH are the sidespawns on top of the underwater-tower.
                Middle spawn is for Cleric Epic. Use wolfform to be non-aggro to
                the other goblins. They heal each other so kite him away. It can
                take several tainted to get the corrupted) and the Corrupted
                Hill Giant (mid lvl 30) in Rathe Mountains (HG area south of the
                hill with the Guard Tower).<br>
                <br>
                - Give the 3 items looted from them to the treant to receive the
                treant heart. Go to Yeka Ias in South Karanas and give him the
                heart. He will give you the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica.<br>

                <br>
                - You will meet a pained Unicorn in lesser Faydark. Collect for
                him the items looted from the Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep (lvl
                52, 1 or 2 groups needed. As far as I can remeber you have to
                pass the area where Estrella is and the named Seahorse), the
                Corrupted Cyclops (3-4 ppl, best tactic is fearkiting because he
                is lvl 52. PH are the Seafury Cyclops) in Ocean of Tears and
                from the Corrupted Brownie (Brownie Scouts are PH. They are
                green to 56/57 and give exp. Each can pop the tainted so it is
                possible that 2 or even 3 tainted roam the area. They are druids
                and the corrupted is a lvl 52 druid so you need help from 2 or 3
                people. Fearkiting is the best tactic) in Lesser Faydark.<br>
                <br>
                - The Unicorn will give you a gleaming horn for the 3 items.
                This has to be handed to the gnome Silox Azrix in Ak'anon to get
                the Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer. He is near the mines on the left
                side of the green river. There is another greeny gnome near him
                but you can do this part with super camou on you if you are kos
                or otherwise disliked there becaus you need no faction for Silox.<br>

                You should have 2 groups with 4-6 melee and 2-4 nukers (all as

                - The 3 corrupted mobs of Kunark are the Corrupted Gorilla (mid
                40)in Emerald Jungle (root/dot him and stay far away. He has
                sow-speed and pops in the northern part of the plateau.
                Tottering Gorillas are PH of the tainted and only non-undead
                tainted will pop the corrupted), the Corrupted Barracuda (high
                40,loc -900, -900) in Lake of ill Omen (only the blue tainted
                will pop the corrupted. Pull it on the land and kite him becaus
                root breaks fast. Would be much easier if you have a friend that
                helps you kill the corrupted) and the Dragon Faydawer that lives
                in the<br>
                sea in Timorous Deep (Guild needed to kill him).<br>
