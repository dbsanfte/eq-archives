          <tr>
            <td>I have been playing a lot on the race war test server recently. The game is still
            undergoing twinks and changing as we speak however I feel that it is going to breathe new
            life into Everquest. I was sitting here going through things in my mind on how this race
            war might play out. Going over advantages or disadvantages of each team and I decided
            rather than keep this all in my head, that I should go ahead and just write it all down in
            an article.<br>
            <br>
            Okay first of all let's go over the bare necessities for anyone new to the idea of Tallon
            Zek(the upcoming race war server). There will be four different teams on the server. You
            can not PK within your own race group. Everyone outside of your race group is free game
            however. Here are how the teams are assorted. I have given each team a name simply to make
            it easier to associate with them. It would get much to confusing to refer to each group as
            Team x or as the x, y, and z team.<br>
            <br>
            Team 1(Humans): Humans, Erudites, Barbarians.<br>
            Team 2(Elves): High Elves, Wood Elves, Half Elves.<br>
            Team 3(Darkies): Dark Elves, Trolls, Ogres.<br>
            Team 4(Shorties): Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes.<br>
            <br>
            There are several new rule changes that will be effective on the race war server. Other
            than that the rules are the same as in Rallos Zek(the PVP server). <br>
            <br>
            For one the level limit has been moved to eight levels. This means you can only PK players
            who are within eight levels of you. This is quite a bit wider than the four level limit on
            the PVP server. I believe it will encourage players to work together and protect their
            lower level teammates. <br>
            <br>
            Verant has not made any comments on the looting situation. It's currently disabled on the
            test server. I am pretty sure this is only a measure taken because certain players are
            regulars on the test server and would hate to lose their items due to the temporary
            testing there. For those not familiar with the PVP looting rules I will recap them here.<br>
            <br>
            You are only allowed to loot players who you killed. You can only loot one item. The item
            must either be worn or be sitting in the first level of their inventory. This means that
            items in backpacks or bags are off limits. <br>
            <br>
            Okay now having all the miscelleneous introductions being made let's get into the real
            purpose of this article. Evaluating the balance of power.<br>
            <br>
            I will attempt to describe each team. Items they will have access to and dungeons which
            they should be able to hold as their own. Of course any other race can accumulate a group
            of players to raid and conquer a dungeon, this is not without risk however. Certain areas
            are going to be hard to conquer. For example Permafrost requires would be conquerers to
            travel past West Karana, Qeynos Hills, Black Burrow and Everfrost which should all be
            occupied most heavily by the human team.<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Humans, Erudites, Barbarians</font></p>
            <p>The human team is locked away on the far side of the world. They will control the
            cities of Qeynos, Erudin and Halas. I'm not sure whats the situation with Freeport. I had
            heard it would be disabled so that humans would not be able to cut the port off(thus
            putting the halfling, gnome, dwarf team at a serious disadvantage). On the test server you
            can still start in Freeport. I'm not sure what is going to happen when the real server
            goes up. We will have to wait and see. I have written this guide assuming that humans will
            not be able to live in Freeport. If they are allowed to then you can add Befallen to one
            of the possible dungeons(though it will be contested by the halflings). <br>
            <br>
            The humans are the only team which has a full selection of classes available to them. <br>
            <br>
            Erudites have the highest base intelligence in the game which means the human team will be
            well represented with necromancers, wizards, magicians and enchanters.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Barbarians have the highest base wisdom of the shaman races which should equal out to a
            nice niche for the human team. They also make fine warriors. <br>
            <br>
            Humans aren't really the best at anything but they make good rangers, bards, and paladins.
            They are the only race which can be monks.<br>
            <br>
            The most glaring weakness of the human team is that they will be the only team who lacks
            infravision. This is important because not only will they struggle to see opponents at
            night time, but they will also be easier to spot because of their light sources. This
            should keep the casters busy trying to dish out infravision. It will also make forays into
            the evil dungeons(which feature some infravision items) a much desired adventure at some
            point.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Humans should own the zones of West Karana, Qeynos Hills, Kerra Ridge, Tox Forest,
            Everfrost and Permafrost. They should also have a good foothold on North Karana. South
            Karana, East Karana and Paw should be on the edges of their dominance ranges and are
            likely to be battle zones. <br>
            <br>
            Humans should have a foothold on the following items.<br>
            <br>
            Low level armor: Bear skin armor, polar bear armor, wolf hide armor, studded/spiked
            shoulderpads, onyx earrings, gold studs, rat shaped rings.<br>
            Mid level armor: Damask, fishbone earring, bone armor, zaharns coronet, runed circlet,
            wolf fur slippers, symbol of loyalty to vox.<br>
            Mid level weaponry: Gigantic zwiehander, ice crystal staff, crystalline sword, silvery
            two-handed axe, silvery war axe.<br>
            High level armor: Not really known as deep permafrost has not been explored inside and
            out. Crafted armor available on the outskirts for brave travellers. <br>
            <br>
            As you can see from the above guide low level weaponry(level 1-20) is going to be a
            problem for the human team. The runed totem staffs and crysknifes are on the outskirts of
            their range. The nearest gypsy camp is on a border zone so even that may be a dangerous
            journey. They will be accessible but the ogres and trolls will probably be a dangerous
            obstacle to reach them. If humans are allowed to begin in Freeport however then the barbed
            bone claymore will become accessible to Freeport based humans, though it will be in a
            hotly contested dungeon.<br>
            <br>
            Permafrost has not been explored as deeply as Solusek B and I am positive that there are
            some very nice treasures in its depths. We can only guess at the items for now.</p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Half Elves, Wood Elves and
            High Elves.</font></p>
            <p>The elves will be able to start in either Kelethin or Felwithe. They will be able to
            play as every class other than shadowknights and monks. They are going to have to fight
            and scrap for control of any area. They are sandwiched between the dwarves and the gnomes.
            The only zones they can truly call their own are greater faydark and crushbone. Lesser
            faydark and mistmoore are bound to be a warzone. <br>
            <br>
            Class wise they are a mixed bag. They will be at a weakness since none of the elven races
            make spectacular warriors. They also are the weakest of the four teams when it comes to
            mage types.<br>
            <br>
            Wood elves make great rangers and druids. They are also pretty handy as rogues and bards. <br>
            <br>
            Half elves make great bards and pretty good rangers and rogues.<br>
            <br>
            High elves make excellent clerics and paladins. They also make above average mage types. <br>
            <br>
            Make no mistake about it. It's going to be a tough road for any who chooses the life of an
            elf. Crushbone is a great dungeon for characters level 5-18. After that point its going to
            be rough. Lesser faydark and mistmoore are going to be a huge warzone. Mistmoore will be
            cuthroat and its the most accessible mid-high(20+) dungeon accessible to elves. Unrest and
            Kedge are also available but you have to cross straight through Butcherblock(home of the
            dwarves) to get to them. <br>
            <br>
            Low level armor: Rawhide, damask, bracer of battle, prayer cloth, shiny brass shield,
            scout cape.<br>
            Low level weapons: Dwarven axe, dwarven two-handed axe, screaming mace, scout blade.<br>
            Mid level weapon: Dragoon dirk.<br>
            <br>
            The chart above shows that the elves should do very well at low levels but are going to
            have problems as they outgrew faydark. This team makes for great role playing
            opportunities. Teamwork will be essential to your survival. </p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes</font></p>
            <p>The shortie team can start in Rivervale(halflings), Akanon(gnomes) or Kaladim(dwarves).<br>
            <br>
            The shorties can be any class other than the shadowknight, bard or shaman. <br>
            <br>
            Dwarves make excellent paladins. They are also good warriors and clerics.<br>
            <br>
            Gnomes are good as mage types. <br>
            <br>
            Halflings make excellent rogues and druids. They can also make good clerics. <br>
            <br>
            The shorties have good class balance. Gnomes can rival dark elves as mages, dwarves are
            probably the best paladins in the game, and halflings are probably the best rogues.
            Halflings and dwarves also make good clerics. <br>
            <br>
            The weakness of this team is that they are so spread apart. The halflings are stuck on the
            mainland. Depending on whether or not Freeport is stocked with humans this could be a
            serious disadvantage. Even if it is not they will be cut off by dark elves. Dwarves and
            gnomes have greater faydark(and three races of elves) in between them.<br>
            <br>
            Another problem is that there are no low level dungeons that the dwarves or gnomes can
            really call their own. This team is going to either have to fight over Crushbone or stick
            to outdoor zones. Thankfully the dwarves can turn to goblin camps and the chessboard area.
            Gnomes have the minotaur mines of steamfont.<br>
            <br>
            Being so spread out things out their numbers, but it also gives them a foothold on several
            zones. Outdoor zones include butcherblock, steamfont, kithicor forest, dagnors cauldron
            and misty thicket. Dungeons include runnyeye, unrest and kedge keep. The border town of
            high hold and its terrain should also be halfling country. Border areas include west
            commonlands, befallen, beholder. East karana and east commonlands are probably going to be
            wargrounds. <br>
            <br>
            Low level armor: Rawhide, scarab shell armor, bracelet of the beetlekind, wooden totem. <br>
            Low level weapons: Minotaur battle axe, bloodforge hammer, wee harvester.<br>
            Mid level armor: Blackened iron armor, bronze platemail, ringmail, blackened iron
            medallion, gossmer, damask, opalline earring, bloodstained armor, cracked darkwood shield.<br>
            Mid level weapons: Blackened iron bastard sword, pugius, polished granite tomahawks, shiny
            brass halberd.&nbsp; <br>
            High level items: Kedge keep is a high level dungeon which is sure to be filled with great
            items... someday. It is currently unitemized.<br>
            <br>
            This team is going to have their problems. The majority of them being caused by how spread
            out their team is. They will also run into some problems when they begin to reach the
            higher levels as they will have to make a decision between kedge keep(which is a difficult
            dungeon) or attempting to move in on mistmoore or through the evil races. Mistmoore is
            probably their best bet. </p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Dark Elves, Ogres, Trolls</font></p>
            <p>In a normal PVP environment the evil races are at a serious disadvantage. On race war
            it seems the tables have turned. If there is any team which seems a bit overpowered it
            would be the darkies. They seem have a foothold(and a strong one) on many of the best
            dungeons in the game. <br>
            <br>
            Darkies can not play as paladins, rangers, druids, monks or bards. <br>
            <br>
            Dark elves make great mage types. They are also decent as clerics.<br>
            <br>
            Ogres make pretty good shamans. They also make the most powerful shadowknights and
            warriors when in a team environment which contains a healer.<br>
            <br>
            Trolls make the best solo warriors and shadowknights due to their natural regeneration. <br>
            <br>
            The toughest part of this pact is the amount of distance between the dark elves and their
            larger teammates. The dark elf lands are probably going to be under constant bombardment
            by other races(probably most strongly by dwarves and halflings(and humans if they are
            allowed to live in Freeport)) trying to gain access to Najena and the Solusek dungeons. <br>
            <br>
            Tank wise the dark team is without equal. Ogres and trolls make the best tanks in the
            game. Combine that with dark elves being arguably(though the intelligence doesn't live up
            to it) the best mages and we have a powerful combination indeed. <br>
            <br>
            By far the largest advantage of this team however is their placement. Outdoor zones that
            they will own include nektulos forest, lavastorm, south ro, feerot, innothule, rathe
            mountains and lake rathetear. The largest advantage however is that they will own the
            dungeons of Cazic Thule, Guk A and B, Solusek A and B and Najena. That constituates two of
            the best mid level dungeons(Cazic Thule and Najena), two of the best high level
            dungeons(Solusek B and Lower Guk), and a great low-mid level dungeon(Upper Guk). If humans
            are not in Freeport you can add Oasis as one of the favorite outdoor zones in the game.<br>
            <br>
            If the humans are not allowed in Freeport then we will probably see dark elves ruling over
            east commonlands as well. Border zones will include west commonlands, befallen, north ro,
            oasis and south karana. <br>
            <br>
            Low level armor: netted, woven, mesh, damask, collar of undead protection, moss mask,
            chitin shell tunic and shield, cuthroat insignia rings. <br>
            Low level weapons: tentacle whip. <br>
            Mid level armor: gossmer, ringmail, large bronze platemail, rubicite, drake scale belt,
            ring of goblin lords, azure sleeves, gator skin armor, shimmering orb, bracelet of the
            woven grass, lizardscale armor, troll/elf hide pieces, silver platemail bracer, flowing
            black robe, journeyman boots.<br>
            Mid level weapons: barbed leather whip, ogre war maul,&nbsp; scepter of flame, ghoulbane,
            mithril quill, obsidian flamberge, stiletto of the bloodclaw, bruthechopper.<br>
            High level armor:&nbsp; mithril, green silk drape, black enamored breastplate, flowing
            black sash, gold chitin armor, darkmail guantlets, silvered platemail legplates. <br>
            High level weapons: demon claw, dark reaver, ebony blade, mithril two handed sword, razing
            sword of skarlon, ykesha sword, fleshripper, painbringer, shield of the slain unicorn,
            serrated bone dirk. <br>
            <br>
            As you can undoubtedly tell from the above listing the largest problem is going to be low
            level weaponry. <br>
            <br>
            Because the darkies have such a foothold on teh high level dungeons there will undoubtedly
            be constant attempts to break through and conquer the mid to higher level areas. Everyone
            is going to want a pair of journeyman boots for example. The dark races are going to be
            under constant attack. They do however have the advantage of having their spawn points
            between the attackers and their route of escape. <br>
            <br>
            In the longrun I feel that the dark races having acces to many players favorite dungeons
            is both a blessing and a curse. I think that every team is going to have its own
            advantages and disadvantages. I do worry about the elf team however. They will probably be
            the hardest team to play as. However this all plays out it's going to be a lot of fun and
            I look forward to killing each and every darkie, elf and shortie out there! </td>
