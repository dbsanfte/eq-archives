<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Level 1</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Frost Bolt</font><br>
<br>
The frost bolt spell is the first in the line of bolt spells. Bolt spells generally do a
higher amount of damage than other lines of spells. The weakness however to this and other
bolt spells is that they are unguided. You must aim where you wish to fire the bolt and
hope that the monster does not move out of the way.<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Minor Shielding</font><br>
<br>
This is the first in the line of the wizards shielding spells. This spell adds armor class
and hit points. It can be cast on yourself only.<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Numbing Cold</font><br>
<br>
This spell is an area effect spell which is based on the caster. That means that this
spell will damage all monster that are immediately surrounding you. This can be great if
you are in combat with more than one enemy. <br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Sense Magic</font><br>
<br>
This spell will give you information on magic items. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Shock Of Frost</font><br>
<br>
This is the first in the line of direct damage shock spells. Shock spells generally do not
do as much damage as a bolt spell of the same level will do however shock spells are
attained frequently and do not need to be aimed. <br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Sphere Of Light</font><br>
<br>
This spell will create a glowing sphere in the casters hand. This sphere can only be used
by the caster and is used commonly as a light source for human eyes. <br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Level 4</font></p>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">

<p></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Fade</font><br>
<br>
This spell is a great escape spell for a wizard. It causes you to randomly teleport from
spot to spot in a close location. This is a good spell if a monster goes aggro on you to
keep him from hitting you while your warriors taunt like mad.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Gate</font><br>
<br>
The gate spell will teleport you home to your bind point.</p>

<br>
This spell lets you take a brief glimpse at objects far away. Basically it gives you a
15-20 second period where your sight is zoomed in to the distance.<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Ice Strike</font><br>
<br>
This is an area effect rain spell. As with all other rain spells these can be effective if
you have a large group of monsters as it can damage them all at a single time. Be sure to
cast this on the &quot;tank&quot; and not on the monsters.<br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">O'Kiels Radiation</font><br>
<br>
This allows you to cast a limited fire shield on yourself or another person. For the
duration of the spell every time a monster hits the radiating player it will suffer
damage. This is important as it is one of the few spells that wizards have that are
actually beneficial to others. <br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Root</font><br>
<br>
This spell will hold your opponent in one place. It serves two different purposes. The
first is to keep a monster from running so your party can finish it off. The second is
that it prevents the monster from getting near you, this is very important if you plan on
soloing at higher levels. <br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFF00">See Invisible</font><br>
<br>
This spell allows you to see invisible beings.<br>
<br>

unguided meaning that you can easily miss if you do not line up correctly.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Lesser Shielding</font><br>
<br>
This is the second in the line of shielding spells. It cannot be stacked with other spells
in this line(such as minor shielding)</p>

This spell is used to bind a player to a certain location. This will be the location where
you will appear if you use the gate spell or if you die. You can only bind other players
inside of a city and they must be in your group to bind them. You can bind yourself
anyplace however. </p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Cancel Magic</font><br>
<br>
This is a very useful spell which can be used to cancel a magic effect cast on you or one
of your party members. This is great if someone in your party is charmed or rooted in a
deadly situation.</p>

spell. </p>

for it currently.</p>

<br>
This will make a character invisible. Beware however that this spell can end at bad times
and certain monsters can see through invisibility.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Project Lightning</font><br>
<br>
This spell is a person based area effect spell. At this point in your career however I
would not suggest using these spells as they will make monsters very angry at you. Though
it can be useful as a last resort if you are ganged up by multiple monsters.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Shielding</font><br>
<br>
This is the third in the line of shielding spells. It not only adds to your armor class
and hit points but to your magic resistance as well. </p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Tishan's Clash</font><br>
