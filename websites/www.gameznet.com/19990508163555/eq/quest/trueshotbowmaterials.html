<p>This quest takes place in Surfall Glade.<br>
<br>
While this quest is a complet waste of time I thought I'd let everyone know and spare them
some time.&nbsp; Talk to Trueshot and he will give you a pack to collect 4 items, some
treant wood from FP, some dwarven wire from Kaladim, some spiderling silk, and a
microservo from Steamfont.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To get the treat wood you talk to Jyle Windshot and he will ask for a small lantern first.
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To get the spiderling silk just kill a spiderling.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To get the microservo kill some clockwork spiders in Steamfont.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To get the dwarven wire you have to find Tantor Everhott, but he won't speak to you unless
you are a dwarf so you have to get a dwarf to talk to him.&nbsp; But he wants a Tumpy
tonic for the bow, so you go to the bartender in Kaladim called tumpy irontoe and he also
won't talk to you unless you are a dwarf so you need to use your dwarf for him too.
&nbsp; You have to say to him I want a tumpy tonic and he will tell you that he can make
that drink if you bring him the ingrediants which are kiola nuts found on the sister
island in the OOT and one water flask.&nbsp; Make sure you buy 2 of the nuts though
because you have to give Everhott 2 of the tonics for the dwarven wire.&nbsp; So give
Tumpy the nuts and water one at a time to get the tonic, then give 2 of the tonics (make
sure they are seperated though) and he will give you the dwarven wire.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Put these 4 items in the bag and combine them and you get a combined pack. Give this back
to Trueshot and what do you get for all your trouble?&nbsp; Some small exp, small amount
of money, some faction adjustment, and a lousy random item worth about 1 gp or 2 at the
most.&nbsp; All in all this quest is a total waste of time.<br>
