          <tr>
            <td>It's been quite a while since i've written an editorial here. As i've grown busier
            with other things my time to write these things has lessened greatly. This particular
            issue has been stirring in my mind for quite some time however and it's about time that I
            got it off of my chest.<br>
            <br>
            The purpose of this article is not to offend anyone. The purpose is simply to make those
            who may be a part of these guilds take a look at themselves from the third person and
            also(on the tail end) to hope that Verant makes some moves to stop catering specifically
            to these groups.<br>
            <br>
            The issue that I am speaking of is the &quot;megaguild&quot;. While this may not be a real
            word I think that most players understand what I mean when using this term. I use the word
            megaguild to describe the large monopolistic guilds that can now be found on just about
            every server.<br>
            <br>
            These guilds can consist of hundreds of characters. They often will not group with players
            of other guilds(or those without guilds). They often will try to recruit any player who
            they do group with who is not in their guild. If a player chooses to leave their ranks
            that player will usually not be invited to any more of their &quot;guild functions&quot;.
            This might not become an issue except for these functions often include claiming an entire
            zone as their own. <br>
            <br>
            Well I don't know about you but quite frankly i'm fed up with these guilds. When I look
            back at my funnest times in Everquest they were not related to guild activities. I ran a
            small(12-15 person at any one time) guild for about six months before we disbanded it. We
            did many activities together and yes most of the time we were with others from our own
            guild. <br>
            <br>
            However we also often grouped with players from other guilds or those who did not have any
            guilds at all. Because we were small in size and could best be described as a collection
            of friends we never had much of a problem with other guilds. I remember the earliest
            dragon raids in Everquest. There was not one large guild hoarding it all to themselves.
            Instead on our server it was several guilds(and some individuals) all working together to
            take down the beasts.<br>
            <br>
            The early days of the planes were the same way. There was never a mega guild on our
            server(Fennin Ro) at this time. There were a large ones(30-50 people perhaps) but there
            was never what I would consider a megaguild. What I mean by this is that if you went to
            the Plane of Fear you might see two or three different collections of people in different
            areas of the zone. Now a days if you walk in to the zone you are likely to get greeted
            with, &quot;This is a soandso event please leave&quot; or &quot;You can join us if you
            want but all the loot goes to our guild&quot;. <br>
            <br>
            Now considering how difficult it is to break a zone such as fear I can understand that the
            people who &quot;break&quot; the zone should get a larger share of items than others
            unless people take turns breaking it and everyone is on the same page. However for one
            guild to claim that they own an entire zone is in my opinion ridiculous. <br>
            <br>
            If you are in a megaguild then the chances are you despise any other guild of similar
            power that could(god forbid) get a share of some of the items on the server. This may not
            be an intentional act. However there will always be those rumors(or true statements)
            floating around in guildsay about how suchandsuch from soandso guild powerlooted this. Or
            how your guild is better in this way than them and how they are always the &quot;bad
            guys&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            It is not uncommon for a guild to take shifts on certain spawns. To always have someone in
            their guild camping a specific location denying everyone else rights to certain items.<br>
            <br>
            Megaguilds are all about the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have nots&quot;. If you are
            in a megaguild chances are you are going to get more items than someone who is not. This
            is simply because your guild will usually be doing everything internally and keeping all
            the items inside of their own guild. If you are not in one of these guilds you will have a
            hard time finding enough players to do a dragon raid for example before one of the
            megaguilds beats you to it. If your guild consists of a mere twenty players then you need
            to find outside help. You need to organize this. Meanwhile the large guilds know exactly
            when these beasts will spawn because chances are they killed the last one. There's not a
            whole lot of organizing to do. It's a lot easier to get 20% of your guilds members to go
            on a raid than it is for another to get 90% of their guild and 50% of anothers.<br>
            <br>
            That having been said why do people join these guilds? Well in general players play a game
            like this to collect items, gain levels and to socialize. It's easier to collect items,
            find a group, gain levels etc in a megaguild. A megaguild in general does not have very
            strict recruiting methods. Hey if you have that many players in a guild then there are
            going to be some bad apples. It's not uncommon for guildmembers to dislike one another.
            They stay in the guild however simply to acquire more items and &quot;power&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            I don't often mention my personal playing experiences on this site. In this case though I
            think it fits to serve as a good example the lure of a megaguild.<br>
            <br>
            Now I have alluded to my previous guild earlier in this discussion. The vast majority of
            this guild joined the first true megaguild on our server after our guild disbanded(some
            players wanted to recruit more people some did not). We had many discussions in &quot;the
            good old&quot; days of the game when there were no real megaguilds about large guilds.
            Back then we considered 30 people in a guild to be large. We discussed how they never
            could work because of bickering. How they were unorganized. How they let anyone in, etc. <br>
            <br>
            I returned to the game a couple of months ago after a few month hiatus. Not a single one
            of my old guildmates(whom I grouped with every day for months) invited me to join them a
            single time. They attempted to recruit me and I declined because of my feelings about
            large guilds. After that I basically was forgotten to them. Other ex guildmates who left
            the guild have been treated in a similar fashion.<br>
            <br>
            They never treated me rudely. They sent tells every day or so to say hello. They told me
            what was going on with their character etc. However being an outsider to the guild you
            don't get invited to events specific to that guild. To each their own this does not bother
            me much. <br>
            <br>
            What does bother me however is if you ask a person inside of a megaguild why they have
            joined. Especially one who you may have spoken to about these guilds before they joined
            one. I returned to Everquest with another player(we both came back at the same time). We
            decided to fire it up and play until we became bored of it(and it seems neither one has
            yet). An hour before we returned to Everquest we were talking about megaguilds. How many
            of our friends were now a part of them. We spoke about how we would not join them and
            basically would try to convince our other friends of their evils.<br>
            <br>
            Within one hour of returning he had joined their guild. So I asked him why he joined their
            guild. It is a question I have asked many others. The most common reason they give is,
            &quot;To do the planes or dragons you need to have a large guild.&quot; This answer is a
            truth and a deception all rolled up in to one. <br>
            <br>
            The underlying truth is that you need a large group(though not necessarily from the same
            guild) to do the planes(at least to break in to fear) and to do dragons. In my opinion
            this is a fundamental design flaw of the zones and it's one that Verant has largely
            ignored. The hardest part about a zone should not be entering it. I look at the planes and
            I see zones that could support several smaller groups. The way it is now you seldom see
            two different groups on an alternate plane of existance. If you do then there is always
            the inevitable bickering between the guilds about how they were there first or some other
            nonsense.<br>
            <br>
            The question which we must pose here is what ever happened to a six player group hunting
            for fun. Six players CAN fight take down a monster in Fear or Hate. Breaking in to the
            zone requires quite a bit more and in the case of Fear is a long grueling process. However
            guilds make this an &quot;event&quot; in this day and age. They break the zone and they
            claim it as their own. <br>
            <br>
            Breaking the zone is the problem. It makes zero sense that the entrance should be the most
            difficult part to overcome. If Fear for example was set up so players could venture in and
            get a foothold first and then fight then players could have many isolated six person
            groups and could have a good time doing it.<br>
            <br>
            The way it is now you need to get a large group of players together and work together to
            do the zone. I have no problem with working together with others to do a zone. My problem
            is that it is this deficiency that causes players to band together in to a megaguild. That
            large mass rolls downhill and gathers a heap of fungus along the way causing problem after
            problem along the way.<br>
            <br>
            Now in the search for the fiery avenger players have been led to the plane of air. I
            personally refuse to believe that this is the fiery avenger quest. I'm pursuing other
            areas which I think may lead to the quest. Time will tell if the Plane of Air is the true
            location of the fiery avenger. If it is however then it is just another blatant example of
            Verant catering to megaguilds. <br>
            <br>
            The Plane of Air requires a huge amount of time to do and it requires a ton of camping. I
            sincerely hope that this is not the new quest. If it is then I must stress my
            dissapointment with the development team. I think to do it now would be to jump the gun.
            Time will tell.<br>
            <br>
            That is still no excuse in my opinion for the elitist and antisocial activities that many
            players in these megaguilds choose to pursue. I personally feel that players should work
            together with others and stop attempting to dominate their server. <br>
            <br>
            The goal of this article is for every player who is a member of a large guild to read over
            it and ask yourself, &quot;Are we a megaguild?&quot; Then ask yourself why? Is it so you
            do not have to rely on others? Is it because you get nice items? <br>
            <br>
            Most importantly... Is your fun impeding the progress and eliminating the fun from other
            players? <br>
            <br>
            I hope that the development team looks at this situation which they themselves have
            contributed to. We vollied long and hard for Fear to be worked on but it appears clear to
            me that this is either the way the Verant envisions the game or that they simply can not
            do anything about it under the confines of the design. I sincerely hope that the expansion
            zones are better thought out.<br>
