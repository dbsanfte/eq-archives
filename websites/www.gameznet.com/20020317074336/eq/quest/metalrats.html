<p>Following information was sent in by Clear, Honorable Dwarf Paladin of Bristlebane and
X'egony. <br>
<br>
Go see Beno Tagnarle (Storm guard Guild Trainer, not far from where you do scarab armor
quest)<br>
<br>
Hail him<br>
<br>
Ask him &quot;What do you [Ponder]?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tell him &quot;I will exterminate the rats&quot;<br>
<br>
Ask him &quot;What are metal rats?&quot;<br>
<br>
He has now told you he will reward you for the carcass of a metal rat.<br>
<br>
Find the Cleaner VII (I don't know if there are others, but that's the one I have seen the
times I have killed it) and kill it. I killed it with my level 3 Paladin with little armor
on. It runs a loop from the Bank/Mine area through the Forge to the Farm and then back.
It's quick and hard to get a swing on, but it climbs the Mine Cap and stops, at least
momentarily, a perfect perch for its impending doom.<br>
<br>
Return the metal scraps you receive from the looting (I don't know what the other gadgets
are for yet, that you may recieve) back to Beno and give it to him. For this he will give
a pittance (max. of 3 copper so far) and a Knight Card, telling you to return it for fine
armor.<br>
<br>
Take this card to Doran Vargnus, located on the Island of Sisterhood, as he has told you
to. This is the second stop in the Ocean of Tears after leaving Butcher Block Mountains.
Get off and go straight from the docks until you arrive at a small hut. Hail Vargnus, then
give him the card. He will thank you and give you your reward, a modest to lame item as I
have seen so far. I have gotten a pair of Patchwork Boots, a Bronze Dagger, A Pirates
Earring and a Cloth Wristband. Beware Pirate raids, although I have never seen any on my
trips. The timing is perfect, if you don't dawdle, to do this and get right back on the
boat to return to Butcher Block (or wherever you chose to embark). <br>
<br>
This is also the island at which you may purchase Kiola Nuts, used in the Dwarven Wire
Quest. Stop by the Double Hut and pick some up before you depart, if you want to kill 2
birds. (You will need at least 2, and they are close to 2 gold a piece) <br>
<br>
One final note: You can do this quest multiple times and stack them so you can get more
items from Vargnus. It won't matter if you already have the Knight Card in you inventory
if you attempt to do it twice, but I recommend an open slot in your main inventory, in
case that is a requirement. (I have been told when items purchased did not appear in my
inventory that the lack of an open main slot was the cause, although I have proven this
wrong, I will leave you the decision)<br>
