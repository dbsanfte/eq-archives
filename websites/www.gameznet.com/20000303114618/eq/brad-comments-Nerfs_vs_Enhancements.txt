Several members of the EQ team, with some initial help from a player's email, 
put the following document together listing both enhancements and 'nerfs' we've 
made to the game since launch. And while we probably forgot some things, both 
negative and positive (please let us know and I'll update the document), I think it 
puts in perspective the ratio of positive vs. negative changes to the game we've 
made. I also feel it heartily invalidates the assertion that we are out to make 
the game harder or to have players advance slower overall, or that 'all we do is nerf'.  

The following is broken down by class, and then addresses those changes made that affect the 
whole game. Changes we feel are positive from just about any perspective are denoted with 
a '+', and those some players might consider a 'nerf', but that we felt were important for the long 
term health of the game, are denoted with a '-'.  (again, I'm sure we've forgotten some things, 
both '+' and '-'; please feel free to comment and add items).
