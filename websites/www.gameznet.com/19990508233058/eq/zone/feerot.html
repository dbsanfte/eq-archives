<p>Feerot connects the ogre town of <a href="ogguk.html">Ogguk</a> to the rest of the
world. This zone also connects to <a href="innothuleswamp.html">Innothule Swamp</a> and <a href="rathemtns.html">Rathe Mountains</a>, and <a href="cazicinnothule.html">Cazic Thule</a>.
There is one vendor who sells here and you will want to visit her as often as possible(to
save trips to Ogguk). If you are leaving town take a left at the fork and keep heading
left. Before the path ends there will be one last stone house and inside of it you will
find the vendor.<br>
<br>
This zone is split into a few areas. The newbie part of the zone lies to the left of the
original fork. Over here you will find <a href="../beastiary/rat.html">rats</a>, <a href="../beastiary/bat.html">bats</a>, <a href="../beastiary/decayingskel.html">decaying
skeletons</a>, <a href="../beastiary/froglock.html">froglock tads</a>, <a href="../beastiary/smallbeetles.html">minor scarabs</a>, <a href="../beastiary/spiderlings.html">spiderlings</a> and <a href="../beastiary/lizman.html">lizard man broodlings</a>. This part of the zone is great
for characters level 1-3.<br>
<br>
If you head straight at the first fork you will find a bridge that leads to a trail to
Rathe Mountains. Over this bridge is the level 4-8 area. On this side of the bridge you
will find lizard man scouts, <a href="../beastiary/lspider.html">jungle spiders</a>, <a href="../beastiary/skeleton.html">skeletons</a> and giant bats. There are several camps in
this area that feature skeletons as well as <a href="../beastiary/zombie.html">zombies</a>.
There are also many lizard men camps.<br>
<br>
The high level area of Feerot is somewhat hidden away from the rest of the zone. If you
were entering from Rathe mountains you would take a right and follow the zone ridge. After
the skeleton camp and before the water you will probably notice a <a href="../beastiary/spectre.html">Spectre</a>. Near this spectre you will see a tree which
is next to the zone border. This is a hidden entrance to what is known as the spectre
cave. Inside of this cave you will find many spectres and a high level(40+) enchanter. She
is guarding the entrance to a gate to another plane.<br>
