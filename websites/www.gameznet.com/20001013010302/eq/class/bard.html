          <tr>
            <td>Bards are one of the most interesting classes in Everquest. Bards are the truest of
            hybrids in the game. They can dual wield and wear platemail armor, yet they can not double
            attack. They can use a large amount of weapons that are only available to them and mage
            types, yet can not not use any of the nice two handed weapons in the game. They have a
            wide selection of spells, yet only receive on every level. They have some thieving skills,
            yet are lacking perhaps the most important ones(backstab, pick pockets and poison). &nbsp;
            They are a great assistance class with their group effect spells, yet they also have some
            spells which enable them to be one of the best soloing melee types. Bards are truly a jack
            of all trades, yet a master of none.<br>
            <br>
            In this guide we will first focus on the various skills which bards acquire in the game
            and we will then focus in on bard spellcasting.<br>
            <br>
            At level 10 you receive both dodge. Dodge is a very useful skill. Dodging prevents you
            from getting hit which is useful for a bard as your songs will often anger mobs causing
            them to attack you.<br>
            <br>
            At level 12 you receive the forage skill. It will take a lot of patience and practice to
            get this skill up to a level where it will be useful. However it is a useful skill as with
            it you will never have to shop for food and water again. <br>
            <br>
            At level 17 you receive your most important melee skill: Dual Wield. This skill will allow
            you to use two weapons at a time. This is important for a bard since you never receive the
            double attack skill. As soon as you can you should acquire a haste item such as the
            flowing black silk sash(thought that will be at least another 15-20 levels) to increase
            your attack speed. This will be important without double attack for your melee to stay
            viable.<br>
            <br>
            Also at level 17 you also receive sneak.&nbsp; Sneak is sort of a poor man's invisibility
            but less effective and it will cut your speed in half. This skill will become obsolete
            when you receive the invisibility song at level 19.<br>
            <br>
            At level 24 you receive the safe fall skill. This skill will allow you to fall from great
            heights without taking damage. It will take a lot of practice to be able to do so
            effectively though. I recommend jumping off the smaller buildings in town to raise the
            skill.<br>
            <br>
            At level 25 you gain the ability to hide. Hide is not that important at this point because
            you can already sing the invisibility song. However hide and sneak can be used together to
            give invisibility as well though you will be moving at a very slow rate.<br>
            <br>
            At level 30 you receive the disarm trap skill. This is one of those skills which would be
            very useful if traps actually worked properly in Everquest. Disarm traps only works on
            moving traps. There are a few moving traps in the game(mostly in the dungeons of Solusek)
            however the damage on these traps has been de-activated thus making this skill worthless.<br>
            <br>
            At level 35 you gain the tracking skill. This is an extremely useful skill. It is
            essential in finding rare NPC's in outdoor zones. It can also be used in indoor zones to
            detect what NPC's have spawned. <br>
            <br>
            At level 40 you receive the last of your skills in the form of pick locks. This skill can
            be useful I suppose. However there are not any locked doors in the high level dungeons.
            &nbsp; This skill is useful for some of the lower level dungeons, but it's nothing to
            write home about.<br>
            <br>
            Before we delve into spells it's important to note the way bard spells work. Bard spells
            will continually sing once you select the spell. They will loop until you deselect the
            spell or begin singing another song. There are two tactics which should be noted for bard
            song singing. <br>
            <br>
            The first is song stacking. Each song has a duration. This duration will remain in effect
            for a few seconds after you stop singing a song. With a little practice you can toggle
            between singing different songs and get multiple spell effects up at one time. It takes a
            little practice but it's an invaluable tactic at higher levels.<br>
            <br>
            The second thing that should be noted is the effectiveness of instruments. You will notice
            that each song uses a certain skill. Certain songs use instrument skills which you may not
            have yet. Do not worry you can still sing the song. By using the instrument which the song
            desires however you can increase it's effectiveness. This makes for some interesting fight
            time decisions. Should you melee while you sing the songs or should you pull out your
            instrument and become a non-melee bard? In the end it's your choice to make and each can
            be an effective tactic under different circumstances.<br>
            <br>
            There are too many bard songs to give a description of each one. If you want full bard
            song descriptions you can visit our <a href="../spells/bard.html">Bard Spell Guide</a> and
            get the best information we have on bard spells at this time. I will however describe the
            different types of spells at a bards disposal.<br>
            <br>
            The first type are combat buffs. These include songs such as the Chant of Battle and
            Anthem de Arms. These songs will increase certain abilities of your party such as strength
            or dexterity. They will effect the entire party. Songs such as Anthem de Arms also
            increase your parties attack speed(haste) which make them invaluable. This also includes
            songs such as the Whistling Warsong which will increase your abilities but are self only.<br>
            <br>
            Bards also offensive spells. Some of these spells such as Brusco's Boastful Bellow are
            direct damage offensive spells which will damage one target. Others are damage over time
            spells which will do a few ticks of a certain amount of damage to your opponent. You also
            receive area effect direct damage and area effect damage over time spells. These spells
            are extremely effective when solo but lose their effectiveness in many instances in a
            group.<br>
            <br>
            Bards also receives buffing spells. These spells will increase abilities such as strength
            or dexterity or resistances such as the resistance to fire or disease. A low level example
            would be the elemental rhythms(level 9) which increases resistance to fire, cold and magic
            for your entire party.<br>
            <br>
            Another interesting type of spell is debuffs such as Largo's Melodic Binding. These spells
            lower the abilities of enemy mobs. Largo's is a good example as it not only lower's your
            opponents armor class but also their attack speed.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps the most sought after line of spells by bards in groups however are their downtime
            reducing spells. Bards have different spells which can increase themselves and their party
            members stamina, hit point and mana regeneration speeds. These makes bards invaluable
            additions to a party. <br>
            <br>
            Bards also possess party utility spells. Some examples of these spells include speed
            enhancing(for travel), water breathing, invisibility, ultravision or levitation spells.
            These spells are very useful for a party as they can effect everyone at once. They are
            require careful attention on the bards part as people can easily move out of range and get
            into trouble. It would be a bad thing for the party if they relied on a bard for water
            breathing and he went linkdead or died while they were deep in Kedge Keep for example. <br>
            <br>
            Bards gain the ability to soothe monsters with Kelin's Lubugrious Lament and it's
            predecessors(such as his Lucid Lulliby). This spell is useful if your puller brings back
            more than you can handle. If your party concentrates on attacking a single monster you
            might be able to soothe all the rest and prevent them from attacking. This allows you to
            take on one monster at a time. The problem with this spell is that if it fails every
            monster will turn and attack the bard. It's a dangerous spell but can also be very
            effective.<br>
            <br>
            Another great bard song allows you to charm your opponent. By using this song you will be
            able to take that impossible to kill pull of three monsters and change it into just two
            while adding one to your party. This spell can be a lifesaver. Beware however that once
            charm breaks the monster will hate you like no other. <br>
            <br>
            Some other useful bard songs include the chain(root) song and fear songs. Chain is very
            useful to stop runners. Fear is generally not a useful spell. Many bards however employ a
            somewhat cheesy tactic where they will fear the monster then chain him over and over. This
            tactic will allow them to constantly hit the monsters backside without being hit. It is
            sort of a reverse kiting tactic. While it remains an effective tactic be warned that you
            probably won't make many friends if you employ it as a large amount of other players
            consider this cheesy or even an exploit. <br>
            <br>
            Convinced you want to play a bard? Well now what do you do? You have three choices of race
            when considering a bard: human, half elf or wood elf. Each of the races have their own
            strengths and weaknesses and it is up to you to decide which one fits your playing style.
            Bear in mind the following skills are important for a bard.<br>
            <br>
            Strength is important if you wish to wear all that shiny platemail and not be overweight.
            It is also useful for increasing your effectiveness in combat.<br>
            <br>
            Agility helps you avoid damage and thus is important for a bard. Some of your spells will
            really anger monsters and the more damage you can avoid the better.<br>
            <br>
            Dexterity is important for playing your songs, combat and and to make your weapons proc
            more often(this is important at higher levels). <br>
            <br>
            Charisma is also important for a bard. A high charisma will make you a more effective
            charmer. Charm will be an important spell for you at higher levels and this should not be
            overlooked.<br>
            <br>
            I've done my best to describe the bard class now the rest is up to you. The most important
            lessons that you can learn in this game are learned from personal experience and not from
            any text document you read on the internet. Hopefully you have a better idea of what the
            class has to offer after reading this document and are ready to begin your journey. Good
            luck and happy hunting!</td>
