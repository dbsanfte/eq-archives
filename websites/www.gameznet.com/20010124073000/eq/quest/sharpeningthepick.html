            the stone! This is wonderful! The fullfillment of the prophecy is now one step closer. The
            most ancient of the stone tells us that one not of stone will come forth and act as our

            people and unite them. When we join we will know all of our experiences and perhaps then
            be aware of how to proceed with the next step in our asscention. We implore you to find
            others like us and make them aware of us. You know the language of the stone and can tell
            them. We await your return with proof that you have spoken to them.&quot;</font> </p>

            up and head down into the caverns, you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf area,
            then a tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long stretch of tunnel
            leading up to a zone out point.&nbsp; That long stretch of tunnel is filled with geonids
            and they con the same as the ones in Wakening Land.&nbsp; Give one of them the focus (any
            one, doesn't matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll get it back with
            the following message:</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>A geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you as anything
            of importance. You attempt to speak with the geonid through your velium focus but all you
            are able to hear is the same though over and over.., Eat. You have gained no knowledge
            from these creatures but you notice your focus has been altered slightly.</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>The description on the focus doesn't change, but it is

            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Phenocryst sends it's thoughts to you, a feeling of

            are alone..So many questions yet we can find no answers. We have been given a very special
            gift but without direction we are lost. We must find who has made us aware of ourselves
            and why it has done so.'</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>You say to Phenocryst, &quot;Find what?&quot;</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We must call to
            it. We must make ourselves heard past these rocks though. A menhir must be constructed to
            amplify our voice. The stones we will need are not found in this area though. We hear
            whispers of stones far away that have the ability to channel and amplify our thoughts. We
            ask you to gather these stones for us harbinger.&quot;</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>You say to Phenocryst, &quot;I will gather these stones
            for you.&quot;</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank you
            Harbinger. We need 3 crystals. One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of the purest Iron.
            These minerals will only be found deep within the earth where the geology is relatively
            stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right crystals. Return it to me with the 3
            crystals and we will construct our Menhir. Please hurry Harbinger, our prophecy awaits.</font>
            </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him you'll
            gather the stones.&nbsp; It's a magic, lore, no drop Elbaite Focus that has 5 charges of
            Identify.&nbsp; It looks like a fire emerald.</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>The stibnite crystal is found in The Great Divide.&nbsp;
            If you enter the wurm caves in the center of that zone from the south, go up to the first
            right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a room with two spawn points for wurms
            and there's a patch of blue crystal at the back of the room.&nbsp; The stibnite is behind
            the crystals and looks like a bag on the floor.&nbsp; It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I
            think.&nbsp; The description of the item is &quot;Bent Metallic Crystal&quot;.&nbsp; It
            weights 20.0, is magic, lore, and no drop.&nbsp; When you identify it, it identifies as
            &quot;Stibnite for the Menhir&quot;.&nbsp; To identify an item using the Elbaite Focus,
            target yourself, pick up the item and right click it on the Elbaite Focus in your
            inventory.&nbsp; It won't change the description of the item, it'll just tell you what it
            is in your chat window.</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p></font>The&nbsp;Beryl crystal&nbsp;is in Split Paw.
            &nbsp; It once dropped in the entrance of the dungeon, but a recent patch has seen Verant
            moving the crystal to a location deeper inside the dungeon.&nbsp; Now it's at loc
            690,-10,-30.&nbsp; If you invis up, go through the first double doors and jump off the
            first bridge, you'll find a door that, when opened, leads to some water on your left hand
            side.&nbsp; About 3-4 feet across the water is a small platform.&nbsp; The crystal can be
            found on the opposite side of the platform.&nbsp; The spawn time here is probably the
            same.&nbsp; The item description is &quot;Reddish Crystal&quot; and it's also magic, lore,
            and no drop.&nbsp; It weighs 10.0.&nbsp; It identifies as &quot;Beryl for the Menhir&quot;</p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>The crystal of purest iron is in Burning Woods.&nbsp;
            It's sitting on the meteor near Slixin Klex.&nbsp; It's item description is &quot;Heavy
            Metallic Crystal&quot; and is magic, lore, and no drop.&nbsp; It weighs 14.0.</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Take these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus back to
            Wakening Lands to Phenocryst and you're ready for the next step.&nbsp; Get 1-2 parties of
            50+ players and bring 'em with you.&nbsp; Due to the dragon that spawns in Wakening Land
            near the dragon portal, you might want to approach from skyshrine.&nbsp; If you're going
            along the wall from skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the
            second cave entrance along the wall.&nbsp; Phenocryst is closest to that entrance.&nbsp;
            Get to know the path between you and him at this point so you're familiar with how to get
            out in a hurry.&nbsp; At this point, all the geonids should con amiable to you.&nbsp;
            Finishing the Velium Focus section achieves this faction adjustment.&nbsp; Make sure you
            have a ranger in your party of friends.&nbsp; You're going to have to track down some
            triggered MOBs and fight them.</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>You submit the items to Phenocryst.</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Phenocryst makes no sound but it's voice fills your mind.
            'We have always held our memories within the earth and stone but only recently have we
            become aware of them.&nbsp; We do not know what happened or who gave us this wonderful
            gift but we can now access those memories and are aware of it's storage.&nbsp; With that
            knowledge has come questions and desires.&nbsp; When the prophecy comes to be then we will
            have our answers and fulfill our desires.'</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Phenocryst 's familiar thoughts flood into your mind
            again, 'You truly are the Harbinger, take this Focus as a mark of your friendship with us.
            Now we can construct the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones speak.., There is a problem.
            Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of them. They must not disturb us while we
            construct the Menhir! Please stop them Harbinger! bring us proof of their distruction
            along with your Focus and then we will begin the calling. Our asscention is at hand!'</font>
            </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>You lose the focus and the three crystals and in return
            gain another focus item with the description &quot;Azurite Focus&quot;.&nbsp; It's a
            magic, lore, no drop item weighing 0.5.</font> </p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><p>Now head outside and start tracking.&nbsp; After a few
            minutes, two &quot;accolyte of Zek&quot; giants will show up on track. A minute later or
            so, a Bloodpriest Loukond will show up on tracker as well.&nbsp; You'll have to run out
            and pull the accolytes to you once you track them.&nbsp; If they are snared, they still
            run quite fast.&nbsp; These giants con blue at 52 and are quite magic resistant.&nbsp;
            Make sure you pull these, they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest.&nbsp; They
            get attacked by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you
            can do the job.&nbsp; If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do.&nbsp; After
            killing both accolytes, loot them.&nbsp; Each one has a medalion that has the description,
            &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;, which is magic, no drop, and weighs 2.0.&nbsp; After the
            accolytes are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest.&nbsp; Bloodpriest Loukond should
            eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand outside it if nobody pulls it.&nbsp;
            After a minute of standing outside the cave, he depops, which is why you have to do the
            accolytes first (they pop first) then the bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if
            you can't find him, the accolytes might not).&nbsp; The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is
            just as magic resistant.&nbsp; He drops a third and final medalion with the same
            description.&nbsp; You must get all three medalions in order to for this part to prove
            fruitful.&nbsp; When you kill the giants, you take the following faction hits: Kromzek
            (worse), Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan (better).&nbsp; The
            giants never enter the caves to attack the geonids or anything.&nbsp; Everything will
            happen outside the caves and the giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up either.&nbsp;
            The Bloodpriest Loukond is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant who
            wanders in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this quest.</font> </p>

            their Menhir and the quest is over.&nbsp; I didn't stick around to watch because we got
            some tar goo on us and that put a dampener on things real quick.&nbsp; It's very important
            to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo does not and if you get any
            of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid.&nbsp; No idea why this is,
            it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.&nbsp; Also, enchanters can skip a huge chunk
            of this quest by casting Collaboration on Phenocryst and starting from the point where to
            say to him &quot;I will gather these stones for you&quot;.&nbsp; The Velium Focus half
            gives you the faction to be able to tell that to Phenocryst.&nbsp; Provided an enchanter
            MAKES him amiable, they don't have to bother with the first half.</font> </p>
