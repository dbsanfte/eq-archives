It's been a slow week for items. There's two in my mailbox that I will post after I confirm and one other one that I promised the submitter I would not post for another week. Other than that we are dry on items. I'm going to spend this time getting all of our databases and other sections ready for expansion. In the meantime here's two screenshots for older pieces of equipment that didn't have them previously and one new old piece of equipment. Did that make sense to anyone but myself? Either way here goes...<br><br>New Equipment: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/silverywaraxe.html">Silvery War Axe</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/enchantedbattlewornmorningstar.html">Enchanted Battleworn Morning Star</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/braceletcessation.html">Bracelet of Cessation</a>(NEC).

Though I did not get a chance to attend I did go through the chatlog from two nights ago and decided to post the highlights of it here. I had planned on just posting highlights to the news page but the list was getting much too long(there was just too much good stuff). So instead i've made a <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/45highlights.html">Highlights Page</a> of the logs. <a href="http://www.everlore.com">Everlore</a> has posted a complete transcript of it which can be found by clicking <a href="http://www.everlore.com/news/Bradlog4-5_1.asp">here</a>.

One small thing that I thought you all should know about Kunark ordering. I got asked this question a few times yesterday and it was hard to come by the information anywhere. Although Ruins of Kunark will ship next week the servers are not planned go live until April 24th. They may go online a couple of days early but that is not known for sure yet. If they do go online early it is likely only to be a 1-3 days early. <br><br>So unless you live in a hard to reach part of the world or unless you are unable to order it until less than a week before release it's likely not worth paying the next day delivery. Just wanted to let everyone know so perhaps they can save themselves a few dollars.

Well Everquest fans the moment that we have all been waiting for has finally arrived. The online store went active today. You may now order the Ruins of Kunark online by logging on to Everquest and going to the Online Store. There are two different shipping options(one for ground mail and one for next day delivery). It looks like it could begin shipping as early as the 11th and possibly be on your door step in less than a week.

Here's some news for ya:<br><br><blockquote>House Ya'Ler is pleased to announce that we will be hosting a Tournament of Champions on Saturday, April 8th, 2000, at 3pm EST in the Arena zone on the Povar server.<br>This will be a TEAMS event, with an entry fee of 250pp per person, with a split for first, second and third place teams to be 60%, 30%, and 10%. Many people will show up late and/or individually, and thus teams are allowed to be formed after the event has begun, but NOT after the first round is over.<br>We are still waiting to hear a response from the Server GM as to if he will be able to come and witness this event, and even offer to be an impartial referee.<br><br>Rules are as follows:<br>-Teams will pit themselves against each other, one at a time.<br>-Teams will have a MAXIMUM of six (6) people each.<br>-The last team left standing will win that round, and move on to the next.<br>-No potions, pumice stones, or clickable items (other than manastones, journeyman boots, and masks of the deceiver) will be allowed.<br>-No pets.<br>-Once you are chosen to enter the Arena, you will have two minutes to finish buffing/medding before the games begin.<br>-You will be warned that you are on-deck for the next battle, so use this time to buff.<br>-PRIOR to battle and OUTSIDE the fighting area, you ARE allowed to receive buffs from anyone.<br>-DURING the battle, ANY tactic may be used except those noted above.  <br>-Outside interference by registered combatants will result in <br>disqualification of your entire team.  Interference can include casting any spell on a combatant, or using ooc, shout, or auction in excess.<br>-Anyone entering the Arena while a contest is being fought, or anyone <br>assisting any of the combatants, will be attacked and killed.  Contestants will be allowed to enter when ASKED in order to destroy the interloper(s).<br>-You may enter more than once, on more than one team, but each entry requires payment of the entry fee.<br>-Teams will NOT be allowed to change members once they have registered.  Members can be added if the team is less than six (6), but a team that loses a member cannot be replaced.<br>-All combatants will bind themselves OUTSIDE the actual fighting area before the fight.<br>-Once you die, you may NOT reenter the Arena, and will ONLY do so to drag your corpse out of the fighting area, AFTER the fight is done and a winner declared.  NO LOOTING IN THE FIGHTING AREA.<br>-No special consideration will be shown to anyone who is Linkdead.  It is a risk we all must take, and the show must go on.<br>-The entry fee is nonrefundable.  All proceeds are going to the winners.<br><br>In the spirit of fair play, we ask that you not let someone die through a DOT or allow them to bleed to death, as they WILL lose experience if this happens.  This event is to vent anger, make (or most likely lose) money, and above all, have fun.  We know that there are some of you out there that just want to enter this to kill your rivals, and we'll try to accommodate being able to fight against them.  No promises however!<br>Hopefully, this event will run without a hitch, and will indeed become a regular event on Povar.<br>For more information, email <a href="mailto:houseyaler@aol.com">houseyaler@aol.com</a> , visit our website at <br><a href="http://members.xoom.com/eqveritas">http://members.xoom.com/eqveritas</a> , or speak to Velglarn Ya'Ler in-game.<br><br>Velglarn Ya'Ler<br>House Ya'Ler<br>Povar</blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#f0f0f0">Important Patch Message</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, April 5, 2000 by <a href="mailto:nofx@gameznet.com">NoFx</a></small><br>
Make sure you read this or the actual patch message before logging in as it may concern some of you more then others (ShowEQ Users).<br><br><blockquote>Dear EverQuest Players,<br><br>An exciting time is now at hand. Within the next 2 days the Login Servers will be coming down and we will be doing a patch that will add the EverQuest Store into the front end of the game. At that time, the first product we will be offering will be the EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark (RoK) upgrade for existing customers. This will allow existing customers of EverQuest to purchase RoK for $16.95 (Plus S&H). In addition, we will offer various shipping options depending on which country you live in. EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark will be launching on April 24th. We want to insure that this product is in everybody's hands on or before that date. <br><br>In addition to this change, we will also be modifying our User Agreement and Software License to add in some additional Terms and Conditions that we will require everyone to agree to before playing EverQuest.<br><br>The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest Characters and Items outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay). Here is the text of this change:<br><br>"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material."<br><br>You may ask why we are doing this. There are many reasons, but first and foremost of them is the amount of trouble this is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there are a lot of people out there who defraud others and we are being put in the middle of it, and we don't have the time or the resources to assist people with these disputes when they arise. The next reason is a more philosophical one and that is that we believe people should have to earn their items and characters in the game rather than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the second point can be argued from other perspectives that we do in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear ours.<br><br>The next change to the User Agreement and Software license concerns our efforts to stop people from hacking EverQuest and from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest as an ongoing business concern. We have developed the technology to check for these hacking tools/programs and report that fact back to us. Without getting into the specifics of this technology, I can say that we in no way will search a user's hard drive(aside from the EverQuest directory during the patching process), registry nor will we send back any information other than the fact that a user is in fact running one of these programs (specifically we are NOT sending information about everything the user is running back to our servers). It's disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the hacking community  force us to do this. Many will say "ShowEQ" isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not something we can allow in a game like EverQuest where it affects other people's enjoyment of the game. In addition, although this is the first time we'll be acknowledging this, ShowEQ isn't the worst offender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring down our servers with another malicious program. We were able to quickly identify what was going on and insure this didn't happen again, but nonetheless the potential is there and we need to be able to quickly identify and stop these types of programs. Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send any information back to the Everquest servers other than information regarding programs that we feel interfere with the intended operation of EverQuest. We have had this technology available for some time, but recently we've found it's going to be neccessary to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To those of you concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say that we feel it's neccessary to do this but we want you to be informed that we are going to try these measures to protect both ourselves and the game's players.<br><br>Here is the text of this change:<br><br>"You hereby grant us permission to download Game-related files to you.  You also grant us permission to access, extract and upload (i) Game-related data as part of the patching process and (ii) data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable discretion, determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest."<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</blockquote>
