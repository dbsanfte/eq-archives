            This guide was user submitted. It was submitted by Lady Solitica Destiny.<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So ya think ya got what it takes ta be a warrior, huh? Got the
            guts ta stand toe-to-toe with a critter that&#146;ll try ta make ya it&#146;s meal? Think
            ya can stand the long sword fights with bandits? The strenuous activity of running around
            in plate mail? The sweat and grim of a hard earned battle? Think ya can stand the fact of
            being the first ta battle, and the last ta run? If ya said no to any of these questions,
            ya should try another class, cuz warriors are the very basis of the terminology
            &quot;tanks.&quot; If ya said yes to all, then you already possess the warrior&#146;s
            mentality. Let us begin with the trainin!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All right, lets start at the very beginning. Race? What
            ta be, hmmm? Well, the choices are all up ta you, but donna listen ta anyone saying that a
            warrior *should* be a Ogre, Troll, or a Barbarian. Ya donna have ta be big and strong ta
            be a lethal killing machine. I&#146;m a wood elf, and any other guide &#145;ell tell ya
            they are the worst warriors. Bah, they just are power hungry. They donna see the beauty of
            a wood elf, not ta mention all our racial benefits. But, once more, you be who and what ya
            wanna be. I&#146;ll just be here ta train ya. Not reprimand ya.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the way, High Elves and Edruties donna believe in the
            warrior ways. They cannot, and will not, choose the mind set of a true warrior, therefore
            they cannot be warriors.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Barbarian</b> - Strong, big, yet a lil on the dumb
            side. Their charisma doesn&#146;t do &#145;em much good either, but they are a strong
            race, if ya can deal without infravision. There are a few weapons that require you to be a
            strong or big race, and barbarians are definitely big and strong. These guys have a bonus
            for combat, they can Slam. This donna do much damage, and most likely will be replaced
            with Shield Bash, but they got it so use it while ya young. Barbarians also have a blessin
            on their resistance towards cold.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Human</b> - Average in stats, which is a blessin and a
            curse. They accelerate at one thing though: experience. All the races suffer a experience
            point penalty save for humans. They learn quicker. They also have the least bit of racial
            tension from other races. Like barbarians, humans donna have infravision.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dwarf</b> - Strong, enduring, and small. Dwarves are a
            sturdy race that donna seem to think working hard and overtime is a bad thing. The
            heavier, louder, and stronger a piece of armor is, they love it more. Ya donna have ta
            tell me twice that dwarves are great warriors, although I&#146;ll tell ya something or two
            about BO with these guys. &lt;phew!&gt; Nonetheless, dwarves possess the nerves and
            mentality to be a true warrior. They possess infravison, a nifty bonus, high stamina, and
            high strength, although they lack in dexterity and agility. They might be able ta dish it
            out and take a few more impacts than I, but I prefer ta not be hit than ta be able ta
            withstand a few more hits. Just my view on life.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Halflings</b> - Their not as strong as the other
            races, but they are mighty agile and dexterous. They might not hit hard, but they can hit
            more often and they can evade hits better than any I know. They have infravision, which is
            a great thing. Their only flaw is their strength. Without any magical assistance, I donna
            know how a halfling will ever get around to wearing plate mail&#133;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Gnomes</b> - Uh oh! Someone said a four letter word!
            (I can count, gnomes is a six letter word. =P ) Gnomes (oops!) are a sturdy race like
            dwarves, yet they are far more intelligent, well they presume to be. They aren&#146;t as
            strong as dwarves nor as wise, but their intelligence definitely shows. They can learn
            quicker than any other warrior; skill wise that is, not experience points wise. They have
            infravision and they have a unique racial ability, tinkering. I donna know if that&#146;s
            a good thing. Gnomes usually come up with weird stuff, but half the time it&#146;s
            actually useful. Note that: <b>half</b> the time. =)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dark Elves</b> - The dark children of Norrath, but
            donna thing just cuz their shun from the world they canna be warriors. They are far more
            vicious than others would presume. Their not strong, but strong enough to get by. Their
            strength lies in their dexterity, agility and intelligence. They possess some truly
            remarkable racial abilities: Ultravision, the ability to see perfectly at night; and the
            hiding skill. They can vanish into thin air, sorta like invisibility, but at will. It only
            works 50% of the time, but it&#146;s better than nothing in my opinion. They just suffer a
            big racial tension around the world, although their tension isn&#146;t as bad as with
            ogres and trolls.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Trolls</b> - Bigger than barbarians, but smaller than
            ogres. These guys are stronger, and more sturdier than dwarves, although their lights
            aren&#146;t always on upstairs. Um, they lack intelligence and wisdom that is. True, a
            warrior donna have to be smart in order ta swing a sword or kick a critter where it
            counts. Trolls have infravision like and they have an admirable trait, which causes
            jealousy ta other warriors. Troll warriors possess regeneration, therefore they have a
            much shorter down time than anyone else. Their weakness is they have low tolerance to fire
            and their racial tension with the world is something to consider. Cuz they ain&#146;t
            welcomed at my home town. Like Barbarians, they can Slam.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Ogres</b> - Biggest of all, strongest of all, UGLIEST
            of all! BO, Brushin their teeth, BATHING all come ta mind when I see, no *think* of these
            guys. But, if ya can stand that, let me tell ya, a swing from an ogre might not hit often
            at first when their young, but when their older, a hit might be the difference between ya
            life and death. These guys are walking muscle. They can start off with a strength of 150,
            which has inspired lots of warriors. But once again, donna think strength is everything.
            Ogres have infravision but they have the worst racial tension with the world. Their KOS,
            killed on sight, with NPC&#146;s, non-player characters. Ta be honest, their strength has
            allured my attention (forget their looks!), but the fact that they canna travel the world
            as easily as the good races, makes &#145;em dwindle in numbers around the world. Ogres can
            Slam like trolls and barbarians.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Half-Elves</b> - Handsome, agile, strong, yet a lil on
            the frail side. Half-elves are a very similar ta humans save for a humans have slightly
            better strength and stamina. Half-elves possess infravision and occasionally laugh at
            their human counterparts when they go bump in the night. =)</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wood Elves</b> - Ahh, my race and choice in life. We
            wood elves are quick and agile, although halflings are more agile I will admit. We can be
            strong, getting a strength of 100. While weaker than the big races, we can boast a high
            agility <b>with</b> that 100 strength, we can have a 100 agility as well. So we can hit
            hard in battle, and avoid blows with ease. We also have a few nifty racial abilities. We
            can hide like dark elves, and we can forage for food like rangers, druids, and bards can.
            We can hide and forage 50% of the time, but it&#146;s better than having ta make food runs
            or if ya low in health and danger is near, ya can always hide while ya recover. =)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, I&#146;ve said all there is about the races. Ya
            choose whatcha wanna be and have fun, that&#146;s all that really matters. Donna look at
            the numbers, stat wise, look at the fact that magical items can always boost &#145;em and
            ya can do a lot more with a different race than ya can do with a strong race. Ogres and
            trolls have ultravision. Barbarians and humans don&#146;t. But Ogres and trolls canna
            travel all over Norrath without doing <b>a lot</b> of good deeds. Barbarians and humans
            are accepted. Elves are quick and agile, but lack in raw power. So? Just takes me another
            swing or two ta take down my opponent&#133;gives me such a rush! =)</font></p>
            <u><b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warriors in Depth</font></b></u></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First off, we warriors can wear almost any armor. Can
            wield almost any weapon. Lastly we have the most hit points per level there is. At levels
            20, 30, 40, and 50, we obtain more hit points. Therefore be prepared ta see some
            astronomical numbers for health. When ya get hit for 94 points, ya&#146;ll just say it was
            a scratch and see ya health bar barely move. Warriors get the ability to go berserk if
            they drop down to 30% of their health, and the ability to cause critical strikes and
            crippling blows in combat. We donna get spells, but that just separates the strong from
            the reliant. Spell casters rely on their mana and usually spend half their adventuring
            time meditating&#133;boring if ya ask me. Even the half breeds, paladins, rangers, and
            shadow knights rely on meditating. Their a shame to us fighting classes. But donna let the
            fact that they can heal themselves slip ya mind. It&#146;s a nice ability that we lack. My
            advice to you is to train in bind wounds. It won&#146;t help you get passed 50% of ya
            health, but it&#146;s better than sitting down for half an hour or so. The higher ya level
            is, the more the down time is. Ya can either heal ya self to 50% or beg a cleric for
            healing. I&#146;m not into beggin&#133;</font></p>
            <u><b><p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Armor Training</font></b></u></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Decided yet? Good! Let&#146;s get down to ya most
            important factor: Armor. Trust me, it&#146;s a BIG difference when ya levels start
            climbing. Patchwork armor is good until level 5, afterwards I&#146;d look for leather
            until 8. Beyond 8 I&#146;d try for banded until 15. At 16 and up, I&#146;d suggest trying
            to get bronze plate mail, or if ya can afford it, steel plate which offers the same AC as
            bronze plate it&#146;s just steel is a bit lighter. If ya need to know why armor is more
            important that weapons, I&#146;ll tell ya. When I was six, I had leather armor and was
            fairing well, until I met a wonderful person that bought me a full suit of bronze plate
            mail. I was in shock for about half an hour! That armor was terrific, although very heavy
            for me. I couldn&#146;t carry much loot. But with that armor, I lived all the way to 14
            without dying once. From 1-14 without any deaths is pretty good. But others will tell you
            that I was &quot;twinked&quot; because I had that armor earlier than most would&#146;ve.
            Prolly, but it was given to me. =P</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">( Twinked, by the way, is a term used in EQ for people
            walking around with very high level stuff at a very low level. )</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Donna worry about twinkers. Worry aboutcha self. Strive
            for breastplates first, cuz they give the best AC, then go for the rest of the armor. Now,
            there&#146;s a choice that will come to you one day. Some armor have magical enchantments
            on &#145;em but have a horrible AC compared ta other non-magical armor. Your choice again.
            I, like a lot of other warriors, firmly believe in STRENGTH enhancing armor pieces. But
            it&#146;s up to you. AC or ATK. In the beginning I&#146;d like ta think AC is more
            important due to most warriors will want ta solo. When ya get passed 20, forget ya soloin
            days and look for a group. ATK is more important now mainly cuz ya most likely will have
            healers with ya that will make up for ya loss in AC.</font></p>
            <u><b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weapon Training</font></b></u></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The best part. Weapons. They come in all sizes and
            shapes. From fists ta huge axes. Warriors are the master of melee. We can wield almost any
            weapon in all of Norrath save for pure mages wimpy stuff. We donna need a water crystal
            staff that can choke our enemies, I&#146;d rather slice &#145;em down with a reliable axe
            and kick &#145;em &#145;til he screams like us women. =)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Note: To train in weapon skill faster, always strive ta
            wield a weapon in the field with a short delay time. Quicker strikes means the skill is
            checked for often and therefore the skill will rise quicker than a slower weapon in the
            field.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1H Slash</b> - The common choice of all warriors.
            It&#146;s not ta be looked down upon, mainly because there aren&#146;t any special 1H
            blunts out there for high level warriors.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1H Blunt</b> - As stated before, there aren&#146;t any
            high end 1H blunt weapons for warriors only, but it donna mean you should over look this
            field. I personally am training in both, ya never know when one might pop up in the world.
            Weapon masters, such as myself, train in every weapon we are allowed.</font></p>

            get a monster&#146;s attention. Just give &#145;em a tap or two with these weapons and
            watch them turn to you in fear.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2H Blunt</b> - There are actually a few good 2H Blunts
            out there for warriors, but these weapons are extremely slow. The only offset they have is
            that they pack a mighty punch! A hit with these weapons takes out teeth from giants!</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Piercing</b> - These weapons aren&#146;t favorable by
            warriors, mainly because their weak in power. Their perfect for rogues, especially for
            their backstabs, but for a warrior, it&#146;s much preferred to use a sword or mace.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hand-to-Hand</b> - A decent training skill, but most
            warriors don&#146;t train in it. Mainly because we excel at weapons, and not fists like
            Monks do. This field is best left to them, still if you ever want to avoid being disarmed,
            this is a fine choice. Ya will always have a backup weapon. =)</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Archery</b> - This is a great skill, or throwing if ya
            like that better, for getting monster&#146;s attention. Since we donna have spells, and we
            don&#146;t need spells, ta lure critters ta us instead of running up ta them and wackin at
            them. It&#146;s also great when ya in a group and ya low in health, you can back up and
            fire away.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Throwing</b> - Same as Archery, save for they have a
            shorter range than arrows. But ya can fire &#145;em a lot faster!</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kicking</b> - We may not be Monks with our feet, but
            we still know how ta kick &#145;em where it counts. Aim low, below the belt. Even the
            shins will do finely. When fighting magical creatures, ya gonna need magical boots in
            order to effect &#145;em injury. </font><u><b></p>
            <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warrior Skill Training</font></b></u></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This will cover our skills we&#146;ll get as we progress
            throughout our years as warriors. Ya canna live without, these skills, and therefore train
            in &#145;em often. Donna worry about putting skill points inta &#145;em though, they rise
            quickly as you fight tougher and tougher critters. Save ya points for weapon skills that
            ya want to train but haven&#146;t had the time ta. Note: ya need ta put at least one
            training point in the following skill in order ta learn it.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Berserk</b> - This isn&#146;t a skill really. All
            warriors begin with this ability. If ya fall beneath 30% of ya health, ya&#146;ll flip ya
            lid and go insane. While berserk, ya strength will improve by 10, which increases our ATK.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shield Bash</b> - This obviously requires a shield in
            order ta be utilized in battle. Ya then use the flat end of the shield and SLAM the shield
            inta the critters face which can stun &#145;em sometimes. The only thing is that kicking
            generally does more damage. But donna over look this skill, when ya up to ya neck against
            magic users, show &#145;em how PO ya can get with a shield. It&#146;ll disrupt their magic
            and ya might walk away with no actual harm. Remember, magic users need their spells in
            order ta be effective, show &#145;em ya shield and they&#146;ll run in fear of ya. =)</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dodge</b> - A great skill I must say. Ya donna believe
            how many times I&#146;ve dodged death with this skill. With our ability to wear plate
            armor, use shields, parry, reposite, and dodge, a warrior can be a difficult being to
            injure when their skills if properly trained.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Parry</b> - I like this skill, ya use ya weapon ta
            stop incoming melee attacks and avoid damage. It&#146;s a nice warriors touch.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Critical Strikes </b>- This isn&#146;t a normal skill
            that ya have to train in. It&#146;s bestowed upon us warriors upon achieving ya 12<sup>th
            level. We then can teach critters not ta mess with us. A critical strike is a very rare
            event, so don&#146;t get ya hopes up high.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When we go berserk, our critical strikes become crippling
            blows. Crippling blows do a hell of a lot more damage than a critical strike and even stun
            opponents. My record a this time is 59 points with a critical strike, and I did a
            crippling blow that did 95 points. See the difference?</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dual Wield</b> - This skill is what a lot of warriors
            dream of. Wielding two powerful swords, or maces, against a critter in an amazing display
            of weapon talent. Just remember, put ya quickest weapon in ya right hand so this skill
            will raise fast. I&#146;d practice this skill in a group, while soloing I&#146;d just
            stick to a sword and shield or a two hander.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Double Attack</b> - This is what we live for. Our
            ability to swing twice as fast in combat is a great thing, especially if ya mastered dual
            wield. Ya can sometimes get four ta five swings before someone wielding a two hander can
            swing once! Yeah, a two hander can swing for more damage per swing, but dual wielders with
            double attacks have better chances of getting critical strikes in combat. Still, double
            attack with a two handed weapon is still something to train in.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reposite</b> - This is an attack that&#146;ll really
            tee-off ya opponents. When they swing at you, you get a counter-strike. Ya can bet this
            skill will be worth it except I don&#146;t think it works as often as I would presume. It
            comes almost as rare as critical strikes do.</font></p>
            <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Disarm</b> - I haven&#146;t gotten this high yet, but
            I believe it&#146;ll getcha some nifty weapons, and be useful when against critters
            wielding powerful weapons such as two handed swords. Most critters donna know how to use
            their fists effectively. Don&#146;t over look this skill. Although ya have to be 35 in
            order ta obtain this skill. So it&#146;s a long journey&#133;donna rush. Ya&#146;ll get
            there eventually.</font></p>
            <u><b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Graduation</font></b></u></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Okay, I have ta thank ya for readin my guide and havin
            the patience ta understand my accent. I hopes I helped ya on deciding whatcha wanna be and
            what ta train in. Warriors are a beautiful class. Donna let anyone tell ya that their the
            way of life is a boring and uninteresting one. Bah! They just got no patience. Warriors
            are masters of battle. A wizard may do 1000 points of damage ta one critter in the blink
            of an eye&#133;but he needs room ta cast it, and while that beast will be battering him
            down, he&#146;ll never get that spell off. In truth, it&#146;s been said before, and
            I&#146;ll repeat it. &quot;Tanks need blasters and healers, while healers and blasters
            need tanks.&quot; I heard this via OOC chat and I give credit ta the guy. Atlas I
            didn&#146;t record his name. =(</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If ya decided this is what ya wanna be, welcome ta
            Norrath, I&#146;ll be willin ta help a youngin anytime. Just don&#146;t expect
            powerlevelin from me. Warriors are proud ta fight, and fighting everything on Norrath is
            part of my dream. So donna rush. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If ya decide this isn&#146;t ya class, donna worry,
