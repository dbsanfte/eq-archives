<br><br>
Well, it was like a normal morning of summer break - I got up around 11:00am, stumbled downstairs, got some food, stumbled back upstairs and sat down at my desk.  I checked my email and was greeted by instant mortgage approvals, offers for fraudulent university diplomas, and other various spam that seems to be part of our every day life now.  Then I opened my browser and went to Caster's Realm (http://eq.castersrealm.com).  Test Server Wipe.  I couldn't quite believe it that after over a year of release Verant decided to randomly wipe the test server.
<br><br>
The test server - the platform upon which all of the things that Verant introduces into the "production" servers are tested.  The players that play there have the choice to play there and know that Verant might screw with their characters a bit, introduce massive bugs that make it almost impossible to play, and change the server switches to test PvP, PvP-Teams or any other idea they come up with.  However players are rewarded for their dedication:  The people who choose to work hard at their characters are rewarded with a place where items are fairly easy to find, there is hardly any overcrowding and from what I have seen in my limited experience there, people are generally more laid back and nice.  For the people that like having high level characters, it was possible to get a character buffed to high levels with amazing gear so that they could test the high level aspects of the game.  This made a lot of people happy and it was a great little community.
<br><br>
The player wipe came not only unexpectedly but for unknown reasons.  The official Verant line was that the test server had been warped in a manner that did not allow for an accurate testing environment, or something to that extent.  What Verant never said was why it had become unsuitable for testing and why the problems wasn't just fixed - did an entire community that was never warned about the possibility of a player wipe have to be destroyed?  Was there no other solution?  Why weren't the players given any warning so that perhaps another solution COULD be found - Verant always says that many people can find things out a LOT quicker than a small number of people:  one would hope they could apply their own ideology to a situation they encountered.  Alas they didn't and the test server and all it's greatness is lost.
<br><br>
So the question then becomes, why was there a player wipe?  Well personally I don't really know.  Perhaps there was a problem and Verant, like normal, took the easy way out by doing a player wipe.  However there are rumors going around of something a lot more serious, that I would like to briefly address.  It has been said that Jeff Buttler had a personal vendetta against a few players on the test server and to get back at them he wiped their characters.  I will not say my opinion on this for obvious reasons.  I will say that it is a rumor and I will treat it as such as there is no hard concrete evidence.  However on the other hand if it is true then there is a serious, serious problem.  Not only would his actions be immoral, unethical (in business terms) and downright mean, I would suspect that it would also be bordering on Illegal - it doesn't say that the test people were in danger of a wipe:  The message was added AFTER the wipe.  I think what perhaps Verant doesn't understand is that these players actually PAY to be there.  They pay their $10 per month like every other subscriber; yet dedicate their playing time to helping Verant make the game better.  I guess this shows how appreciative Verant really is.
<br><br>
So what is actually happening with test?  Well I have recently joined the Eq'Lizer team although I have been with GamezNet for a while now (at The Shadowbane Authority) and my first day on the job happened to be the day of the player wipe.  Well I have seen first hand what the players have done and they have given me information and item pics that Verant will not be happy are out in the open.  Recently I posted a guide for the hardest zone in the game - Veeshan's Peak as well as getting a myriad of item info about the zone.  
<br><br>
There is a Plane of Air guide on its way, and I have learned that much of the zone is still unpopulated and unitemized because Verant figured that the players would focus on Kunark and forget about Plane of Air for a while (which they did).  I have also learned the original plan for the Plane of Air.  It was originally supposed to be a zone that hosted the quests for the games holy-weapons, otherwise known as the Fiery Avenger - Class weapons, particle effects and all.  The weapons are in the game, however the quests to get them are plain old broken so there is no way to get them other than through the Test server.  Because they were posted it is very possible that the weapons might never be released and replacements will have to be created
<br><br>
What it all comes down to is that Verant did something to the players that they thought they could get away with.  They wiped the test server and expected the player base to say "Well it's a test server, who cares they knew it was possible."  What Verant didn't count on was that the players would actually stand up for the test server people that are as much a part of the Everquest community as the people of Veeshan, or Tarrew Marr, or Rallos Zek.  
<br><br>
Finally I would like to give a message to Verant and a warning to the other companies that might be reading this.  What you did was simply inexcusable - not only did it maliciously attack the customers that support your very existence, thereby making many people wonder how you manage to run a successful business but you opened the eyes of the largest gaming community to how much you really care about the players that dedicated themselves the most to you - the players that sacrificed their time and money to help make Everquest the great game that it is today. Furthermore you don't even listen to your longest standing advisers anymore, the phase .5 testers, which show the people the exact same thing.  By destroying the very people that help you the most you show the rest of us that we could be deleted at a moments notice; for all I know my account could be banned because you don't like what I am saying.  And if the rumors I have heard about Jeff Buttler are true (I will not repeat them here, anyone that is interested enough can go searching around the message boards) then Verant should not only restore the characters that were deleted, and give the players some compensation for being wronged, but also exemplify Jeff Buttler by showing him the door and giving him the boot.
