            <br>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">The following is a post I placed on Everlore's message
            boards regarding the Darkforge Armor quest, it's components, and advice regarding how to
            get each. Remember the that quest begins and ends at the Undead Knights at the Temple of
            Solusek Ro, and you will be spending a LOT of time in Cazic Thule. </font><div><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I hunted in Cazic Thule for 12 levels (26 onward) in my persistant
            search for Darkforge. Here is some general advice regarding hunting Crusaders in CT and
            attaining the various other items required for the quests: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-When hunting in CT, your best bet for Crusaders are by
            the Ziggurat/Pyramid/Temple (same location, often called any of those) either on the
            ground outside of it, or camping the Archon and pulling from the lower levels of the
            temple. Crusaders will spawn where the other high lvl lizards spawn(Justicars, Zealots,
            Judicators). The top of the pyramid can be camped by a full group of low 30s with little
            difficulty (especially if you have an enchanter, as is often the case). The other place
            where high level Lizards spawn often is in the sewers (not the gator pools) which can be
            distinguished by the plank walkways over crocodile infested waters. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-As soon as you join the group, ALWAYS tell them that you
            are looking for Crusaders so you can loot pieces of decayed for quest armor. Remind them
            that it is No Drop. It is also often best to remind them nearing the end of a battle with
            a Crusader, in case someone decides to loot the corpse and grabs some decayed because
            &quot;it looked like banded&quot;. Countless times i have had pieces of decayed that I
            needed looted off of Crusaders, only to have the person claim &quot;I didn't know you were
            looking for it&quot; or &quot;I didn't see the message&quot;. Granted, sometimes this is
            actually the case, but more often then not they are getting the decayed to do the quest
            themselves (SKs are desperate for Darkforge, and everyone knows it). Of course, treachery
            is not prevalent in all groups, but if you're hunting in CT for an extended period of
            time, you should meet some of the same people and figure out who you can trust. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a reminder, here are the components needed for each
            piece of Darkforge: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darkforge Breastplate: Decayed Mail, Decayed Breastplate,
            2 bars of enchanted platinum (not stacked) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darkforge Helm: Decayed Helm, Decayed Visor, 2 Freeport
            Militia Helms (I believe they changed the item name on the helm, but if it was dropped by
            a dead FP guard, it is the right helm) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darkforge Vambraces: Decayed Left Vambrace, Decayed Right
            Vambrace, Qeynos Kite Shield </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darkforge Bracer: Decayed Left Bracer, Decayed Right
            Bracer, Broken Minotaur Lord Horn (note, this makes one bracer, if you want 2 you need to
            do the quest once, turn in the items, then go back and do it again as all items required
            are NO DROP, LORE) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darkforge Boots: Decayed Left Boot, Decayed Right Boot, 2
            plies of Faerie Dust (unstacked, looks white, not yellow like pixie dust) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darkforge Greaves: Decayed Left Legplate, Decayed Right
            Legplate, 2 bricks of Melatite </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darkforge Gloves: Decayed Left Glove, Decayed Right
            Glove, 1 bar of enchanted platinum </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In regards to the various non-decayed pieces for the
            quests,here are a few small tips: </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-When getting Faerie Dust (for DF Boots), it is best to
            hang around near Felwithe in Gfay and kill pixies and other small game until you see a
            Faerie spawn. They are usually a Faerie Royal Guard, Maiden, Princess, etc. Dust drops
            usually on 1 out of every 3 or 4 of them, so it shouldn't be too difficult. Remember,
            Faerie Dust is white, Pixie Dust is yellow, be wary if people try to sell it to you. I
            would also suggest resisting the urge to go to Lesser Faydark and camp the Pixie building.
            True, Faeries have a better potential to spawn here, but you risk running into a wandering
            Brownie, NPC druids who are TOUGH for their level (30-45). Your best bet is to be patient
            in Greater Fay. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-The Broken Minotaur Lord Horn (for DF bracers) is always
            dropped off of the Mino Lords in Steamfont. They are reasonably difficult, but if you are
            a good soloer you can take them alone at 33+, otherwise get another person around your
            level to help and they should be no trouble. One thing to watch for is that deep in the
            Mino caves (if you follow the left path) Mino Lords spawn and wander, dangerously close to
            lvl 35 gnome necro, Meldrath. Anyone who has ever fought NPC necros around their level
            before knows that unnecessarily engaging one is generally not the best idea. Remember that
            the Minotaur Hero is different from the Lord and a much higher level mob (mid to high 40s
            i believe). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-Freeport Militia Helms (for DF helm) can be gotten
            rather easily by sneaking into East Freeport and waiting for the guard that walks by the
            dock (provided no one is camping the guards by the gates). He is pretty low, and is far
            enough away from other guards that, as long as you have him darknessed and kill fairly
            quickly, he won't aggro any others. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-Qeynos Kite Shields (for DF vambraces)can either be
            attained by killing Qeynos guards (hard way) or by giving a low level 10pp to go inside
            the city and buy one off a vendor for you (sell for 5-8pp last time I checked). The shield
            you require is indeed a Qeynos Kite Shield (not a wooden kite shield, or any other form). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-Melatite (for DF Greaves) is found on the clockworks in
            Sol A. People often are selling melatite in the zone for 50pp per brick or so, but if you
            want to camp them it drops fairly often (1 out of 2 or 3 has it). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">-Finally, Enchanted Platinum Bars are pretty easy to come
            by. Your best bet is to buy the bars yourself and then just give it to an enchanter you
            trust to enchant for you. Enchanters sometimes charge an excessive royalty for fetching
            and enchanting the bars themselves (enough to make up for whatever discount you may think
            they'd get for having such high CHA). The cheapest place i've found to get the platinum
            bars is in the Foreign Quarter in Neriak on the Ogre/Troll side at a store called Shinie
            Things. She usually sells the bars for 108 (with a cha of 55 or so) which is generally
            much cheaper than other jewelry stores from my experience. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And thusly I end my diatribe. Best of luck, young Knights
            of Shadow, A full suit of Darkforge (best earned, not bought) is truly an honor amongst
            our class. Wear it well.</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></p>
