          <tr>
            <td valign="top">Crushbone is the home of the Crushbone orcs, found throughout Faydwer.
            Close to Crushbone is an orc camp, filled with level 2 orc pawns to level 8 centurions,
            oracles, and shamans. The entrance to Crushbone is guarded by several centurions, all
            around level 8 - 10. <p>Inside Crushbone, there are several more centurions from levels 6
            - 8, or pawns of level 2 at the entrance. Once you wind through the short tunnel, you'll
            get a good glimpse of Crushbone. If you head left, you'll go to the slaver camp. Turn
            right and you head to the castle and slaver pits. Dead ahead is trainer hill.</p>
            <p>If you turn left, you'll have to cross a bridge guarded by low level centurions and
            pawns. Once you pass the bridge and cross a few rocks, you'll come down a hill with a fire
            pit and building beyond it on your right and caves on your left. There is nothing in the
            fire pit (except fire) but in the building there is a lone orc slaver of level 8 or 9
            guarding two dwarven smiths and an elven priest (used in the screaming mace quest). If you
            head left, beside the building, you'll find a small passage that is guarded by pawns,
            centurions, or legionnaires of level 12. If you continue through the passage, you'll find
            more low level orcs guarding the other end.</p>
            <p>If you go into the slaver caves, you'll find 4 or 5 slaves (dwarves, wood elves, or
            high elves) that for some reason will heal any hurt orc (but never attack you unless
            attacked or you are kos to them - slaves are only level 4 or 5). Three slavers spawn in
            the cave, all about level 10. Occasionally, slavers carry keys that will free a certain
            slave (corresponding keys to slaves at bottom). Rondo Durnfire, a level 14 dwarven
            (warrior I assume) that only carries his tongue (used in rogue quest in kaladim). Also
            spawning in here is a wood elf slave named kelynn that attacks you if you attack an orc,
            and gives bad faction with the scouts of tunare if you attack. </p>
            <p>Heading past the slaver caves will take you to a slaver camp (which the exit of the
            above mentioned passage leads too also) which has a fire in the center, several small
            tents that house pawns, centurions, or legionnaires, and one large tent that will hold one
            orc at each exit.</p>
            <p>If you turn right from the entrance and go to the left of a wall near the turn, you'll
            end up in the slaver pits. They house several more slaves as well as 2 slavers, 3
            centurions or 2 centurions and 1 legionnaire. The Orc Taskmaster spawns instead of one
            centurion/legionnaire on occasion, and has a leather whip as his drop. He also rarely
            drops an earring which can be turned in to the dwarven smith or worn(armor class 2).
            Behind the pits is Retlon Brenclog, a gnomish magician. He hits for up to 32dmg, has a
            level 15 (although weak) pet, and has a 50dmg dd spell. He can be freed with a key, or
            &quot;freed&quot; meaning someone pulled him out of his hole.</p>
            <p>If you head straight from the entrance and jump up the small ridge and head up, you'll
            find yourself on trainer hill. Up to 4 centurions spawn here, and rarely the orc trainer
            does. He's a level 10 or so mob that carries the shiny brass shield on occasion. It
            fetches up to 30pp on rodcet nife, and is used in a quest (not screaming mace but same
            dwarven smith).</p>
            <p>If you decided to turn right at the entrance (or continue from slaver caves past
            slaver) you'll reach the castle. The wall next to it is popular for level 8 - 12 people,
            as it allows one to pull a higher level orc and take him out there. The first bridge over
            the moat is guarded by two orcs, either pawns, centurions, or legionnaires. The entrance
            to the castle also has two of the same type of orcs guarding it. The door to the castle
            will have two orcs directly inside, either centurions or legionnaires. Directly to the
            left of the door are two more centurions or legionnaires. Past all of this, you get to the
            throne room - you will die very quickly if you walk in here alone when all the orcs are
            spawned unless level 24+ (non agggro then).</p>
            <p>The two sides of the wall leading to the throne room are guarded by a pair of
            legionnaires. A table is ahead and to the left, with an orc oracle always behind it. If
            you face the throne from the table, you'll see two legionnaires or emissaries on either
            wall to your left and right, with four legionnaires or emissaries at the benches in front
            of the throne. To the left of the throne is an oracle, and to the right is a level 15
            emissary or legionnaire. The throne is guarded by Lord Darish, with a level 15 or 16
            legionnaire or emissary as his place holder.</p>
            <p>Behind the throne is a small passageway that leads to the most dangerous part - the
            tower. Along the steps the royal guard spawns. He's a level 16 or 17 rogue that will
            backstab for up to 89 and pierce for up to 32. He always carries one or two bronze
            weapons. Past him is the actual tower. The Prophet spawns in the front of this small room,
            with a level 16 orc oracle as his place holder. Right behind him Emperor Crushbone will
            spawn, a level 18 legionnaire-type orc that has a few extra moves with more hp and hits a
            lot harder. To his right is the most dangerous of all, Ambassador DVinn, a level 18 - 21
            dark elf (warrior I assume, no backstab although some insist he is a rogue) or an orc
            centurion as his place holder. Note: DVinn is much tougher than his level, like Dorn Brynn
            in nro or Kizdean Gix in west commons. More about these mobs are found below.</p>
            <p>Mobs:</p>
            <p>Orc pawn: Level 2 orc that poses no threat. Loot includes small change, and the
            occasional rusty item, container, or food.</p>
            <p>Orc centurion: The most common orc, they vary from level 4 to 10. Not usually
            dangerous, but deadly in groups to low levels. Loot includes small change, rusty weapons,
            and cb belts.</p>
            <p>Orc legionnaire: The warrior of the orcs, they are the big brothers of centurions. Most
            are level 12, except for the few that spawn near the throne that go up to level 16. Loot
            includes up to 4gp, rusty weapons, cloth armor, legionnaire bracers and pads.</p>
            <p>Orc emissary: Level 15 or 16 mobs, they are about 25% more powerful than orc
            legionnaires. Emissaries only spawn near or in the castle, and always have a rusty spear
            which they can hit for 32 with. Loot includes up to 4gp, rusty spear, cloth armor, and
            legionnaire pads.</p>
            <p>Orc oracle: The toughest common mob in Crushbone, they hit like legionnaires but have
            shaman spells on top. They include a 66dmg poison dot, a disease dot, an 80dmg cold based
            spell, drowsy and walking sleep (attack speed/speed slowers) and a 30 point heal spell.
            Loot inclues up to 4gp, cloth or sometimes rawhide armor.</p>
            <p>Orc Trainer: Level 8 to 10 rare spawn on trainer hill that drops the shiny brass shield
            on occasion. Other loot includes small change and cloth armor.</p>
            <p>Orc Taskmaster: Found in the slaver pits, this level 15 or 16 mob hits hard and quick
            with his leather whip that he always drops. Also rarely drops an ac2 earring that can be
            turned in to the dwarven smith for experience. Other loot includes cloth armor and small
            coins.</p>
            <p>Lord Darish: He can be found guarding the throne in the throne room and is level 14 or
            15. He carries the dwarven axe (6/26) which sells for 4pp to vendors. He also carries a
            dwarven two handed axe(14/43) from time to time. Darish is tougher than his level and hits
            for up to 30. Loot includes up to 8gp, cloth armor and rusty weapons.</p>
            <p>Retlon Brenclog: Level 15 or 16 gnomish magician that hits for 32dmg, has a 50dmg dd
            spell, and 80dmg aoe spell. His pet is 14 or 15, but rather weak. Both carry an 8dmg
            shield, making him very hard for a melee class. Faction hits include bad eldritch
            collective (or good if you free him).</p>
            <p>Orc Warlord: Level 14 orc is a very rare spawn that appears to the left of the first
            bridge or right under the tower to the right of the first bridge . He has a tendency to
            run for other orcs (and into walls, pathing problem I believe) making him even more
            dangerous. Loot includes up to 1pp, legionnaire pads, rusty weapons, and the bracers of
            battle - used in the screaming mace quest they fetch 60pp on rodcet nife in greater
            faydark.</p>
            <p>Royal Guard: Powerful rogues that guard Emperor Crushbone. They are level 16 or so, and
            hit very hard very fast. Loot includes up to 1pp, one or two bronze weapons, words, runes,
            and rawhide armor.</p>
            <p>Emperor Crushbone: The most powerful orc, he hits for up to 38dmg as well as kicks and
            bashes. Loot includes the occasional bronze weapon, up to 1pp, and the dwarven ringmail
            tunic used in the screaming mace quest.</p>
            <p>The Prophet: The most powerful oracle, he is a level 16 or 17 version of an oracle that
            is resisted less and hits for more. Loot includes a blue orc head, spellbook, note (all
            used in paladin quest) change and a rusty weapon.</p>
            <p>Ambassador DVinn: A dark elf ambassador from the neriak brotherhood of level 18 to 21,
            he is very very scary. He hits for up to 44dmg about every 1.5 seconds and stuns often
            with bashes. He is not soloable by a melee until level 30 or pure caster at 20. He carries
            the dragoon dirk about every 6 spawns (6/23 +3sv magic +2dex) and up to 2pp. DVinn's black
            heart is also dropped and used in a paladin quest.</p>
