Hey guys :)  Well I don't do this often but I'm going to do it now.  The bard epic quest item, the singing short sword, needs some serious work... It isn't that this weapon isn't as good as bards were expecting it is that the sword actually reduces the effectiveness of bards, so even if it is obtained it won't be used.<br><br>I would like to see everyone support the threads on the official boards that are going on about this problem.  One of the main ones is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019941.html">here</a>, and another big one is right <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022085.html">here</a>.<br><br>For anyone that goes and supports these threads, I thank you... for the rest of you, please reconsider.... your musician friends will love you for it =)
