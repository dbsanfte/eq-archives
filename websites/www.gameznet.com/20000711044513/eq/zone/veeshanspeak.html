Corpse loss is a very realistic possiblity and entering without being equipped and level 60 is akin to suicide.  It is located in the Sykfire Mountains.  The only way into the zone is via a hard quest involving killing at least one dragon.            <br>     
<br>       The zone contains dragon like creatures - Dragons, Wurms, Drakes, etc....  I recieved this strategy guide from a test server player after the player wipe.  What follows is the guide in its entirety.  Please note that this is a cut and paste (adding some html) of the post made by Steve / Cid on the ign boards and there are oppinions in there may be oppinions expressed that do not reflect this oppinions of Gameznet / EQ'Lizer or any of its affiliates <br><br>

  Veeshan's Peak 101: 
<br><br>
When you zone in your safe on the edge of a small platform. Nothing wanders to this platform. 
<br>
The first wandering mob: 
<br>
Guardian Wurm 
60th Level Warrior 
Hits for 650+ and uses the high level warrior ablities. 
Respawns in 2 mins 
<br>
On the left and right of the bridge is a mob that cons blue at 60. Stay away from them and they won't argo. 

They way to do this zone is to cut to the named dragons and kill them before the Guardian Wurm respawns. 

Once the first Wurm is killed you can then move up a bit and attack the first named dragon. 
<br><br>
Silverwing 
65 Enchanter Dragon 
Hits for 730 
Casts all Enchanter spells 
Casts long lasting charms on PCs 
<br><br>
Silverwing is a super looking dragon, but she can be taken down without much trouble by a good group of 30+ people. 

After you kill a named dragon you can then rest in that dragon's spot and move on to the next when your done. 

Note: You can't cast any kind of gate spells well in VP. the only way out is through the exit which is a good long way from the ent. 
<br><br>

I post this with a HEARTY middle finger up Butler + Brad's Shared Ass. And any copy/reproduction of this note, please include this part. 
<br><br>
Important: Once you zone in, the only way out is 1. Death, or 2. Through at VERY LEAST 3 dragons that make nagafen look like a froglok shin knight. 
<br><br>
Right when you zone into VP's, group up to the left of the entry point. It's about the only safe spot in the zone. Take your time and group up and prep here. When you move from here, there really isn't turning back, unless you die. 
<br><br>
At the safe zone in point, I'd highly recommend a shaman using Vision to follow the wurm's around. Learn the pathing patterns and timing of the wurms and ESPECIALLY the named Dragons. The two of Primary concern are SilverWing as previously mentioned, and Hoskar, who's the meaner of the two. 
<br><br>
Your absolute worst nightmare is having to fight the two dragons at once, so make absolutelyu sure, when you fight one, the other one is far away. 
<br><br>
As previously stated, the mobs here spawn almost instaneously. Wurm die, wurm pop. 
The dragons however do take a long spawn cycle, and have very very good loot. 
<br><br>
The optimal attack plan we found, was to tackle the 1st wurm as he come across the bridge toward the entry point. 
<br><br>
Then walk dead center past the 2 raptors. They have low aggro radiuses, so don't waste time fighting them, cause if you do, the prevuiyd wurm will be quickly upon you. 
<br><br>
This corridor and the subsquent large ramp heading up is the optimal place to fight your 1st dragon. Whether it be Silverwing or Hoskar. 
<br><br>
Hopefully at this point you have a dedicated shaman trailing one of the dragons with vision. You need to know where they are!!!! 
<br><br>
Once you kill one of the dragons, I'd recommend holding your ground kill the inc wurms, and ambush the other dragon on his way to you. 
<br><br>
At this point, you can move up the ramp and past the bridge. If you head straight, it splits, to the left is a safe area, with no spawns or mobs. This is a FANTASTIC place to keep a cleric or something logged here permanently. Cause in future runs in VP, if you can drag corpses to here for res'ing, and regroup here, it's far far simpler to pull the dragons solo to this point to pulverize. So... utilize this point so your 2nd trip and beyond to VP are easier. 
<br><br>
Ok to proceed further. Remeber that bridge after the ramp. Instead of heading straight and left to the safe point. Follow the right ledge RIGHT after the bridge further up. 
<br><br>
You will encounter a few more Wurms, which should be cake walk for you now. 
<br><br>
The next room should be 6 raptors guarding a room with a few statues. The raptors can probably be pulled solo, or at no more than 3 at a time. They aren't that hard. 
<br><br>
You will mosey on further, usual stuff, until a setup of 2 raps+2drakes, and maybe 2 wandering wurms. This ought to be a tricky fight, but easire than the dragons. 
<br><br>
Note: Might be worth tryinng some enchanter tricks on the raptors, I believe they were charmable at a certain point, but might've been changed. Definitely worth charming one of them beasts to help you out. 
<br><br>
If I remeber correctly, silverwing+hoskar are the only wandering "dragon"s in VP. The others are all behind giant double doors. 
<br><br>
The Dragon that guards the portal out, Nexar? blue guy, Breathes nasty Acid attack, and is also guarded by a blue drake, and possible wandering wurm. not an easy fight. 
<br><br>
There are a few more dragons in there, but the toughest mofo of them all is called Phara Dar. 
He is black+purple with kinda unicorn type of horns. But more importantly, he has an AoE mez. I remeber fighting him, and having the entire group mez'd stunned. oh he had a 800-1200 dmg too. I think out of 30 or so people, only one person actually got through his stun and landed a few hits on him.
