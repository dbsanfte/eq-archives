            <td>If there is one class in Everquest that can do it all it is certainly the druid.
            Druids are the masters of nature and certainly have no match in their domain. However they
            are also adept adventurer's indoors as well in that they can fill many different roles in
            a party. If your idea of a good time is being a jack of all trades then a druid is the
            class for you.<br>
            <br>
            To illustrate what I mean here let's look at various classes and their strengths and
            compare them to a druid:<br>
            <br>
            <a href="cleric.html">Clerics</a> are great role players. Their strengths are in their
            buffing spells, their ability to fight undead and their ability to heal. They also have
            the unique ability to be able to ressurect dead players. Druids can not ressurect and do
            not get specialist spells versus undead. They do however get pretty good buffing spells
            and healing spells. Generally druids get the same healing spells as a cleric only one
            circle later. They do not however get the complete heal spell that is cleric specific. <br>
            <br>
            <a href="wizard.html">Wizards</a> are powerful casters whose mastery is in dishing damage.
            Wizards also have great teleport and group teleport spells up to and including
            teleportation into other planes. While no class can match a wizard in mana:damage
            efficiency druids can go toe to toe with just about every other class in the game. Other
            classes will trade positions from time to time as they get new and more powerful spells
            however druids never fall too far behind.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="ranger.html">Rangers</a> are the other nature loving class in the game. Rangers
            are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 druid. They also have the forage and tracking skills. Druids get
            these same skills only at later levels. This means that druids will not have to worry
            about spending money on food or water or returning to town as a neccessity to buy these
            products. It also means that druids will have a leg up over every class other than rangers
            when it comes to tracking down outdoor animals. Likewise animals are not naturally
            agressive to druids. That wolf that will attack most other classes will leave you alone.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="magician.html">Magicians</a> specialize in their pets and their ability to summon
            things such as food, water and bandages. They also have good damage shields which will
            punish the monster for hitting a player as well as a ward series of spells versus summoned
            beasts(elements). Druids get damage shields that can rival those of a magician. They can
            also charm animals and use them as pets. Druids can forage which renders summoned food and
            drink useless. Summoned food and drink will dissapear when you log out. Foraged food will
            not. Magicians summon spells are actually spells inherited from druids. Druids get these
            same ward summoned spells a couple circles earlier than magicians and at the same level
            range that clerics get their ward undead spells.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="enchanter.html">Enchanters</a> specialize in illusion and charm spells. Druids
            are never able to touch the former but the latter is acquired for taming animals. This
            allows druids to tame those mighty <a href="file://E:\gameznet\eq\class\druid.html/../beastiary/griffon.html">griffons</a> and
            use them to do your dirty work for you.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="necromancer.html">Necromancers</a> have two main areas of expertise. One is their
            mastery of undead and the other is their Damage over Time(DoT) spells. Druids have no
            mastery over undead however they do have a mastery over summoned beasts. There are many
            less summoned monsters in the world however druids can quickly dispose of those that
            exist. Druids have powerful DoT spells in the form of the stinging swarm line of spells.
            These will eat away at monsters over a period of time.<br>
            <br>
            On the equipment side of things druids are somewhere between a mage-type class and a
            priest class. They can wear up to leather type armor but cannot wear metal armor. They can
            wear both <a href="file://E:\gameznet\eq\class\druid.html/../equipment/lupinearmor.html">lupine</a>
            and <a href="file://E:\gameznet\eq\class\druid.html/../equipment/bonearmor.html">bone</a>
            armor however which is in many players eyes better than the much ballyhooed <a href="file://E:\gameznet\eq\class\druid.html/../equipment/plate.html">platemail</a>.
            Weapons wise they have a have a big leg up on mage types class and a small bonus with
            regards to other priest classes. They can use one or two handed blunt weapons and also can
            use scimitars. This may not seem like a big bonus at lower levels however there are
            several higher level magic scimitars that druids will be able to take advantage of
            including a rumored druid only scimitar.<br>
            <br>
            That all having been said you will probably be wondering why druids are stronger outdoors
            than indoors? Several of the druids most popular spells are outdoor only. For example you
            will not be able to conjure lightning indoors. Also you will not be able to use spirit of
            the wolf(a very popular travel spell) indoors. You will not be able to cast invisibility
            until higher levels as your level 5 camoflauge spell will not work in indoor zones. The
            only real disadvantage here is that outdoor monsters give 25% less experience than their
            indoor counterparts and for good reason. One of the more popular druid tactics is what is
            known as kiting. The druid will use spirit of the wolf to outrun their prey while their
            stinging swarm line of spells will slowly eat away at the beast until it is dead. It is a
            low risk tactic which is very cheesy yet still very effective.<br>
            <br>
            Things will be slow going in the early levels until you get meditate at level 8. Once you
            get meditate however things will really begin rolling. At level 15 you will gain the
            ability to dodge which will help you avoid punishment. It maxes at a rather low level
            though and will not be nearly as effective as the dodging ability of meelee classes. <br>
            <br>
            At level 20 you get the ability to track which is a major addition. Tracking will allow
            you to find those rare NPC's in the large outdoor zones who carry those rare and powerful
            magic items such as <a href="../equipment/mroonsdoll.html">Mroon's Doll</a>. It will also
            allow you to keep track of monsters in dungeons. For example if you are waiting for the
            emporer to spawn but don't want to wander into his anti camp radius to find out you can
            use tracking to check to see if he's on your scope. When he pops then you go kill him.<br>
            <br>
            At level 30 you gain the ability to specialize in a certain field of magic. This will
            allow you to be most effective in one field say for example conjuration or evocation. <br>
            <br>
            The most important thing about playing a druid is to play to your classes strengths. Use
            your DoT spells, take advantage of your teleport spells, use your thorns on your party
            members. You can play the role of a cleric, wizard, magician, necromancer or ranger
            depending on the situation. You are a welcome addition to any party because you can fill
            so many roles. <br>
            <br>
            So you think you want to be a druid but don't know which race you should choose? The race
            most fit to be a druid would be the <a href="../race/woodelf.html">wood elves</a> with <a href="../race/halfling.html">halflings</a> coming in a close second. You really can't lose
            with either of these choices. Wood elves have slightly better statistics for being a druid
            but their city can be confusing and a wrong turn can result in death at lower levels(its a
            long fall from the &quot;ewok village&quot;). The halflings newbie zone(<a href="../zone/mistythicket.html">misty thicket</a>) is much less crowded and probably a
            better overall zone that <a href="../zone/greaterfay.html">greater faydark</a> which the
            wood elves must share with the <a href="../race/highelf.html">high elves</a>. Misty
            thicket is also quite a bit less confusing. The only saving grace of greater faydark is
            the fact that <a href="../zone/crushbone.html">Crushbone</a> is only a short distance from
            the wood elf village. Crushbone is an excellent dungeon for young druids as all of the
            magical items found there with the exception of the dwarven ringmail are great druid
            items. <br>
            <br>
            What it all boils down to is that druids are a fine class. They can do a little bit of
            everything which will keep them from becoming boring. They can fill in as a tank at lower
            levels when their fighting skills are not too far behind those of a meelee classes and can
            fill in several different caster roles at the higher levels. Perhaps most importantly
            their group travel spells can save a parties life when things get hairy at higher levels.
            Druids truly are one of the finest classes in the game.<p>DRU</td>
