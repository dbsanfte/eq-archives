            <td valign="top">Compliments of Brendan. <a href="mailto:webmaster@gameznet.com">Email</a>
            Additional info. Level 27 song by Pentar.<p>1- Chant of Battle - Adds DEX and STR to
            everyone in your party<br>
            Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: A great song. The STR bonus is pretty useless at low levels, since you don't get
            a damage bonus for STR yet, and it's unlikely you will be overloaded at the early levels.
            The DEX bonus might save you from getting hit a couple times, which is what it's mainly
            useful for. </p>
            <p>2- Chords of Dissonance - AE (Area Effect) damage to non party members.<br>
            Uses a stringed instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: I found this song to be pretty useless. Most of the low-level areas have mobs
            that are too close together to use this safely. If you are going to use it, make sure that
            the mob you are fighting is the only one nearby, or you'll get ganged really quickly. Be
            VERY careful when there are wandering guards nearby, because this will make them attack
            you. If you don't have much money, I wouldn't worry about buying this song. </p>
            <p>3- Jaxan`s Jig o` Vigor - Increases STA regen rate for all party members.<br>
            Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: Not too useful at lower levels, except for swimming long distances. Until you
            get Selo's at 5, it might be useful to sing when running from a mob, because you'll be
            able to jump more often with the extra stamina. At high levels, you might use this when
            your party is in a long fight, but there are probably more useful things you will be
            singing. Don't bother using the drum, singing it gives you more than enough STA. Sometimes
            a useful song, but I'd buy armor before it. </p>
            <p>4- Lyssa`s Locating Lyric - Locates the targeted person's corpse.<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: A pretty handy spell. To use it, select the person who's corpse you want to
            find, and start singing. The song will point you in the direction of the corpse. It's a
            bit tricky to see if someone is following you, so you might want to switch to the 3rd
            person view. If you are finding your own corpse, juggle between this and Selos(5) so you
            get there faster. Some people will charge for this, I never do, just assuming that the
            person I helped might be around to save me sometime. </p>
            <p>5- Selo`s Accelerando - Speeds your party's movement rate and decreases STA loss.<br>
            Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: One of the bard's best songs. By itself, without a drum, it will let you go
            about as fast as Spirit of the Wolf (aka SOW). With a drum you can easily outpace anyone
            with SOW. This should save your skin frequently in outdoor areas, because it will let you
            outrun virtually any moster in the game (Aviak Egrets can outrun you if you don't use a
            drum). This song doesn't work indoors, so like druids I tend to stick to the outdoor zones
            and dungeons. If you are overloaded and running, juggle this and Chant(1) to get speed and
            an STR bonus at the same time; it should speed you up considerably. </p>
            <p>6- Hymn of Restoration - Increses HP regeneration.<br>
            Uses a stringed instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: Another of the bard's best songs. Until you get better songs, you should be
            juggling this with Chant(1), since it will help you last longer in battles. Investing in a
            stringed instrument is a good idea, since you will heal much more quickly with it. You can
            outheal most Poison and Disease spells with this, which is helpful if you don't have a
            party member who can cure those effects. I soloed many plague rats, since i didn't have to
            worry about not being able to regenerate health once i was diseased. You can make friends
            with this song as well - If you are at a dungeon entrance healing yourself, offer to group
            with other people and heal them. Every six levels your healing power goes up by 2 points.
            (at 12, 18, 24, etc) </p>
            <p>7- Jonthan's Whistling Warsong - Increases your STR, AC, and Attack Speed<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: A good soloing song, you might end up using this well into your 20s (should you
            still be soloing at that point). Like Chant(1), the STR bonus is not very useful at lower
            levels. The AC boost is useful, but the real benefit of this song is that it speeds up
            your Attack Speed by 15 percent or so. It's tough to notice, but it is there. At this
            point, you might be able to juggle 3 songs pretty well and should be juggling Chant(1) and
            Hymn(6) with it. </p>
            <p>8- Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament - Will Lull/Soothe the targeted mob.<br>
            Uses the Singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: A good song, it stops the targeted monster from ganging on you if you attack on
            of it's friends. Verant recently neutered this song a bit, and the duration is now very
            short. It's useful for pulling a monster from a camp without the rest coming along for the
            ride. In a camp of three monsters, you should be able to keep 2 lulled with this, while a
            party member pulls the third one away to a safe distance. If the mob resists, then it and
            all it's pals will come after you. </p>
            <p>9- Elemental Rhythms - Increases party member's Fire, Cold, and Magic resitances.<br>
            Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: I find most of the Rythms series of songs to be pretty useless, and haven't
            noticed much of a difference in my ability to resist. At one point the resistances were
            broken, but they are working now. I'd buy a piece of banded armor instead of this song,
            and buy it at a later point (when you have lots of cash). </p>
            <p>10- Anthem de Arms - Increases party member's STR and Attack Speed<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: Your party will love this song, especially if you have a lot of tanks. It will
            increase STR (which is again not very useful until the higher levels); the real bonus is
            that it speeds your party's attack rate by about 15 percent. It will stack with
            Warsong(7), making it good for soloing, but not with Chant(1). </p>
            <p>11- Cinda's Charismatic Carillon - Adds the targeted NPCs faction to you.<br>
            Uses a wind instrument, can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: A useful song. If you cast it on an NPC vendor you can frequently get better
            prices (especially if they view you dubiously). Also useful for getting quests out of NPCs
            that view you indifferently (this will usually raise you to amiably). </p>
            <p>12- Brusco`s Boastful Bellow - Does DD to the target.<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: A very useful song at lower levels, it can be compared to a warrior's Kick
            attack, in that you will be able to do additional damage per round. This is not a
            continuous song, you need to keep restarting it; as soon as the monster is hit by it, stop
            the song and sing it again - the extra time it takes for the song to stop is wasted time.
            You can use this song to kite monsters, although it takes a long time, although in a close
            fight, getting some distance with Selos(5) then bellowing while you are running away can
            be the difference between zoning and winning. You might want to juggle this song with
            Warsong(7). </p>
            <p>13- Purifying Rhythms - Increases party member's Poison, Disease, and Magic resitances.<br>
            Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: The second song in the Rhythms series. If you liked Elemental(9) then you'll
            like this song. It might stack with Elemental(9), but I can't remember for sure (that
            should show you how often i use it). </p>
            <p>14- Lyssa's Cataloging Libretto - Identifies an item that you are holding.<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: Broken right now, as there is nothing to identify. Supposedly at some point it
            will identify Lore that is associated with an item. Save your money on this one until
            there are items to identify. </p>
            <p>15- Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby - AE song that will put mobs to sleep for a short time<br>
            Uses a stringed instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: Sometimes useful, this song will put mobs in range to &quot;sleep&quot; so they
            don't attack you. It will also sometimes clear the monster's &quot;s-list&quot;, which is
            it's memory of who attacked it. I've found it useful on occasions, and too dangerous (like
            all AE songs) on others. Attacking the mob (or DoT damage) will wake it up. I've found
            that I have to sing this near continuously and can't juggle other songs with it. </p>
            <p>16- Tarew`s Aquatic Ayre - Gives underwater breathing to all party members.<br>
            Uses the wind skill, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: Breathing underwater is pretty fun, and can be useful for when your party wants
            to kill pirannas or aqua goblins. Since is the first wind song you are will get, you can
            use it to build up your wind skill (which you will want for Clouding(19)). This song works
            fine without a wind instrument; it's range might be increased with one but I haven't been
            able to notice a difference. </p>
            <p>17- Guardian Rhythms - Increases party member's Magic resitance and AC.<br>
            Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: The last in the Rhythms series. You can juggle this with Elemental(9) but not
            Purifying(13) for a big Magic resitance boost. There is supposed to be a Spell Shield
            (absorb damage) effect as well, but it does not work. </p>
            <p>18- Denon`s Disruptive Discord - AE song that does DoT (Damage over Time).<br>
            Uses a brass instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: A good song in outdoor areas, carrying the same problems as other AE spells. In
            safe areas, it's better to use this than Bellow(12), as it will do more damage. It's the
            first brass song, so find a safe place (the Arena is good) where you can start singing and
            walk away from the keyboard for a few hours. </p>
            <p>19- Shauri`s Sonorous Clouding Grants your party invisibility.<br>
            Uses a wind instrument, it <u>cannot</u> be sung.<br>
            Analysis: The best song to go pull your corpse out with. Always keep a flute and a drum in
            the bank, so you can get them out to help retrieve your corpse. The range is not far, so
            if you are going to invis your party, they must all be near to you. Not very useful when
            your party is moving, but good when you are resting/medding and don't want someone to drop
            a train on you. In EQ, invisibility doesn't make you invisible to other monsters, it
            merely makes them view you with indifference. Monsters that you have already annoyed will
            not be effected, and will see right through the invisibility. </p>
            <p>20- Largo`s Melodic Binding - AE song that lowers non party member's Attack Speed and
            AC.<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: This song mixes very well with Discord(18) and Anthem(10). It's an AE song, so
            caution must be used, but the combination of slower NPC attack speed (about 10 percent)
            and the party speedup of Anthem is pretty nice. </p>
            <p>21- Melanie's Mellifluous Motion - Will randomly teleport all party members.<br>
            Uses a wind instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: This song is pretty useless. If you are in a small room it's fun, as you will
            just pop up all over the room, but it's not much more useful than that. It's similar to
            the Shadow Step spell, but why teleport when you can outrun with Selos(5)? </p>
            <p>22- Alenias Disenchanting Melody - Unknown effect<br>
            Uses a stringed instrument, <u>cannot</u> be sung.<br>
            Analysis: I haven't met anyone who has figured out what this song does yet. It doesn't
            cancel magic and it puts an icon in your effects list, although it is unclear why. It
            doesn't protect against charm, DoT, or DD spells, which leads me to believe it's broken. </p>
            <p>23- Selo's Consonant Chain - Lowers the target's Attack Speed and Movement Speed.<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: A great song for use in fighting and in catching runners. The slowdown in attack
            speed is useful when you can't use Binding(20), and can be used the same way. The other
            benefit is that it slows down the target's movement speed, which makes it hard for them to
            run away (interestingly, you can completely stop their movement and they won't attack,
            unlike root). As well, it can be used to kite to an extent, although it tends to be
            resisted fairly frequently.<br>
            <br>
            24- Lyssa's Veracious Concord<br>
            Give party members Ultravision (and see invisible)<br>
            Uses a wind instrument, can also be sung.<br>
            Analysis: Not too exciting for half elves or elves, but the holy grail for<br>
            humans. Ultravision is even better than infravision, so it's fun to impress your human
            party members with; somewhat useless past it's novelty as a party trick tho, as it's a
            drag to keep people in range. Useful for killing the Froglok Warden (since he can fight
            while invisible) when you don't have a spellcaster to cast see invisible on you. This song
            will break Serpent Sight, in the same way that Selo's Accelerando breaks Spirit of the
            Wolf. You also cannot juggle this with Shauri's Sonorous Clouding, so forget about being
            able to see invis and be invis at the same time.<br>
            <br>
            25- Psalm of Warmth<br>
            Gives party members +35 Cold Resist, a couple AC, and a damage shield<br>
            Uses the singing skill.<br>
            Analysis: A great song, especially when your party is fighting multiple mobs at once. The
            cold resistance might be useful against ice shock and the like, but casters seem to always
            cast force strike on me instead. You get a couple AC from the song, nothing worthwhile
            really. The real plus is the damage shield. At level 25, it will do 5 dmg everytime a mob
            hits you or a party member, which makes it a great replacement for bellow (should you
            still be using it), since most mobs at this point have double attack and hit frequently.<br>

            26- Angstlichs Appalling Screech<br>
            AE fear song<br>
            Uses a brass instument, can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: A song to look forward to. The AE radius of this song is very<br>
            small, probably limited to things you can hit or that can hit you (physically, not with
            spells). There are 2 uses for this song. The first being as an escape tool - just sing the
            song when your party is in trouble, when the mobs run away you will have a few seconds to
            get a head start running in the other direction. The second use is to fear-kite - juggle
            screech with chain [23] and walk behind the mob, smacking it as it runs away. This song
            seems harder to resist than many others, making it effective even when sung.<br>

            Level 27: Solon's Song of the Sirens<br>
            Effect: Target Charm<br>
            Wind instruments but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
            Analysis: As the song suggests, it's a targetted charm-song.&nbsp; Works<br>
            rather well and charms a target for around 10 seconds.<br>
            during this time, the taget will obey pet commands and thus<br>
            is effective for using the target to attack his friends, or<br>
            simply making him sit down and get out of your hair.&nbsp; The<br>
            song is probably more effective with a wind instrument,<br>
            causing the duration of the charm to last longer and the<br>
            resistances to be lower.<br>
