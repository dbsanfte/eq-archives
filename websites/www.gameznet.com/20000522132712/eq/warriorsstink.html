            <td valign="top">Warrior's STINK.<br>
            <br>
            Okay I've sat down and written this little thingie over the past few weeks, in places it
            repeats itself, you may even find it<br>
            incoherant in places. And hell I'm to lazy to load it up in a real word processor to run a
            spell check (go notepad!). But<br>
            take it as it is, I think it still has something important to say:<br>
            <br>
            I play a level 46 troll warrior in EverQuest. In most every game I play I'm always a
            warrior and fairly happy with the role<br>
            and abilities warriors are given in most games, wether it be an online or offline game.
            Now when I was making my troll<br>
            warrior I did a little research and heard things like this:<br>
            <br>
            - Warriors get more hitpoints than any other class.<br>
            - Warriors at high levels do more damage than any other melee class.<br>
            - Warriors have the best selection of magic and mundane weapons and armor.<br>
            - Warriors are the most skilled at weapon-to-weapon combat.<br>
            <br>
            Now some of these are things people take for granted about the sterotypical role of a
            warrior others are conclusions that can<br>
            be made after reading comments made by Verant about warriors (wish I'd cliped the quotes
            to put here).<br>
            <br>
            So for the first few levels I was pretty happy with the warrior, with a trolls
            regeneration you can quickly get out of the<br>
            lower levels. My first observation of an imbalance was that all other melee classes were
            advancing just as fast in weapon<br>
            skills, with 5 additional points of offense and weapon skill each level. So that a level
            10 Shadow Knight and a level 10<br>
            Warrior would both have the same weapon and offense skills (assuming they're using the
            same type of weapon). So I'm saying<br>
            to myself what's the point of a warrior? Our melee skills are not outshining anyone.<br>
            <br>
            So life goes on, now I'm around level 20 or so and still I haven't found any equipment
            that puts warriors above others, our<br>
            skills are still on par with anyone else. So what about the duel wield, double attack
            issue? Well by this level rangers get<br>
            them both, monks get them both (with a higher skill level than any class), thieves get
            them both. And so well warriors get<br>
            them both. So again I begin to question the point of warriors.<br>
            <br>
            So now I start comparing hitpoints. Well rangers don't have as many hitpoints.. but they
            can buff themselves and heal<br>
            themselves.. monks don't have as many hitpoints but they can mend themselves (and don't
            tell me, oh but if it fails they get<br>
            hurt bad, cuz I group regularly with a monk since level 37 and I have yet to see him fail
            a mend)... ShadowKnights don't have<br>
            as many hitpoints but they have HP drains... Paladin's don't have as many hitpoints but
            they can buff, heal and lay hands..<br>
            So in the end I actually end up having LESS hitpoints than most any other melee class
            because after buffs and considering<br>
            healing and life drains the other melee classes (except rogues) have more HP than me. But
            being a troll with a high stanima<br>
            I get a few extra hitpoints here and there which add up to around 150 more HP over other
            melee classes (at level 46 mind<br>
            you). At level 46 this accounts for maybe two additional hits from a monster worth XP. So
            a warrior's benefit is not in<br>
            it's hitpoints.<br>
            <br>
            So what about armor, they can wear most anything right, so they should have extra high AC?
            Well not quiet, even tho rangers<br>
            can't wear plate, they can wear most magical versions of it, and they have AC buffs.
            Paladins, ShadowKnights, Bards can all<br>
            wear plate also (man the acoustics of playing an instrument in full platemail must be
            odd). And of course these classes ALSO<br>
            have AC buffs! Then there are monks, well they can't wear much armor.. but the lighter
            they are the more AC they get! So<br>
            again I'm left out saying, well what's a warrior good for?<br>
            <br>
            So someone tells me, well most melee classes skills cap at level 30 and warriors keep on
            going. Well level 30 rolls around,<br>
            and other melee classes keep right up with me. So maybe it's level 35 they cap, nope. Well
            maybe they cap at level 40 and<br>
            warriors can goto above 200. Well level 40 rolls around and yes other melee classes do cap
            at 200, well warriors do ALSO!<br>
            UGH. I've held out so long waiting for some benefit of warriors to shine through, kept
            getting told at higher levels you<br>
            really shine! Well I'm at the higher levels and if anything WARRIORS are the WORST melee
            class beyond level 40 (gauging my<br>
            experience with grouping with high level Rangers, Monks and ShadowKnights). In fact Monks
            don't cap at 40! They can go<br>
            above 200! But my Parry, Riposte, Pierce, 1h Slash, 2h slash, taunt, bash, ALL of them
            maxed at 200!<br>
            <br>
            So then there is the allure of the Executioner's Axe. A warrior's dream weapon, the only
            warrior only weapon known of (well<br>
            recently found a warrior only shield/weapon combo item but it ain't a dream weapon by far)
            and it is a good item (assuming<br>
            haste goes off often enough). But you can't get it till you are in your 40's, the monster
            with it rarely has it, rarely<br>
            spawns, is deep in a dungeon and has a nice assortment of guards. And now that I finally
            have the weapon, I find out it is<br>
            TERRIBLLY handicapped! The haste on it only lasts 10 seconds which at most allows for 3 or
            4 swings! And the damage range<br>
            is so large it's a hopeless weapon as you never know if you'll get a hundred 9 damage hits
            or a hundred 80 damage hits! I've<br>
            gone complete fights without doing more than 100HP in damage! With upto 12 misses in a
            row! In 4 duels, 2 using<br>
            Executioners Axe, 2 using Painbringer and Shield of The Slain Unicorn. The 2 with
            Executioners Axe were a 50/50 chance that<br>
            if we had gone to death who would of won (mind you I was dueling a ShadowKnight who was
            using buffs but NOT using his other<br>
            spells and was 4 levels below me). Using the sword and shield combo I was the clear
            winner. Not to mention the fact a<br>
            class should NOT be defined by a SINGLE weapon they can't get until they're almost level
            50!<br>
            <br>
            And on a side note why do warriors seem to have to wait LAST to get a
            &quot;superweapon&quot;? I've found (or friends have) caster,<br>
            ranger, paladin &quot;superweapons&quot; and know where an SK one is that we can kill the
            monster with it but it rarely has the item is<br>
            the problem. Man I'm so fed up. And of course if I had my choice I'd much rather duel
            wield 2 Ebony Blades as they're<br>
            better than Painbringer (which btw is a lore, nodrop item so forget duel wielding the only
            nice warrior weapon I've ever<br>
            seen).<br>
            <br>
            So now that I've disproved about every advantaged you'd figure warriors would have here
            some other general ranting:<br>
            <br>
            On top of all this Monk's NEVER die if they know how to use Fiegn Death (the monk I group
            with has died twice from level<br>
            37 to 49, while I have died 8 times between level 45 and 46 alone). Shadow Knights have
            Feign Death (as a spell) and<br>
            invisibility! Rangers get similiar abilities (though generally outdoors only). So most
            classes have ways to avoid being<br>
            attacked or ways of getting out of being attacked. Except warriors. So since we can't
            avoid fights and we can't get out of<br>
            a fight the everything over level 18 is aggressive rule REALLY screws warriors over as we
            have to fight through EVERYTHING to<br>
            get to anything.<br>
            <br>
            Okay then I've finally found something I can solo for XP when my friends are not around to
            group with me. Well in general<br>
            those monsters will run away and are deep in dungeons, and warrior's CANNOT handle
            runners! Rangers get ensnares and roots<br>
            (and Ebony Blades), SKs get darknesses, or heck they have mana to burn things up with.
            Even a monk can chase things down<br>
            kill it and if anyone else attacks they just fiegn death! UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH. SO WHAT IS
            THE POINT OF WARRIORS?!?!?!? Can<br>
            anyone tell me?<br>
            <br>
            Please? And don't say it's a low XP table. The XP tables in Everquest are SO messed up
            it's not even funny. They're messed<br>
            up to the point that a monk gets almost 2 levels to my 1 level and the Monk is
            SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much more powerful than I<br>
            am, not to mention they RARELY die.<br>
            <br>
            We are not the lords of battle in any stretch of the mind in the world of Norrath. Look at
            the original four things I've<br>
            stated. Well I've disproved them all. Heck even worse other melee classes spells still
            improve (and they get new ones) past<br>
            level 40 so that means their buffs get better, but my skills are all parked at 200 (well
            offense and defense goto 210)! And<br>
            well monks they might not have as high ATK as me, but hell they're still getting quadruple
            (!!!!!) punches for over 50 damage<br>
            a hit and kicks over 80 damage! WTF! THIS MAKES NO SENSE. Assuming I got MAX damage in a
            single round using a Gigiantic<br>
            Zweihander I would do 130 damage in 3.9 seconds, or with an Ashenwood Spear and Polished
            Granite Tomahawk I would do 104<br>
            damage in 2.4 seconds. But of course I've never gotten anywhere NEAR max damage. Now
            compare this to a Monks max damage,<br>
            200+ damage just with punches in approximately 3.0 seconds! This just really sucks.<br>
            <br>
            And of course there are the past few patches. I see things changing for other classes
            making them MORE powerful and here I<br>
            sit being SCREWED over ROYALLY. But warriors can wear platemail! Well all other melee
            classes can wear various forms of<br>
            magic platemail (mithril, silvered, rubicite, pick your poison) so that discussion is null
            and void. So in the end I cannot<br>
            think of a single advantage warriors have over ANY other class AT ALL. Thank you Verant
            for setting me up for the fall. I<br>
            didn't expect warriors to rule the earth at level 50, and I NEVER expect them EVER to be a
            heavy solo class beyond the early<br>
            levels, but hey at least let us be the kings of melee combat or share the title with
            monks. And with less mana now spent<br>
            when a spell fizzles and spell specilization (in or on it's way) you've made every casting
            class just that much more<br>
            powerful.<br>
            <br>
            They could double the ammount of damage a warrior could dish out and it wouldn't seriously
            disrupt things (I'm not saying<br>
            this is a viable solution, just that if it was done we'd be the lords of battle but still
            couldn't solo). Hell at level 40<br>
            I can't even solo a GREEN Cyclops, yet my monk friend albeit with some difficulty can at
            least solo a BLUE griffon). If I<br>
            did twice the damage sure I could solo it but then when it ran away I still would not be
            able to finish it due to the<br>
            tons of other monsters that would join in (not to mention the poor prediction code which
            makes it so hard to chase things).<br>
            Thanks Verant. Damnit I'm so pissed. Why couldn't you at least let our weapon skills goto
            255? Why is a ranger just as<br>
            good at me in melee combat and have spells? Why do monks just completely kick my ass? And
            in a monk vs warrior duel at high<br>
            levels the time it would take would be over 5 mintues (or I should say the time it would
            take me to kill a monk would be over<br>
            5 minutes, although a monk could prolly kill me in less than 5 minutes) in length so a
            monk would end up getting more than 1<br>
            mend during the fight making his HP total far outweigh any warriors.<br>
            <br>
            The only thing I got going for me is being a troll with high regen and some extra strength
            and stanima. But this doesn't <br>
            ammount to much considering we can do NO QUESTS (Verant WHERE THE HELL ARE THE TROLL
            QUESTS IN GROBB?), I can't get good<br>
            faction with other places enough to do quests. And everything under the sun hates me. The
            whole faction system is so dumb<br>
            in the end the only people it hurts are evil races. Bleh well now I'm off the topic of why
            warriors get SCREWED, why trolls<br>
            get screwed is a whole different topic. So goodday to those who've bothered to read this
            from start to finish. If I've<br>
            overlooked something significant let me know. I'd love to know my character is worth
            something. Warriors from level 42<br>
            onward GET NOTHING. Oh and our flaunted taunt skill, well the farther your teammates move
            above level 40 the more worthless<br>
            the skill becomes to the point now I can rarely taunt anything off anyone. And why when I
            use a 2 handed weapon does taunt<br>
            work ALOT less than when I use 2 one handed weapons? Damnit Verant I'm so fed up, will you
            quit tweaking every class into <br>
            superhuman beings and pay attention to warriors for a BRIEF second to come up with
            something besides &quot;Beserking Frenzy&quot;.<br>
            Beserking Frenzy? This is supposed to be something good? Please Verant, when it says
            &quot;You have entered a beserking frenzy&quot;<br>
            that's my cue to zone cuz I'm going to die if I stick around. I guess it's not fair to
            complain so much about my class<br>
            without a suggestion or two to make warriors a more viable class to play. If I were to
            rebalance the warrior class I would<br>
            do 2 simple things.<br>
            <br>
            1) Let our weapon skills goto 255. This includes 1h slash, 2h slash, piercing, 1h blunt,
            2h blunt and offense maybe even<br>
            riposte and or parry. Perhaps not even all the way upto 255 but somewhere above other
            melee classes and enough that it<br>
            makes a noticable differance in combat.<br>
            2) Allow a warrior to specialize in 1 or 2 forms of weapons (for instance 1h and 2h slash,
            or piercing and 1h blunt). Your<br>
            skill in specilization reduces your weapon delay, not by tons. But lets say you have a 1h
            slash specilization of 200,<br>
            any 1h slash weapon you wield would be swung 10 percent faster than it's given delay,
            maybe even only 5 percent but<br>
            something slightly faster.<br>
            <br>
            Some other things I'd consider doing:<br>
            <br>
            1) Let our defensive skills go up higher than 210 also.<br>
            2) Let us have access to ALL weapon and armor except the class specific items (robes, monk
            headbands, bard instruments).<br>
            3) Make gate potions more available and more reliable (I've used a gate potions in which
            it tells me the zone is loading<br>
            only to find myself a few minutes later standing right where I was when I drank the potion
            and then promptly killed)<br>
            <br>
            Even if you did all of these things you are not significantly changing the balance of the
            game at all as the warrior's<br>
            biggest weaknesses are still it's down fall, we can't get out of a tight situation, and we
            can't heal ourselves. At most<br>
            this enables us to keep up with Monks damage wise and also to pull our selves apart from
            melee classes and MAYBE be the best<br>
            melee class. And at least be considered a viable member of a group.<br>
            <br>
