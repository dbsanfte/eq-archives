          <tr>

            <td>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There are thirteen distinct races in the
              lands of Everquest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              all have strengths and weaknesses as well as different relations
              with the other races in the game.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><i>HUMANS -</i> The Human race is the race
              that all others are measured by.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They start in either Freeport or Qeynos, which are two of
              the biggest cities in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The available classes for them are Bard, Cleric, Druid,
              Enchanter, Magician, Monk, Paladin, Necromancer, Ranger, Rogue,
              Shadowknight, Warrior and Wizard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You will note that this is every class in the game except
              for the Shaman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
              main advantage of the human race is that it essentially has no
              weaknesses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They can
              be almost any class, and do fairly well as any class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>There are no gaping holes in their starting statistics,
              making them ideal for the first time player who does not have a
              great deal of insight into where to specialize.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are also one of only two races in the game that can be
              the monk class, and they are generally considered the best monks
              because of their harder hitting hands and superior balance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This race has no experience penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Faction wise, most humans can enter most cities with the
              exceptions of Grobb (Troll), Ogukk (Ogre), Cabalis (Iksar),
              Paineel (Evil Erudite) and Neriak (Dark Elf).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is not true under some conditions – generally if
              your character is considered evil due to her class or deity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It should also be noted that humans do not have any form of
              night vision.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>BARBARIANS</i> – The Barbarians
              are the rugged humans of the north, who have developed their
              bodies while sacrificing their mental abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They start in Halas, which is perhaps the most remote city
              in Everquest proper (the world of Everquest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>before the expansions).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The available classes to the barbarians are limited to the
              Shaman, Warrior and Rogue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
              will note that they are one of the four races that can be shamans
              and are the only “good” race that is able to be one (as
              opposed to evil).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              are the strongest of the good classes as well and therefore are
              naturally suited to be warriors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They can also be excellent rogues because of their high
              strength (the harder you stab somebody’s back the more it hurts
              evidently).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
              weakness is in their mental and social skills.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They start with inferior intelligence and charisma, but
              this is balanced by their superior strength and stamina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Stat-wise they are the most neutral of the “big” races.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The race has no experience penalty and has similar faction
              restrictions to their human cousins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </span>They also share their optical deficiencies with their
              cousins, having no night vision whatsoever.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>ERUDITES</i> – Erudites are simply
              the smartest race on the face of Norrath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They left their inferior cousins, the humans, to start a
              new life on the island of Odus, and founded their home city of
              Erudin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Evil Erudites
              begin in the dark city of Paineel, which is hidden somewhere on
              the island, and was founded by the dark sorcerer Miragul.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The classes available to them are Cleric, Enchanter,
              Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Shadowknight and Wizard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are best suited to be one of the four mage-classes, as
              those classes are intellect based (the stat in which Erudites
              excel), however they loose out due to their very low physical
              skills.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Most noticeably lacking are strength and stamina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The race has no racial experience penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Faction for Erudites is split into the good and evil ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Those who live in Erudin are generally accepted in most
              cities in the game following the same basic rules as their human
              cousins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those of
              Paineel are only allowed into the dark cities of Neriak and
              sometimes Grobb and Ogukk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </span>Cabalis is hostile to even them – the Iksars are not a
              particularly friendly bunch of lizards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Once again, they are blind at night like their cousins.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>HALF ELVES</i> – This is the
              crossbreed between humans and elves – they struggle to belong in
              a world where neither society fully accepts them, yet neither
              rejects them completely either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They can start in a great number of cities depending on
              other choices they make.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Felwithe,
              Kelethin, Freeport and Qeynos can all be what a half elf might
              call home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
              classes available to them are the Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue and
              Warrior.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Half Elves have a lot of strengths because of their mixed
              blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps their
              most important strength (especially if you are a bard) is that
              they always look mighty good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are without a doubt the coolest-looking class while
              wearing plate armour.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Those seeking to look good sometimes refer them to as the
              “masters of plate”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              also have fairly balanced stats, with above average agility.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This is balanced, however, by their less-than-desirable
              wisdom deficiency, which makes wisdom-based classes more difficult
              to play as a half-elf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </span>They also get infravision that helps them see in the dark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is especially helpful at night in the depths of the
              Feydark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
              faction is very similar to that of their distant Human relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The major difference is that they are greeted with open
              arms nowhere; however they are more neutral with some of the other
              races than humans are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              have no racial experience penalty.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>WOOD ELVES</i> – This is your
              standard run-of-the-mill elf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They live with nature and have the innate ability to forage
              up food if they need it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are the commoner of the elves and start in the tree-city
              of Kelethin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
              perhaps one of the most confusing and dangerous cities in the
              game.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There are many different platforms connected by bridges and
              planks, with no guardrails.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
              wrong move and you may find yourself falling to your death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Because of this innate danger, Kelethin is the home to
              many-a drunk racing competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The classes available are the Bard, Druid, Ranger, Rogue
              and Warrior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              have exceedingly high agility and share the best wisdom for a
              druid-possible class with halflings, however their stamina,
              strength and intelligence are below par.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They have infravision and have no racial penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are welcome in most cities in the game except for the
              aforementioned evil ones, allowing them to travel and see the
              world with relative ease.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>HIGH ELVES</i> - These are the
              nobility of the elven kingdom, and are considered the most
              egotistical race.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              view themselves as superior to pretty much every race other than
              the high men (Erudites).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              also wallow in their own beauty, having graceful bodies and pale
              complexions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
              starting city is Felwithe, which is perhaps the most
              easy-to-navigate city in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It is also one of the most aesthetically pleasing, with
              marble pillars and such.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
              strengths are in their higher than average intellect, their
              extremely high wisdom and their charming personalities (high
              charisma).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They also
              possess higher than average agility, and adequate dexterity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This all makes them ideally suited as a caster-class, and
              they are among the best choices for Clerics and Enchanters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>However, all classes they can decide to be are very
              playable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
              possible exception is the high elven paladins, which are
              challenging because of the race’s inherently weak strength and
              low stamina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
              classes available are Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Paladin and
              Wizard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are
              welcomed in all good cities in the game, and even have a “second
              city” in Kunark, Firiona Vie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>On the down side, they are particularly hated in evil areas
              of the game, most of all by the dark elves, who are what you might
              consider their evil twins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They,
              of course, have infravision, which helps them navigate the forests
              where they spend much of their time.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>DARK ELVES</i> – Born from
              Innurok’s tortured souls of the kidnapped high elven king and
              queen, the Tier`Dal are the race to be for those who just love to
              be pure, unadulterated evil.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They worship Innurok as their father, and almost all Dark
              Elves have him as their deity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They start in the eerie city of Neriak, which can be
              confusing until you get to know it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </span>They are an extremely intelligent class, being among the
              top three in this area, and also share the high agility and
              dexterity that their distant wood elf relatives enjoy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>However this is balanced out by their below-average
              strength and stamina, as well as their less than charming
              personalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              can be a fair number of classes:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Cleric, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue,
              Shadowknight and Wizard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              do well in almost all of these classes, yet dark elf Shadowknights
              share the same problem that high elven paladins suffer from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Their evil ways have caused them to be hated throughout the
              lands of Norrath, and they are safe only in their own evil realms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>At first, the only cities that will accept them away from
              home are Ogukk and Grobb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              also have an outpost, much like the high elves, on Kunark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Those Dark Elves who decide not to worship Innurok can gain
              partial trust in the nearby human city of Freeport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>However, they are in grave danger when on Feydwer, as they
              are the blood enemy of the light elves, the Feir`Dal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Their night vision is superior to all other races – they
              possess ultravision, which grants them perfect night vision,
              albeit with a slightly purple tinge.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>GNOMES</i> – The Gnomes are a
              fantastic race, which has mastered the art of mechanical creation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They live on Feydwer, in their home of Ak’anon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This marvellous city is a testament to their mechanical
              expertise, as they have robots called clockworks that help run the
              city for them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
              are guides who will show a traveler around the city and merchants
              who sell goods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              also have a king who is inexplicably a very short human.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are second to only the Erudites in intellect, and have
              melee skills that are just below par.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>However they have terrible charisma as well as lower-than
              average wisdom, making them more suited to be a caster than a
              healer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are
              extremely short as well, making them interesting to play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It is rather amusing to watch a level 60 gnomish warrior
              destroy an Ogre or Troll of a similar level in a duel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Class-wise the Gnomes are able to be Clerics, Enchanters,
              Magicians, Necromancers, Rogues, Warriors and Wizards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are accepted in most cities in the game, and can even
              build up enough faction with the Dark Elves to be allowed in
              Neriak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They possess
              infravision that helps them see in the dark.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>DWARVES – </i>Strong, stout and
              sturdy little people, the Dwarves have a unique society, which
              hails honour, drinking games and facial hair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Almost all dwarves indeed do have facial hair, including
              most women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only
              those who have been “corrupted” by the ways of the humans
              shave their hair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
              you might be able to guess, Charisma is one of the weaker points
              to a dwarf.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They live in the city of Kaladim, located in the Butcherblock
              Mountains on Feydwer, near the forests of the elves.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The city has many facilities for Dwarves including numerous
              pubs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To their
              dismay, however, they still have fewer than Kelethin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They have high starting strength, stamina and wisdom, and
              decent dexterity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However
              they suffer with their extremely low charisma, and below average
              intellect and agility.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They can choose to be few classes: Cleric, Paladin, Rogue and
              warrior are the only disciplines that they can grasp.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They start with a sense heading ability of about forty, which
              allows them to navigate the world better than a typical newbie,
              and they also receive infravision like so many other races.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are accepted in most towns throughout the world, and
              follow the same general “rules” as the humans, faction wise.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are just more liked in Kaladim, and less in human towns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>HALFLING – </i>Halflings are the
              hobbits of Norrath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              live in their home city of Riverdale, which is crunched between
              the extremely dangerous Kithicor Forest and what is considered the
              best newbie zone in the game, Misty Thicket.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are small, devious creatures who are very well suited
              to be rogues, with their above average strength, dexterity, wisdom
              and agility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They,
              however, suffer from lower intellect and charisma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are allowed to be Clerics, Druids, Rogues and
              Warriors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are
              among the best Druids and Rogues in the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Faction-wise they are most hated by the dark elves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They have set up camps of their weaker comrades near Neriak
              and are regularly slaughtered there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are allowed in most light cities in the game, however
              they are rarely trusted in them because of their rather
              mischievous nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              do have some innate racial abilities that help make up for this
              though – they are naturals at foraging and hiding, and they have
              infravision.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>TROLLS</i> – Trolls can be best
              described with three simple words – big, ugly and green.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are a simple society that has a natural speech
              impediment that many players are compelled to have fun with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you hear somebody takin lic dis den dey be eder troll or
              ogre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They live in
              Grobb, which is a simple town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Anything more complicated and the trolls would have a very
              difficult time navigating.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are big and ugly, which inherently means that they are
              most likely strong, an assumption that is correct in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They have the second highest strength and stamina in the
              game, which is balanced by their absolutely horrendous intellect,
              wisdom and charisma.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              are hated everywhere in the game except in the evil cities listed
              above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They also have
              the advantage of faster-than normal regeneration, which makes them
              ideal for somebody who wants to solo, and be a melee class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Class wise, only Shaman, Shadowknight and Warriors are open
              to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are also blessed with infravision and the ability to
              “slam”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They,
              however, have a racial experience penalty because of their
              regeneration.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>OGRES</i> – Ogres are… big and
              ugly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although they
              aren’t green, they make up for this by being even bigger than
              trolls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
              impossible to compare the degree of ugliness between these two
              races, as they are both disgustingly ugly in their own unique way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The Ogres reside in the simple town of Ogukk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Again, the town is simple because if it weren’t, the
              residents would get lost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
              main strength of the Ogre is just that:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
              absurdly high, which makes them (arguably) the best warriors in
              the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They also
              have very high stamina (also the best in the game), which makes
              them able to tank better than other races.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is balanced by their absurdly low intelligence and
              charisma, as well as their awful wisdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They do not have a natural regeneration, like the trolls
              do, which is what balances these two massive races out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Their racial skills are a natural immunity to being stunned
              from the front, the ability to “slam,” as well as infravision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </span>Because of these other abilities they also have an
              experience penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They are evil and thus hated everywhere except for the evil
              cities (once again, the “evil cities” exclude Cabalis where
              everyone that isn’t a lizard is hated).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </span>They can be Shamans, Shadowknights and Warriors, and are
              good at all of these, especially warrior.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<i>IKSARS</i> – Iksars are the
              lizard-race who make their home on the rediscovered island of
              Kunark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have
              kidnapped the high elven princess (otherwise known as the EQ-cover
              girl), which caused the other races to finally sail a little
              farther south and find Kunark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Their home city is Cabalis and it has several exits that
              lead to different parts of Kunark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is the one city in the game that does not accept any
              visitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Everyone is
              marked kill-on-sight unless they are an Iksar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It is possible to raise your faction high enough with these
              lizards to earn their trust and let you into their city, however
              the effort is simply not worth it as there are two other cities on
              Kunark where one can bind, shop, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They can be Monks, Necromancers, Shadowknights, Shamans,
              and Warriors making them have a fairly diverse class set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is presumably because they have no allies so they have
              to be able to do many things on their own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Their stats are fairly average, with advantages in agility,
              dexterity and wisdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Surprisingly
              this makes them suited to be very balanced Shadowknights, and
              arguably the best shamans in the game (they have the best starting
              wisdom of any shaman race).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
              start with the advantages of a superior starting swimming skill
              and regeneration much like the Trolls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>However they cannot wear conventional plate armor for some
              odd reason (it hinders their scales or something like that) and
              they are hated everywhere they go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They have an experience penalty and infravision.</p>
