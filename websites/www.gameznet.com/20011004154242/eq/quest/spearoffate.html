              innumerable variable but not many know of its relation to the
              event in the early years of our fair city. For as many people as
              there were in Torsis there were that many theories regarding Ne
              Ashiir's disappearance. Others say there were political tensions
              between the queen and her lord,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>so much so that she had to leave to escape death. And for
              good measure a few pointed to the stars and said<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>that people from beyond the sky took her. One thing all
              agreed upon however is that the relationship between the royal
              couple was decaying. Political scrutinizers noted small personal
              habits between the two implied a separation of intimacy during
              their public appearances. Many even tie the highly publicized
              Crusade of Kim into the disappearance of Neh as Kim left the city
              only a few weeks before. It is recorded in many texts that the
              visage of Rak`Ashiir reflected his dispair over his wife's
              vanishing although it is a well know fact that it was mostly an

              cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of. He
              had haphazardly discovered a way to directly create a mantle of

              the timing was lucky indeed. We supplied him with materials needed
              to construct a weapon that could pierce the very fabric of the
              [cosmos]. First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient
              lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft
              and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his
              fingernails. He then split the top of the flexible shaft, lodged
              the blade into place and bound them together with the tanned
              entrails of an ox. Finally, he adorned the spear with the magical
              feathers of a an aviak elder.<o:p>

              Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but it was a force
              brought into existence. This force was positive in nature, the
              opposite of nothingness. Even though it worked like a void, it was
              still created by an imposition of will. We figured that if we
              could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence
              or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger
              volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no spirits could
              even get close to it. In one act of devotion and singular purpose,
              Thalger rode the wind far above the land and with one colossal
              arch ripped a [breach] across the planes.<o:p>
