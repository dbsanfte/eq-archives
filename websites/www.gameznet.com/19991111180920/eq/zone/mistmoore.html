          <tr>
            <td>Mistmoore is the home of Lord Mahong Mistmoore and his legion of vampires and
            worshippers. This dungeon is located in Lesser Faydark. If you are coming from Steamfont
            you can take a left and follow the zone ridge straight to Mistmoore. If you are coming
            from Greater Faydark you can take a left and follow the zone ridge. From Greater Faydark
            it will be the second zone that you come to(the first is Steamfont).<br>
            <br>
            Mistmoore is tuned for characters level 20-50. The entrance is guarded mostly by dark
            elves and a couple gargoyles. Beware of all the casters in this zone, they can be deadly
            to an unwary traveler. If you follow the zone entrance to the right you will come to a
            fork. To the right will be the graveyard. If you continue following downhill you will
            reach the courtyard which leads to the front of the castle.<br>
            <br>
            We will discuss the graveyard first. This is a good area for characters level 25-30. It is
            also the location of a rare spawn imp who drops some interesting items. In the middle of
            the graveyard you will see a tomb where a vampire used to spawn in the beta. I have yet to
            see him spawn in the final but he may still spawn rarely. Be careful in this room. Both
            sides of the coffin are pit traps that will drop you into a place that you would probably
            rather not be.<br>
            <br>
            Along the left side of the graveyard wall you will find a fake wall. Inside this wall is a
            shortcut to the castle. You will first come to a room with 4 doors. One of the doors is
            actually a lever which will open the other three. All three doors contain monsters. There
            are two other fake walls in this room. The first leads downstairs where there is not much
            to see. The second leads upstairs which allows you to connect to both the rest of the
            castle and to Lord Mistmoore's tower. Beware there is a patroller in this hallway.
            Occasionally this patroller will be a rare spawn who drops some nice items for melee and
            cleric types.<br>
            <br>
            When you reach the top of the stairs there you will come to a T intersection. To the right
            of the T leads to the tower. Inside this tower is rough(mid 30ish mobs). The real reason
            to come here however is because it is the spawn location of Lord Mahong Mistmoore himself.
            Lord Mistmoore is a level 53+ vampire who has yet to be killed. The problem is that he
            spawns very rarely and only at night. We ventured to slay him one day and after about two
            hours he had not spawned and everyone grew restless and chaos set in.<br>
            <br>
            To the left of the T intersection connects back to the front of the castle. Speaking of
            the caste it's time to getting aroud to describing it. This is one of the spookiest and
            best designed locations in any dungeon in the game. You can not only reach the castle by
            taking this T intersection but also from going down at the first fork near the courtyard.
            Inside the castle you will find mostly dark elves but also vampires and gargoyles. There
            are a couple important quest NPC's inside the castle as well, I will not go into it
            further as I don't want to spoil it for anyone.<br>
            <br>
            The monsters in the castle are mostly in the level 28-35 range with a ranging at level
            36+. There are also some werewolves inside the castle which are rare spawns and spawn only
            at night time. Werewolves are highly sought after because of their Lupine armor which is
            great for spellcasters and monks. <br>
            <br>
            Mistmoore is the home to many great magical items including diamondine earrings, crested
            armor and the bloodstone eyepatch. </td>
