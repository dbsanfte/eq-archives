            <td>My name is BattleDragun, I am a level 48th Barbarian&nbsp; Warrior on the Team PvP
            server Vallon Zek. I have had great&nbsp; success in pvp with over 500 pvp wins(chasing
            person from&nbsp; zone) and 109 confirmed pvp kills(screenshots taken of death&nbsp; or
            faction hit). I've been asked many times how to pvp as a&nbsp; warrior, but its just too
            long to explain the intricacies of&nbsp; the class and most of the skills with warrior pvp
            comes from&nbsp; trial and error. Hopefully this Guide will help the future&nbsp; warriors
            out there.<br>
            <br>
            PvP with a warrior is one of the hardest pvp classes&nbsp; and requires more skill than
            any other class. It is the same&nbsp; with all pure melee in pvp, but warriors do not have
            the&nbsp; little safety options that monks(mend, safe fall) and rogues(hide) have. With
            the innate ability to resist magic,&nbsp; tons of hit points, and a large assortment of
            gear&nbsp; available, a well equipped and played warrior is one to be&nbsp; respected.
            Before I get into specifics, the best friends of&nbsp; a pvp warrior are <br>
            1) Pumice stones<br>
            2) Journeyman boots<br>
            and&nbsp; <br>
            3) Magic resistance equipment.<br>
            <br>
            Now why I say pumice stones, is because they are the number 1 means of keeping a warrior
            alive. If a warrior gets rooted, snared, or darkened, they are pretty much easy meat. But
            with a pumice stone, you can remove any type of magic based debuff/effect/buff from either
            your target or yourself. Journeyman boots are very important to 1) outrun <br>
            pets and 2) keep up with casters that have journeyman boots and to outrun those that
            don't. One of the most useful items in the game for PvP as they have a instacast. And for
            Magic resistance equipment, its very useful in pvp. If you cannot be rooted, stunned,
            snared, blinded, or mezed, you cannot be killed unless you stick around. Now into class
            specifics.<br>
            <br>
            Priest classes:<br>
            <br>
            Druids- To fight them, unload a full pumice stone to destroy all buffs that they have on,
            including SoW, thorns, wolf form, hp buffs, str buffs, and the such. When this is done,
            recycle your pumice stone for a new one. If the druid snares you, target yourself and
            pumice it off. If you get doted, target yourself and pumice it off. If you know you are
            gonna be fighting a druid, Load up on the heat resistance gear, but make sure to get at
            least a 65 cold resist(for the level 49 ice spell). Most of the druid nukes are fire
            based, so if you can resist these and pumice off the dot's and snare, a druid is a easy
            opponent to take out. When the druid see's he is gonna loose, he will most likely
            &nbsp; cast SoC and run off, once it is casted, you have to quickly pumice his SoC and
            finish him off.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans- As with druids, start fight with full pumice, and use pumice stone to get rid of
            DOT's that are magic based. With shamans you want to load up on the cold, poison, and
            disease resist(malosi series is disease based). A buffed shaman CAN out-melee a warrior
            with heals and dot's, so make sure you have pumice to removed buffs. For the deadly
            envenomed bolt, you can get some counteract poison potions from a friendly alchemist for
            around 15-20pp each. When the fight is going bad, the shaman will most likely SoC away
            like the druid, pumice it off and finish the shaman.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics- If you haven't noticed a pattern, open the fight with a full pumice to remove all
            buffs. For a cleric this is important that you do this. A cleric can add around 30 ac and
            up to 1k hp's at level 49 to his stats with buffs alone. That's a lot of damage that you
            don't have to do. With clerics, go ALL magic resistance gear. If you get around 100mr, a
            cleric will do little to no damage with DD's, stuns and roots will be resisted. Key thing
            for fighting a cleric is you must interrupt his heals. If he goes invulnerable and tries
            to run, you cannot do damage, but you can stun him to keep him from making it to the zone
            line with bash or slam. Clerics are one of the hardest classes for a warrior to kill, but
            it is possible.<br>
            <br>
            Pure caster classes:<br>
            <br>
            Wizards- As with all classes, start the fight by unloading a full pumice stone and cycling
            out for a new one. The key to fighting a wizard is to stay on him. His nukes are strong,
            but have a 5-6 casting time. The key is to have high enough magic resistance to resist the
            stuns or bonds of force. A stun from a wizard will give him enough time to get <br>
            a ice comet off, and post expansion 2 fast casting fire based DD's. If fighting a 49+
            wizard, cold resist is a must. Ice comet HURTS. But for wizards, go with Magic as most
            important resistance, then cold/heat, depending on level. <br>
            <br>
            The only way for a wizard to flee is through shadow step or gate, if you can interrupt his
            spells, the win will almost always be yours. If a wizard does get a shadow step off on
            you, use your bow as a locator. With the bows in everquest, if you are facing in the
            general direction and within bow range, firing the bow will point you in his exact
            direction.<br>
            <br>
            Magicians- Mainly Magic based nukes, but have fire based bolt spells that hurt. A way to
            dodge a bolt spell is to always keep the pet between yourself and the caster while it is
            being casted. Magicians however can beat warriors easily by turning the pet on the warrior
            and running around. <br>
            <br>
            This is where Jboots come in handy as you are able to outrun the pet. Note: Because of a
            change with dispel magic, never, EVER dispel yourself with a pet on you. If you do, the
            pet because &quot;rogue&quot; and no longer hits for nerfed damage. That pet that was
            hitting you for low 30's will now be hitting you for low 50's. The only thing a pet has
            over a warrior is auto tracking, otherwise a warrior is better than a pet in pvp, pets hit
            for maximum of around 36, with bloodfire and amy whip I'm doing a maximum of high 40's,
            low 50's.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers- Open up fight with a pumice to get rid of buffs, a necro with DMF is hard to
            hit, but remember with a pet and a ton of dot's, necromancers are the warriors worst
            nightmare. To fight necro's load up on the poison, magic, and heat resistance. If high
            enough you can resist all his deadly dot's and DD's. Pumice stone can get rid of darkness
            and blood line of dots, but a counteract potion is needed for the poison line, also must
            pumice yourself and the caster if he hits you with vampiric embrace or bonds of death. The
            disease line of dots are near useless as it takes forever to do actual damage, so it isn't
            that important to invest in disease resist or counteract disease while fighting a necro.
            Stay on the necro while fighting him, use your bow to keep him on target and to interrupt
            spells, same with all casting classes. The hard part of fighting a necro is his life taps,
            if you cannot interrupt them, you cannot win.<br>
            <br>
            Enchanters- They are ALL magic based. If you cannot be mezed, stunned, or nuked, you
            cannot be killed by this class. A 100+ MR is required to resist their spells. Tashani
            series is poison based, but is near impossible to resist. Use counteract poison to remove
            tashani series. Interrupt his gate spell and with a high MR, will be a easy kill. Use a
            pumice stone to remove all buffs and to remove all debuffs that stick on you.<br>
            <br>
            Hybrid classes:<br>
            <br>
            Bards- They are just annoying, songs are unpumiceable, and can easily kite a warrior. Use
            your bow to wear down the bard if he tries kiting you, or just run out of song range and
            wait for him to come back. Warrior will hands down beat a bard in pure melee. Wearing
            Magic resist gear and AC gear is a key for victory.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers- A more pvp oriented druid type of class. Open fight with pumice to remove buffs.
            Resistance's needed are heat for the rangers fire based DD's (ignite, call of flames) and
            magic (snare). If they try to kite you, use your bow to wear them down, in pure melee,
            your hp's and ac alone should ensure you the win.<br>
            <br>
            Paladins- Open fight with a pumice stone, clerical buffs might be outdated for the level,
            but can still add a few hundred hp's to the class. Unless a paladin has a top of the line
            weapon (planar or high level kunark) a warrior can beat a paladin in pure melee. Must
            interrupt the heals, and LoH can be a pain. If magic resist is high enough, you will
            resist all stuns (need 70 or so MR), but AC and interrupting heals is the key to killing a
            paladin.<br>
            <br>
            Shadow knights- Open fight with pumice stone. Magic resistance is a key to fight the
            shadow knight class, If the dot's don't stick, they can't kite you. And harm touch can be
            resisted with high enough MR. Shadow knights, like paladins, cannot out melee a warrior,
            and must rely on their damage spells to win. With life leach and harm touch, a 50+ shadow
            knight is very deadly, a warrior can loose 2 bubbles of life in a few seconds. Shadow
            knights do get shadow step for a escape spell, so to ensure victory, it must be
            interrupted. AC and weapons are the key to beating a shadow knight.<br>
            <br>
            Pure Melee:<br>
            <br>
            Warriors- Not much to do against one. You have 2 options. Going toe-toe and seeing who has
            the better equipment, and that person will win. Or you can dance around, using your fps
            skills, connection, and equipment to ensure the win. &quot;Float like a butterfly, sting
            like a bee&quot; is a good way to describe how to fight melee Vs melee. Its more like a
            boxing match when you dance around. AC is king.<br>
            <br>
            Monks- Monks are masters of straight up melee damage. Get your AC as high as possible and
            try to dance your way to victory, standing toe to toe with a monk is asking to loose. Mend
            is your worse enemy, and fists and kicks will hurt.<br>
            <br>
            Rogues- Pretty easy targets, masters of the dance of blades. Never leave your back open
            for a backstab, without them, a rogue is a weak warrior. Keep a Counteract poison and a
            pumice slot ready for a rogue who uses magic and poison based poisons. Also need magic
            resistance around 60+ to resist the procs that rogue weapons have. If you get darkened by
            a rogue's SBD, pumice it off, or you will get backstabbed as you cannot maneuver fast
            enough.<br>
            <br>
            General tips:<br>
            <br>
            Bow- Can be used to help keep your target at center of screen, can also wear down running
            opponents, and can interrupt spells.<br>
            Jboots- Can outrun pets, and can overcome running opponents that do not have them. <br>
            Pumice stones- Can remove all magic based buffs, debuffs, dots. Open ALL fights with a
            full stone, sold for around 18pp depending on faction and cha at a potion shop, one
            located in every city.<br>
            Slam/Bash- Always use it in pvp until kick-stun at 51. Can momentarily stun running caters
            and can interrupt casting.<br>
            Weapons- Against casters who like to run and cast, a high damage weapon is wanted. When
            they stop to try to cast a spell, smack them once or twice, slam to interrupt and they
            will run again. While they run your weapon will recharge. Against melee's or casters who
            stand toe-toe or don't run that far off. Use 1h'ers as 2h'ers will have to high a delay to
            interrupt casting or to low a damage output to bring in the win.<br>
            <br>
            Hope this bit of information helps all the future pvp warriors out there.<br>
