                                Ok. Read my Maestro of rancor post for related info. Once again, clear the zone with 30-36 players. Dont start or bring up 42+ too soon, or it will be crowded, laggy, and not much fun. Clear the zone, skipping maybe the very northern houses and second floor of house C, and D, and house P. If you are going to do maestro as well, clear it all, maybe skip C second floor.
                                <br><br>
                                Why? Because pulling drakes from the top level(ones at top of ramp) can aggro roamers on North patrol route, aggroing maestro house, aggroing maestro, and the rev houses, and well, you get the idea. Besides, give everyone some loot or shots at it. Clear it all on the second floor expect for Inny himself, and the stuck drakes. Leave em there.(We always got stuck drakes).
                                <br><br>
                                Take up your players after clearing ALL roamers to the second level of hate. Before going, have them all buff everything except for augmentation, and damage shields. Form your dragon groups, pet groups, etc etc. NO pets yet. Have mages, shamans, enchanters get a cha buff. For one, you never know when another mob shows up to help sometimes, and have the ench rdy to mes/charm.
                                <br><br> 
                                Malisement? or malosi, whatever, I hear is charisma based. So have your shamans don their charisman gear. Borrow crude steins, etc etc. If I were a shaman I would buy charisma jewelry for these sort of events anyway. 
                                <br><br> 
                                Take everyone up, and off to the left. Stay a good ways back away from the door to his room. If he comes out, you're screwed. He will grav flux you all over the zone, and cr will take hours. Some people wont do /l when they get sent flying, and you'll have to waste a lot of time looking for these newbies.
                                <br><br> 
                                Summon pets. have your clerics buff the pets. They should be fm anyway. Pass augmentation around. Innoruuk has an AE nullify or something, it drops like 4? buffs at a time. I have tried the crap buffing, then the good ones, it dont matter. You can buff all your resists, disease, poison, fire, cold, see invis, de guise, sow, regen, etc etc, but it usually takes too long and aint really necessary. 
                                <br><br> 
                                I always have myself in his room feigning death, watching his movement. His pathing takes him all over his room, from neear his doorway, to all the corners of it. As you look into his room, you will see the room turn in to the right. The corner where the left wall meets the north wall(as you're looking into his room) is where you place all your tanks. Damage shields up now.
                                <br><br> 
                                Clerics are halfway in, along the left wall, with everyone else staged behind them. Place your Death touch candidate slightly ahead of your tanks. Innoruuk's pathing will bring him to you, and he will yell that players name. Then have your tanks lifetap, arrow, whatever, pull him in. LET HIM COME TO YOU.
                                <br><br> 
                                Ive heard many theories as to, fight him deep in his room, pull him downstairs, but its all newbieism(is that a word?) He can and will aggro roamers on the north patrol route, and you are less likely to have them train up if you fight him where I am describing. He has an AE gravity flux. He will send you flying across the zone if you let him. This is the reason all of your tanks are huddled in the corner, and make sure they know two basic things. At all times fighting him, keep your back to the nearest wall. And stick to him like glue. 
                                <br><br> 
                                If you're in that corner, he will grav flux you up, and thats it. You land, and there he is. As long as everyone keeps their backs to the nearest wall, you have no problems. Once again, dont nuke too heavily. REND was fixed, and works wonders. Druids lightning shock, and all magic based work well. Innoruuk isnt undead like maestro. The damage you take from falling can be considerable. Clerics should group heal often INMO. Everyone should have a mod rod, for emergencies. 
                                <br><br> 
                                When he is pulled, Dispel the heck out of him. Have each ench dispel, and TASH him. Then start your mana seiving. Land it, and your shamans will be working on malosi, togors.  Land them, and hes done for.   Send pets in after hes enagaged tanks. Make sure you have pet taunt off as always pet classes. He really isnt that hard if you dont suffer massive linkdeath on the pull. Keep clerics and casters away from tanks at first to avoid this. If you got the people for an extra tank group, stage them outside wheere you initially staged and send em in later. When hes at 60-70, he gets there fast, nuke away. 
                                <br><br> 
                                If a pet dies, summon a new one. Nuking involves melee range, get under him, nuke, and get out. Run in After HES GRAV FLUXED EVERYONE. Dont be a dork, run in, and get grav fluxed. Casters aint got the hp for that. He will run. Be prepared for it. Make sure everyone knows, when and if he runs, everyone chases. Clerics nuke, do whatever you have to to drop him. If he makes it to the bottom, kill him no matter what, and train away. DONT TRAIN THE TOP. This way you can res someone to loot so it wont rot(Had it happen ugh). 
                                <br><br> 
                                He is pretty easy though, just Keep your backs to the nearest wall at all times, and stick to him like glue until one of you dies. Cake.
