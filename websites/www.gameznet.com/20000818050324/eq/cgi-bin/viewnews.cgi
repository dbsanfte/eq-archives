I only have three new pieces of equipment for you today. They are three very nice pieces however. One is from Trakanon and two are from Plane of Air quests. The warrior weapon is somewhat dissapointing damage wise to me. It seemed to me when the fiery avenger was found months back it would probably be one of the weaker POA quest weapons. That would make sense since it was the easiest to complete. However it still stands as by far the best weapon to come out of there.<br><br>New 1HSlashs: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/dagas.html">Dagas</a>(WAR).<br>New Cloaks: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/cloakofpiety.html">Cloak of Piety</a>.<br>New Rings: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/crimsonringofdesinence.html">Crimson Ring of Desinence</a>(SHM).<br>Updated Ultra Spawn: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/trakanon.html">Trakanon</a>.

Greetings Travelers, I am Foramen Magnum, a new editor for EQ'Lizer.  Some of you may have known me from the old site that I used to run, EQTT, I have decided to give access of my site to JC, so that we could combine our knowledge into one site.  I haven't had a ton of time to put into my site like I once did and I fear that it has been slowly dying.  This is my reprive for my website.  I hope to be a valuable asset to this site.  Just so that everyone knows, the first thing that I'm going to tackle is reducing the size of some of the Jpegs in the site to attempt to make stuff load a little faster.  I will also be working on getting some of the blanks in the equipment fields filled.<br><br>We still plan to do plenty of updates involving new equipment, so keep those submissions rolling.<br><br>-Foramen

It's been quite some time since have written an Everquest class guide. While bored out of my mind on my laptop the other evening I began typing up a new guide for my personal class, the shadowknight.

One for shadowknights(resulting in Rheumguls which was previously posted here after the test server wipe) and Zephyrwind. While both of these weapons are very high quality I am sure there will be quit a few dissapointed players out here.

Well, it has been confirmed that it was a GM run event that spanned multiple servers.  It is still unclear if it was on every server, however it was on many.  So, perhaps you won't get to hunt for Rubicite again, but there has been more thrown into the world to trade for and you know those GM's: if they do it once, they just might do it again (in a slightly different way, no doubt hehe)

Hey Everyone!  I told ya you'd see me again soon <grin>  Anyway just wanted to drop a note that apparently RUBICITE is again dropping in the game.  It is unclear whether this was a GM-controled spawn that was a one-night-only thing or if it was a totally new addition to Najena.

To the delight of most players there are now three new dragons patrolling the landscape of Kunark. There is a new dragon in Skyfire, Emerald Jungle and Dreadlands. Thus far these dragons have been slain on several servers and drop a mixed bag of Nagafen and Vox loot with at least two new items thrown in. One of them being a new weight reducing pack which I do not have a screenshot of and the second being the new <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/dragonherobracer.html">Dragon Hero Bracer</a>. There are likely more new items. Another interesting item is the green dragon scale which drops on Severilous. I haven't checked with the quest giving NPC but there is likely a quest for it somewhere in Norrath. It also appears that the loot is a mixed bag between the dragons.

Here's a text bite...<br><br><blockquote>Now, you've gently used the phrase 'revamping'. At what point will you consider the customer service program turned around?<br><br>Well, it's getting there. I've been in San Diego about three months now and one of the key things that we've done is to put in a new phone system. This is important because prior to July we had only one line coming in to the Verant building and it was a local number. So what we've done, we've brought in a T1 line to our phone system which quadruples our capacity. That brings us up to 32 inbound lines and we've increased the staff from 5 phone reps to well over 15.</blockquote> <br>
