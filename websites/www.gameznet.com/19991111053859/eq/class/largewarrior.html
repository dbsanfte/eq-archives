            <td>How to start and have a good LARGE RACE WARRIOR, an essay.<br>
            <br>
            Before we begin, these are my own experiences, and I in no way guarantee success using
            these tactics and tips, only that it worked for me and I'm very happy.<br>
            <br>
            I know for a fact that warriors are the backbone of any RPG. I originally started a
            Barbarian warrior. I chose that race for several reasons. Barbarian's are a large race
            with a naturally high STRENGTH, a natural ability to slam, they are widely accepted in
            most cities, and most importantly, I liked the way Barbarians looked. So, I go to create
            my warrior, and like most new folks, I created a warrior with high STRENGTH and put the
            rest of my points into STAMINA. I was thinking that these were the most important
            attributes to the foundation of a good warrior. However, after having attained level 18
            through much bloodshed and deaths, I came to the realization that warriors are really hard
            to play and level up if you are constantly getting your butt kicked. Something else was
            amiss here. I found it hard to believe that the developers to this game would purposely
            make warriors a weak class. I wasn't looking at the big picture, I think. <br>
            <br>
            There had to be a solution beyond the &quot;lets revamp the warriors&quot; one. Now,
            naturally, there are some areas that DO need some tweaking, but overall the warrior isn't
            really as bad as everyone is screaming about.<br>
            <br>
            Being the typical engineer, I did some research. What did I find out? Well, to begin with,
            the starting attributes I should have selected to pump up for a LARGE RACE warrior were
            AGILITY and DEXTERITY. <br>
            <br>
            What's that? Come again?<br>
            <br>
            Yes, you read correctly, AGILITY and DEXTERITY. How did I find this out? Well, by reading
            all those message boards and getting answers in game from some high level warriors I've
            run into. The articles I've read that were the most intriguing were articles about
            Halfling warriors and their high AGILITY that are not taking any damage during fights.
            Interesting I thought, tell me more. I found out that STRENGTH for a LARGE RACE warrior
            just means you get to carry more things, it doesn't always help with damage. I know, some
            of you are going to yell about not being able to do maximum damage and some of you are
            gonna yell about not having enough strength to carry armor, but trust me and just read on,
            you'll be impressed I promise. <br>
            <br>
            The idea behind STRENGTH is this (information given to me by J.C.Smith of EQ'lizer): <br>
            <br>
            &quot;1 STRENGTH = 1 Attack. So when you're talking about the difference between say a
            Halfling warrior with 80 STRENGTH and an Ogre warrior with 150 STRENGTH that's a 70 point
            attack difference. 70 points of attack is about the attack equivalent of 4-5 levels.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            While I don't doubt the validity of the formula, the attack level of a Barbarian (and the
            other LARGE races) is already high because of naturally high STRENGTH. So saying this, the
            actual point difference per hit is in the range of 5 to 15 points (ROUGHLY) of extra
            damage per actual HIT. My argument is that I would much rather avoid most 90+ hits from
            say, a Hill Giant, than to dish out an extra 100 to 300 points (ROUGHLY) per fight. Why?
            Because I figure that after that Hill Giant has hit you for the tenth time for 90+ damage,
            you might be thinking a little bit differently at this point. <br>
            <br>
            Why would you think differently? Well, the Hill Giant just took 100 to 300 points extra
            damage, whereas you have just taken 900. Lets face it, this is not a good trade-off. The
            argument about STAMINA is the same. If you aren't taking as much damage then not having a
            high amount of hit points is a moot point. Of course, there are always going to be unique
            situations where this might no be the case.<br>
            <br>
            Ok, so let me continue to rebuff the argument about needing alot of STRENGTH. Having
            played the warrior to level 18 I found out that the little &quot;strength less than
            90&quot; Halfling was doing the same damage I was doing with a STRENGTH of 130. Hmmm ...
            lets see here ... Same damage? ... After talking to some level 20+ warriors and picking
            their brains about whether or not you received a STRENGTH bonus to damage after level 20,
            and getting a negative response from some, or a response of &quot;not enough to make it
            worth it&quot; from others, I thought &quot;hmmm ... interesting ...&quot; As far as
            STRENGTH making a difference wearing plate, my response is this: Whom can afford the plate
            sold in stores, and what make you think that plate is the best armor anyway? Yes, plate
            armor does tend to absorb more hits than other types of armor, but there are some
            trade-offs worth noting.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Example: I sold my Bronze plated cloak for a Lizardscale cloak. I get the SAME AC as
            plate, but with a fraction of the weight and a plus 5 to DEXTERITY. That is MUCH better
            stuff and is MUCH lighter. So don't be too worried about STRENGTH, don't be a fool and
            discount it all together, but just know that as a LARGE RACE warrior, AGILITY and
            DEXTERITY are much more worth the extra build points. I then said to myself what the heck,
            and recreated my character and I am now Faman Wrathblade, Barbarian warrior with high
            AGILITY and good STRENGTH and DEXTERITY. I've never looked back since.<br>
            <br>
            As it stands now I have acquired two plus 5 AGILITY rings (player made), a necklace of
            plus 7 to both DEXTERITY and AGILITY (player made), Snakeskin gloves with a plus 3
            DEXTERITY, a Grotesque Mask with plus 7 DEXTERITY, Barbed Armplates with plus 2 DEXTERITY
            and the Lizardscale cloak I mentioned earlier with the plus 5 to DEXTERITY. At level 25
            now, my warrior has an unbuffed AGILITY of 124, and an unbuffed DEXTERITY of 94. Not the
            greatest stats of them all but, let me tell you, what a difference I have seen. Also,
            because of the large race being used (Barbarian), the starting STRENGTH of 113 is a good
            start point. I actually added 5 to STRENGTH and not DEXTERITY thinking that there were
            more DEXTERITY enhancing items than STRENGTH. So my STRENGTH is not high but respectable
            at 118. Ogres and Trolls have an even higher starting STRENGTH, so they have an even
            bigger advantage.<br>
            <br>
            Now, I hit alot more often and still get the maximum damage just as much. When I dual
            wield my third attack hits quite a few times, and I know my fourth attack will kick in as
            well alot(once the skill is high enough). My Polished Granite Tomahawk goes off AT LEAST
            twice and up to six or seven times every fight. And god forbid I get some buff spells cast
            on me by anyone that gives me even higher DEXTERITY and AGILITY ... Woohoo daddy I'm a
            wrecking machine! The mobs miss me a heck of alot more too. I get quite a few dodges and
            misses EVERY fight. Now its not like I'm going after Hill Giants and such, but if I have
            to fight ANYTHING that cons blue, with the exception of a very few select creatures, I
            waste them. Sometimes I take a little more than a few bubbles of damage, most times even
            less than that. As far as yellow cons go, I can beat some of those DEPENDING on what it is
            and what weapon(s) I am using. Red cons, however, are hard to judge because you can't
            really tell what level they are above you, so I usually stay away from them unless I'm in
            a group. <br>
            <br>
            Bottom line: High AGILITY makes the monster miss ALOT more and you dodge ALOT more. Higher
            DEXTERITY helps you hit ALOT more, dual wield ALOT more, double attack ALOT more, and your
            magic weapon(s) goes off ALOT more. Also, with the possible implementation of critical
            hits, which attribute do you think will make the critical hits occur? Yes, you guessed it,
            DEXTERITY.<br>
            <br>
            Enough said?<br>
            <br>
            Ok at this point let me say this, THESE ATTRIBUTES HELP YOU TO SURVIVE AND COMPETE BETTER
            IN THIS GAME, THEY DO NOT MAKE YOU A GOD. I felt that I need to say that. I didn't need
            anyone coming to me later and saying I lied to them. What I'm trying to say is that you
            still need to have a good understanding of how to play the warrior too. Having great stats
            alone is not going to make you a better warrior. Warriors are not the simple &quot;hit the
            attack button and sit back and read a book character&quot; that everyone thinks they are.
            There are definite strategies and abilities that warriors are the best at. YES, I actually
            did say that warriors have something they are best at, and after having read about how
            &quot;this warrior sucks because of this&quot; and &quot;that warrior sucks because of
            that&quot;, I decided that this needed to be written so that people wouldn't be
            discouraged by a few individuals that<br>
            don't know how to REALLY play the class. Yes, I know that I'm not a hugely high level
            (level 25), but I've had so many less deaths and sweated so much less blood with this guy
            that I cant see things going sour in the future.<br>
            <br>
            Let me continue.<br>
            <br>
            A warrior must know alot of things. He must know what weapons best go with which
            adversary. He must know whether it is time to use a two handed blade, or when to dual
            wield two swords. He must know when to use bash as opposed to when to use kick. He must
            have bind wound, he must have archery, and he must have taunt. He must know when to attack
            like a madman and when to back out a bit. Use your brain in combat. The warrior must not
            fear death, but embrace it as a learning experience. Sounds a little scary? Well, it is.<br>
            <br>
            Onward ... <br>
            <br>
            Don't listen to the idiot that tells you two handed weapons are the only way, or the one
            that says one-handed weapons are the only way. <br>
            <br>
            LEARN THEM ALL. <br>
            <br>
            It doesn't take very long to become proficient in each of them. If you are creating a
            warrior that is only proficient in one weapon skill, you are doing yourself, your future
            group, and the character you are creating a great disservice. Also, don't worry about your
            low level of INTELLIGENCE. You will learn all the combat skills just as quickly. How, you
            might ask?<br>
            <br>
            Well, what does a warrior do? He is constantly swinging a weapon. He is constantly
            kicking, taunting, bashing, and binding wound. You will be surprised once you try this and
            see that because of the amount of repetitious acts the warrior must do to survive, his
            COMBAT SKILLS will go up just as fast as anyone else, regardless of the intelligence he
            has. <br>
            <br>
            LEARN ALL THE ABOVE SKILLS. ALL OF THEM. TOTAL. EVERY ONE. Did I make myself clear?<br>
            <br>
            One of the skills that I cant seem to stress enough is archery. It's a warrior's long
            range attack. It is a MUST have skill. You are that much more diversified and deadly if
            you can use a bow well. Later in the game when you have acquired some wealth, you will
            definitely want to buy a good bow with high damage and long range. The benefits from a
            good bow and the skills to match shine during fierce group fights when you are down to
            very low health. You can back out of the infighting, and still dish out some decent damage
            (with higher archery skill). It's also a GREAT luring weapon. I can also beat ANY caster
            to the punch using my bow. I can lure creatures WITHOUT having to go up to them and hit
            them with my weapon. This in itself is a huge plus.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            I will finish up here by saying this: These stats are the best combination of stats and
            skills that I have come up with by experimentation, and I bet you will find that the ideas
            presented here will really help you in the long run. I know they made a WORLD of
            difference to me and my group and most importantly, my warrior. Have fun playing this game
            and don't lose sight of the fact that there are real people behind those characters you
            see on the screen, and most importantly remember this one fact: its only a game, have fun.<br>
