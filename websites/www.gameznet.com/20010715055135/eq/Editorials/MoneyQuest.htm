                        <td>An age old question... Can gaming
                        make you money? Well if it comes to
                        EverQuest...yes. When you hear the words
                        money and EverQuest I'm sure Ebay comes
                        to mind. I'm sure at one time or another
                        you have visited the site to see what's
                        there, if he's a hoax or not. Well it's
                        not a hoax, and infact verant is against
                        it.<p>Who in their right mind would pay
                        2500$ for an eq account you may ask
                        yourself at times, even I do sometimes.
                        Way I see it is that for the ammount of
                        time/monthly fees that it would take to
                        get all the items/levels a character has.
                        Many find it cheeper to just buy an
                        account rather than spend time leveling
                        it themselves. Some are newbies just
                        wanting a boost, others are old
                        AD&amp;Ders just seeking a new begining
                        with another class, and not wanting to
                        have to do it all over again.</p>
                        <p>Here I am talking about how it's nice,
                        back to the subject, Can gaming make you
                        money? Is EverQuest a job? Is Camping a
                        Short Sword of the Ykesha the same as
                        working for a day or 2? For
                        some...well...yes. I don't know about all
                        of you, infact I know about 5% of all the
                        people that play EverQuest, but as common
                        observence I have found that apx. 35-45
                        compleated transactions are done on EBay
                        each day. Yet... if everyone is against
                        ebay, who is buying the items...</p>
                        <p>EverQuest is a source of income to
                        some, source of fun for others, and a
                        source of escape for the rest. If people
                        are able to make money thru the game,
                        then I see little reason to not count
                        playing EverQuest as a job. Infact I
                        wouldn't be suprised if some people have
                        added: EverQuest Merchant to their
                        resume. It's not far-fetched, infact
                        EverQuest is playing it's own role on the
                        economy.</p>
                        <p>If you take a larger look at things,
                        you can make some damn nice cash off
                        playing the crack. Spend a bit of time,
                        get a level 50, get some nice items, sell
                        it off, doit again, u can support
                        yourself from playing a computer game...
                        weird huh? So let's take a larger look,
                        you could make 25,000$ + a year from
                        EverQuest. You could quit your job and
                        just play the game and support yourself.
                        Don't go telling the boss you quit just
                        yet!</p>
                        <p>As much as the world is evolving,
                        people aren't able to fully support
                        themselves from just EverQuest. Verant is
                        even trying to stop the sale of goods on
                        EBay. So is the MoneyQuest over? Or just
                        begining...<br>
                        -<br>
