            <td valign="top">T<font face="Verdana" size="2">his quest was submitted by Kabal. It
            begins with Lieutenant Krofer in <a href="../zone/wakeningland.html">Wakening Land</a>.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            This quest is most likely given after completing the <a href="wakeninglandmessenger.html">Wakening
            Land Messenger</a> quest. You can skip to it directly however by using it's key
            phrase.&nbsp;<br>

            His third ques is initiated by saying &quot;I am prepared&quot;.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            He will then give you a&nbsp;Letter for War&nbsp;to take to Staff Sergeant Drioc in Kael,
            who upon receiving the&nbsp;Letter for War will peruse, sign it, say to return&nbsp;it to
            Krofer and that the troops will be on the way shortly.<br>
            <br>
            Return the note to Krofer (who gives you another note to return to him after the battle)
            and 4 giants spawn at the Kael zone 2 Berserkers, 1 Acolyte and&nbsp;1 Corporal.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Follow them to the NE camp of Sifaye (1762, -285) and wait for the Corporal to say his
            squad is ready.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Say &quot;Troop Attack&quot; and they will charge the Sifaye Village. The surprise is 4
            Sylvan Guardians all blue to yellow to a 54 Shaman will pop up to help defend the Sifaye
            camp.</font> &nbsp; <br>
              <font size="2"><br>
            This is a scripted sequence and you are meant to lose. Return to Krofer with the mission
            report and he will send you inside to see Drioc again. Drioc will then curse and rage and
            tell you that you must explain it to his finacier and gives you the failure report back. <br>
            <br>
            Although he does not divulge who his finacier is it I can tell you that it is an NPC named
            Noble Helssen who is located next to Wenglawks in the Noble's building. <br>
            <br>
            If you hand Helssen the failure notice he will inform you that it was not your fault and
            that Drioc was to blame. He then will divulge that he seeks to not only control the
            wakening land but the very force of Growth itself.<br>
            <br>
            He wants you to help him accomplish this goal. He will hand you a tablet inscribed with
            the runes of binding and tell you to seek out a turtle by the name of Corudoth in the
            Iceclad Ocean. He will give you an <a href="../equipment/enchantedveliummask.html">Enchanted Velium Mask</a>
              to help you find Corudoth. <br>
            <br>
            Corudoth can be found under a chunk of ice at approximately -6000,+6000 in Iceclad. If you
            tell him that he &quot;owes Helssen&quot; he will deny owing Helssen anything. Handing him
            the tablet however will change his tune.<br>
            <br>
            I am going to post the logs of my text with Corudoth to help give the complete
            storyline...<br>
            <br>
            Corudoth curses and goes into a fit of frustration before finally giving in. The ancient
            sea turtle finally says, 'Fine. I dont know what Helssen wants with that but I know where
            you can find it. Years and years back I traveled with what was called the Icy Mugs. We
            were a mercenary company out for fun and profit, and there was plenty of that. During our
            adventures we ran across a great many foes. <br>
            <br>
            You say, 'what great foes'<p>Corudoth says 'Yes. One of note was the vile and evil
            sorcerer Rosh. A better example of depravtity and anti-morality I cannot think of. He
            researched magics destined to end all life on this cold chunk of rock and snow. We made it
            our mission to destroy him. In the end we defeated him, but alas our friend and comrade
            was slain. Poor Abrams was left cursed forever to wander that spire of ultimate loathing,
            the Tower of Frozen Shadow. </p>
            <p>You say, 'who is abrams'</p>
            <p>Corudoth says 'Abrams was a brave warrior and a good friend. His great maul could
            always be counted on to strike true as he used his body to shield others from greivous
            wounds. He sacrificed himself to save us from the eternal suffering he now endures up in
            that dark tower. The book you now seek, is in his possesion. You must first destroy his
            tormented form to free him from his madness. Tell him you seek the Arcanum and then give
            him the lock of hair I just gave you. You also will need the key? </p>
            <p>You say, 'what key'</p>
            <p>Corudoth says 'We ambushed Rosh on an expedition into the cursed Tower. When we faced
            him, Abrams ran forward and grabbed the Arcanum. He held it to his chest as lightning and
            flame rained down upon him. With Rosh busy trying to save his book it gave Petcas and I
            enough time to strike Rosh down. We went to Abrams and found our friend left a smoking
            pile of Coldain ruin. He underwent a strange transformation in which the Arcanum was lost.
            We decided Petcas should keep the key. </p>
            <p>You say, 'who is Petcas?'</p>
            <p>Corudoth says 'Petcas has retired from the life of an adventurer as I have. I would not
            tell you where he is as he is a good friend, but what I owe Helssen is stronger than
            comraderie or even friendship so I must comply; it is the word of Veeshan. Petcas now owns
            a small bar in the Coldain city of Thurgadin. To get the key you must fight your way into
            the city and kill Petcas. I wish you a most horrendous death Dark Elf. Now leave me to my
            sleep. <br>
            <br>
            Petcas can be found in a building just to the right of the Thurgadin zone when facing out
            from Icewell Keep. He drops an ancient rusted key.<br>
            <br>
            Abrams ghost can be found on the sixth floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadow. His ghost goes
            by the name of an incoherant spirit and has a very long spawn time. Killing the ghost will
            spawn Abrams. Hand him his beard and he will hand you the Arcanum of Rosh.<br>
            <br>
            Return the Arcanum and the Ancient Rusted Key to Helssen and he will give you a voucher.
            There are three rewards here and it is your choice which path to take.<br>
            <br>
            He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with Kellek for &quot;an item worthy of a
            hearty and rugged combatant.&quot; This reward is the <a href="../equipment/collarofthestorm.html">Collar of the Storm</a>.<br>
            <br>
            He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with Wenglawks for &quot;an item to be
            worn by only the most pious.&quot; This reward is the <a href="../equipment/girdleofreflection.html">Girdle of Reflection</a>.<br>
            <br>
            He will tell you that you can redeem the voucher with him for &quot;a sorcerous trinket of
            his own design&quot;. This reward is <a href="../equipment/helssensprismatictrinket.html">Helssen's Prismatic Trinket</a>.</font></p>
