     Tower of Frozen Shadow is a dungeon in the <a href="icecladocean.shtml">Iceclad

     <br>

     <br>

     </span></u></b><o:p>Each level has at least two mirrors. One mirror leads to Iceclad Ocean and

     does not require a key. To use this mirror each person must individually

     click on the exit mirror. The second mirror leads to the next floor. These

     mirrors typically require a key but only one person per group needs to have

     the key. This person clicks on the mirror to take everyone in the general

     vicinity of the mirror to the next level. (The exception to this is the 6<sup>th</sup>

     floor, which I will explain later in that section)<br>

     <br>

     All mobs in the Tower with the exception of a few rare named mobs give

     Tserrina faction hits. Tserrina is the boss mob of the ToFS. She is a

     caster and has several nice drops most of them pure caster based. There are

     a whole bunch of named mobs throughout the different levels and some of

     them have some pretty nice drops. From the 4<sup>th</sup> floor up I have

     seen every mob have a chance to drop various level 39 Velious spells.<br>

     <br>

     This zone brings many rewards to those who come here. It can also bring

     much suffering. There is no zoning between floors. That means that mobs can

     bring aggro from previous floors. While it does not happen much, there is

     the possibility for this to happen. The keys are all lore and no drop. That

     means that you cannot have a spare in the bank and they stay on your

     corpse.<br>

     <br>

     When traveling here HIGHLY suggest someone with an evacuate spell or a

     second set of keys in someone’s bank.<br>

     On this floor there are Ice Shades, Shadowbones, and Fading Shadow Guards.

     All of them are undead. The zone in for this level is a safe spot and

     nothing will attack you.<br>

     <br>

     Immediately out the safe passage is a large room with several halls

     branching off of it. Be careful when not in a hallway because the center

     room is very slick and there is a pit in the middle of it.<br>

     <br>

     On the first floor instead of going to the right to go to the next level if

     you go to the left there is another mirror. With the key from Tserrina you

     can go straight to the 7<sup>th</sup> floor.<br>

     <br>

     All mobs on this floor are undead. Most of the mobs on this floor are

     casters. They range from teachers and scholars to students. This level is

     the ghostly remains of a school. The first mob you come up against is the

     Librarian and her assistant. She is the toughest normal mob on this floor.<br>

     <br>

     There are a few other named mobs on this floor but I have no knowledge of

     their uses.<br>

     into the back room and on the left wall is the exit mirror. The exit mirror

     is partially blocked from view by a support brace when you first walk into

     the room.<br>

     <br>

     This floor has mostly undead mobs but there are a few Armored Shadows that

     are summoned creatures and can see through invisibility to undead.<br>

     <br>

     There is a named mob on this floor called an Angry Chef. She is a caster

     but in over twenty slayings of her she has yet to drop anything. If you are

     of the level to be fighting here she sometimes does not seem worth the

     hassle. She is a tough mob for her level.<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Zone out:</b> Go to the right and

     you will see a door. It is locked and requires the Frosty Key. Follow the

     passage to the exit mirror.<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Zone to the next level: </b>Go

     right. Take the first right. This curves around and takes you the same way

     you were heading when you zoned in. Do not deviate from this path all

     though you will zig zag a line to the back of the zone. There it will curve

     so you are facing the zone in spot. At this point it looks like a dead end.

     You will be facing what looks like a garbage incinerator door. This is a

     hidden wall and you can walk through it. Continue around to the exit

     mirror.<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Keyholder: </b>Cara Omica<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Safest Travel:</b> Invisibility

     (kind of)<br>

     <br>

     As for the safest travel, I will say this: There are both undead mobs and

     normal mobs on this level. I would say about 90% of the mobs are normal.

     The plus side is that most of the undead mobs cannot see through

     invisibility. I said <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">MOST</b>, be

     careful! On the other hand 100% of the normal mobs on this level can see

     through invisibility to undead.<br>

     <br>

     The zone is not a safe spot so do not zone in visible expecting to be safe.

     Where you zone in there are at least three mobs that wander by. Be very

     careful one mob can quickly turn into eight on this floor.<br>

     <br>

     This floor has traps down some of the passageways. The traps lead you down

     to a sub-floor. If you fall through you are in a passage. Follow this

     passage to the center of the sub-floor. There is a pot. If you click on the

     pot it will take you back to where you zoned in.<br>

     <br>

     I have heard people say that only the undead are the placeholders for

     Amanhoteph but if you track after every mob you will see that any mob on

     that floor can spawn him. I have however seen him on the path to the next

     zone more times than any other spot.<br>

     <br>

     Cara Omica spawns past the hidden wall on the way to the exit mirror. When

     killing her in her room you can see the mirror to the next level. It is not

     uncommon to come into this level to have Cara already up. This level is a

     maze and not everyone knows the way to the next level and the fact that as

     soon as Amanhoteph dies Cira spawns.<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Zone out: </b>After zoning in do not

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Zone to the next level: </b>It is

     <br>

     The zone in point is a safe area, with exception. I typically have everyone

     move to the left-hand wall without using their mouse to control their

     character. It is horrible on the expedition to have someone use their mouse

     and accidentally click on the exit mirror to make the party go all the way

     down and get them. As long as you don’t go to far you will not provoke

     and attack from any mobs.<br>

     <br>

     All mobs here are undead. If you can get to this floor then you should not

     have any troubles with this level at all. This level is much easier than

     the previous floor. Some of the mobs on this floor may even be green to

     you. The golems are the highest normal mob on this floor and they are right

     next to the zone in point.<br>

     <br>

     The Enraged Relative however is a different story. After becoming relaxed

     on this floor he will take you by surprise. This mob is definitely the boss

     mob for this level. He will take quite a beating and kindly return one back

     to the group.<br>

     specters. Hug the left wall all the way around the room and in the back

     right of the room is a closet with the mirror. In this room to the right is

     a dragon statue. Be careful because he is a trap. If you step to far away

     from the wall or to close to it you will get hit with a 500pt breath weapon

     that also dispells. To top that off if you have not cleared the room the

     specters will gladly help the trap finish you off.<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Zone to the next level:</b> If you

     take the first right and follow that path all the way around and up the

     stairs you will find the next mirror. Be careful on the ledge getting to

     close can provoke an attack from the specters below. This is the weird

     floor. The next mirror is not a keyed mirror. Everyone has to click on the

     mirror to progress.<br>

     There are two kinds of mobs on this level Icy Shades and Shadow Guardians.

     Both of these mobs offer great experience all the way through 50. After 50

     they give experience about every two in five mobs.<br>

     <br>

     The zone in is a safe spot once again. I think this is truly the best place

     to pull mobs to in this zone. From the start a well-balanced group can pull

     almost the whole floor.<br>

     <br>

     There is a mob on this floor called the incoherent spirit. He is the

     placeholder for the Lucid Sprit of Abrams. Abrams spawns around twenty

     percent of the time immediately after the Incoherent Spirit dies. Abrams is

     used in a quest and is indifferent to almost everyone. You can however kill

     him for some experience with out worries of a faction hit.<br>

     On this floor you zone into a fight. There are Shade Bats. Upon their

     deaths they immediately spawn an Enraged Vampire. The Vampires proc a spell

     that that completely drains your stamina. After killing all of the bats in

     this area start to buff up. With a good puller you can pull the rest of the

     bats from Val Sherra’s area with out pulling him.<br>

     <br>

     Val Sherra is a caster and is most definitely the hardest mob up to this

     point. I believe that he pulls most of his spells from the necro/sk line of

     spells. He also can charm so get your magic resistance up. It is best to

     pull the bats then go up and kill Val Sherra where he stands because he

     likes to gate when he is low on life.<br>

     allows you to take the left tunnel on the first floor and come straight to

     7<sup>th</sup> floor mirror room)<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Placeholder:</b> The Shrouded Bats

     on this level can all spawn Tserrina<br>

     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Safest Travel:</b> Neither (Drakes

     on this floor can see through both Invisibility and Invisibility to

     Undead.)<br>

     <br>

     When you zone in it is another safe spot. To get to Tserrina you must pass

     a trap. A quick disarm and you are on the way. In the room with the spiral

     stair case there is a hidden wall in the back. Behind that are Shrouded

     Bats. Killing these all have a chance to instantly spawn Tserrina.<br>

     <br>

     If you have a force big enough to kill Tserrina you should have no problems

     keeping this floor clear. I have killed Tserrina both near the entrance and

     in the back of the room where all the bats spawn and both times seemed to

     go smoothly. Fighting her in the back seemed easier due to the fact that

     you really do not have to worry about the other mobs on the floor and can

     concentrate on killing Tserrina.<br>
