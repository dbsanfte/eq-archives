      <P><FONT face=Verdana></FONT></P><FONT face=Verdana>
      <P>Learning and developing skills are the keys to a character's success. 
      Casting skills can fizzle less with better skills, melee types can have 
      better hit that occur more often with high skills and certain armor or 
      items can be crafted only with master level trade skills.&nbsp; Some 
      skills are triggered automatically, while others are used when the player 
      performs a certain function.&nbsp;There are many shared skills but some 
      are specific to class or race.</P>
      <P>The best way to increase your skills is to use them!&nbsp; Some skills 
      need to be&nbsp;"trained" before you can use them.&nbsp; You do this 
      by&nbsp;visiting your class Guild Hall and approaching a trainer.&nbsp; 
      You can train one point in certain skills to&nbsp;get you started in 
      them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some skills can only be raised by using them after a 
      certain skill level, this includes Trade Skills.</P>
      <P>Here is a short description that was posted by Everquest&nbsp;on each 
      skill.&nbsp; Some are melee based, while others are based in spell casting 
      or learining the art of a Trade skill.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Abjuration<BR></FONT></B>One of 
      the several skills related to the art of magic, abjuration deals with 
      defensive magic; for example, a spell that enables the character to take 
      less damage from extreme cold.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Alchemy<BR></FONT></B>A shaman of 
      accomplished experience is capable of brewing various potions, many of 
      which are magical in nature. Most of these potions are beneficial in some 
      way, offering enhanced physical ability for example, so they are in demand 
      by many adventurers.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Alteration</FONT><BR></B>Another 
      of the several skills related to the art of magic, alteration deals with 
      changing things, whether it is illusion or an actual physical change. An 
      example would be a spell that teleports something, or that enables a 
      character to move faster, or forces him or her to move more slowly. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Archery<BR></FONT></B>In addition 
      to the skills dealing with melee combat, range weapons are also prevalent 
      in the world. The skill of archery deals with a character's efficacy in 
      using bows, crossbows, and other, similar devices.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Apply Poison<BR></FONT></B>An 
      ability that is limited to rogues, apply poison enables them to inflict 
      even more damage to their foes after the initial strike. There are 
      numerous steps to learn and perfect in order to use this skill 
      effectively.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Backstab</FONT><BR></B>The rogue 
      has many unique skills in his repertoire, including the ability to strike 
      at his opponent from behind, often inflicting a great deal of damage in 
      one blow.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Bash<BR></FONT></B>Certain races 
      and classes have the ability to disorient an opponent, thereby lowering 
      his defenses and also interrupting the process of spellcasting.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Bind Wound</FONT><BR></B>Bandages 
      can be used to stanch the flow of blood from a wound, thereby healing the 
      victim to some extent. This can only be used on seriously injured patients 
      who are not actively pursuing some other activity.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Block</FONT><BR></B>Negating an 
      attack by deflecting the blow with one's body is a skill unique to the 
      monk, and blocking is one of several skills available to that class.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Channeling<BR></FONT></B>One of 
      the several skills related to the art of magic, channeling allows you to 
      continue casting without being interrupted if you are hit while casting 
      the spell. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Conjuration<BR></FONT></B>Another 
      of the several skills related to the art of magic, conjuration brings 
      something from elsewhere into the world, whether they are elemental 
      creatures or powerful clouds of energy. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Disarm<BR></FONT></B>This skill 
      allows the combatant to dislodge a wielded weapon from his opponent's 
      hands, knocking it to the ground and forcing him, at least for the moment, 
      to fight hand-to-hand.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Divination</FONT><BR></B>Another 
      of the several skills related to the art of magic, spells of divination 
      allow the caster to both detect things previously concealed and conceal 
      things previously visible. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Dodge<BR></FONT></B>One of the 
      better ways to negate damage is to completely avoid the blow itself, and 
      the skill of dodging allows the combatant to do just that. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Double Attack</FONT><BR></B>When a 
      fighter becomes particularly adept at his craft, he may become fast enough 
      to hit his opponent twice in the time it would normally take to hit once. 
      Needless to say, this can be very advantageous in a difficult battle.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Dual Wield<BR></FONT></B>Certain 
      classes are able to wield a weapon effectively in both hands, thereby 
      increasing the number of attacks and thus the amount of damage inflicted 
      in a given period of time. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Evocation<BR></FONT></B>Another of 
      the several skills related to the art of magic, evocation deals with 
      things that go boom. Fireballs, force spells, etc., all fall under the 
      auspices of this offensive skill. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Feign Death</FONT><BR></B>Some 
      creatures are said to pretend to be dead, in order to fool their attackers 
      into leaving them alone. Clever monks have mimicked this behavior and 
      found it to be very effective for them, too.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Flying Kick<BR></FONT></B>The 
      monk's body is a finely honed weapon, as this rather acrobatic strike 
      demonstrates. The force of a flying kick is much greater, due to the 
      length of one's legs, than a blow from the upper extremity.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Foraging<BR></FONT></B>Being at 
      home in the wilderness has many benefits, including the ability to forage 
      food. This skill has been known to save quite a few trips back to town 
      when the supplies have inadvertently run out mid-quest. Only those whose 
      classes bring them in tune with nature have refined this ability to any 
      degree.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT 
      color=#ffff00>Hand-to-Hand<BR></FONT></B>Although this skill can be 
      mastered only by monks, most every other class can at least throw the 
      occasional punch. Besides, one never knows when one might be relieved of 
      one's weapon, both during combat and at other times. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Hide</FONT><BR></B>Hiding from an 
      opponent can be a valuable skill to learn, particularly if one finds 
      oneself without defenses unexpectedly. It should be mentioned, however, 
      that some creatures are able to see better than others. Therefore, this 
      skill is not foolproof.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Kick</FONT><BR></B>Being able to 
      dish out a bit more damage during combat is attractive to many of the 
      melee classes in the game, and kicking one's opponent in unpleasant places 
      in between sword swings does just that.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Meditate</FONT><BR></B>Another of 
      the several skills related to the art of magic, meditation allows casters 
      to memorize spells and regain their mana more quickly. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Melee Weapons</FONT><BR></B>Combat 
      is rather integral to the game, and there are a variety of weapons 
      available to the combatant. In general, these weapons are broken up into 
      three categories, blunt, slashing, and piercing, as well as whether they 
      require one or two hands to wield. The better one is at any of these 
      separate skills, the more effective they are with that weapon. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Musical 
      Instruments</FONT><BR></B>Certain bard songs require certain instruments, 
      and the better the minstrel is at playing these instruments, the more 
      effective he or she will be at playing those songs. Each type of 
      instrument learned, whether it is percussion, string, brass or wind, can 
      improve the musician's effectiveness by enhancing their magical 
      compositions.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Pick Lock<BR></FONT></B>Oftentimes 
      finding that precise key is just too time consuming or expensive, and the 
      lock picking abilities of the Rogue class come in very handy. Bards, being 
      somewhat roguish themselves, also have this ability.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Pick Pocket<BR></FONT></B>Rogues, 
      particularly the halfling variety because of their unique and convenient 
      size, have a tendency to lighten those overly heavy pockets of passers-by, 
      but only as a courtesy, of course. Their intended victims, however, will 
      at times detect this activity and will rarely appreciate the attempt. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Safe Fall<BR></FONT></B>Monks, 
      being typically unencumbered by heavy armor and weapons, often work on 
      their ability to fall great distances, yet still land on their feet 
      incurring minimal if any damage. Bards and rogues also practice this 
      skill.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Sense 
      Heading</FONT><BR></B>Although compasses are known to exist, they are also 
      typically rare and expensive. Nearly anyone can learn to determine their 
      heading and direction if they are persistent. Then again, they are also 
      often times wrong. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Singing<BR></FONT></B>Bards (one 
      can at least hope) have great singing voices. And the better they are at 
      this art, the more effective their songs, which are themselves often 
      magical in nature. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Sneak</FONT><BR></B>Some races are 
      better at sneaking than others because of size, but class is also an 
      important factor. In order to bypass a dangerous enemy, it might be 
      advisable to slow one's movement and creep cautiously along, being very 
      quiet.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Specialization<BR></FONT></B>Magic 
      users of advanced experience levels tend to specialize in one or another 
      of the skills available to them, depending on which type of magic they 
      find most useful. Specializing in one of those areas allows casters to 
      cast spells using less mana and with a higher rate of success.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Swimming<BR></FONT></B>Many areas 
      in the world of Norrath are covered by water, and one's ability to 
      maneuver in that environment is directly related to one's skill level in 
      swimming. As one becomes more adept at this skill, it is possible to move 
      much faster in the water, and possibly even remain underwater for a bit 
      longer as well.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Tracking<BR></FONT></B>Rangers, 
      druids and bards, through natural or magical abilities, are able to follow 
      traces of others over varying distances. They have never been known to 
      share the secret of this ability with the other classes, which leads one 
      to believe that it is a very difficult skill. </P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Taunt<BR></FONT></B>Taunting an 
      attacker to attack oneself instead of another is a method by which one 
      member of a team or group can help prevent the death of another, if 
      successful. Warriors in particular are known to do this in order to 
      protect the physically weaker magic users of their parties.</P>
      <P align=justify><B><FONT color=#ffff00>Trade Skills<BR></FONT></B>The 
      citizens of Norrath have also developed a number of trade skills over the 
      course of their history, as would any civilized world. Merchants on all 
      continents buy and sell components to supply those who opt to learn these 
      skills, be they apprentice or master. Some learn the skills to feed 
      themselves, to earn money, or simply to provide themselves with items they 
      would otherwise lack, due to their cost. Some of the trade skills widely 
      practiced on Norrath are: </P>
