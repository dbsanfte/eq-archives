<p>Kerra Island is the home of some feline creatures that are friendly to some,
unfortunately not to their Erudite neighbors. It connects with <a href="toxforest.html">Tox
Forest</a>. The following information was submitted by Morbis:<br>
<br>
This outside dungeon is great for a FULL lvl 10 group.&nbsp; You will need 3
tanks(magician pets are fine) and 3 spell casters, a cleric if the tanks are players from
another continent. At the entrance is a group of about 15 lvl 5-7 kerran males and females
(females are stronger and cast spells). You will need to take them out carefully, in small
groups of 5-7 kerrans. Once you take out these kerrans the isle is yours. You will then
want to hunt pridesmen and clawknights for exp, which you can lure from the docks or small
cave. The toughest monster seen in Kerra Isle zone is the Kerran High Guard. No one knows
his level, but we assume it is lvl 15+. You will need your group of lvl 10 players to take
him out, as he actually spawns in the zone enterance! Now that EQ is in retail, you
shouldnt have a hard time filling your group with lvl 10s. <br>
<br>
There is an Island in the bay where Heretic Necromancers spawn. These can be taken by 15th
level players easily.<br>
<br>
To get to Kerra Isle zone, follow the mountainside to the right of the entrance into Tox,
and then follow the shoreline to the left.&nbsp; You will see a dock, jump straight off it
and swim (for about 2 min at lvl 10) till you reach another shore. Go left till you see
the entrance, you'll know when you see it. Happy hunting.<br>
