              This quest begins by talking to the two scorpikus overlooking the

              You say, 'what ancient armor?'
              <p>Xlixinar Arcut says 'You wish the armor of our ancestors? The
              armor donned by the Guard whose duty was to protect the Chosen? A
              warrior relies not on strength alone, but many virtues. If a
              warrior learns to balance each virtue, then he may be fit to guard
              the Chosen. Each piece of armor reflects a [virtue], and each
              virtue must be learned before the armor is given.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what virtue?'<br>
              <br>
              Xlixinar Arcut says 'The armor I keep are the symbols of focus,
              sacrifice, and perseverence. The [helm], [pauldrons], [vambraces],
              and [breastplate]. You must bring me proof that you know these
              virtues before attaining the armor I keep. I also will need a
              piece of Banded armor of the type you desire. My brother keeps the
              other pieces.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what helm?'<br>
              <br>
              Xlixinar Arcut says 'You must first learn focus before being
              awarded the legionnaire scale helm. The Swifttails are the masters
              of focus and as such you will learn from the Grand Master of the
              Court. It has been so long, I do not know who is Grand Master now.
              Whoever it is, give him this note and follow his instruction. Once
              you have learned, return to us and the helm will be yours.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>You say, 'what pauldrons?'<br>
              <br>
              Xlixinar Arcut says 'Upon our shoulders we carry the virtue of
              sacrifice. Our bodies are ruined in the name of our Lord. Pain and
              suffering please him and our ancestors. Without knowing sacrifice,
              a warrior can never protect his charge from harm as he sees
              himself as greater than his duty. The mystics embody sacrifice.
              Find their highest authority and give him this note. He will
              recognize it.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what <a href="../equipment/trooperscalevambraces.html">vambraces</a>?'<br>
              <br>
              Xlixinar Arcut says 'Our arms carry more than the weapons of war
              and the hands that make use of them. We sacrifice the strength in
              our arms to carry our duties and obligations. Unless we can
              sacrifice our own bodies and abilities to carry these ideals, we
              will never be fit to protect the Chosen. Take this note to the
              master of the mystics in Cabilis, he will teach you a lesson in
              sacrifice.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what breastplate?'<br>
              <br>
              Xlixinar Arcut says 'The monk is the master of focus, the shaman
              of sacrifice and the shadowknight of righteousness. Lastly, our
              brothers of the dark know confidence. It is then our duty to know
              perseverence more than any other. When others fall from spear and
              sword, we must stand. When others are washed away by fire and ice,
              we must stand. When others are frustrated and confused, we must
              continue on. There is a warrior in the swamp near the city. He is
              an exile, like my brother and I. He knows more about&nbsp;<br>
              being a warrior than any baron in Cabilis. Take this note to him.&nbsp;<br>

              Drixiv Arcut says 'You wish the armor of our ancestors? The armor
              donned by the Guard whose duty was to protect the Chosen? A

              <br>
              Drixiv Arcut says 'The virtues symbolized by the armor I keep are
              confidence and righteousness. The [boots], [greaves], [gauntlets],
              and [bracers]. Bring me proof that you have mastered these virtues
              as well as a piece of Banded armor of the type you desire and the
              appropriate armor shall be yours, Binx . If you wish the other
              pieces you must speak to my brother.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what boots?'<br>
              <br>
              Drixiv Arcut says 'You wish the boots worn by the ancients? Then
              you must first master the virtue of confidence. For our brothers
              of the dead, confidence is the virtue that allows them to control
              the forces that would tear them apart if they knew it not. When a
              warrior steps, he must be confident, for a weak step cannot crush
              your enemies. Take this note to the current Harbinger in Cabilis
              and learn from him.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what greaves?'<br>
              <br>
              Drixiv Arcut says 'Our legs move us forward. If we move with
              hesitance we will surely fall and leave our charge exposed. Before
              you can wear the greaves, you must learn from the Brood of Kotiz.
              For if they did not wield their powers over the dead with
              confidence, their life forces would be sucked from them instantly,
              leaving them empty husks. Take this note to the Harbinger and
              listen to his instructions.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what gauntlets?'<br>
              <br>
              Drixiv Arcut says 'Our hands are our most useful and deadly
              instruments, after our minds. When we use them other than in
              service of our lord and ancestors, our actions are false. Without
              knowing righteousness we can never be sure if our actions are in
              the name of fear. The Chosen, the Crusaders of Greenmist, know
              fear intimately. Their actions are never without the blessing of
              our lord. Take this note to the Archduke. He will recognize my
              writing and instruct you.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'what bracers'<br>
              <br>
              Drixiv Arcut says 'The bracers of our ancestors embody
              righteousness. When we strike, and our forearms are soaked in the
              blood of our enemies, our purpose must be pure. Else that blood
              will burn our souls and anger that which we live for. Go and find
              the Archduke in Cabilis and give him my note. He will teach you of
              righteousness. For if our chosen did not know righteousness, our
              people would not be. Go!</p>
