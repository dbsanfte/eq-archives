      face="Times New Roman" color=#ffffff>Patch Message:<BR><BR>** Planes of 
      Power Pre-Order Bonus ** <BR><BR>If you pre-order the PoP expansion you 
      will be able to purchase the Planes of Power original soundtrack CD for 
      just an additional $4.95. <BR><BR><BR>*** Important Notice about Alternate 
      Advancement *** <BR><BR>- When a character has 30 or more AA points, they 
      will receive a red message stating: <BR><BR>Warning: You are currently 
      over the earned Advancement point limit of 30. Please spend some of your 
      stored AA points. You will not be able to earn further AA points until you 
      have fewer than 30. On October 21, 2002, all points over 30 in your AA 
      pool will be deleted. <BR><BR>It seems appropriate that Advancement points 
      earned prior to the release of Planes of Power be used for abilities from 
      earlier expansions. In addition, many of the Luclin abilities are 
      pre-requisites for Planes of Power abilities. When the servers come up on 
      October 21st, all unused Alternate Advancement point pools over 30 will be 
      wiped. <BR><BR><BR>** New Spell Effects ** <BR><BR>We are implementing a 
      few new spell effects using our new particle effects engine with this 
      patch as a way of easing into the new system. The new effects are faster 
      and give you more control over how they look. We have changed the Display 
      Options menu to accommodate these new options. <BR><BR>On the Display tab 
      of the options window you will now find four options regarding particle 
      effects. The first three, listed under Spell Particles are Near Clip 
      Plane, Density and Opacity. These are the options for controlling the new 
      particle effects. They will not change the old particle effects. The old 
      particles are controlled using the Other Particles option. <BR><BR>Note on 
      Near Clip Plane: This option chooses how close to you particles cease to 
      be visible. So Near allows particles to be seen right up to the character. 
      Farthest will clip out particles near the character and only show those at 
      the 'farthest' distance. <BR><BR>Note on Opacity: This feature works at 
      all settings for cards that support TnL. For other cards setting Opacity 
      to 0% will turn off the effects and any other setting will show them 
      fully. <BR><BR>We'll leave it up to you to discover which spells have the 
      new particles... <BR><BR><BR>** Alternate Advancement ** <BR><BR>- 
      Beastlords now have access to the Mend Companion ability. <BR>- Beastlords 
      now have access to three unique class alternate advancements. <BR>- 
      Permanent Illusion used with Wolf Form should no longer result in a wolf 
      tinted by the Enchanter's robe. <BR>- Updated Finishing Blow - <BR>"This 
      ability gives you a chance to finish off an NPC that is below 10 percent 
      health and fleeing with a single blow. The first level works on NPC's 
      below 50, the second on NPC's below 52, and the third on NPC's below 54. 
      (Non-Warriors must first train one level of Combat Fury to use this 
      ability.) " <BR>- Improved Combat Fury for non-warriors to give more value 
      to the points spent after level 1. <BR><BR><BR><BR>** Spells ** <BR><BR>- 
      New Druid and Shaman heal spells are available. <BR>- The "Your XXX Spell 
      Has Worn Off" messages for DoT spells will now go to the right character. 
      <BR>- Illusions that are of a character type that can't wear armor, such 
      as werewolf, will no longer cause the character to be naked when the 
      illusion drops. <BR>- Fixed the Illusion wolf form swimming animation. 
      <BR>- Shaman and Beastlord Shrink spell has had its location restriction 
      removed. <BR>- The outcasts of Echo Caverns have deciphered new magics 
      that allow Dark Knights to channel the essence of terror into their 
      enemies minds. While their initial findings have proven very powerful, 
      rumors exist of even greater magics that might channel the nightmares of 
      Terris Thule herself into the minds of mortals. Where that power might be 
      found is not yet known. <BR><BR><BR>** Items ** <BR><BR>- Items that grant 
      bonuses to bandage skill should be working now. <BR>- Guise of the Hunter 
      no longer makes the user appear to be naked. <BR>- Validus Custodus Battle 
      Axe no longer looks like a bard mandolin when equipped by a pet. 
      <BR><BR><BR>** PvP Servers and Gameplay ** <BR><BR>- The recent resist 
      changes have been adjusted for PvP. They will not be exactly as they were 
      prior to the resist change, but they should be reasonable now. Please let 
      us know if you feel they need further adjustment. <BR>- Player characters 
      will no longer lose experience in the Arena areas on the Sullon Zek 
      server. <BR>- A player character can no longer tell his pet to attack 
      another player's horse when not on a PvP area or in a duel. <BR>- Kael, 
      Skyshrine, and Thurgadin on Sullon Zek no longer have the newbie 
      protection code active. <BR>- Players should once again be able to use 
      level-restricted clickable buffs on the Sullon Zek server. <BR><BR><BR>** 
      Pets ** <BR><BR>- Improved Beastlord pets to scale more reasonably with 
      the level of the Beastlord after level 40. This also puts them into line 
      with the last round of pet balancing, which did not improve beastlord pets 
      at the time. <BR><BR><BR>** Horses ** <BR><BR>- Locate corpse songs/spells 
      should now work on horseback. <BR>- Detect traps should also now work on 
      horseback. <BR>- Fixed a bug that was preventing manipulation of inventory 
      items if a character died with coins on the cursor. <BR>- Invisibility on 
      horseback should now make your horse invisible to NPCs as it does the 
      rider. <BR>- Zoning with Levitate/Levitation and horse no longer causes 
      the levitation to fail. <BR>- Fixed a bug that would cause the horse 
      'buff' to disappear when zoning in some zones. <BR>- Player characters on 
      horseback can now be hit by various missiles, such as arrows, thrown 
      weapons or the various bolt spells from PCs and NPCs. <BR>- Call of the 
      Hero should no longer put people under the world when the caster is on 
      horseback. <BR>- Dragging a corpse while on a horse will no longer cause 
      the corpse fall under the world. <BR>- You can now right click on spells 
      to arrange your spell book when on a horse. <BR><BR><BR>** Zone Specific 
      ** <BR><BR>- We believe that we fixed the major source of lockups caused 
      for players in certain zones such as the Great Divide and Shadowhaven. 
      <BR>- Hierophant Oxyn in East Cabilis will be showing up again. 
      <BR><BR><BR>*** The Following User Interface Files have been changed with 
      this patch *** <BR><BR>Updated: <BR>equi.xml <BR>equi_aawindow.xml 
      <BR>equi_optionswindow.xml <BR><BR>New: <BR>equi_gemsgamewnd.xml 
      <BR><BR><BR>** User Interface ** <BR><BR>- The New User Interface will 
      default to ON. Officially, it is now just The User Interface and the other 
      interface is now the Old User Interface. <IMG 
      src="http://ubb.fiveassedmonkey.net/ubbthreads/images/icons/smile.gif"> 
      <BR>- The Fade to Transparency option should now affect all bags. <BR>- 
      PC/NPC name on/off settings will now be saved when leaving the game. <BR>- 
      CTRL key being pressed while looking up or down no longer creates a cycle 
      of constant panning up or down of the camera. <BR>- Wrapping in the middle 
      of the first word in an Item Tag no longer causes all text from then on 
      being included in the tag. <BR>- Fixed bug with Item Tags for items that 
      contain comma's in their name. <BR>- Pet sit button will now change to 
      stand button if the pet is already sitting. <BR>- Added Item Tags to list 
      of buttons in the Chat Options page, you can now change the color of the 
      tags. <BR>- Item Tags now appear as part of the standard "You have looted 
      an X" messages. <BR>- Hair should no longer disappear in Character 
      Creation of Female Ogre with Luclin models on. <BR>- The Tracking window 
      selection color is no longer the same as a yellow con mob. <BR><BR><BR>** 
      Miscellaneous ** <BR><BR>- Fixed a bug with /hidecorpse making corpses 
      invisible, but still be targetable. <BR>- /Gems is now available in both 
      User Interfaces. <BR><BR><BR>** An Ancient Arises ** <BR><BR>Deep within 
      the recesses of a cave yet unknown to the world at large, a dark, menacing 
      figure parts with the slumber that has kept him silent for ages. The eyes 
      of a magnificently ominous beast pierce through the darkness, his memories 
      flowing freely once more. In the depths of this beast's mind sparks the 
      knowledge that his prophetic savior has been released from the ancient 
      magiks of time, let loose upon an unsuspecting world where the kin shall 
      once again reign supreme. <BR><BR>"My master's shackles have been 
      trounced, and so it is written that in this world that has been so deftly 
      overrun by pitiful mortals, he shall bring power back to those of the 
      scale." The deep rumbling voice of the beast lingers throughout the 
      cavernous hideaway, the barely distinguishable figure of a mighty lizard 
      moves through the stone and dirt and dust as if to leave the gloomy 
      surroundings and find his place once again upon Norrath proper. 
      <BR><BR>"For far too long have I been a prisoner to the overwhelming might 
      that kept me in a state of secluded sleep; for far too long have I been 
      victim to the ancestral elemental forces keeping my master at bay. Now I 
      awaken and bring life back to the disciples; now shall the lifeblood of 
      the Four once again spread the word of prophecy!" The footsteps of this 
      great beast are slow but sure, moving through the depths of the gaping 
      mountain retreat towards the surface. Along the walls, pebbles and stones 
      that have remained dormant for years crumble and crack, falling to the 
      ground as the immense beast walks past. <BR><BR>A maze of dead ends and 
      broken paths twists and turns in the expanse beyond the figure's resting 
      place. The skeletons of those who had tried - and failed - to make their 
      way to him in the years he spent in forced slumber remain, tumbled 
      landmarks of heroes long lost. Slowly he moves, his reptilian eyes darting 
      back and forth looking for any meager meals that may still be available. 
      As he proceeds, he steps atop a mighty echelon, overlooking the bodies 
      that could not defy the magical properties of the cave; fools of mortal 
      thought, incapable of fathoming the power that lay beyond them. "Time has 
      been good to you, my faithful warren... let us both pray that I no longer 
      need you. The time for the revival is at hand."</FONT><STRONG>

      <P><FONT color=#ffff99>Greetings all,</FONT> </P>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff99>Rest assured that there is no 
      plan to institute a "pay for Customer Service" model. We have a large

      <P><FONT color=#ffff99>Customer service will always 
      be an integral part of SOE's products and while we may not respond to 
      every issue as rapidly as we would like, we do try to resolve them all in 
      time. If you find that your issue has not been responded to, please use 
      the Contact a GM link on the EverQuest board. These emails are generally 
      responded to within 48 hours thanks to the diligence of our Email GMs. In 
      addition, while GMs are available in limited numbers 24 hours a day, you 
      may have the best chance of contact during peak usage hours which are from 
      5PM to 8PM PST as this is when most GMs are available.</FONT>

      <P><FONT color=#ffffff>So does this mean they are aware the Customer 
      Service in Everquest is lacking?&nbsp; Perhaps...</FONT></P>
      <P>In my opinion (and only mine) I feel something needs to be done to 
      change the mistake they made when they took GM's away from their assigned 
      servers.&nbsp; Instead of this they decided it would be helpful to have 
      them move in groups from server to server in an effort to improve and 
      speed up urgent petitions.&nbsp; I can safely say since this happen, it 
      seems the customer service has declined at a frightening pace.&nbsp; </P>
      <P>Instead of having a definate time when your server GM would be on 
      (their scheduled work hours), you have to blindly hope this pod of GM's 
      might swing by your server at any random hour of the day.&nbsp; Who's idea 
      was this and why did it not occur to them that this would make it even 
      more difficult to find GM help? /boggle</P></FONT>

      <P>To be honest, when I first read this I was thinking, "Wonderful, more 
      boring levels to kill a million shrooms for!".&nbsp; But I was a bit 
      suprised to see that this might not be the case.&nbsp; Though it appears 
      if you want to do straight experience to get your new levels...well you 
      can, but you also might have another option.&nbsp; To me, though, this is 
      a bit late in the game to be introducing another leveling method and more 
      levels!&nbsp; Yes, I can see being level 65 might let me solo more things 
      and travel the world or Everquest with less people in search of "Phat 
      Lewt", but still something like this 3 years or so into the game?&nbsp; 
      Here is what the Planes of Power Team had to say: </P><FONT size=2>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff00>"For Planes of Power there will be two forms of 
      character advancement: level increase and Planar Advancement.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff00>The level cap will increase to 65. Those levels 
      will have inherent benefits much like previous levels. However, they will 
      not be exactly the same. The rate of advancement in character levels is 
      designed to feel more natural and not take the punishing time commitment 
      required between 51 and 60. We understand the frustration that painfully 
      long levels can cause, and hope not to repeat that experience for players. 
      This, combined with the new bonuses for fighting higher level opponents, 
      should make leveling seem less like something that you have to do and more 
      like something that just happens as you play.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff00>Level advancement is closely tied to Planar 
      Advancement. The systems compliment each other. Planar advancement 
      includes extensions on the Alternate Advancement system, along with new 
      abilities for all classes. Advancing your character is a combination of 
      traditional leveling and advancement through planar abilities. Players who 
      enjoy pure leveling can do so, and people that prefer a combination of 
      level advancement and investment in specific abilities can do that as 
      well.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff00>That's the basic plan for advancement in Planes of 
      Power. We'll continue to refine and tune the specific details as we go 
      through the remaining six weeks of beta testing.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff00>Many of the game balancing and system changes 
      you've seen in Live EverQuest over the last few months have been done with 
      this future advancement in mind. Expect to see more balancing that allows 
      us to once again develop high end content that does not involve marathon 
      battles that are more about attendance and endurance than tactics and 
      skill (e.g. The first time people rounded the corner, stared Trakanon 
      square in the face, and knew they had mere minutes to win or lose, as 
      opposed to the second hour of an end-game encounter.) Creating Planes of 
      Power has been as much about reevaluating existing gameplay as it has been 
      about creating new gameplay.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff00>We believe that advancement should be fun and 
      rewarding. We are very aware of the issues that players are not enjoying 
      in current gameplay and some of the mechanics introduced with other 
      expansions. We plan to avoid contrived "timesinks", so that you'll be 
      playing rather than just spending time. This is not to say that success in 
      Planes of Power doesn't require some time, we just want it to be time that 
      you can enjoy. And even though this is a high level expansion, there will 
      be ways for both casual and hardcore players to advance.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT color=#ffff00>That is as much detail as we can give you right 
      now. We appreciate your patience, and we hope that you'll enjoy Planes of 
      Power.</FONT></P>

      <P align=left>Rumor has it that with the Planes of Power expansion we 
      might see a level increase to 65! Here is a partial list of spells that we 
      might see with the expansion.&nbsp; *Note: Some of these spells might have 
      a increase in classes, changes in damage or benefit and perhaps might not 
      make it at all into the game.</P>
