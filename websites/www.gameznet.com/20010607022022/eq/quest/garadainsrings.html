          <tr>
            <td valign="top">This quest begins with Garadain Glacierbane in the <a href="../zone/easternwastes.html">Eastern Wastes</a>.
              It is a tiered quest. Each step is required to complete the next
              and each step gives an interum reward ring. The ring scales up in
              its bonuses as you go eventually resulting in the <a href="../equipment/veliumcoldaininsigniaring.html">Velium Coldain Insignia Ring</a>.<font SIZE="2">
              <p>1) Garadain Glacierbane wants you to make him a blanket to keep
              him
            </font> <font SIZE="2">warm. Combine two high quality tundra kodiak
              hides and two high quality
            </font> <font SIZE="2">snow cougar pelts in a sewing kit to make the
              blanket. The item was
            </font> <font SIZE="2">trivial at skill 82.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Turning this in will get you a Copper Coldain
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Insignia Ring and the following
              factions:&nbsp;<br>
              Coldain better,
            </font>&nbsp;<br>
              <font SIZE="2">DainFrostreaverIV better,&nbsp;<br>
              Kromzek worse,&nbsp;<br>
              Kromrif worse,&nbsp;<br>
              and some xp.</p>
              <p>2) You must first do the Garadain's Blanket quest to get your
              copper
            </font> <font SIZE="2">ring. After that, Garadain asks you to take
              the axe he gives you to his
            </font> <font SIZE="2">nephew Boridain, and bring back proof that he
              is ok, along with your
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Copper ring. This requires going to
              coordinates -2446, 1544 and giving
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Boridain the Axe.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              At this point, he will start trying to find his Rabid
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Kodiak. Which means he wanders around and
              gets in trouble. You must keep
            </font> <font SIZE="2">him from dying. I highly suggest a minimum of
              two people for this, so
            </font> <font SIZE="2">one can fight and the other can keep
              following Boridain. Some of the
            </font> <font SIZE="2">mobs we had to fight were blue to a 52,
              btw.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Eventually, a Rabid Kodiak
            </font> <font SIZE="2">will spawn. Kill it, loot the rabid pelt, and
              give to Boridain. You
            </font> <font SIZE="2">don't have much time, as he will despawn in a
              minute or two after the
            </font> <font SIZE="2">kodiak is dead. He will give you back a
              Broken Axe. Take this Broken Axe
            </font> <font SIZE="2">(this is your &quot;proof&quot; for Garadain)
              and your Copper ring back to
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Garadain to recieve a Silver ring. There was
              xp but no faction for
            </font> <font SIZE="2">completing this quest.</p>
              <p>3) This time, he wants you to make him a nice knife. You need a
              flawless
            </font> <font SIZE="2">walrus hide, a wooly rhino tusk, and a
              skinning rock.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The walrus hide is
            </font> <font SIZE="2">actually a high quality walrus hide, and the
              tusk is a horn. These can
            </font> <font SIZE="2">be found on the appropriate mobs.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The hard part is the skinning rock,
            </font> <font SIZE="2">which spawns randomly on the ground. Once you
              have all three items,
            </font> <font SIZE="2">combine them in a forge to make Garadain's
              new knife. (This is not
            </font> <font SIZE="2">trivial at skill 56!) Once you have the knife
              made, take it and your
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Silver ring back to Garadain for the gold
              ring.</p>
              <p>4) He wants you to get him a hammer to smith the knife you just
              got for
            </font> <font SIZE="2">him. He gives you a note to give to Tain
              Frostbite, however, you really
            </font> <font SIZE="2">want to give it to Tain Hammerfrost.</p>
              <p>If you head straight out from the dragon bone bridge in the
              eastern
            </font> <font SIZE="2">wastes...you will very soon (after the first
              hill) come to a small
            </font> <font SIZE="2">dwarven cleric named Tain.</p>
              <p>Giving him the note does not do much, but if you hail him,
              he'll mention
            </font> <font SIZE="2">that he was ambushed by frost giants and he
              desperately needs [help].
            </font> <font SIZE="2">If you say &quot;I will help you&quot; he
              sits down (I think he actually despawns
            </font> <font SIZE="2">and despawns immediately, which may be
              important) and says &quot;they will be
            </font> <font SIZE="2">here soon! Kill Grhek and give me his
              vial&quot;.</p>
              <p>4 Frost giants, and one named giant....spawn not too far and
              run up to
            </font> <font SIZE="2">kill the dwarf. They are all blue to a 56.</p>
              <p>If you can kill the named Giant, you can loot a blue vial
              ALL/ALL no
            </font> <font SIZE="2">stats. (it had a name..for the life of me I
              don't recall it...).
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Tradeable.</p>
              <p>If the dwarf despawns and respawns before you can give him the
              vial, you
            </font> <font SIZE="2">get nothing. If you give the vial to him
              before he despawns (or perhaps
            </font> <font SIZE="2">after triggering him again) he gives you a
              Coldain Smithing Hammer, a no
            </font> <font SIZE="2">drop lore item with no stats. Take that back
              to Garadain along with your
            </font> <font SIZE="2">gold ring and he will give you the platinum
              ring.</p>
              <p>5) Garadain asks you to go intercept a rygorr messenger who is
              carrying
            </font> <font SIZE="2">invasion plans. Garadain instructs you to
              give the invasion plans to a
            </font> <font SIZE="2">coldain lookout in his camp. He also tells
              you to intercept the invasion
            </font> <font SIZE="2">force and kill the leader, an orc named
              Scarbrow. When you give the
            </font> <font SIZE="2">lookout the plans, a veritable horde of orcs
              attacks Garadain's outpost.</p>
              <p>Scarbrow leads a force of 2-3 rygorr invaders (lvl 42-44) and
              2-3 rygorr
            </font> <font SIZE="2">oracles. (lvl 42-44)
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Without your assistance the orcs will
              probably wipe out the dwarves,
            </font> <font SIZE="2">however this isn't good because the dwarves
              can outdamage you, and thus
            </font> <font SIZE="2">cause Scarbrow's corpse to poof when you do
              finally kill him.</p>
              <p>The trick is this: The orcs spawn about 100 yards from the
              camp. You
            </font> <font SIZE="2">must intercept Scarbrow before the dwarves
              agro. You can let the dwarves
            </font> <font SIZE="2">kill the other invaders, and I highly suggest
              it, because 7 43+ mobs are
            </font> <font SIZE="2">a pain. Scarbrow himself is about 47th level
              and is a shadow knight.</p>
              <p>Anyway, get Scarbrow away from the action and kill him there
              while one
            </font> <font SIZE="2">person kites the other orcs. There is some
              risk here in that the oracles
            </font> <font SIZE="2">may sow themselves and they can do some real
              damage with spells if you
            </font> <font SIZE="2">try to kite them. But doing it this way only
              required 3 people, whereas
            </font> <font SIZE="2">killing all 7 toe-to-toe would probably
              require 2 groups, even if you
            </font> <font SIZE="2">had an enchanter.</p>
              <p>Scarbrow dropa his head and a Frozen Orb, a very nice range
              slot item.
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Giving his head and your platinum ring to
              Garadain results in the
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring.</p>
              <p>6) Garadain wants you to find out what happened to the coldain
              invasion
            </font> <font SIZE="2">force that tried to attack the giants a while
              back. No evidence has ever
            </font> <font SIZE="2">been found of their demise. Garadain wants 2
              things, proof of their
            </font> <font SIZE="2">demise, and proof of the demise of their
              killers.</p>
              <p>For the proof of the demise of the Coldain, Korrigan the undead
              coldain
            </font> <font SIZE="2">is the NPC you want to talk to. He spawns at
              night at the dwarven hut
            </font> <font SIZE="2">near Icefang, the named dire wolf. Talking to
              the undead coldain reveals
            </font> <font SIZE="2">that the coldain elite forces were the
              victims of a very nasty trick by
            </font> <font SIZE="2">the rygorr. Before the coldain could mount
              their attack on the giants,
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Rygorr shaman charmed the coldain's wolves
              and turned them on their
            </font> <font SIZE="2">masters. During the conversation with
              Korrigan, Icefang respawns as an
            </font> <font SIZE="2">agro high level version of himself and
              attacks you.</p>
              <p>Stay out of range of Icefang, and he will eventually run over
              to the orc
            </font> <font SIZE="2">hut near the bridge. When he gets there, 4
              oracles or ry'gorr will spawn
            </font> <font SIZE="2">along with Poxbreath Yellowfang, a named
              rygorr. Kill Yellowfang to get
            </font> <font SIZE="2">a Note from Kromrif. (no drop) The note
              outlines Rodrick the coldain
            </font> <font SIZE="2">traitor's assistance in killing the elite
              coldain.</p>
              <p>Near Rygorr keep is the exit of crystal caverns. Every once in
              a while a
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Rygorr Emissary will spawn there. If you wait
              a few minutes and don't
            </font> <font SIZE="2">kill him, Rodrick will spawn next to him. He
              is a traitor to the
            </font> <font SIZE="2">coldain. Kill him to get his Head (no drop).</p>
              <p>Turn the head, the note and your obsidian ring in to Garadain
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Glacierbane for your mithril insignia ring.</p>
              <p>7) Garadain asks you to rescue Corbin Blackwell. Kill Warden
              Bruke for
            </font> <font SIZE="2">his Shackle Key (no drop) and then give both
              the key and your mithril
            </font> <font SIZE="2">insignia ring to Corbin Blackwell. He will
              make his escape. (And give
            </font> <font SIZE="2">back the ring). You must protect Corbin until
              he reaches Dobbin
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Crossaxe.</p>
              <p>Along the way 4 rygorr and 4 giants including Commander Bahreck,
              a named
            </font> <font SIZE="2">giant, will attack Corbin. You must keep him
              alive. Once he reaches
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Dobbin, Dobbin will thank you for rescuing
              him and tell you that he will
            </font> <font SIZE="2">give you a note for Garadain if you show him
              your mithril insignia ring.
            </font>&nbsp;<br>
              <font SIZE="2"><br>
              Giving Dobbin the ring results in a note. Give this note back to
            </font> <font SIZE="2">Garadain and he will reward you with the
              adamantium ring and the final
            </font> <font SIZE="2">quest.</p>
              <p>8) This is the 8th, and I think final, Garadain quest. It is an
              all out
            </font> <font SIZE="2">war against Chief Ry'Gorr and his troops.</p>
              <p>Garadain says 'Very Well, Kaladur , give me the Adamantite ring
              and I
            </font> <font SIZE="2">will give you the marching orders. Once the
              orders are given to Gloradin
            </font> <font SIZE="2">in the next hut, we will be underway. You
              then must follow me to what
            </font> <font SIZE="2">will be our battleground. I must warn you, I
              will hold your ring until
            </font> <font SIZE="2">the head of Chief Ry'Gorr is given to me. If
              we fail, all will be
            </font> <font SIZE="2">lost... for both of us.</p>
              <p>As you can see, the 8th quest is tough. You only get ONE chance
              to do it
            </font> <font SIZE="2">right. Once you give Garadain your ring, you
              must kill Chief Ry'Gorr,
            </font> <font SIZE="2">loot his head, and give the head to Garadain.
              Ry'gorr only has a head
            </font> <font SIZE="2">during this event. I am unsure if you can do
              the quest if Garadain dies.</p>
              <p>Most likely, if he dies during this event you won't be able to
              complete
            </font> <font SIZE="2">the quest. You only get one shot at this,
              because you lose the ring.
            </font> <font SIZE="2">This battle involves 30+ rygorr, including
              some low 50's. This probably
            </font> <font SIZE="2">requires a well-tuned team of 55-60th level
              snare kiters, or
            </font> <font SIZE="2">alternatively a full 30+ PC army.</p>
              <p>Upon completing this quest you will receive the <a href="../equipment/veliumcoldaininsigniaring.html">Velium Coldain Insignia Ring</a>.<br>
              <br>
              We do not have full details but the quest continues from this
              point and results in the <a href="../equipment/ringofdainfrostreaveriv.html">Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV</a>.</p>
