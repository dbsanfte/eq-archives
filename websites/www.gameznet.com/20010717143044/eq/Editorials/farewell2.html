<center><b>A Final Farewell...</b></center>

<br><br>
I have quit Everquest.  I said it. I did it.  It is done.  It has been a long time coming and despite the bitterness that I have the memories are in general good ones.  However on the same note I will say that the game has gotten worse and worse since beta.  Maybe it was the shock of an amazing new game sitting beside UO and Meridian 59, or maybe the game was truly better with a tighter community.  I remember viewing GM's and Guides as friends, not opponents and trusting almost everyone I met.
<br><br>
Things certainly have changed in Everquest.  Verant has shown again and again that despite their ramblings that Everquest was a labor of love and that the game was the most important thing to the designers, but the bottom line when push came to shove was making money.  And on that note many things that were promised never got done and many things that should have been done after the game was released were never done.  One great example of this is guildhalls.  Guilds were supposed to be a big part of Everquest; "The ultimate grouping game," where class interaction was a must and therefore guilds would be a natural and necessary element of the game.  Verant promised to give guilds the tools to be great:  Guildhalls that could possibly be custom designed in some cases, as well as guild crests and tunics to make the guild unique in the world.  However Verant, almost a year into release, backed out on this idea.  Apparently it would not be cost effective to create options for a minority of people.  Sure maybe only the uberguilds such as Fires of Heaven would have castles with Dragons guarding the entrance but god damnit it would be cool and would be one of those things that make people feel like they have accomplished something.  
<br><br>
Perhaps the foremost reason that I have quit Everquest was because of the server that I played on, Rallos Zek.  "You knew what you were getting into"  they say.  Well quite frankly none of the RZ veterans that were there from the beginning knew what they were getting into.  Perhaps I was so naive to think that it would be a good roleplay server where PvP would be a Paladin vs Shadowknight thing; a place where High Elves and Dark Elves would war.  What nobody expected was the naked gank-fest that the server has become.  Pkers can make thousands of dollars selling stuff that they PK on EBAY so quite frankly why would they not do it?  Hell sometimes it makes me wonder why I don't do it.  I have 2 level 50 characters that could be great Pkers!  What happened no one could have predicted, however Verant could have done something about it.  Many people know about my campaign to get Rallos Zek changed to coin only.  Verant has never actually been "man enough" to confront my long letters and massive threads.  Instead they make posts on short, less intimidating threads contradicting themselves left right and center and trying to make excuses.  Why won't they change Rallos Zek to coin-only?  I honestly don't know.  It doesn't make any sense so I'm figuring that someone at Verant has an interest in the PK's continuing to gank people at portals and steal their stuff.  I won't get into the whole argument because quite frankly I don't care anymore.  My guild, Dragons of Destiny will be continued by my friends and I hope that the server is fixed soon so that they may enjoy their time on Everquest more than I could at the end.
<br><br>
Well all of these things have been going on of a long time so the reason why I have suddenly decided to quit is not clear.  To be honest I have been thinking about it for a long time and as friends of mine will tell you there have been several times where I "quit" for a few months only to go back to the game.  However the wear of the Rallos Zek issue, and Verant's continual disrespect to the players made me snap.  I suppose it would be fair to say that Diablo II's release helped give me the final push away from Everquest, however it was but a catalyst to the reaction.  I would have quit anyway, just not so soon.
<br><br>
Brad: I don't know what to say about you.  You have truly disappointed me, and perhaps some of it was my own doing.  However you are still supposed to be responsible for Everquest and even though you have created the masterpiece that is Everquest your own ego has helped in a large way to destroy the game.  I remember when Aradune was a legend.  A character that was looked upon as almost a god; wielding his powerful fiery avenger and dressed in the indestructible green splinted armor.  However though the Green Splinted never made it into the game, the fiery avenger was disappointing to say the least and Aradune has become a character that I no longer (and most people no longer) respect and trust.  Brad, you and your Vision (tm) have destroyed your greatest accomplishment.  Oh and one other thing?  What ever happened to the producer letter?  April 24th was the last one?  Real dedication there!
<br><br>
Gordon:  I would go as far as to say that hiring you as the PR agent (notice the singular form of agent) was one of the worst moves that Verant ever made.  I have always firmly believed that your ignorance is not your fault - you have never known much about Everquest the game or Everquest the community.  I don't know if you just parrot wrong information from the REAL dev team that you are obviously separated from in some way, or if you just give your own corrupted and incorrect answers to problems without actually talking to the people that have a clue about what they are saying.  Why isn't it your fault?  Because I also think that your job description from your superiors is "Keep as many people as possible happy while still giving the live team as little work as possible."  Well I guess you met half the description, but god knows you don't keep many people happy.
<br><br>
Jeff Butler:  I'm not gunna go into the whole Test server fiasco again.  However know this:  I am not certain about the truth of the stories that I have heard about the real reasons behind the test server wipe.  However I have seen and heard very compelling evidence that would suggest that you were a large part of that with your personal vendettas.  Many test server people emailed us after the player wipe and I got talking to a number of them who all told me basically the same thing.  So if it is true, you are a poor excuse for a human being.  If your superiors knew half the stuff that I know I am certain that you would be out of a job and out of the industry.  Doing that to the players that do the most to help you is despicable and you have to keep your petty, pathetic problems out of the workplace.
<br><br>
The Balancing Team:  My god.  I don't know where to begin but you have most definitely failed miserably!  I'm gunna be perfectly blunt about the fact that in a PvE environment the classes are very unbalanced STILL, with some classes easily able to do what multiple classes cannot do in some circumstances.  I can think of two or three parties that would be considered by most to be the most powerful in the game that consist of 2 or 3 classes at the most in multiple numbers.  I have been in some of these groups and can tell you that they are great fun.  But sometimes you have to think what the use of some classes is.  Many classes are severely crippled and you refuse to fix the problem or even admit that it exists.  I hope you can eventually balance the game but at this point it is far too out-of-whack to be fixed.  And don't even get me started about PvP balance because it doesn't exist in anyway.  There are a few god-pvp classes and the rest are mediocre at best.
<br><br>
The GM's:  hehe there isn't much to say here... I don't know if it is policy that prevents you from being useful, laziness or just sheer frustration about how dumb some people are but you truly are useless in every sense of the word.  Since release I have ONCE and only ONCE actually been helped sufficiently when I contacted a GM for help.  Many times I the help I got was inadequate and many more times help was not provided.  For example one day I was hunting in Butcherblock with my newbie character minding my own business, when I get rooted and PKed.  Ok, fine I play on Rallos Zek it is a fact of life.  I run back to my corpse.  When I am almost at it (10 feet away maybe) I get rooted and killed again by the same little gnome sitting on top of my corpse.  This happens several more times.  I petition like a good player and what is the response that I get?  According to this GM I am not getting corpse camped nor does it matter that I felt like I was being harassed.  This is totally unacceptable.  Unless I am actually bending down looting my corpse I can't be attacked?  What kind of stupid crap is that?  I was also under the impression that a player would never be allowed to ruin the enjoyment of the game for another player.  Ok, so that is one example.  Here is another, perhaps WORSE example:  I was hunting at the chessboard with my newbie (another one) and was pulling, killing, etc.  A member of a rival guild came along and started taking kills.  I informed him that he was not welcome and kept killing all the monsters.  Now a bit later I pulled a pawn and he jumped in front of it as I was pulling it to safety.  Suddenly I am summoned by the gods about 50 meters away by a GM that I had never seen on the server before (Keep in mind on my multiple accounts I have 2 level 50's) and that I never saw again.  So I asked what the problem was and the GM told me that I was training that member of the opposing guild and that I would have a warning placed on my account.  So I logged off my newbie and onto my high level:  A move clearly showing the GM that I was a veteran of the server and not some newbie that was gunna be pushed around.  I argued the charge with the GM saying that they jumped in front of the pull and told my side of the story.  The GM then told me that I was lying and that he was going to place two warnings on my account now.  I was absolutely livid.  I talked to the lead GM of the server and got one of the warnings removed, because the Lead GM said that the GM was not supposed to be on our server.  That is totally out of line.  And it was a friend of the person that I was competing with as well which to me shows terrible business ethics, yet again... how do I know?  "Hahaha I TOLD you my friend was a GM and now you have 2 warnings hahaha" There are more GM stories but it would take too long to tell them all.
<br><br>
This is the end for me.  I will still be at Gameznet and I'm sure that many of you will see me again here on EQ'Lizer either giving shameless plugs for another Gameznet site, or even helping the crew with some of the stuff when things get busy.  However for now I am in semi-retirement from EQ'Lizer.  I invite you all to check out the up-and coming Shadowbane (http://www.shadowbane.com/) and the site that Gameznet is creating and I am primarily working with, The Shadowbane Authority (http://www.gameznet.com/sb). 
<br><br>
Goodbye, Good Luck, and Good Riddance. "You're in Our World Now!"  Nope, not anymore.
