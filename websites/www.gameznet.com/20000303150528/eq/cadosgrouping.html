            <td>The following article was submitted by Cado Thebutcher:<br>
            <br>
            <u>What this is</u>: an elaborate editorial on how to properly handle grouping situations
            in dangerous areas in EQ.<br>
            <u><br>
            What it is not</u>: the definitive truth about it. This is my opinion. Improvise and add
            on it if you can.<br>
            <br>
            CLASS 1: know your role!<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Grouping in EQ is all about knowing what role
            your character must play for your specific group. I personally choose to discern between 4
            different categories on what they should do during the battle and in between them.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PULLER: This character main goal is to bring monsters to you in a
            fashion where your chances of surviving the fight are as good as possible. This should be
            your most experienced member in the region your are playing in. I would strongly suggest a
            tank* do this dirty work, for he can survived the original onslaught of a train (more HP)
            should he bring one on the group&#146;s head.. This member should always be kept fully
            buffed* with spells like SoW, endure magic and AC/HP enhancing enchantments. When the pull
            is done the puller falls into one of the basic category of fighting, described below.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TANK: These are the core members of any group. The players who stand in
            between the rock and the hard place: defending the casters, taking the damage and
            pig-sticking monsters at in-your-face range. The other very important task you will have
            to perform is taunting monsters when they assault your group&#146;s casters. One of the
            tank should be designated to pull out of melee to give a hand to the casters, so when a
            caster calls for help only one will disengage to help. These are the members with the
            highest death ration, since these players must cover a retreat should the leader call for
            one. You WILL die once in a while, but that can&#146;t be helped. And standing your group
            taking one for the group will make you a valuable teammate to have for them and you will
            never have problem to find a group.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HEALER: Without at least one of those in your group you won&#146;t be
            able to fight a tougher foe for long or fight often enough to make life in EQ interesting.
            This member should be well out of melee range and be ready to heal the tank in case of a
            sticky situation. Also most of the good healer classes are also buffers. Heal until you
            are OOM* or a general retreat is called for.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NUKERS: These group member can dish out more damage in a few seconds
            than all the tank in the whole fight. The trick to being an efficient nuker in a group is
            to KNOW when to nuke. Wait for the monsters to be firmly in melee with the tank and nuke
            only the monsters needing the extra damage to finish them. Also always keep mana to keep
            the monsters from fleeing, that way the tank wont have to run after the monsters and can
            change target to keep on fighting. </p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once your role in a group has been determined, I strongly suggest
            talking between yourselves to know exactly what is expected of you. Here are some tricks
            of the trade I have seen used or devised myself to make grouping as efficient as possible:</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) If you are the puller, make an &quot;INC!&quot; hotkey to use when
                  you are pulling a foe to let your party know you are coming. I use a series of
                  &quot;INC!&quot; commands to tell the party of the strength of the pull: 1 for a weak
                  pull, 2 for a medium and so on&#133;The clearer you are are on your pull the easier it
                  will be for the members to fight efficiently.</p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) If you are a spellcaster, make a &quot;OOM&quot; hotkey to tell your
                  group you wont be able to heal or nuke anymore. This is especially helpful for the leader
                  to decide when to tuck tail and run.</p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3) Spellcaster should also have a &quot;Monster on ME! HELP&quot;
                  hotkey to notice the designated tank to taunt him off his back.</p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4) When you have multiple Paladins, make sure you know who should use
                  Lay on Hand on which character so you won&#146;t spend two of them on the same member and
                  thus spend one for nothing.</p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5) ATTACK ONLY ONE MONSTER AT A TIME. It is a way of life. Kill one
                  monster at a time. Always concentrate all you firepower on the biggest baddest monster,
                  then once it&#146;s dead switch to the second toughest. The best and easiest way is to
                  assist the lead tank (left click on the member then /assist). Only the caster helper
                  should disengage to attack other monsters.</p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6) STAND YOUR GROUND. Another way of life. Don&#146;t run &#145;till
                  the leader says so. Or at least until the situation is desperate enough to warrant
                  fleeing. Before fleeing tell your group you are and if the leader says &quot;no&quot; then
                  go back and jump back in. It&#146;s never the time to argue with the leader in the middle
                  of a vicious fight.</p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7) Sometimes it is better to die than to run. That way you won&#146;t
                  have to take 30 min locating your corpse. </p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">8) Don&#146;t be afraid to speak out when a player wants to join your
                  group and you know him/her to be a bad team player. You will save lives. It&#146;s that
                  simple. Also don&#146;t be afraid to eject someone on the team who is deliberately doing
                  something bad on the group. DO NOT mistake cowardliness for inexperience. Give people a
                  chance. </p>
                  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">9) Reach a mutually agreed loot order before starting to fight. Also
                  have a way to randomly distribute the bigger and more expansive loot (/random 100 is the
                  favored way). If you have a member trusted by all other members let him take the prized
                  loot so it can be given to the winner of the random roll.</p>
