          <tr>
            <td valign="top">This quest contains information collected by a variety of persons
            including our own staff, <a href="http://www.rpgnews.com">RPGNews</a>, the <a href="http://wwww.gamezportal.com">GameZPortal</a> message boards and the <a href="http://www2.hpcdsb.edu.on.ca/~jeff_cameron/">Paladins of Norrath</a> message
            boards(which was by far the best source of information for the quest info). This is a no
            nonsense quest guide. Meaning we will give you the exact steps needed to complete the
            quest by the quickest means possible. This is an out of order way of doing things but it
            will save you tens of thousands of platinum pieces believe me.<br>
            <br>
            1. You should first collect yourself a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ghoulbane.html">Ghoulbane</a>. This holy sword can
            be obtained by killing the Froglok Shin Lord in Upper Guk. It is a rare drop so be
            prepared for a long camp. <br>
            2. You will need to acquire Soulfire by completing the <a href="zimelsblades.html">Zimel's
            Blades</a> quest in Freeport.<br>
            3. You will need to raise your faction with the Deepwater Knights in Erudin. I'm not sure
            how high you need to raise it but I would recommend getting it to warmly. Better safe than
            sorry(it's a dangerous jaunt to that fourth island of POA).<br>
            4. You must kill both Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox(the red and white dragon of Permafrost and
            Solusek B). Each of these dragons drops a different book. One is the book of vox and the
            other is the book of nagafen. <br>
            5. A barkeep in the Blind Fish Tavern of Neriak will combine these books to create the
            Book of Scale if you pay her 1000pp.<br>
            6. Take the book of scale to the Oracle in the Ocean of Tears. Some players may be camping
            the Oracle for the robe. Just ask them if you can hand the book first and it should be no
            problem. In exchange you will receive the phylatercy.<br>
            7. You must now head down to the ice caves of Everfrost. These are hidden away under some
            ice. Inside these caverns a lich(the lich of Mirgaul) will spawn. You must have an
            enchanter or necromancer(and a good sized collection of bodies) for this step. You will
            not be able to hand the lich anything if he is attacking you. What you must do is have an
            enchanter or necromancer charm him. When he is charmed you can then hand him the
            Phylatercy. <br>
            8. After handing him the phylatercy the real Miragul will be restored(a foul necromancer).
            You must now kill him. Upon killing him you will receive both his head and his robe. These
            are needed for the quest.<br>
            9. You must now venture to the Plane of Air. When in the plane of air someone has to hail
            Dirkog Steelhand. Asking him about a sword of flames will trigger him asking you for a bit
            of cash. Now when someone hands him 500pp it will trigger Inte Akera(the giver of the
            quest) to spawn. The problem is that Inte Akera spawns on the fourth island of Air(a tough
            place to get to) inside of the Windmill. This is a tough island to get to. You will need a
            lot of cash(for reagents), a lot of coffins(to summon corpses), a lot of bashers(to help
            you out) and a lot of time(its going to take a while). <br>
            <br>
            EDITORS NOTE: I would like to post some good strategy for getting to island #4. However
            noone on our server has been able to reach that far since the ability to levitate was
            removed from the zone. If you have some strategies feel free to <a href="mailto:eqstaff@gameznet.com">send them in</a>.<br>
            10. Inte Akera will only remain spawned for a small period of time. You must keep him
            hailed to spawn him. Wait to give Dirkog the cash until after your party is already on
            island #4. He will ask for a few things but you already have acquired them. Basically what
            he wants are proof of sacrifice and nobility. Hand in Soulfire for one(he will hand back a
            note) and Ghoulbane for the other. Hand those two back to him with the head and robe to
            complete the quest.<br>
            11. Congradulations you have received the <a href="../equipment/fieryavenger.html">Fiery
            Avenger</a>.<br>
