                                1) Only level 47+ people (48+ even better...etc).
                                <br>
                                2) (2-4) tank / cleric groups
                                <br>
                                3) X caster groups (add a cleric to each group..if you can spare, it goes smoother when you can)
                                <br>
                                4) 3 enchanters -- (more is alwasy a +)
                                <br>
                                5) Necros go solo
                                <br><br>
                                Ok you're on your way to kill vox.  
                                <br>
                                You're making your groups.
                                <br>
                                Here is how you do it. 
                                <br>
                                <br>1) you have to have a good leader. 
                                <br>2) you can't have newbies. 
                                <br><br>
                                Here is how you do it in one hour also (not 4+):
                                <br><br>
                                A) The day before you KNOW you're going to kill vox, you let EVERY person know the EXACT time. In every single time zone, that applies to people going. If anyone is late for any reason they do not go, period. If not enough people show up on time, event does not happen, people dragons are basicallyh CAMPED now. You have to be there THEN. I HATE WAITING! ;P
                                <br><br>
                                B) ONE leader. One Back-Up Leader. While the Leader Is alive, every single person does EXACTLY what that ONE person says. If he dies, the Back-up leader then does a 4 line shout that the leader died, and he is now leader, and to listen ONLY to him. The leader shouts directions. NO ONE ELSE USES SHOUTS. If they do, they never come again. Now if this is a big guild they can use guild chat. 
                                <br><br>
                                C) Ok, now that you have A and B down GOOD. your ready to pull out the trash (ice gaints spiders etc).  Once you do that everyone moves to the Buff Spot...I am guessing you know where this is(hopeing). Ok now here everyone meds to full. NO BUFFS YET.
                                <br><br>
                                D) Now everyone strips Every buff they have. Then the leader shouts out "10 min warning to first charge". And that my friends WILL be followed up on. The leader times it. You put on 4 Crapy Buffs first. Then you put on your good buffs(everyone should be at 120+ vs cold, GET THE SLACKERS TO BUY GEAR). Now, everyone should be buffed and CLOSE, if not FM. This all has to happen in 10 min, less is proff your a good clan of people (try to do it in 3-4 min). 
                                <br><br>
                                E) You're buffed, you have a good leader. What next? Well first off if you don't have 3 enchanters(2 is possible..maybe even one, but what happned if that one enchanter goes LD?), good luck I doubt you will win. Tank/cleric groups go in first, of course clerics follow tanks from behind. Now casters do not go yet. Also think about it how many tanks should go on this "first" wave. I am going to say 10-16. It all depends on how many clerics you have really. So you can play with these numbers. 
                                I belive vox can be beaten with 19 people, maybe less. But that is just me. 20 Secounds AFTER the tanks have started the fight (leader counts, ONLY the leader) then he Shouts for the casters/enchanters/necros to go. Guys I was a level 50 necro, let me explain why you need to be solo. You cannot do much damage to dragons, period, deal with it, almost any other class deserves that heal before you in this situation. Sorry but that is the truth. What you can do though is give every once of your man                              a to one of the enchanters. See they are they KEY to vox, they drain her mana. 3 enchanters can easily drain ALL of vox's mana, before she even gets to the L in her name. This means She will NOT heal at all. This means all she is, is Naggy, with cold spells. 
                                <br><br>
                                F) You should always have at least 1 backup group of tanks. Tanks/clerics are the key to all big battles in this game people. The leader looks at loses, does not even really need to be in the fight, and knows when to call out the reserves etc. PEOPLE, if there is ONLY casters left, IT IS OVER. Don't suicide the casters whatever you do! Vox regen is SUPER fast. 
                                <br><br>
                                G) Ok I know you're not going to like this one either. I hate pets when doing vox. She fears, pets love to get bugged and call up ALL the mobs for the pits. I would rather not risk it. Sure it is a bug, but do I expect verant to fix it? Hell no. This bug does not happen offten, sometimes it is just a newbie person who falls in the pit and does not die there ...or a cleric in his group tries to heal, a few things can go wrong. But anyway. With this Information you should be able to easily Kill Vox. 
                                <br><br>
                                H) MAKE SURE EVERY SINGLE PERSON HAS READ THE RULES. IF they say something dumb like, "what rules?"...ban them.
                                <br><br>
                                I) If this is muti guild..know how loot works. Don't want to create enemies, out of a great sucess.
                                <br><br>
                                J) look at your watch, smile, you just wasted 1 hour, instead of 5, and you won.
                                <br><br>
                                Now, for some other little information:
                                <br>
                                Here I am going to take the time to explain why it is NOT worth bringing people under level 47. See it is like this, the technology of verant, does not like a lot of PC's around so it creates lag. If there is enough level 50 players use JUST them! I swear people 10 level 40's are not going to equal the damage that 1 level 50 would do with less lag. Hell they might even cause the level 50 to disconnect!  Think smart, don't think about "people" or individuals, think of "the people" as in groups, as a unit. This is WAR people, there is no such thing as an individual in war. Think as a team and win, or die like a fool, all alone.  Sure there might be room in a group for a necro, then it is fine if they are in a group, I am not saying that they should be solo no matter what, I am just saying that it is better to let necros go in and send pet and then give mana to enchanters. I think clerics should only heal wizards and enchanters really(out of casters), 
                                I don't see a point in healing someone who is doing next to no damage in a fight(i think mags might do some nice dmg to vox not naggy though, I am not a mag though so don't know). Also sending pets on Vox is OK, that bug only happens once in a blue moon. Besides that, 99% of the time it is because of a "newbie" level 50 that causes it...but if you want to be SUPER safe, i just threw it out there.
                                <br>
