      <P>Adroha gives a soft sigh of woe, 'You won't be getting any response 
      from Thelin. Ever since his injury he has been in a deep [coma] with no 
      sign of ever recovering.'<BR>Thelin tosses and turns violently on the 
      floor, then is still.<BR><BR>You say, 'what coma?'</P>
      <P>Adroha Jezith says 'My pity onto Thelin. His life on Norrath was a 
      miserable one. As a young man he began to study the workings of fear 
      inspired by Cazic-Thule. The workings had been translated for mortals by 
      Zebuxoruk. Pouring over the texts, Thelin felt his mind being invaded by 
      Cazic. This information was not for mortal usage and the malevolent god 
      stripped him of all his earthly belongings and cursed him to live in 
      [poverty and ruin].'<BR><BR>You say, 'what about poverty and 
      ruin?'<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith says 'Aye, he lived in the streets of Eastern 
      Freeport, begging from those passing through the port. He sat quivering, 
      propped up against a wall with one hand out as he watched the travelers 
      pass by. None of them even gave him a second glance. Several years would 
      pass before a female dwarf would arrive to trade some of her family's 
      armor and weapons. She saw and took pity on Thelin. She knelt down, 
      scratched her beard then began to rummage through her backpack. She then 
      placed a [jeweled dagger] in his hand, smiled and returned to her former 
      business.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what jeweled dagger?'<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith says 
      'This was the only gift that Thelin had received since the curse. It was 
      beautifully crafted and would likely have fetched a handsome price upon 
      the market. He decided to keep the dagger as it was such a kind gesture. 
      Later that eve, Thelin heard the calling of others that studied 
      Zebuxoruk's workings. He recognized the language they called out in. He 
      approached the men and explained he had studied the writings of Zebuxoruk. 
      One of the shaded figures then began to mutter an incantation. Suddenly, 
      there was a bright flash, lush vegetation and a peaceful breeze surrounded 
      them. They had ascended here, to the [Plane of Tranquility] where they 
      could further study the works without interference from the gods and 
      mortals alike.'<BR><BR>You say, 'what about the Plane of 
      Tranquility?'<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith says 'Thelin enjoyed it here. He assisted 
      the other followers by using all his mana to open a portal to the Plane of 
      Nightmares, the demi-plane ruled by the child of The Faceless, 
      Terris-Thule. Spent from using all his energies, he went to bed early 
      after his victory had been achieved in this task. As he laid in bed, he 
      looked over the dagger that had been given to him by the female dwarf. He 
      smiled at the new peace he had found here and began to fall asleep. 
      Drifting away into the realm of dreams, his subconscious was assulted by 
      the horrors of a nightmare. He tossed and turned from the visions that 
      came before him. So bad did he writhe in his subconscious torment that he 
      turned on the dagger. He was critically injured, and let out a wrenching 
      scream. We found him and were able to heal his wound enough to keep him 
      alive. However, he still lies in a deep coma seemingly [tortured by 
      nightmares].'<BR><BR>You say, 'how is he tortured by nightmares?'<BR>You 
      have received a character flag!<BR><BR>Adroha Jezith tells you, 'It is our 
      belief that Terris-Thule is punishing him for allowing entrance into her 
      plane. She seems to have an exceedingly strong tie to him. Since her 
      father has already punished him, she likely found that he was easily 
      tormented by her own powers. Sometimes he talks while tossing and turning. 
      We have taken note of everything he has said. He has said 'I accept your 
      offer Terris-Thule', 'I must find the pieces', and 'It never ends'. You 
      must help him. Go through the portal that he has helped to create. Try to 
      find his planar projection in Terris' plane. Help him wake from this 
      torment. Please, I beg you. I cannot stand to watch him suffer any 
      longer.'</P>
      <P>Thelin Poxbourne is located by a hedge in the back of the Plane of 
      Nightmare zone.&nbsp; Your task is to go with *three groups* through the 
      maze he ports you into AFTER everyone has this flag, and ensure his safety 
      along the way.&nbsp; See Plane of Nightmare---&gt;Plane of Nightmare B 
      guide to find out how you reach Terris 
      Thule.</P></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></td><TD bgcolor="#503828" valign
