          <tr>
            <td>The plane of fear is the home to the god Cazic Thule. This is an alternate plane of
            existance full of many evil high level beings including Cazic Thule himself. You can get
            to Cazic Thule via a gate hidden away in the spectre cave in <a href="feerot.html">Feerot</a>.
            Only level 46 and higher players will be able to enter this plane. Melee classes should be
            sure to bring a group gater because the gate is one way.<br>
            <br>
            All of the monsters on this plane are level 47 or up. They are extremely tough and each
            type has it's own special abilities. Make no doubts if you choose to venture into the
            plane of fear, you will die. Corpse recovery is often difficult so expect to die and die
            often. Don't expect this zone to be a pushover. <br>
            <br>
            What makes this zone interesting is that different monsters drop many different items. For
            example fetid fiends drop a full suit of paladin only armor. These some of the most
            powerful items in the game. I will attempt to describe some of the beings that you will
            encounter in this zone below.<br>
            <br>
            You will no doubt spend much time in the zone before you are likely to come accross a
            scareling. Scarelings are rogues and backstab. Combine this with the fact that they can
            outrun players without spirit of the wolf and you have a very deadly adversary. Scarelings
            cast a teleport spell on their victims which will randomly teleport you somewhere in the
            vicinity. You will never be teleported far away but it can be disorienting and worse yet
            it can teleport you into other monsters. Scarelings drop woven shadow(rogue) armor.<br>
            <br>
            Spinechillers are high level spiders. They cast a chilling spell on you which will drain
            your health over time. These spiders are highly sought after as they drop
            cryosilk(magician,necromancer,wizard,enchanter) armor.<br>
            <br>
            Shiverbacks are gorilla like beings. They are sought after for their shiverback hide(monk)
            armor.<br>
            <br>
            Tentacle Tormentors resemble tentacle terrors. They cast a high level throwback spell
            which will throw you far into the distance. Tentacle Tormentor's drop thorny vine(ranger)
            armor.<br>
            <br>
            Worry Wraiths resemble wisps. They are enchanters and are usually accompanied by a pet.
            Worry wraiths cast a spell which will throw you high into the air. So high that you will
            suffer around 300 points of damage when you hit the ground. Worry wraiths carry ethereal
            mist(cleric) armor.<br>
            <br>
            Gorgons resemble very high level gorgons. They cast a stun spell which will stun you for a
            long period of time(around 30 seconds). This makes them dangerous to fetch especially in
            their camp(where three of them occupy a shrine). Gorgons possess druid only armor.<br>
            <br>
            Fetid fiends resemble toermented dead or zombies. They possess valorium(paladin) armor.<br>
            <br>
            Boogeymen resemble huge ghouls. They cast a fear spell which has been known to crash the
            zone so you should be careful when fighting these beings, make sure to be in a safe
            location. Boogeymen drop bard only armor. <br>
            <br>
            Turmoil toads resemble froglok's and are very difficult to see in the green landscape.
            They cast a fear spell as well as rooting their opponents. Turmoil toads carry shaman only
            armor.<br>
            <br>
            Amygdalan's are common throughout the zone and come in two varieties. Both variants cast a
            mana sink spell which can drain all of your mana. Amygdalan Warriors are warriors and have
            extremely high resistance as a result. Amygdalan Warriors drop warrior only(lustrous
            russet) armor. Amygdalan Knights are shadowknights. They cast all shadowknight spells,
            manasink and also have pets. They are quite dangerous opponents and they guard the three
            elite guards of Cazic Thule(Fright, Dread and Terror). Amygdalan Knights carry umbral
            platemail(shadowknight) armor.<br>
            <br>
            There are several other types of monsters which you will find in this zone including
            Samhains(who cast a fear spell), Nightmares(black horses who cast can blind you and drop a
            Nightmare Hide Cape), and Phoboplasms(which resemble gelatinous cubes and cancel your
            buffs). These monsters are a bit less hunted than the ones above. <br>
            <br>
            Last but not least is the two big boss men of the zone. Both of these carry powerful items
            including weapons. Both of these bosses are shadowknights, they both harm touch and have
            pets.<br>
            <br>
            The first is dracoliche a bone dragon. Dracoliche is a challenge that will require at
            least two parties to take down. Be careful as in additional to the standard shadowknight
            spells he casts a high level dot spell which can take you down quick without a healer.<br>
            <br>
            While dracoliche is tough he is nothing when compared to Cazic Thule. Cazic has recently
            undergone a modification which has made him seem more or less invincible. I am sure that
            some group will tackle him one day but it will take many level 50 groups to do so. He
            casts a throwback spell, debuffs his opponents, has several high level pets, and hits in
            the 300's. Rest assured he has some extremely powerful items which were obtained before he
            was beefed up. He also has several items which have yet to be found. </td>
