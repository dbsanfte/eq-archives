            <td valign="top"><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">This guide contains
              information collected by our staff and submitted by various
              parties including <font SIZE="2">Baaldok, </font>Darkbane, Umacat and
              Bulwei. This advice is not neccessarily the advice of our staff
              but it is listed as a reference guide.<br>
              <br>
              The Hole is a level 40-55 dungeon that is
            located underneath Paineel. It is the highest level non-expansion dungeon in the game and
            is available via the optional patch. <br>
            <br>
            The dungeon has yet to be explored fully but here is what is known at this time. It is
            full of high level elements and golems. This makes it a perfect hunting ground for
            Magicians, Druids, Clerics or Rangers who have been itching for a place to use their ward
            summoned line of spells. <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately getting in is the hard part. Do not fall into the large hole in the middle
            of Paineel. Many players did this originally and found themselves falling for 10k damage.
            GM's will not res you if you do this so be warned.<br>
            <br>
            The entrance to the hole is actually down the previously unused area past the newbie area
            of Paineel. Down at the bottom where it dead ends is a small pond. One of these stones
            down here is actually the locked entrance to Paineel. <br>
            <br>
            You will need a key unless you are a small race(small races can squeeze throught he
            entrance). The keys can be obtained from a vendor in the building across from the entrance
            of the bank. The key is easy to miss as it looks like a bag. These keys will cost you over
            100pp and are NO DROP.<br>
            <br>
            Rogues and bards can also pick the lock. I'm not sure what skill is needed but I do not
            believe it is set very high.<br>
              <br>
              The entrance is guarded by six elemental warriors. These mobs are
              level 40-42. They are spaced far enough apart that you can pull
              them one at a time if you are not careless.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              After you clear the warriors you will see a hallway which leads
              down. Beware because an elemental crusader(level 43-45) patrols
              this hallway and can make things sticky if he catches you off
              guard.<br>
              <br>
              As soon as the hallway ends there are two elementals on the
              opposite edge. They are hidden from view however so beware. The
              one on the right is always an elemental crusader. The one on the
              left can be either a Crusader or a warrior.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              After disposing of these foes you will notice the hall begins to
              go downwards. Move to where it begins to slope down and turn
              right. This is a good place to meditate or buff. The only mob that
              patrols this area is the Crusader which you should have just
              killed.<br>
              <br>
              After you are ready to continue your journey you will notice a
              fortress straight ahead guarded by a rock golem(level 47-53) and
              an elemental crusader. You can pull these each seperately if you
              target the golem first.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The fortress is locked and noone has found the key to this point.
              We have likewise been unable to pick the lock. You can hit the
              mobs with spells to aggro them if you stand on the top of the
              bridge however this will bring many mobs at one time and is not
              recommended.<br>
              <br>
              Instead I recommend you follow the path which leads down into the
              pit. This will be on your left. Be forewarned that once you drop
              down you will not be able to get back up without gating. There is
              no way up that I know except through the locked fortress
              door(which is the route that the mobs take).&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              If you manage to lose some corpses down here there are two
              possible scenarios to get them. The first involves the obvious
              summoning of their corpses. The second involves an enchanter
              casting illusion: earth element on himself and then a party member
              casting invisibility on him. This will allow him to sneak by most
              of the mobs up to the pit and will avoid the earth elements seeing
              him(which can see invisibility).&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
 I recommend that you fight the
              first few battles while up on the ledge still so you do not have
              to fight too many mobs at once.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The pit is filled with elemental curators(level 45-50), elemental
              wizards(level 45-50), flighting fiends(level 45-47) and rock
              golems. It will take a while to clear them out until it is safe to
              move but once it is clear you should move directly down until you
              are facing the entrance into the fortress below. This is probably
              the safest pull location you are going to find down here.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Inside of the fortress you will find many of the same mobs that
              you have already encountered as well as ratmen warriors(level
              48-50). This is as far as we have gone in. I do not know of any
              deeper point which is safe to pull to. I would suggest you send in
              your monk or shadowknight and have him pull to the entrance here.
              Even with a feigner however it is hard to pull singles here as
              they do not like to reset. So an enchanter is a definate plus
              unless you have a large group.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
            </font><font SIZE="2">Beyond the first castle is a large Tower - the
              tower has a throne room with</font> <font SIZE="2">many golems and
              elementals, no named spawn has been spotted in this room yet</font>
              <font SIZE="2">but I suspect the NPC on the throne is a
              Placeholder.</font>&nbsp;<br>
              <font SIZE="2"><br>
              Beyond the Tower is a fallen city. There are many shops with
              withering</font> <font SIZE="2">signs and lots of fallen in walls
              and cobwebs. This part of the zone is</font> <font SIZE="2">patroled
              by a couple of Revenents and Wanderers, but the elementals and</font>
              <font SIZE="2">golems are the main mobs and there are Alot of
              them. At the back of this</font> <font SIZE="2">part of the zone
              there is a small pond with a dock, an overlook into the</font> <font SIZE="2">depths
              of The Hole is here, but it is fatal to fall from this point.<br>
              <br>
              Moving onward to the rear of the fallen city an opening in a large
              wall</font> <font SIZE="2">leads to a courtyard and another large
              Library like area, I saw a bejeweled</font> <font SIZE="2">elemental
              here but have yet to see one fall to know what treasure it
              keeps.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              To the left of the Library courtyard there is a walkway which
              heads to the</font> <font SIZE="2">Main Castle. The main throne
              room had 6 golems spawned and one Stonesoul</font> <font SIZE="2">the
              Unmoving - a named elemental. The throne had a plain rock golem on
              it</font> <font SIZE="2">which I suspect to be a placeholder. The
              real surprise was in the upper</font> <font SIZE="2">back corridor
              of this Castle, two bedrooms, one contained a common elemental</font>
              <font SIZE="2">but the other contained a Fiend Duo - Schnozz the
              Flighty and Kejar the</font> <font SIZE="2">Mighty.
              <p>To the right of the Library courtyard another opening leads to
              a long tunnel</font> <font SIZE="2">down - a very long tunnel
              down. There are a couple of wandering revenants</font> <font SIZE="2">and
              wandering ratmen as well as elementals and golems.</p>
              <p>At the end of this tunnel a large grotto opens up with a large
              city of</font> <font SIZE="2">undead at one end, an overlook to
              The Hole on the right, and another tunnel</font> <font SIZE="2">down
              on the left. The city is filled with Undead Erudite Revenants,</font>
              <font SIZE="2">Wanderers, Fallen Erudite skeletons and one Niltoth
              the Unholy - The</font> <font SIZE="2">apparent Boss Mob of the
              zone.</p>
              <p>The tunnel down leads to the very bottom of The Hole and the
              future doorway</font> <font SIZE="2">to what I beleive will be The
              Plane of Underfoot, the door is locked but</font> <font SIZE="2">small
              races can fit through the gaps on the sides.</p>
              <p>The difficulty of this zone I think lies in the Sheer number of
              mobs that</font> <font SIZE="2">live here, the average room has
              4-6 mobs of lvl 50-55, plus 2-3 wandering</font> <font SIZE="2">mobs
              in proximity.</p>

              <p><font size="2" color="#C0C0C0">
              Items in the hole appear to be random drop for the most part.
              There are a few known rares but most of the good stuff can be
              found on normal mobs. Crusaders drop Loam Encrusted armor at a
              decent rate but I have also heard that Rock Soul and Golems drop
              it as well. Ratmen have dropped random weapons.<br>
