<p>Unrest is an undead dungeon in <a href="dagnorscauldron.html">Dagnor's Cauldron</a>.
This dungeon is tuned for characters level 15-30. <br>
<br>
Some of the monsters you can expect to find here include <a href="../beastiary/jackolantern.html">Jack-O-Lanterns</a>(in the hedge maze), tormented
dead(a level 12-15 version of <a href="../beastiary/zombie.html">zombies</a>), ice boned <a href="../beastiary/skeleton.html">skeletons</a>, <a href="../beastiary/carrionghoul.html">carrion
ghouls</a>, <a href="../beastiary/lmummy.html">lurking mummies</a>, <a href="../beastiary/ghoul.html">ghouls</a>, and <a href="../beastiary/werebat.html">werebats</a>.<br>
<br>
Lower level characters should conecentrate on fighting the jack-o-lanterns in the hedge
mazes. They are the safest prey to fight as you can usually get them one on one. You will
notice death beetles patrolling the courtyard. Death beetles are not agressive they will
attack anyone who is in combat with undead however and once they begin coming it's usually
best to just zone(unless they still give you experience). <br>
<br>
Mid level characters will probably want to pull from the front of the house to the
fountains. The reason you want to pull to the fountain is because wizards and clerics can
cast from a safe enough distance if they stand back against the hallway and not make the
monster go agressive to them.<br>
<br>
Around level 20-24 you will want to start pulling from the left side of the house. this
will allow you to pull carrion ghouls(for small <a href="../equipment/ringmail.html">ringmail</a>)
and ice boned skeletons(for human sized ringmail) and not have to worry about as many of
the lower level monsters getting in the way. <br>
<br>
Around level 25+ you will start wanting to get a group together and conquering the unique
monsters of this dungeon. There is a mortuary fungus to the right side of the house down a
tunnel underwater. He is not undead and ranges in the level 26-28 range. The fungus can
cast a fungus drowsy spell which is rather effective.<br>
<br>
By far the most exciting things in this dungeon take place in the basement. If you were
entering from the front of the house and turned down the left hallway and went to the last
doorway you could open that door. It would appear to be empty except for a bookshelf.
Click on the bookshelf and you will find the entrance to the basement. In this basement
lies all sorts of baddies including barbed bone skeletons(level 24-26 skeletons which
whose barbed thorns will damage you when hit them), skeletal monks(level 24-26 undead
monks), and werebats. <br>
<br>
In the center of the basement is one of the two hags in Unrest. Festering hags are level
28-30 undead spellcasters who can cast some very powerful spells including charm, blood
boil and engulfing darkness. The hag carries small <a href="../equipment/bronzeplate.html">bronze
platemail</a> armor which is much sought after.<br>
<br>
There is also a secret passageway in the basement which leads to another room. Beware the
trap in this hallway. You will come to an area where it appears to be a safe walkway on
each side and lava in the center. The lava does not hurt and you can walk right through
it. The walkways however are a trap that leads to a pit that you will likely die in.<br>
<br>
Deep in this room you will find not only <a href="../beastiary/tentterror.html">tentacle
terrors</a> but a dwarven spirit by the name of Garanel Rucksforth who is part of some
quest i'm sure.<br>
