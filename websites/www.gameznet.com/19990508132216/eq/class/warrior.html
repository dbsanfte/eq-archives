<p>Warriors are the meat of any role playing game. They are a neccesity to every well
balanced party. Warriors can dish punishment and more importantly they can absorb it.
Warriors keep the monsters occupied while the casters launch away from distance. Warriors
don armor, they wield the weapons, and when it is all said and done they often get all the
credit from the onlookers. <br>
<br>
Many people might argue that warriors are not an incredibly interesting class to play.
Casters gain a whole new set of spells every 4-5 levels. Warriors only have a few
interesting skills and they are few and far between. However the flip side of the coin is
that warriors are the ones who are in the thick of things. When the casters have their
noses in the spellbooks meditating for the next heal or for the death blow, the warriors
will be battling on.<br>
<br>
While casting types await to get new spells and other meelee types await for new special
skills the warrior really lives from item to item. A warriors livelihood lies in his
equipment. The advantage of this is that a warrior can concentrate purely on equipment and
does not have to worry about spells and the like. It is important to always have the best
equipment possible at your level because this equipment can and will mean the difference
between life and death. <br>
<br>
Traditionally warriors are the leaders of a group. They are the ones who brave the foes
first. They are the first ones who take the damage, and often they are the first to die. A
warrior must have faith in his party members. A warrior needs to have the courage to stand
and fight until his healers get enough mana to throw him a heal. A warrior must have the
heart to stand in there while the wizards get the mana to deal the death blow. As a result
of this a warrior is often the one who makes an impression on a crowd of onlookers. I
recall a time when myself, Hafez and Grog were battling with Hill Giants in the Oasis of
Marr. Hafez and myself were keeping Grog(our fearless warrior) healed long enough for him
to defeat the mighty beast. At the end of each battle the crowds would shout and cheer,
&quot;Grog just killed another hill giant! All hail Grog&quot;. Such is the life of the
warrior, remembered not only for his fearless deeds but also for his flashy and brilliant
equipment which often outshines all other classes.<br>
<br>
So what does a warrior have to look forward to skill wise?<br>
<br>
At level 5 warriors gain the ability to bind wounds. This skill allows you to use bandages
to help yourself heal faster when critically wounded. This skill fails a lot early on and
requires bandages. To be quite frank with you most players never use this skill they
instead rely on party healers or <a href="../equipment/barkpotion.html">bark potions</a>.
However at higher levels if you have money to waste you might want to invest it into
bandages and bind wounds. This skill can heal up to 22 points at a time when maxed and can
be used to heal you to up to 50% of your health.<br>
<br>
At level 6 you gain the ability to dodge. This is a very important skill. Dodging causes
your opponent to miss and thus raises your armor class. Seeing that you will be tanking
most of the time every little addition to your armor class helps.<br>
<br>
At level 9 you gain the bash skill. Bash gives you an alternative to kick and requires a
shield. Bashing generally does less damage than kicking it does however have a chance to
stun your opponent. This is important when your prey attempts to flee. It is also
important when doing battle with spellcasters and a bash will interupt their spell. Large
races gain the ability to slam which is identical to bash except that it does not require
a shield.<br>
<br>
At level 12 you gain the parry skill. Parry is similar to dodge in that it causes your
opponent to miss and thus raises your armor class.<br>
<br>
Level 15 is the warriors power level. At level 15 you get your two most important skills:
Double attack and duel wield. It is wise to save up most of your training points to pour
into these two stats once you hit level 15. Double attack allows you to hit twice per
round. Duel wield allows you to have the option of using two one handed weapons and thus
theoretically be able to get up to four attacks per round. These skills go up slowly and
are not overly effective at first, but once they start gaining in skill you will notice a
huge difference in effectiveness.<br>
<br>
At level 25 you gain the riposte skill. This is basically another armor class increasing
skill.<br>
<br>
At level 35 you gain the last of your skills: Disarm. Disarm allows you to knock a weapon
out of your opponents hands(although it very rarely works). This can accomplish two
things. First off it can get you a nice weapon if you are lucky. Secondly a monster with a
weapon hits quite a bit harder than a monster without one. <br>
<br>
Most races are allowed to be warriors. The exceptions are the high elves and erudites who
simply do not have it in their nature to shed blood in this manner. The three races best
suited to be a warrior are the <a href="../race/barbarian.html">barbarians</a>, <a href="../race/troll.html">trolls</a>, and <a href="../race/ogre.html">ogres</a>. Notice
that all three races are of the large variety. This is not only because of stats but due
to the fact that large races get the racial ability to slam which allows them to bash(stun
attack) without a shield and also allows them to do so while using both duel wield and
double attack. <br>
<br>
Barbarians are probably the weakest stat wise of the three and they also lack infravision.
However barbarians are the only of the big three that is widely accepted throughout
Norrath. Barbarians also have the extra perk of being able to wear both human and large
sized armor(human sized armor is cheaper). <br>
<br>
Ogre's are probably the best pick stat wise. You will probably want to pour a lot of
points into agility but otherwise they are set. Ogre's have extremely high strength and
stamina which are prime traits for a warrior. The weaknesses of ogre's are that they are
evil and their low intelligence will result in your skills raising slowly. <br>
<br>
Trolls have stats that lie somewhere between a barbarian and an ogre. The advantage of a
troll however is in his natural regeneration. This is an important ability for a warrior
as regeneration means less downtime when you are soloing.<br>
<br>
Thus far we have discussed the strengths of a warrior and how well he fits in a party. Now
we will cover the weaknesses of a warrior and why he does not make a great solo character
at later levels(20+). <br>
<br>
Warriors do not make great solo players for several reasons. The first one to become
obvious is the fact that monsters run. At the first couple levels you will be able to
finish these runners off in a swing or two and it will not be that big of a deal. As the
monsters get tougher however they will require quite a few hits to finish. In a dungeon
environment this is especially deadly because they will lead you into tougher monsters as
you chase behind them trying to finish them off. In a party you will usually have casters
who can root the monster or finish it off with a direct damage spell.<br>
<br>
The second weakness that becomes apparent around level 5 is that warriors heal slowly.
Warriors have more hit points than any other class yet they heal at the same rate. At
higher levels you can expect to rest for up to 20 minutes if you are fully damaged. You
can invest in bark potions or quest for a <a href="../quest/squadring.html">Squad Ring</a>(unless
you are an evil race) but these can be expensive or hard to achieve. This factor probably
more than anything else will lead a warrior to team with some sort of healer. <br>
<br>
The third weakness with a warrior is the amount of time it takes him to kill monsters at
higher levels. A properly equipped warrior may be able to kill the same monsters as a
casting class of the same level but it will usually take the warrior much longer. This is
to be expected. We hit for less damage and can absorb much more. However in the amount of
time it takes you to finish off your opponent the chance continues to grow that another
monster will respawn or walk accross your path thus spoiling your fun and possibly forcing
you to run. This can be quite frustrating to fight a monster for a couple minutes only to
be forced to run empty handed and then rest for 10-15 minutes as a result of it.<br>
<br>
The fourth glaring weakness of a warrior is the lack of his ability to cure himself of
diseases and poisons. This becomes evident as you begin to gain levels and more or less
makes entire dungeons(such as <a href="../zone/befallen.html">Befallen</a>) completely
impossible for a warrior to solo in. Some diseases can last for hours and in the meantime
you will be unable to heal(or even worse you will be losing hit points) until some nice
cleric comes along and cures your disease.<br>
<br>
Thankfully there are items that can cure some of the warriors deficiencies allowing him to
do some more interesting things. An example would be healing potions, potions of gate,
cure potions, <a href="../equipment/journeymanboots.html">journeyman boots</a>, etc.
However these will never hide the fact that a warrior is designed for a group. A warrior
should be a leader and will find it hard to branch off on his own. In a group however you
will be very happy. Warriors are in the thick of things more than any other class in a
group and you have others to make up for all of your shortcomings.<br>
<br>
In the end warriors are a perfect class for a certain style of play. They are not a class
that is well suited for solo play and if that sort of thing is your bag you might want to
try a <a href="druid.html">druid</a>, <a href="magician.html">magician</a>, or a <a href="necromancer.html">necromancer</a>. However if your idea of a good time is to be a
good team member and to put your life in the hands of others and trust them to keep you
alive then a warrior is an exciting and a very fun class to play.<br>
