          <tr>
            <td>Verant has had some blunders in the past. Being a producer of the most successful
            MMORPG to date you are going to be constantly under the microscope. Their mistakes have
            been well documented on sites accross the internet including ours. Perhaps no blunder has
            been as big as the one which has recently befallen us however. <br>
            <br>
            Two weeks ago Verant opened their online store to begin taking orders on their highly
            anticipated Everquest expansion Ruins of Kunark. They were immediately flooded with
            thousands of orders by players wanting to get their title before the official April 24th
            release date. Commercially Kunark could already be seen as a success and the future of
            Everquest was looking brighter and brighter. <br>
            <br>
            That future continues to look bright. However I would be lying to you if I was to say that
            the execution of ROK has been a success. The first problem was that Verant failed to make
            it clear was to when Ruins of Kunark was going to be playable on the game servers. Many
            players ordered Next Day shipping assuming that the sooner they received the game the
            sooner that they could play the game. I myself sent mails to three Verant employees and
            could not receive any response to my questions simply asking them to clarify the
            situation. A day later this was cleared up and many users who shipped overnight felt as if
            they were misled into believing they could play the game immediately. Other users felt
            misled into thinking that if they ordered the upgrade overnight they would at least have
            the CD in a couple of days. I must report however in Verant's defense that it clearly said
            in the login message that they would not begin shipping until the following week(April
            11th). <br>
            <br>
            The second major problem came with overseas shippings. Some oversea players were forced to
            play ridiculous shipping costs in order to play the game in the near future. This was not
            really under Verant's control. It still angered a good number of players. One thing that
            was under Verants control is the upgrade CD. Current plans are for you to only be able to
            buy the full retail(a new version with upgrade included) in stores and not the upgrade.
            The full retail version will sell at an estimated $39.95 as compared to the $16.95 upgrade
            price. The only way to order the upgrade is via the online store. Verant has made it clear
            that it will not be available in stores.<br>
            <br>
            These are relatively small issues to some. Sure some players paid a bit extra for
            overnight shipping were angered by these moves. A few even threatened to sue. To the bulk
            of consumers however this was a forgiveable offense. The last problem is a bit larger. At
            least in my personal opinion.<br>
            <br>
            Ruins of Kunark was supposed to begin shipping on Tuesday April 11th. There was a slight
            delay in the shipping process and we were informed that it would not ship until the 12th.
            These things happen and not many were worried. The day that your product shipped you were
            supposed to receive a confirmation email to let you know the expansion had been sent. <br>
            <br>
            As early as Thursday the 13th a small number of players were receiving copies of Ruins of
            Kunark. Several sites posted screenshots of the new map and posted the starting stats of
            the new Iksar race. On friday the <a href="http://www.everquest.com">official</a>
            Everquest page was updated with this small bit of news.<font size="2"><blockquote>
              <p>&quot;Due to unforeseen technical problems we are experiencing a slight delay in
              shipping The Ruins of Kunark software. We have fixed the technical problems and are
              currently processing orders as quickly as possible. Many have already been shipped out. <font color="#00FFFF">Please note that we will be using the shipping option you chose. Please be
              assured that you will receive your software and be ready to experience The Ruins of Kunark
              on the release date of April 24th.</font> We apologize for any delays this may cause you.</font>&quot;</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Please note the text highlighted in Cyan. Many players including myself did not get too
            worried with the original delays. What does it matter so long as we have it by the 24th
            right? Well sort of. <br>
            <br>
            Verant has said several times this month that they will try to place the servers online a
            couple days early if they can. They have made no promises but many people believe that the
            Kunark servers may be live by Saturday rather than Monday. I personally find this to be
            unlikely as a result of the shipping problems and public pressure. It would help alleviate
            some of the stress however as a smaller number of players might have their copies early
            rather than late and might get it out of their system.<br>
            <br>
            So with this date rapidly approaching many of us are wondering what the deal is. I am not
            aware of the official numbers on what orders have been shipped but in a player poll that I
            personally gave today it appears that well over half of the Everquest players have not so
            much as received a confirmation that their order has shipped. That is a conservative
            number. If I had to guess i'd put it closer to 70%. <br>
            <br>
            The interesting thing here is I have one friend who just ordered Kunark on Friday morning
            and has already received a confirmation. Yet myself and at least six others I know ordered
            within hours of the store going online. I myself ordered three copies within hours of the
            store going online. I ordered next day delivery and have yet to receive a confirmation on
            any of the orders. <br>
            <br>
            I found <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/news/comments/956062446,82210,.shtml">this</a>
            thread on <a href="http://www.eqvault.com">EQVault</a> which I felt was rather
            interesting. The first comment reads... </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>After speaking with a lady at 1-888-800-1340 I was told that my order had not yet been
              shipped and would not be shipped until april 24th, scheduling me to receive it on the
              25th. Needless to say i was super dissapointed and I feel very sorry for those whose
              orders have not been shipped and ordered ground because their orders will not reach them
              for quite a while.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The next one is more disturbing. It reads as follows...</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Just got off the phone with the Station. They informed me that due to the technical
              problems of the first day after the patch. None of those orders were forwarded on to
              Zomax. They said that they got all of these taken care of on Saturday and that they should
              start shipping these orders out today. Um, we will see! LOL</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This would make sense considering myself and several players I know ordered a copy just
            hours after the store went online. However one of my friends who ordered just about an
            hour before I did received a confirmation letter on the 14th(Thursday). Here is a copy of
            the confirmation letter for those who are wondering if they have received one or not. It
            is proof that at least some players are receiving copies.</p>

            <p>Why is this such a big deal? Any ground mail deliveries that are not shipped out by
            today or tommorrow are not likely to reach many consumers before Monday. Next day
            deliveries have a bit larger window. Asumming that the servers do not open before Monday
            it appears that as much as half the user base could be left out. <br>
            <br>
            Why is this important? If you are like me you would like a chance to explore the game
            before every little detail is posted on to the spoiler sites(ours included). Fact of the
            matter is that within 24 hours much of Kunark will already be spoiled. This is a good
            chance for many of us to explore the new lands for the first time in a year. Players fully
            expected and were promised by Verant that they would have the package on their doorstep
            before expansion hit. <br>
            <br>
            Okay enough about why we want Kunark before release. Let's talk about the major concern of
            myself and many others regarding Kunark. I have been wondering all along what will happen
            when Kunark opens. Everyone is going to want to visit the new zones. It is likely to be a
            complete madhouse as hundreds of players fill the zones well beyond capacity. The
            consensus was that after a couple of crowded days many players would seek refuge in
            uncrowded zones on the mainland while others explored. <br>
            <br>
            When they began taking Kunark orders I wondered if they would stagger the orders. Only
            allow so many deliveries at a time. Those who remember the initial days of Everquest will
            remember that Verant used a similar tactic when Everquest was released. They limited the
            number of copies of the game that would be available for initial release. </font></p>
            <p>After receiving no confirmation still by mid-yesterday I decided to do a bit of
            investigating. I dialed Zomax(the shipping company) all day long only to find busy
            signals. I mailed Verant employees. I sent Zomax an email to inquire just what was going
            on. No responses from any of those emails. <br>
            <br>
            This morning I was finally able to reach the number which Verant provided everyone
            yesterday(Zomax). An automated message was the result. After going through not one but
            three touch tone answers I was greeted with the same generic recorded answer that could be
            found on the Everquest news page. Once again stating they are having problems and assuring
            us that we would have a copy of Kunark in time for April 24th. What about users who
            entered in incorrect information? What about those who had an actual billing question?
            There was no way to reach an operator. All that we got was what we could have read on the
            internet. <br>
            <br>
            The most disturbing event happened last night. A friend was had given the wrong mailing
            address for his copy of Kunark and was trying to clear things up. Zomax was unreachable so
            he tried the desperate move of petitioning a GM. During his conversation with the GM he
            asked what the deal was since most players still have yet to receive a confirmation or a
            copy of the game. I will leave the GM's name out for but it was a GM-Admin and not a
            guide. I have contacted Verant to ask them to comment on this issue. As of yet (a day
            later) no comment.<br>
            <br>
            The GM informed him that Verant would be staggering shipments of Kunark. He told him that
            they were worried about the initial burst of players to Kunark and that as a result they
            would be limiting the amount of copies of the game initially.<br>
            <br>
            It must be noted that this was only a GM it was not an official Verant statement. I have
            contacted multiple Verant employees(including Brad McQuaid).&nbsp; I specifically
            mentioned that I would go public with this if they did not clear it up. I have yet to
            receive a response from any of them. <br>
            <br>
            Whether this GM was just blowing smoke is not the issue here. I find it extremely hard to
            believe that this would be Verant's official position on the matter. I do not doubt that
            this could be an unofficial stance by Verant from behind closed doors. I am further
            bothered by the fact that they have yet to feel a need to respond to the shipping problems
            anywhere in public or in private to me when asked. All their assurances will do no good
            unless they put shipping in to high gear in the next twenty four to fourty eight hours.
            Considering the relatively small amount of shipments they have made in the past six days
            this is beginning to look more and more unlikely.<br>
            <br>
            This is extremely disturbing because the players were never informed of this. In fact
            Verant specifically told us not to worry that our copies would be in our hands by the 24th
            just last Friday and continues to do so. The next few days will determine how many people
            receive Kunark in time for the release. Hopefully I am wrong. Hopefully 95% or more of the
            Everquest community receives their copies on time and most players are completely happy
            with the service. <br>
            <br>
            I only bring this article to you because it is not to late. If Verant is in fact
            staggering shipments on purpose then it is not too late for the EQ community to let them
            hear about it. If there are technical problems that are out of their control then the
            least they can do is come forward and admit it. The silence is hurting the user community
            and it's putting a further gap between the user community and Verant. I have tried to get
            answers to these questions in private for the rest of the community. I have failed to
            accomplish this task and it is now up to you the community. Good luck everyone and I hope
            to see you all on Kunark next Monday.<br>
