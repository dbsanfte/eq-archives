<p>Monks, like rogues, don't peak until later levels. While warriors can dish out 30hp damadge with a two hander at level 10, monks wont be doing 30 damadge until level 30. However take comfort in the fact that at later levels, you will mop the floor with warriors. Monks are the only class that start with duel wield, although it wont work very often until you reach level 15 or so (which is the level warriors get duel wield) it does decrease the gap between warriors and monks at low levels.
<p>
Stats:
<p>
Strength - Will make you do more damadge at high levels, and let you carry more. I wouldn't put any points here, since you don't need to carry more (you wont be carring more then 15 pounds since that will make you lose AC), and you wont make that much more damadge at higher levels... <p>
Stamina - You get a few more hps every level, very insignificant. Don't put any points here.
<p> 
Agility - This is where you should dump all your points. Agility will raise your AC a little but the important thing it will do is make you dodge, block and riposte better. And not getting hit is always top priority, besides there isn't anything else worth putting points at.
<p> 
Dextirity - Nobody knows what this stat does exactly... supposingly it makes you hit more often but I havn't noticed any diffrence. And it also helps with ranged atacks and spells, but you wont be using any of those.
<p> 
Equipment:
<p> 
Monks don't need much. The can use blunt weapons but it's really not recommended, while it may be a bit better then hand to hand at low levels, hand to hand is far superior at higher levels. But as long as you keep your hand to hand maxed, feel free to use blunt weapons. Monks can't wear more then leather (except some magical armor). The first thing you should do is get yourself a set of cloth armor, it's very light and will get you about 40AC. A full set of cloth armor costs about 3PP. Then you may want to save up for netted gloves, as they will let you kill wisps (Invlurnarable to everything but magical attacks, you should be at least level 10) which drop lightstones (greater lightstones can be sold for 5PP, very nice for level 10). After cloth armor you may want to travel to Guk (a dungeon in the innothual swamp), it's a pretty dangerous trip, better get someone to cast invisibility on you. You can find Woven armor on level 8 mobs in guk. Woven is the same as leather but much ligher. That's what you will be using until you get to level 20-25 at which point you will want to go back to Guk, and fight Froglock Gaz warriors. They drop Mesh armor which is almost as good as chain but still much lighter. Unfortunatly, you will be using Mesh up to really high levels at which point you may want to seek out rubicite armor. When you reach level 50 you could try and get green splinted platemail which is the best armor in the game. It's much stronger then plate (the gloves give 14AC), very light and give some nice attribute boosts. Monks are very vulnerable to magic, that's why you should look for items that will increase your resistances as you travel. Just remember to keep your weigh below 15 at all times. That means you will either have to sell loot often or be selective as for what you are looting.
<p> 
Starting location:<p> 
Monks can start in Freeport or Qeynos, depending on deity. I have been to qeynos and freeport many times, and yet I'm not sure what's the best place to start in. Qeynos is less crowded, yet there are less mobs to kill. There's a nice dungeon in the qeynos hills which you can go to at level 6 or so. Freeport has alot of mobs to kill, and it borders with the northern desert of ro, which is a great place to get from level 7 to 15. However there are griffins (a level 35 mob) wandering around freeport which are agressive and will kill you in one hit if you go near them. It's very fustrating to fight near griffins... I think the best thing to do is start in freeport and go to misty thicket (borders with rivervale, go to east commonlands, zone east to commonlands, zone east again, zone north into rivervale, and exit rivervale from the north to get to misty thicket.) Misty thicket is one of the best newbie places to hunt in. If you follow the road out of rivervale you should rich a wall with two halfling guards. Beyond the wall you can find bears, shadow wolfs, goblins, giant scarabs, giant spiders... very safe and plantyfull place for newbies ranging between levels of 5-12. <p> 
Skills: <p> 
You start with Mend, perhaps the most important Monk skill. Mend will heal about 25% of your health when succesful and it recycles every 6 minutes. Mend drastically reduces downtime. I wouldn't use mend during battles until your mend skill is at least 100 because it may fail and hurt you, and there's nothing more anoying then almost winning a fight, then using mend worsening your wounds and dying. Most peopel will tell you to hit this skill constatntly to imrpove it, that's true but when you get to level 7-8 you can start using it only when you need it, it'll max out anyway.<p>
Level 1 - Dodge, although you start with this skill you must put 1 point into it for it to start rising. This skill let's you avoide blows (duh). You will start appritiating this skill more as you level up (because it will work more often and because you will be getting hit for much more hps...)<p>
Level 3 - Safe fall. At the moment this skill will not go up, sometimes it actualyl works and you don't take damadge (you don't get a msg)<p> 
Level 5 - Round kick. Same as kick but it does a bit more damadge and has a cool animation :)<p> 
Level 8 - Sneak. This skill will make you move 1/4 of your normal speed. It happens to have a side effect that makes you move silently, that means that if you use it you can walk behind mobs and they will not atack you (because they wont know you are there). Pretty useful as it let's you get the first hit in, but it's very hard to cross thru zones and not getting hit with this skill (I think you are better off running...). also useful in PvP. <p> 
Level 10 - Tiger Claw. Another special move, This one will do about as much damadge as round kick does when you get it to the same skill level but it does recycle a bit faster. The animation for round kick is better though.<p> 
Level 12 - Block. This skill is like dodge.<p>
Level 15 - Double atack. This skill will make hit twice every round if successful. When you get this skill and duel wield high (level 25 or so) you should get four atacks per round from time to time. <p> 
Level 17 - Feign death.  I don't know why people say this is a great skill, even maxxed at level 27, it usually doesn't work... But still if you're going to die you might as well hit this skill as it may work and save your life. Me, I rather just kick ass.<p> 
Level 20 - Eagle strike. This special attack actually does more damadge then round kick, about twice as much. <p> 
Level 25 - Dragon punch. Another special move, sheesh.<p> 
Level 30 - Flying kick. The last of your special moves, this will do like 100hps at level 50, and about 70 once you get it maxxed at level 31-32.<p>
Level 35 - Riposte. Another dodge like skill.<p> 
Monks don't get taunt, but what most people don't know is that your special attacks act as taunt. Flying kick will almost always make a mob turn to you...<p> 
As a monk you should be grouping from level 10 up, you can solo beyond level 10 but it's much slower then grouping... in conclusion, let me add that you shouldn't worry about not being able to wield that execusioner's axe or fiery avenger, the monk's fists are the deadliest weapon in the game at level 50, especially with a claw... :)<p>
