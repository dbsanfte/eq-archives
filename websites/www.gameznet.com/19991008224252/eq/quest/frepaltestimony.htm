          <tr>
            <td valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="2">This quest was submitted by Jurok.<br>
            <br>
            This quest originates in North Freeport, by Merkos Quentos.&nbsp; He resides at the Hall
            of Truth on the grassy area below the Paladin Guildmaster, Valeron Dushire. This quest
            starts at about the 7th level, and ranges through the 12th level to complete solo. <br>
            <br>
            If you say, &quot;I am a squire&quot; to Merkos, he will say that he needs a small task.
            Little do you know that this will turn in to a major undertaking. You then ask, &quot;What
            is the small task&quot;. He will give you a note to give to Altunic Jartin in East
            Commonlands. You go to East Commonlands and Altunic will normally be in a hut across from
            the 3rd Inn just before the West Commonlands zone. If he is not there, just wait. He
            usually makes his rounds through East Commonlands every once in a while. Give him the note
            and he will say something about sending a squire to do a man's job and so forth. <br>
            <br>
            Then he will ask you&nbsp; to take care of a problem rogue that keeps bothering him at his
            house. Don't worry too much about the [house] part. If you say, &quot;Where is your
            house&quot;, he will say, &quot;Follow me&quot;, but you are already there. At this time,
            Narls, the rogue, will be standing outside the house shouting throughout the whole zone
            about how he is waiting for Jartin, blah, blah, blah. Narls is about 6th&nbsp; level, I
            believe. He is hard to hit, and has a pretty decent punch, twice a round. After killing
            him, you loot his body for a head. After getting the head, give it to Altunic Jartin. <br>
            <br>
            After giving it to Altunic, he then tells you that he likes to walk around and collect
            junk in the area to sell. He is afraid of the denizens and would like to have a Cloth
            Shirt to provide him with a little protection. You can buy a Cloth Shirt at the 2nd inn.
            Don't try a Small Cloth Shirt,&nbsp; it will not work. A Cloth Shirt will cost around 5-6
            gold to buy. You can also find Cloth Shirts on certain mobs in the game(orc centurions).
            After getting the Cloth Shirt, give it to Altunic. He will say how wonderful and noble you
            are and give you a coin called a &quot;Token of Generousity&quot;. He will tell you to
            tell Merkos you have earned the token of generosity. (notice the spelling, it is VERY
            important)<br>
            <br>
            Go to Merkos and say, &quot;I have earned the token of generosity&quot;. You MUST spell it
            this way. He will then say that to prove your bravery you have to fight a desert tarantula
            and get a spider venom sac for him. I do not know if a venom sac from a dune tarantula
            will work, but it might. If you decide to buy a spider venom sac, you might find one at
            the inn, or the fishing village, in North Ro. They normally run about 5-6 gold. You then
            give the spider venom sac to Merkos. He will then give you the &quot;Token of
            Bravery&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            He will tell you that if you wish to go through the &quot;Test of Truth&quot;, you must
            give him the tokens of generousity and bravery. Make sure you can&nbsp; easily defeat a
            desert tarantula before doing this(green). The finale of this wonderful adventure is near.
            You give Merkos the tokens of generousity and bravery one at a time, the order doesn't
            matter. After the second token, Merkos will say something&nbsp; about your opponent being
            in the sewer and to defeat them for the prize.<br>
            <br>
            This is very important, you must move very quickly to the sewer, where the canoe is, and
            to the left is Guard Willia. If you hesitate at all, Willia will run away, and you will
            lose your chance. Guard Willia will plead with you to not kill him/her, and will try to
            run away. The words [Freeport Militia] will appear in the paragraph, and if you try to say
            something, they will be long gone. I would guess the Guard is about 12th level or so, a
            little harder than a desert tarantula. After killing the Guard, you loot the body for a
            &quot;Token of Truth&quot;. If Guard Willia runs away, he/she will say, &quot;Thank you
            for letting me go. I promise to change my ways... Maybe!&quot; Give the token to Merkos,
            and he will give you 3 gold and your testimony of knighthood.</font></td>
