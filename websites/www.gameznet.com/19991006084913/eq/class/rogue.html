            <td>So.. you want to be a Rogue do ya? <p>Maybe this guide will help you on your way...
            and maybe it will help you on another choice for a class. All in all &#133; this guide was
            written to help any adventurer out weather rogue, cleric, mage, or any of the other
            classes. <u><i><b></p>
            <p>Race</b></i></u></p>
            <p>So... the first question is... what race do you want your rogue to be?</p>
            <p>Halflings are said to make the best rogue... with naturally high dex and agility... as
            well as decent strength and stamina. They also wear small sized armor... which is lighter
            and cheaper then both medium and large type armor.. which adds to their playability. They
            also get infra-vision... which helps on those dark Norrath nights..</p>
            <p>My personal favorite is the wood elf, for many reasons.</p>
            <p>-First, they are natural rogues by sorts in their high agility and dexterity make em
            wonderful at their trade. </p>
            <p>-They also have the option of wearing both small and medium armor, where a Halfling can
            only wear small. This plays a greater factor in some magic armor that is medium&#133; and
            some magic armor that is small. This allows the Wood-Elf and Dark-Elves to wear both...
            which adds to the amount of toys they have access too. </p>
            <p>-Wood-Elves also have foraging... a rogues best friend. Foraging helps a rogue stay out
            of towns and hunt for a long time, and help them get food when t would otherwise be
            impossible without the help of other players. Though the foraging skill does not go up for
            wood-elves that aren't druids or rangers, the skill it begins at is adequate enough to
            supply yourself with food and water.</p>
            <p>- Wood-elves also get infra-vision... which edges them above the human and barbarians.</p>
            <p>Dark-Elves come in second in my choice for a rogue... and nearly are as good as a
            wood-elf... if not equal to them in diversity. The one thing that Dark-elves have over
            Wood-elves is Infra-vision... but their race/class combo makes them hated throughout
            Norrath. If you choose to be a thief-type and role-play evil more... maybe Dark-Elves
            would be a wiser choice then Wood-elves.</p>
            <p>-Barbarians also have a strength... though many weaknesses to go with it. The slamming
            ability of the barbarian class gives Barbarian Rogues an edge over their counterparts...
            allowing them to stun their opponents (for a little damage) and then whirl around for a
            backstab. The slamming ability, however, never goes up in skill for a rogue.. so you have
            to be content with 1 - 4 damage with it. Barbarians also have the ability to wear both
            medium and large type armor (which makes them edge out human-type rogues) as well as being
            an excellent fighter. Barbarians, however, along with humans are blind as a bat when it
            comes to night. If you choose a Barbarian of any type... you need to get a Greater
            Lightstone as soon as possible, or find yourself stumbling into camps of monsters and
            dying often.</p>
            <p>-Humans rogues have two weaknesses. They are limited to medium armor and have no
            infravision. If you choose a Human rogue... make sure to read what I said about
            Barbarians.</p>
            <p>-I would not recommend a gnome or a Dwarf as a rogue... though Dwarfs tend to have the
            stats. They might have the numbers down.. but to me its hard to imagine a successful gnome
            or dwarf rogue. They might.. however.. be better Rogues then humans and/or barbarians...
            but I'm not too certain. Also Dwarfs never seem to like Rogues.. although not KOS by the
            dwarf guards.. it was a very hard time to get a shopkeeper to deal with you. I ruled out
            Gnomes fairly quickly just going to Ak'Anon once... I despise that city. =P Also they
            never liked me much after I killed all their zoo exhibits.</p>
            <p>Whichever the class, pick the one you want to be by the area you are in and what type
            of character you want to be. Being the &quot;Ultimate&quot; rogue with best stats would
            lead you to be a Halfling, but that won't help you much if all your friends are
            Barbarians. So choose a race with both the class in mind and your preferences. How you use
            ability points is another factor, which brings me to my next Topic.<u><i><b></p>
            <p>How to Spend your Ability points</b></i></u></p>
            <p>Spending your ability points is really flexible.. depending on what you want to do with
            your rogue. I'll just basically tell what each stat does and tell you my preference.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <i><b><p>Strength</b> - </i>Strength basically affects your damage a little bit, but more
              importantly how much you can carry. If your a small class, (dwarf, gnome, Wood-elf,
              dark-elf, halfling, etc) you want your strength to be at least in the 70's... to be able
              to wear your armor and higher for the medium/large classes...</p>
              <i><b><p>Dexterity </b>- </i>Dexterity supposedly affects how often you hit in melee
              combat, but haven't seen this shown much. Dexterity does affect missile/throwing weapons
              however, so if you are planning on using archery or throwing.. make sure you have a decent
              dexterity. Dexterity also determines the rate at which magical effects on weapons take
              effect, so dexterity will play a more important role later on in your career as a rogue.
              Dexterity also slightly affects the usage of your skills.. Such as pickpocketing, picking
              locks and what not. Dexterity is one of the prime Requisites for a Rogue... at least thats
              what Verant leads you to believe.</p>
              <i><b><p>Agility</b></i>- This is the mother of all stats for a Rogue, as well as any
              melee class in my opinion. Agility is the skill that most directly impacts your character
              in his AC.. So the more agility you have the less you get hit. (Does wonders when combined
              with dodging and parrying). A high agility is what makes a Rogue a worthwhile melee class.
              Another Prime Requisite for Rogues here.</p>
              <i><b><p>Stamina</b></i> - Stamina affects your Hit Points&#133; as well as how tired you
              get while fighting. You might want to add a point or two here if you see yourself needing
              more hitpoints, but is totally un-needed in my opinion.</p>
              <i><b><p>Intelligence</b></i> - Intelligence, though more important for mage-type
              characters, is an important stat none the less. It affects how fast you learn skills... so
              if you envision yourself with multiple-types of weapons.. you might want to add a few
              points here. I found that an intelligence of 75 lets me learn quite quickly... allowing me
              to learn piercing, slashing, archery (somewhat), and un-armed combat pretty quickly
              without being behind in skill.</p>
              <i><b><p>Wisdom</b></i>- The only thing wisdom does for you is affect your resistances
              slightly. Other then that.. it doesn't really seem to affect anything else.</p>
              <i><b><p>Charisma</b></i>- Charisma might be important for you, because your going to need
              the edge you can get when dealing with NPCs. All in all everyone will hate ya... but a
              high charisma might help you get your faction up with some classes. If you&#146;re a
              Dark-Elf good luck. =P</p>

            <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>How to start off...(A guide from 1-20)</b></i></u></p>
            <p>Starting off is hard in any class, but luckily its nearly all the same. You just go out
            and kill things out in the newbie gardens and scrounge up some money for basic Equipment.
            Kill the local ruined-pelt giving animals (wolf/cats/bears) for patchwork armor and get a
            tailor (or be a tailor yourself) to make some patchwork. You also want to stick with that
            training dagger start off with and get another rusty/tarnished dagger as soon as possible.
            Though you might not always use a dagger... and prefer a spear or other piercing weapon..
            a dagger is nice to boost your skill relatively quick, since you hit a monster a lot more
            with a dagger, which is a greater chance to increase skill per fight. This goes for all
            weapons... find the one with lowest delay and use that to boost skill. Also lower delay
            weapons help out on the higher-level critters in hitting em.. and I seem to do much better
            with lets say a tarnished dagger then a tarnished spear on monsters that con as gambles or
            low tombstones. Stick to the newbie gardens until at least level 5.. doing some exploring
            before then to where you'll hunt next. Always know your surroundings as well, it helps a
            lot with locating your bodies. At level 3 make sure you throw a point into dodging. It
            &quot;primes&quot; the skill up and it will increase by itself eventually. At level 5 or
            6... you should be out of the newbie gardens and maybe a zone away or two. Around these
            levels... group with a cleric one or two levels lower then you... both you and the cleric
            will gain experience quickly killing off some of the undead around. Also practice some of
            your skills while resting and in combat... especially pick pocketing at level 7. You
            shouldn't use your practice points much unless its in a trade skill or the
            &quot;basics&quot; you MUST spend on skills to start learning them. Also a trade skill
            might pop in as well as archery/throwing... where it is wise to spend some points. Save
            some points up though... since skills later will need some boosting. </p>
            <p>At level 10... you get your most prized skill.... backstabbing. Backstabbing makes you
            a viable component in any group, which is when you should start considering dungeon
            hunting and being in groups of more then 2 people. When you get level 10... you might want
            to consider pumping in a good 15 points into backstabbing since its a somewhat hard skill
            to increase quickly. Safe Fall at level 12 is also a skill that tends to refuse to go up
            much... so might want to prime it up a bit. You might also be considering either
            store-bought leather.. or maybe player-made metal armor now.. if you have the plat for it.
            </p>
            <p>At level 13, you get parrying. This skill is a much-welcomed added defense which lets
            you get hit less by blocking an attack. Only spend a point or two here... it eventually
            goes up by itself. </p>
            <p>Then comes the level 15/16 combo. Here you get Double attack and Dual wield... Which
            are just add so much to a rogue I can't put it into words. If you trained up something
            besides piercing.. such as slashing.. Have your Primary weapon as a piercing weapon and
            your secondary weapon as either piercing as well.. or maybe a minotaur axe or Tentacle
            whip (The life-tap abilities help a lot), whatever you want. These two skills tend to have
            a slow start... so primer them up if you have training points to spare.</p>
            <p>At level 18 comes another Rogue-specific skill... the Art of Poisoning. This skill
            doesn't come to play much til level 20... when you get to make your own poison. During the
            beta.. poisoning wasn't in yet (at level 10).. but it seems like a wonderful skill to
            have. </p>
            <p>At Level 20.. comes the ability to make your own poisons.. which will help a lot for
            that apply poison skill... as well as the last name that you can have bestowed upon you.
            Make sure you petition a GM if you want your last name (unless they changed that). You
            also get Disarm traps at level 20, which would be real helpful if there were many traps to
            disarm. The abilities of a rogue don't seem to come in too often.... below 20 that is.</p>
            <p>Remember that speed is a much needed quality in all your weapons that you get... Rogues
            tend to to better hitting a lot then hitting for a lot, but always have balance between
            damage and weapon speed.<u><i><b></p>
            <p>Level 20 and beyond...</b></i></u></p>
            <p>If you haven't been grouping yet... I am surprised you have gotten this high. now its
            ESSENTIAL to be grouping. Use your skills to add to the groups your in and be a viable
            team member. Some skills, such as Disarm traps and such not seems like they would be
            valuable skills, but they come into play during the deep-dungeon expeditions. Instill
            Doubt is a nice welcome to your arsenal, causing enemies flee (and showing their backsides
            for a nice backstab). Disarm also is a nice skill.. which lets you take the weapons your
            enemy is using (adding to the coin purse a lot there). Basically, your abilities beyond 20
            truly increase in the new toys or items you get. A rogue, probably as much or even more
            then a warrior depends on the equipment he has a lot... with the rogue tending to have
            more cash then the warrior to buy this equipment. The upside to this, however, is that you
            get a bunch of cool toys to play with . =P This alone makes Rogues a much more appealing
            class then their nearest coutnerpart.. the Monk.. though the Monk is one of the true
            masters of avoiding damage, Rogues come in at a close second but with the added fun of all
            the nice toys that are available (especially for the wood-elves... since they can wear
            both small and medium sizes and quest for a lot of stuff). Remember to make a lot of
            friends... since you need em. =P The most important thing to remember is to have fun, is a
            game after all.</p>
            <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Downsides to a Rogue</b></i></u></p>
            <p>There are, however, lots of downsides to a Rogue. They are hated by most every race,
            (except Halflings of course), and that makes it a challenge sometimes. They also don't
            have the nice abilities of a magic-using class of getting spells every 4 or 5 levels... so
            at higher levels Rogues might tend to get a little boring (unless you can keep getting
            better and better equipment). They are however more enjoyable then a Warrior.. as you can
            see with a high-level backstab skill. They are, however, limited to 1-handed weapons...
            which makes it a kind of disappointment damage wise (as you see all the warriors
            completely destroying a monster with a halberd or other 2-handed weapon). Although we
            dodge melee attacks well, we take some hard hits from spells, making us weak to some
            higher level monsters (having less hitpoints then the other melee classes). This is where
            a lot of magic/fire/cold/poison/disease resisting magic items come to affect for the
            Rogue. Rogues also tend to be a class ignored by the programmers (their skills are
            somewhat incomplete and not very usable at times), and that tends to hit them hard from
            being truly balanced with all the other classes. </p>
            <p>Your choice of character really is determined by how you want to play. There is no
            &quot;best&quot; class, there are no tank mages... which makes this game all the more
            enjoying. Rogues can be a worthwhile class, as all classes can be, and to me they are the
            class I would enjoy EverQuest the most as. But that is why you have eight slots.. To
            explore all the racial and career opportunities provided by each class. </p>
            <p>All in all... although Rogues seem to be more popular now we are in the final... many
            people may find themselves struggling with a Rogue... as all classes seem to have, which
            can make the game frustrating. If you choose the Rogue because they can pick pockets...
            your going to be somewhat disappointed with the class in the long run. If you chose a
            Rogue because all their abilities and characteristics seems like the type of character
            that you would have the most fun with, then the game will be much more enjoying in the
            long run.</p>
