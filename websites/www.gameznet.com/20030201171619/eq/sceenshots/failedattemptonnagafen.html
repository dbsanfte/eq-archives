            <td>This collection of screenshots is a slideshow of pictures taken by several different
            players. The screenshots depict our attempt on Lord Nagafen(the deadly red dragon)'s
            life.They are a collection acquired over two different raids. The first was unsuccessful
            and nearly everyone lost their lives. The second one was successful after quite a few
            deaths.<p align="center"><A href="solb/dragonbridge.jpg"><IMG height=240 alt="dragonbridge.jpg (65163 bytes)" src  ="solb/dragonbridge.jpg" width=320 border=0 ></a></p>
            <p align="center">This is a picture of the "Dragon Bridge". This is the bridge
            that leads to the lair of Nagafen.</p>
            <p align="center"><A href="solb/giantsattack.jpg"><IMG height=240 alt="giantsattack.jpg (147789 bytes)" src  ="solb/giantsattack.jpg" width=320 border=0 ></a></p>
            <p align="center">These were the last group of fire giants that we had to face before
            getting Nagafen alone.</p>
            <p align="center"><A href="solb/mouthofdragon.jpg"><IMG height=240 alt="mouthofdragon.jpg (72289 bytes)" src  ="solb/mouthofdragon.jpg" width=320 border=0 ></a></p>
            <p align="center">Nagafen's lair is right up this tunnel. </p>

            <p align="center">This is a peek of Nagafen in his actual Lair. Unfortunately he came
            running out to the doorway when we smacked the Magi. It would have been a much friendlier
            environment to fight in.</p>
            <p align="center"><A href="solb/nagafenhead.jpg"><IMG height=240 alt="nagafenhead.jpg (91635 bytes)" src  ="solb/nagafenhead.jpg" width=320 border=0 ></a></p>
            <p align="center">The battle had begun. Unfortunately when we cleared the last two giants
            Nagafen had run to the doorway here. He could not fit through the passage so we had to
            fight in this rather cramped hallway rather than his spacious lair. This caused us some
            headache. One might think you can simply run away and rest and recover your mana and hit
            points. This is not possible however as Nagafen can summon you back to his side(as many
            players discovered).</p>

            <p align="center">Here is a taste of the mass fear spell that Nagafen was casting. It
            would send 30 or so people running at a time. This would allow Nagafen to simply breath
            his lava breath(which is area effect and would reduce me(a level 45 shadowknight) by a
            good 2 bars at a time and claw(for 225) the remaining few players who are near him to
            death.</p>

            <p align="center">This is the best picture I have to give you an idea of the size of
            Nagafen. I tried to get a picture standing back a ways to emphasize his size.
            Unfortunately every time I attempted to I would be feared and it would go out the window.
            &nbsp; I did not last much longer than this screenshot.</p>
            <p align="center"><A href="solb/backofnagafen.JPG"><IMG height=240 alt="backofnagafen.JPG (160544 bytes)" src  ="solb/backofnagafen.JPG" width=320 border=0 ></a></p>
            <p align="center">The last of my Nagafen screenshots. This is of the neck, wings and in
            the distance you can see his tail.</p>
            <p>Our first attempt failed miserably. The fear spell which Nagafen would cast on us was
            the main culprit. Soon all of our tanks were dead. Their corpses were underneath Nagafen
            himself(who had summoned them there) so we could not ressurect them to continue. I died
            early but from what I gathered from the others there eventually we all ran out of mana. We
            had the beast down to about 1/3 of it's health bar but he simply summoned our spellcasters
            one at a time(who with no tanks had to resort to trying to meditate during battle and
            sending in pets) and sumarily slaughtered them. We had learned some valuable lessons for
            the next attack, and we would return...</p>
