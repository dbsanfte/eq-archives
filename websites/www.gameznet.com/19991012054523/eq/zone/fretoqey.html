          <tr>
            <td>This guide was submitted by Akaran of Veeshan.<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#ff0000"><p></font><font color="#C0C0C0">Ok, this is a generally easy, but long, task. Most of the problems you'll
            face are on the Qyenos side of the continent. And if you run real fast through HighHold,
            you won't have much problems there either. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">By the way, it makes sense to stop and get bound in Rivervale
            when you get there, but that's a little ahead of things. <br>
            <br>
            Starting at the West Gate, make sure you have some food, water, and some type of light
            source (Lightstone or Greater Lightstone; even better is Serpent Sight). You don't need
            Speed of Wolf (SoW) but it might be helpful if you get caught in the middle of a train.
            Don't forget to be fully armed and armored because chances are you WLL meet up with
            somthing big and ugly. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">By the way, if you're a Paladin or Shadow Knight, you might want
            to wait on your trip uintil your &quot;Lay Hands&quot; or &quot;Harm Touch&quot; is able
            to be cast again. I'm not kidding about these nasties, and it's always good to be fully
            prepared for any lengthy trip. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Ok, from the West Gate, head West into the Eastern Commons.
            Simply follow the path, don't go off on any splits in the path, just keep walking until
            you get to the West Commons. In the EComms, just keep your eyes open for Young Kodiacs,
            Black Bears, Black/Shadow Wolves, Lions and Lionesses. Oh, and there's a rather large
            Griffen that spawns in there too. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Once in the WCommons, you can either follow the right edge of the
            map or the path. I generally follow the right edge, but be careful becaue you'll have a
            chance of running into some Orc/Derv Camps and a Mummy/Skel spawning ground. Keep folowing
            the edge until you hit the entrance to the Kithcor Woods. Watch out for Kodiacs, Orcs,
            Zombies, ect. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">In Kithcor, it's probably dark. It's ALWAYS dark in Kithcor. Keep
            your eyes open and your weapon ready. Usually I'm through this zone so fast I don't bother
            to stop and look at the locals, just keep going until you hit the fork in the path. If you
            are feeling daring, go ahead and follow the fork on the right which goes to HighHold Pass.
            If you're feeling intelligent, go on the left hand path and head into Rivervale. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Once in Rivervale, scream until you get bound. If you can't find
            anyone to bind you, go into Misty Thicket and ask there, donate if necessary. (East and
            West Commons aren't fun to go through naked) Stock up on provisions if necessary, and try
            and refrain from making any short jokes. Also sit and heal, meditate to recover any mana
            spent. This is very important, because you're going on the path through HighHold, which
            is, arguably, the NPC training ground for the Fear Plane. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Leaving Rivervale, follow the path back to the fork. Go on the
            path on your right, head to HighHold Pass. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Once you hit HH, start running and don't stop. Don't stop to read
            this guide, don't stop to grab a drink. Don't stop to help or heal, if you do you'll
            probably be dead. (Ignore this if you're above level 15 or so.. if you're that level go in
            and have fun) At the entrance you'll be in the middle of an Orc Spawning ground. Run. Go
            straight. You'll cross two bridges in sucession, then have a chance to turn twice, don't.
            After the second brach on the path, you come to a third turn on your left. Take this turn.
            And pray. This is Gnoll spawning ground, so go through it very quickly, if you get hit
            keep running because the zone isn't far ahead of you. Soon as you hit East Karana sit and
            take a breather. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Well now, that was fun, wasn't it? </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">The trip through East Karana is a vacation. Don't look down,
            however. Take the right hand ledge and walk through this zone. I saw no monsters here at
            all. Just keep walking and stay close to the mountainside. (It's a long way down)
            Eventually the edge will lower down to a open field, get on it and kiss the ground. From
            there, start walking and cross the wooden bridge into the nest Zone, North Karana. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">Ok, durring the trip through most of the Karana's, I didn't see
            much hostile. Much, that is. I hear stories of Griffens, Hill Giants and other biggies.
            And I saw a number of Silvermist Wolves, a varied assortment of Bears, and a Bandit.
            Through north Karana, don't deviate from the path, don't take either of the two left turns
            you'll see. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">West Karana is HUGE. Bears, bugs and other biggies spawn here, so
            be careful and back away from anything that cons higher than blue to you. Also, avoid the
            big barns near the farms. You'll see what I mean. Bandits, both caster and non-caster hide
            in there, and will attack upon sight. Just stay on the main path, don't take any of the
            branches on the track. Near the end of your journey, you'll see a human on the track
            (usually). He's a bandit, and a hard one to kill. (Yellow to me when I passed through the
            area at level 9) Leave the track long enough to put alot of space between you and him,
            then once you've safely put a large ammount of space between the two of you, get back on
            the path and zone into Qyenos Hills. </font></p>
            <p><font color="#C0C0C0">From the Qyenos hills, you're set. Just follow the path down into
            Qyenos, and ask for a bind. <br>
            <br>
            That wasn't overly difficult, but if you want to have a higher survival rate (or lower,
            depending) go with a small group. This means you can have more people covering your back,
            but it also means that you'll have a greater chance of attracting somthing nasty. </font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#ff0000"></font></td>
