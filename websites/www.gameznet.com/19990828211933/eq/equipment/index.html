			I decided to do a minor update.  I'm going to wait until tommarrow morning to do the big update.  It's just alot of items from the fear plane.
			This item is another rogue dagger.  Look below to find it.  Also, not sure why those links went down.  The xoom worked fine this morning and the other one did as well.<br>-Iuons<br><br>

            I have received a couple mails from players to inform me that Verant did indeed put a

            serious warning of the planes being changed on the patch message. This is not the message

            we are referring to. We had been to the planes after this message several times. They

            changed it again last night without any warning. They DID in fact give a warning last

            night but not until after 20 of us had died down there and petitioned agrily. In the

            aftermath everyone who stayed on for a couple of hours had their corpses summoned to a

            safe spot and were ressed by the GM's and teleported out. <br>

            <br>

            Posted eight new items including a rogue only piercing weapon.<br>

            -J.C.<br>

            <br>

            I talked to Vlad of Avatars of Doom on Karana awhile back. He said like J.C. said, they've

            made the planes extremly hard now. Creatures backstabbing for 400 damage when you try to

            portal in. Getting hit can teleport you to other parts of the zone. He did mention before

            they made it impossible to get it about some of the armor. Hopefully he'll send it on in

            as well as the rest of his guildmates. Paladin armor is blue. Cleric armor is purple. Bard

            armor is yellow. Druid is green chain. Ranger is green plate. Shaman is grey (not sure).

            They also managed to kill a dragoliche and got some nice items. So far there has been no

            findings of warrior or rogue only plate. Everyone send in your armor screenshots. Weapons

            are nice as well. Here's a few screenshots. <a href="http://www.webdoodle.net/dragon">Site

            Ah, it feels good to be home and in a place where my money is safe. Had a great time in

            Vegas. I wish that meant I won but unfortunatley it did not. <br>

            <br>

            I visited the newly opened Fear last night. Longest i've spent playing Everquest in a

            couple months. It's a very interesting area with tons of great items(many of them for a

            specific class only). Apparently Verant believed the items were being obtained a bit too

            easily so they beefed up the area. Unfortunately they did not tell anyone and we all zoned

            in to be summarily slaughtered. No GM assistance, not even a response. I understand that

            they wanted to make the planes a high risk area. Unfortunately I don't think it was wise

            of them to change the area and not warn anyone. They did warn everyone after the fact.

            Unfortunately by that time several people had already died in very bad locations(the

            scarelings teleport you away which makes it disorienting and hard to find your location). <br>

            <br>

            The items on the Plane of Fear are exceptional however. There seems to be a set of armor

            for each type of class, many of it class specific. For example shadowknights get nice

            black armor, rangers get green armor, paladins get blue and clerics get purple. I'm still

            waiting to get most of the screenshots in and will be posting them here. I did add one

            from my personal collection, the Umbral Platemail(shadowknight only) Greaves.<br>

            <br>

            Regarding the server slowdown. It's all a server problem. New server has already been

            ordered we are just waiting for it to arrive.<br>

            Fourth update today? -- Anyways, just a warning to all. Dropping weapons near walls can

            result in it being under the wall and unable to get it back. For those wizards out there,

            Ice Comet does 1120 damage for 400 mana. Thanks to Stalkin for this.<br>

            -Iunons<br>

            <br>

            For all those who replied or even read the message on the mesage board about helping me.

            Please read the last post that I made. Any flames -- send them to me. mattm@bellsouth.net

            -- Send me any flames you wish, I'm more than will to apolgize. I owe you all so much this

            only adds on to it. Once again, I'm very sorry. I wish I could find a way to make it up to

            you all. I feel horrible as of lately. I'm going to go do something for awhile, I've got

            to get away.<br>

            -Iuons<br>

            <br>

            Clarification: Jixl was the first person to get Soulfire on Xegony, I have no idea who was

            first to get it throughout the world. Please keep submitting screenshots of the equipment

            on Fear. I have stats of about 20 items, but screenshots/confirmations of only about 4.

            Also, all you Rogues might want to thank Arutha of Xegony for submitting Rogue Poison

            information. <br>

            For those who don't know, yesterday there was a rather big 'exploit'. Verant decided to

            make another trade skill useless. The skill this time was pottery. Yes, it had a purpose

            before. You could use it to make 100's of plat. Yes, they should have changed it so you

            didn't make that much as quick as people did. Verant changed Pie sketches from 1sp to 7gp

            on test server. People learned about this and before the patch came out, they bought

            hunderds of pie sketches. Some people claimed to have made 5000+pp. Just something I

            thought everyone should know.<br>

            -Iuons<br>

            <br>

            Thanks for all the e-mails. Very few item e-mails however, the ones we did get I'm posting

            now. Hopefully there are no mistakes. The page was going very slow yesterday for some

            reason. I cannot fix this. For those who sent in guild links or about events on servers.

            We used to post these, however, now we have the name that we are spoilers. We post

            articles here and there but for the most part we try to stick to items and quests. We

            slack alot on quests. For those who don't know there is a site called <a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">Allakhazam's Magical Realm</a>. He's very up to

            date on his quests and also has a nice item and many other things. If we don't have the

            information you want, try there. <br>

            Well one of the quiet people speaks up. Some news: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/soulfire.html">Soulfire</a> was first gotten on

            Xegony by Jixl Zycron and a couple days later by Kael. Not just a congratulations to them,

            but also informing everyone else the Soulfire quest is operational again. Also, I would

            like to vent, most of the email we get are crap. It literally takes over an hour to read

            all the mail we get and after that hour I got 1 thing I felt worthwhile to post. It is

            from the Fear Place so it isn't a bad post. ;p<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;-Kevork <p>Sorry about all the problems guys. I didn't know the

            tags were messed up for IE5 yet worked fine for Netscape. I tried to edit then and somehow

            I couldn't read it then (netscape). Hopefulyl I've got them all fixed. Sorry for the

            troubles.<br>

            -Iuons<br>

            <br>

            I just wanted to thank all those how have sent me e-mails. I've tried to send a reply to

            each and everyone, if you didn't get a reply, please resend. This is not something that I

            expected. I've tried to explain myself in <a href="http://206.86.100.18:8080/feqlizertempmessageboardgeneralmessages.showMessage?topicID=3.topic">this

            post</a>. Your welcomed to take a look at it. Also, sorry about the slowness of the site.

            I noticed it yesterday, I have no way of working with the server since J.C. usually is the

            one that does this. It still seems a bit slow, I've updated two items and I am about to go

            somewhere so I will try to get the others a little later (monk guide, paladin guide update

            and some screenshots). J.C. if you happen to see the site in Vegas, give me an e-mail.

            Need to talk to you. Once again thanks all. There is one other thing. Yesterday someone

            sent in an e-mail saying that he would pay 450$ if my account had not reached that by the

            time the end of the bidding. Seeing as I had trouble getting anyone to even bid 250, I

            thoght this was a great deal(still do) and I told him that if he offered 450 tommarrow I

            would take it. Well, it seems my account is now at 475. I am going to talk to him today,

            I'm not a big fan of going against my word so if he wants it, I will sell to him. If he

            decides to wait, and it doesn't get muhc over 450, I will still probably sell to him for

            being nice about it. Once agian this depends on him, I should be getting his e-mail today.

            That little bit of info was for those thinking about buying the account. <br>
