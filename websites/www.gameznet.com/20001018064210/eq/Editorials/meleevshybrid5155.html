            Stone Stance<br>
            <br>
            This discipline will absorb about 75% of the damage that you would normally take during
            combat. It only lasts for 12 seconds and has a reuse delay of 12 minutes initially. This
            reuse will fall to a mere 3 minutes at level 60.<br>

            Sipon Life<br>
            <br>
            Siphon life is a 75 hit point lifetap that takes 73 points of mana. I know what you might
            be thinking. Don't they have a 280 hit point lifetap already? Yes they do but this one is
            different.<br>
            <br>
            First off it is more mana efficient than life leech. Life leech requires 1.125 points of
            mana for every hit point healed where siphon life requires only 0.973. Not a huge
            difference but it is a difference nonetheless.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Life leech also has a two minute recast delay where you can chain cast siphon life until
            you are out of mana.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            On the flip side siphon life has a slightly longer casting time.<br>
            <br>
            So what does this all mean? Basically life leech is still your life saver during combat.
            Siphon life should be used for reducing downtime or for stepping back out of combat and
            self healing in an emergency if life leech is already gone.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin<br>
              </b><br>
              Pacify<br>
              <br>
              Pacify is an upgrade to the paladin's calm line of spells. This
              spell will reduce a monsters aggression and hopefully(if succesful)
              allow the paladin to pull a single mob in an area where several
              would normally come.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
              Ensnare
              <p>Ensnare is an upgrade to the snare spell. It is less easily
              resisted and has a longer duration. It requires 35 mana however
              which drives most rangers to keep snare memorized instead.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 52<br>
            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            Thunder Kick<br>
            <br>
            This discipline will cause your next succesful flying kick to do more than the maximum
            damage. I'm not sure how much more it will do number wise. It seems to add somewhere near
            about 25-50% damage for one attack. <br>
            <br>
            The base reuse delay is 7 minutes. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Warrior<br>
            </strong><br>
            Evasive<br>
            <br>
            This discipline allows a warrior to take less damage in melee combat. The disadvantage is
            that they will also do less damage themselves. The duration is a lengthy 3 minutes
            compared to a 15 minute base reuse delay.<br>
            <br>
            In my opinion this is an extremely useful skill. Warriors are tanks first and are the best
            tanks in the game. This skill allows them to be more effective at what they do best. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue<br>
            </strong><br>
            Rogues receive no disciplines at level 52.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight<br>
            </strong><br>
            Malignant Dead<br>
            <br>
            Malignant dead is a new pet spell. It is a big step up from your level 49 spell. This pet
            is the level 39 necromancer pet spell. It can dual wield as your last pet could but has
            quite a few more hit points and can hit for up to 39 points of damage each hit.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            In the eyes of some this is the first shadowknight pet that can actually be considered a
            good pet. It dishes a pretty decent amount of damage and can take a few hits without
            dying.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Rest the Dead<br>
            <br>
            Rest the dead is an upgrade to the numb the dead spell. This is a calm spell which works
            against undead beings.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            This can be used in dungeons such as Sebilis(undead side), City of Mist or Karnor's Castle
            to isolate single undead mobs out of groups without having to resort to a feign
            death.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin<br>
              </b><br>
              Force<br>
              <br>
              Force is an upgrade to the Stun-&gt;Holy Might line of spells. It
              will stun your opponent which can temporarily halt attacks or
              fleeing mobs and interupt spellcasting. It also does up to 90
              points of direct damage.<br>
              <br>
              Frenzied Strength<br>
              <br>
              Frenzied strength is an upgrade to the reckless strength line of
              spells. This spell will temporarily add 40 points of strength.
              Over time the strength increase will gradually decrease until it
              actually goes negative before returning to normal.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
              Extinguish Fatigue<br>
              <br>
              This spell will restore your targets stamina. It can come in handy
              for dual wielders during long battles. Most rangers will never use
              this spell however except for underwater excursions.<br>
              <br>
              Firestrike<br>
              <br>
              Firestrike is a fire based direct damage spell. It does up to 302
              points of direct damage to your target for only 155 mana.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 53<br>
            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            Whirlwind<br>
            <br>
            At level 53 a monk will gain the discipline of whirlwind. This discipline will cause every
            attack against you to be riposted for 9 seconds. This wil allow you to do a bit of extra
            damage in combat. The problem is that the short duration ensures that it will not do that
            much extra damage.<br>
            <br>
            It is seldom used however because of the 60 minute reuse delay.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Warrior</strong><br>
            <br>
            Charge<br>
            <br>
            The charge discipline will cause all attacks to land for 14 seconds. This does not affect
            the damage output of these attacks but it does mean that you will land much more often
            than normal.<br>
            <br>
            The base reuse time is 30 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue</strong><br>
            <br>
            Level 53 grants rogues their first discipline of counterattack. This discipline will allow
            you to riposte all attacks against you for nine seconds. This can be very useful in a
            pinch. <br>
            <br>
            The downside to this discipline is a 60 minute base reuse delay. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight<br>
            </strong><br>
            Boil Blood<br>
            <br>
            This is an upgrade to the heat blood spell. It will not stack with heat blood but it will
            stack with the darkness and heart flutter lines.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Boil blood will do over 500 points of damage over a very long duration.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin<br>
              </b><br>
              Armor of Faith<br>
              <br>
              Armor of faith is an upgrade to the armor-&gt;guard line of
              spells. It adds approximately 25 points of armor class to the
              targetted player.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
              Storm Strength<br>
              <br>
              This is the last in the line of ranger strength buffing spells. It
              increases your targets strength by 35 points. Because strength
              adds to a players ATK rating this will cause them to hit for a bit
              more damage during combat.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It is a very well liked buff.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 54<br>
            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            Voidance<br>
            <br>
            This spell will allow you to avoid attacks against you for 8 seconds. It only works versus
            melee attacks. A common usefor this discipline is to buy time if a feign death fails and
            death seems certain.<br>
            <br>
            You must pick and choose your useage of it very wisely however as it has a 60 minute reuse
            delay which will reduce by one minute per level to a minimum of 54 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Warrior<br>
            </strong><br>
            Mighty Strike<br>
            <br>
            Mighty strike causes all hits during a 10 second period to be critical or crippling
            blows(depending on your level of health). This can be a great damage disher. <br>
            <br>
            The downside is a 60 minute base reuse delay.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue<br>
            </strong><br>
            Deadeye<br>
            <br>
            During the 14 second duration of this discipline a rogue will land all attacks attempted.
            This is a great discipline if a fight is getting close and you need to dish some damage in
            a hurry. <br>
            <br>
            It has a 30 minute reuse delay.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight<br>
            </strong><br>
            Banshee Aura<br>
            <br>
            Banshee aura is a self only damage shield. For the duration of the spell(about 10 minutes)
            any being that hits you for melee damage will suffer 12 points of damage from the
            shield.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            12 points of damage may not soud like a lot when you are getting hit for 100 points from
            the mob but believe me it adds up. This is one of the most mana efficient ways of dishing
            damage that you have and the damage will add up on the mob quickly.<br>
            <br>
            Panic the Dead<br>
            <br>
            Panic the dead is an upgrade to the spook the dead spell. It is a very mana efficient fear
            spell with a very long duration.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Using this spell in conjunction with dooming darkness you will be able to solo extremely
            effectively in zones such as Burning Wood or Trakanon's Teeth if you stick to undead.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin<br>
              </b><br>
              Enstill<br>
              <br>
              Enstill is an upgrade to the root spell. It can hold your target
              place for a longer amount of time.<br>
              <br>
              Expel Undead<br>
              <br>
            Expel undead is the last in the line of paladin anti undead spells. This spell does up to 273
            points of direct damage to undead beings.&nbsp;<br>

              Drones of Doom<br>
              <br>
              Drones of doom is a damage over time(DOT) spell. It will do 34
              points of damage per tick for 10 ticks(1 minute) for a total of
              340 points of damage for only 141 mana.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It is an upgrade to the stinging swarm spell and will not stack
              with it. As a result it uses the conjuration spell skill which
              many rangers may not have kept up to par. So expect to fizzle
              quite a bit at first.<br>
              <br>
              Skin Like Diamond<br>
              <br>
              This is an upgrade to the skin like wood-&gt;rock line of spells.
              It adds approximately 15 points of armor class and 200 hit points
              to your selected target.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It will not stack with higher level versios of the&nbsp; cleric's
              courage or druid's skin like wood series.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 55<br>
            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            Monks gain no disciplines at level 55.<br>

            <br>
            Defensive<br>
            <br>
            This discipline is somewhat of an upgrade to the evasive discipline from levle 52. In
            essence it does the same thing(decrease damage taken while also decreasing offensive
            output) bit appears to be more effective. <br>
            <br>
            The base reuse is 15 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue<br>
            </strong><br>
            Nimble<br>
            <br>
            The nimble skill will allow you to dodge all melee attacks against you for 12 seconds.
            This is a great defensive skill and will allow you to tank high level mobs effectively for
            a short period of time.<br>
            <br>
            The reuse delay on this skill is 30 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight<br>
            </strong><br>
            Bobbing Corpse This is a slightly scaled down self only version of the necromancer's spell
            Dead Man Floating.&nbsp; It will cause the caster to levitate, water breath and also will
            add to his poison resistance.<br>
            <br>
            This spell is very useful for fighting mobs which might poison you such as Wyverns. It is
            also useful for taking shortcuts through zones(you can fly over an area quicker than you
            can run and you take no damage from falling). Lastly it makes it safer to explore a
            dungeon without worrying about falling into a pit trap.<br>
            <br>
            Expel Undead<br>
            <br>
            Expel undead is the last in your line of anti undead spells. This spell does up to 273
            points of direct damage to undead beings.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin<br>
              </b><br>
              Divine Aura<br>
              <br>
              Divine aura grants the paladin an 18 second period of
              invulnerability. During this time you can not be damaged by melee
              or magical attacks. You may also not attack or cast spells during
              this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              This can be an invaluable way of buying time for your party to get
              off that gate spell or to flee. It can also be used to fetch a
              large number of mobs which might normally kill you until an
              enchanter can mesmerize them.<br>
              <br>
              This spell has a long recast delay so you should only use it for
              emergency or sticky situations.<br>
              <br>
              Divine Favor<br>
              <br>
              This spell will grant a player a harmshield similar to the
              shadowknight or mage types shieldskin line. This will grant them
              protection against approximately 150 points of melee damage. The
              difference is that this spell can be cast on others similar to the
              enchanters rune line of spells.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger</b><br>
            <br>
              Chloroplast<br>
              <br>
              Chloroplast will cause your target to regenerate at 10 hit points
              per tick faster than normal speed for 15 minutes of time. This
              spell is very useful for saving your priests mana because they
              will not have to worry about healing party members during
              downtime.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It is also useful to cast on your fetcher. This way while they are
              searching for mobs they will be healing. This saves them the
              trouble of having to wait to be healed before fetching in many
              cases.<br>
              <br>
              Jolt<br>
              <br>
              When succesful this spell will lower a monsters aggression towards
              the ranger. It works by placing you lower on to a mobs aggro list
              similar to the rogue evade skill.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You can use this spell as an anti-taunt if you are getting beat up
              on a bit too much(rather than the parties primary tanks) and
              draining all of your cleric's mana.<br>
