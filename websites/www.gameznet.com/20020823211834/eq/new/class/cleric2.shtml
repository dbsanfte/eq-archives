      a) Melee effectively during your career<br>
      b) Solo<br>
      or&nbsp;<br>
      c) Nuke within a group !&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      No kidding - you will NOT be doing this in a group and soloing as a cleric
      is PAINFUL except against undead and even that usually doesn't compare to
      grouping.. This guide hopes to explain why. Read on if you do want to make
      LOTS of friends, role-play and get to see all the hotspots in the game
      with many people making sure you see it safely... Hopefully balanced, this
      will both help you choose the class with a long term view and appreciate
      it more if you play another class.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><strong>Playing the Cleric Class</strong></font><br>
      <br>
      In short , the reality of playing a Cleric is that we spend almost all day
      sitting in front of our computers, looking at the lovely meditate button
      or nearest corridor after level 35 (hmm - Ed) this will consume , by level
      40+ 95% of your time. No joking.&nbsp; Clerics heal and buff others.
      Period. Harsh maybe , and believe me it does cause long bouts of &quot;why
      did I pay money for this ??&quot; sessions as we watch Monks get lavish
      praise for a perfect pull , fighters get praise for a 150 damage critical
      and wizards &quot;oooohs&quot; at the latest ice comet. The flip side of
      the coin is rather brighter however and to me more than makes up for this.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><strong>Heals</strong></font><br>
      <br>
      This is the reason why you clicked that button back at the creation of
      this current incarnation. With heals , we can extend the lives of those
      that protect us. By healing them , these other warriors reward us with
      lots and lots of experience. We are the masters of the heal bar none.
      Without&nbsp; our healing groups can take an area's mobs carefully ,
      slowly and with many worried glances. WITH<br>
      our healing , multiple pulls scare us marginally less , big monsters are
      faced with courage and and control is brought to the situation. Warriors
      feel secure and fight confidently until the awful cry of &quot;CLERIC OOM
      - BEWARE!&quot;.&nbsp; A short step away is the responsibility that can
      easily be ours - &quot;To run or not to run&quot;. When we start to get
      low on mana, it can more often than not be our responsibility to cast that
      last heal after shouting &quot;RUN&quot; or &quot;HAG TO ZONE&quot; ( used
      in Guk for a laugh!). Superior heal after 40 outweighs the other classes
      significantly. The joys of Complete heals with a warrior friend after 40
      is immense especially as you try to get more and more efficient by casting
      the spell later and later ( this will either make you famous or infamous
      VERY quickly ;) Heals make you friends as you are in a prime position to
      save the life of a PC nearby. Do this if you can as this is what we are
      clerics for ... We also have a chance to consider the tactical side of our
      fights when necessary while we sit down and wait for that mana to return.<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><strong>Buffs</strong></font><br>
      <br>
      Our AC and HP spells may not be as original sounding as that of shamans
      etc and to be honest shouldn't be seen that way. Buffs extend the time
      between heals as the warriors can take more damage and therefore dish more
      out. Regularly buff at LEAST the primary tank in your group and you will
      do much better. You can add 600+ HPs to a PC at the higher levels&nbsp; (a
      massive amount and at least 5 hits from some of the mobs you take at this
      level !!!). Buffs also makes you friends. Cast it on a newbie as you pass
      and you will make friends in the world.&nbsp; The AC does make a big
      difference to the survivability of the tanks , so use everything you have
      on them. As for symbols , if your rich - use em. If your not - don't but
      get some cash soon. I have close friends who know to get the jaspers
      themselves for the spell , meaning that we are both happy&nbsp; ;) the
      perfect answer..<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><strong>Soloing</strong></font><br>
      <br>
      This is not our forte. We are down longer and have less chance of killing
      things before running out of mana. OK , with our HPs we can take a few
      taps from the mob, but to be honest you would have to be very lucky to
      kill something after running OOM.&nbsp; The exception to this ( soloing
      that is)&nbsp; is undead. Killing these can be effective but to be honest
      I think we're better off getting company and using our classes strengths
      to combine with others to speed our way through the levels. Duetting on
      the other hand with a warrior is totally different. Find a place where you
      can pull one or two at a time without interruption, and you have the
      perfect combo for power leveling. With a warrior you can heal buff and
      assist him while he absorbs all that damage to the maximum benefit to both
      , just don't get involved in more than you can chew off , and root it when
      it runs ;)<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><strong>Raise the dead AKA Anon time</strong></font><br>
      <br>
      We are abused more than any other class. Big words , but you expect to pay
      up to 2 PP and more for a SOW , 10PP or more for a teleport&nbsp; - can
      anyone tell me why people expect to be able to ask for an exp
      resurrection, get it and say &quot;thx&quot; and walk away!! This recovers
      at least a few hours(days at 49)&nbsp; gametime and also gets warriors
      back to the scene fast but is EXPECTED of a cleric. Don't get me wrong (
      I.E. rant time) I will help a mate any time any place anywhere - my group
      - those fighting the same mob as my group included,&nbsp; which is WHY I
      played a cleric , but now I stay anon so that only those that know me
      would ask me , therefore reducing the time I spend sitting reading a book
      while staring at the screen every now and then ( with the sound up just in
      case) waiting for that 500 mana to return. I pay by the minute and want to
      get something for my time online, even if it is only a promise of help in
      the future.... 300 sterling per Qtr is a good reason for saying
      &quot;No&quot; to all the requests when trying to get a group in a zone...<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><strong>Recommendations</strong></font><br>
      <br>
      Find a partner: Assisting others is how we earn our bread and butter. Buff
      heal another and he will get you the wins you crave in this type of MUD.<br>
      <br>
      Find a group: For the same reason as above, just with more bad guys at
      once ;)<br>
      <br>
      Find a lot of bad guys! Because the bad guys want to give you all their
      loot -<br>
      otherwise why would they keep coming back ;) Just remember to stand BEHIND
      the warrior!<br>
      <br>
      Do NOT get the Cleric armor: Because it sucks ( sorry Verant).
      Bloodstained, Enameled , mithril and gator stuff is far better at getting
      you to that peak - 200 Wisdom ( ALL THAT MATTERS when you are a cleric ;)<br>
      <br>
      Get used to sitting down...<br>
      <br>
      <font color="#ffffff"><strong>Conclusions and insights</strong></font><br>
      <br>
      We have the honor of being at the same time one of the most important
      member of any group and also the most overlooked/taken for granted.&nbsp;
      Any&nbsp; group focused on minimum downtime and maximum bang per HP will
      want a cleric there so the fighters can fight , the nukers can nuke and so
      on.&nbsp; Sitting down constantly is the order of business for us clerics
      to make the best use of our mana and fight on that little bit longer. We
      enhance the group, allowing a much greater range of opponents to be
      tackled. This is what it means to be a cleric , so if this appeals , then
      you are on the road to a very rewarding time!</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
