            <td>It has been over a year since I wrote my original shadowknight class guide and in that
            time much has changed. This evening I found myself in an odd position. My brain was still
            fried from this weekend's festivities and I could not find anything to occupy my mind
            while sitting on this laptop. As a result a new shadowknight class guide has been born. I
            hope that you enjoy it.<br>
            <br>
            This guide does not follow the normal class guide structure found elsewhere on the site. I
            had much to say and it simply would not fit inside of the older style. This guide is a
            result of more than twenty months of play primarily as a shadowknight. Some of the
            opinions expressed in this article are based on my personal opinions and may not
            neccessarily be the standard practice of other shadowknights. I have attempted to make my
            best effort to display as many situations as possible. <br>
            <br>
            Because of the extremely large size of this document it has been split into four seperate
            parts. The first part covers shadowknight basics. The second, third and fourth cover
            levels 1-25, 26-50 and 51-60 respectively. If you know where you are
              going then you can quickly skip to one of the other sections by
              clicking one of the links below.

              <p><strong>Why A Shadowknight?<br>
            </strong><br>
            In the 19 months of <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/index.shtml">EQ'Lizer</a>'s
            existance one of the most common questions I have been asked is, &quot;Why should I play a
            shadowknight?&quot; Class selection is definately a matter of personal preference. Many
            players enjoy playing a necromancer because of the versatility of the class and the
            ability to solo effectively when play time is limited. I myself can understand this
            argument but never have been able to play a necromancer past level 12 because they do not
            fit my personal style of play. So i'm not going to tell anyone that one class is better
            than another. Each class has their own pros and cons and in my opinion the classes of
            Everquest are more or less well balanced. <br>
            <br>
            I will instead give a list of the reasons that I have chosen the shadowknight as my class
            of perference. <br>
            <br>
            The first thing that I want to cover is the caster vs. melee issue. I have always been a
            player who likes to be involved in the action. I like to be involved in the fight from
            start to finish which is the primary reason that I moved from a caster(cleric through most
            of the beta) to a melee type. Before my cleric I had spent a decent amount of time as a
            dwarf warrior but in the longrun the lack of options is what made me move to a caster. By
            the final two months of the beta test I was certain that a hybrid would be the best choice
            for me.<br>
            <br>
            Ranger and paladins are also very good class choices in my opinion. I have spent a decent
            amount of time playing both of those hybrids as well. The shadowknight remains my favorite
            class for a variety of reasons which I will attempt to explain below. <br>
            <br>
            In my opinion the single largest strength of the shadowknight class is it's versatility.
            Shadowknights are the only hybrid which can cast both invisibility versus both the living
            and the dead. Lifetaps have proven to be an excellent addition to the class for reducing
            downtime and for healing yourself in an emergency situation. Shadowknights are the best
            soloing hybrids. Your dot's help you to dish out a sizeable amount of damage in a lengthy
            fight and only warriors make better tanks. Feign death serves not only to keep you alive
            but also makes shadowknights excellent pullers for groups without an enchanter or monk.<br>
            <br>
            I have heard many players complain about the shadowknight class. It remains one of the
            most underused classes in the game. Much of this can be attributed to players not playing
            to the classes strengths or using improper playing techniques. Some other areas are
            legitimate gripes. When all is said and done however I feel that shadowknights are in the
            longrun one of the most powerful classes in the game. Do not expect to feel this power
            early on however. Shadowknights struggle through the early levels and do not feel their
            true power until much later in the game. If you have the persistance to play it through
            however you will be rewarded in the longrun.<br>
            <br>
            In just a few paragraphs I am going to&nbsp; attempt to walk you through playing a
            shadowknight from beginning to end. Before I can get to that however I need to clear up
            the basics of the class including racial benefits, starting stats and basic skills.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Which race to choose?<br>
            </strong><br>
            When choosing a race for your shadowknight there are two common schools of thought. The
            first is to choose a small race shadowknight(dark elf, erudite, iksar or human) because of
            the smaller experience penalty and the generally higher mana pool due to increased
            intelligence. The second is to choose a large race(troll or ogre) for their excellent
            melee stats. I personally subscribe to the second school of thought but I will try to show
            the strengths of both choices.<br>
            <br>
            There are three steps of small race shadowknights. Erudites have very poor melee skills
            countered by the highest level of intelligence. Dark elves feature probably the best mix
            with slightly below average melee skills countered with very high intelligence. Iksars
            have middle of the line stats but have the advantage of regeneration. Humans are middle
            ground with no attribute being above or below average.<br>
            <br>
            There are some who will tell you that intelligence is not important to a shadowknight. The
            reasoning behind this is that a shadowknight's do not generally expend a large amount of
            mana in a battle. In a typical dungeon battle you will most often cast your debuffs or
            dot's. Since our primary damaging spells are dot's we only need to cast each spell once
            per battle. Thus even if we stack all of our dot's and debuffs we will generally only use
            about 2 bars of mana(or less) per battle even as a large race.<br>
            <br>
            While the above paragraph is completely true it does not tell the whole story. Mana
            becomes more and more important at higher levels because more mana equals more lifetaps.
            It is not uncommon for life leech to take a full two bars of a low intelligence large
            races shadowknights mana when they first attain the spell. In a single battle this still
            will leave you mana to spare. However a well tuned group will be pulling more or less
            nonstop and every bit of mana counts. More importantly you will often find yourself being
            the primary puller in a group. This will not leave you time to meditate and you will enjoy
            the extra mana.<br>
            <br>
            Mana also makes a huge differnce when reverse kiting. This is a popular method of soloing
            employed by many shadowknights and necromancers. Because you are keeping your opponent
            feared throughout most of the battle you will not be taking many hits. More mana allows
            you to fear kite longer which allows you to take on tougher mobs. This allows small race
            shadowknights to hypothetically be much more efficient soloers in outdoor zones than large
            race ones. <br>
            <br>
            With the exception of iksar shadowknights small race SK's also face fewer faction problems
            than their larger counterparts. This allows them to complete a larger number of quests and
            to travel to a greater variety of locations without worrying about being killed on sight.<br>
            <br>
            That having been said I still prefer large race shadowknights for their melee abilities.
            There are two types of large races shadowknights: trolls and ogres. One could argue for
            hours about which of these two makes the better SK. If popularity is the decider then
            troll's are clearly the winner here. There is an old saying however that if a million
            people believe a dumb thing that it is still a dumb thing. I wholeheartedly agree with
            this. <br>
            <br>
            In my opinion the choice of large race shadowknight depends on your personal playing
            style. <br>
            <br>
            Trolls make better soloers because of their natural regeneration. Regeneration can cut
            downtime in half when soloing. Trolls suffer from a critical weakness to fire starting
            with only 5 fire resistance. One thing that should be noted is that troll shadowknights
            have by far the highest experience penalty of any class/race combination in the game. It
            should be noted that your party members pay this penalty for you when in a group which all
            but eliminates the problem so long as you aren't soloing.<br>
            <br>
            In my opinion ogres are the better choice in a group however. They have naturally higher
            strength, stamina and intelligence which are perfect for a shadowknight. In the longrun I
            think that choosing between a troll and an ogre should depend on whether you plan on
            grouping almost exclusively or soloing a decent amount of time.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Large race shadowknights have the advantage of using the slam skill. This allows you to
            bash without using a shield. As a result when using a two handed weapon(which you likely
            will for much of your career) you will have the advantage of a secondary attack where
            small race shadowknights will not. Slam is also great for interupting casters.<br>
            <br>
            Now that I have given a brief description i'll give a few of my personal thoughts on the
            matter. I personally play a troll shadowknight. I do subscribe to the thought that
            shadowknights generally do not need the mana pool of a dark elf or erudite if it means
            trading melee effectiveness. I feel that we are 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necromancer rather
            than 50/50. I know all of the benefits of high intelligence and boost my intelligence
            every chance that I get. I however feel our ability to tank and dish damage via melee is
            more important.<br>
            <br>
            I also enjoy troll shadowknights for their regeneration. While I feel that players should
            group as often as possible(for both fun and efficiency) I also am a player who suffers
            from time constraints. There are often times when I only have one or two hours to play.
            Under these time constraints it is sometimes hard to find a group without travelling for
            the majority of my playtime. The ability to solo without a large amount of downtime comes
            in extremely handy in these situations.<br>
            <br>
            If you choose to go the subscribe to the mana school of thought I would recommend playing
            a dark elf. Iksars can not wear platemail which in my opinion is a serious drawback for a
            shadowknight. Dark elves have a high mana pool with less melee penalties than erudites
            pay. They also feature a very SK friendly home and ultravision which both will come in
            handy.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Beginning Stats</strong><br>
            <br>
            There are many useful ways to allocate your starting stats. For each race it is a bit
            different so I am not going to attempt to explain a base way of doing things. I will
            however cover the benefits of each stat really quickly here.<br>
            <br>
            Strength is right up there with intelligence as the two most useful shadowknight
            abilities. Strength equals ATK which equals more damage in combat. Strength only affects
            your maximum damage not your median damage. Some will complain that strength does not
            increase your maximum damage by enough to make a difference. While this is a valid
            argument it is still the second most useful skill of a shadowknight.<br>
            <br>
            Agility is an important skill because it increases your armor class. The most important
            thing to remember is to start your agility at 75 as a minimum. With an agility below 75
            you will suffer a bad armor class penalty. Increasing your agility above 75 is not an
            imporant issue to me. Agility and dexterity are the easiest skills to raise by way of
            equipment. There are many items which give signifigant raises in your agility and
            dexterity. <br>
            <br>
            One thing that should be noted here is the two types of armor class rating in Everquest.
            These both calculate into your AC rating but many players do not undersand the way that it
            works in Everquest. <br>
            <br>
            There are basically two types of AC increases. The first is agility and defense based AC
            and the second is armor based AC(I am unsure which of these that&nbsp; buffs fall under).
            Agility only affects how often that you get hit. Armor class only affects the amount of
            damage that is absorbed on a successful hit. Thus two characters with identical armor
            classes can be affected differently. Monks for example have a naturally high AC bonus.
            When comparing a monk and a shadowknights AC a monk will usually be much higher. Monks AC
            allows them to be hit less often. When they are hit though their armor will absorb less
            damage.<br>
            <br>
            This is why a twinked character gets hit as often as an untwinked one but often only takes
            one damage per attack.<br>
            <br>
            Dexterity affects how often your weapons will proc. This only enters play on weapons which
            have an effect. Many players would rate dexterity up there(or above) strenght in
            importance. I however do not feel it is as important for a shadowknight for various
            reasons. <br>
            <br>
            First it is easy to increase via items. Strenght is not. <br>
            <br>
            Second many of the best shadowknight weapons either do have a proc or feature a proc which
            does not stack well with itself. For example the dark reavers steal strength only needs to
            go off one time for its five or so minute duration to be effective. Any more than this is
            a waste. The proc on Soulbinder for example is a DOT lifetap. Thus if it procs twice in a
            short span of time it limits it's own damage potential. <br>
            <br>
            Intelligence is probably the most important stat to increase at startup unless you have
            deficeincies in other stats. Intelligence equals mana. While you may not care about it
            much early on it will make a difference later in your shadowknights life. While 10
            strength might equal 10 ATK at level 60 10 intelligence could mean a signifigant amount of
            mana. That mana could be used for a lifetap for example to do more damage(and also heal
            you) than the same amount of strength. Intelligence is also harder to increase without
            trading armor class. There are many strenght items which feature high armor class. There
            are far fewer items which increase intelligence. When it comes down to armor class or
            stats I would choose armor class in most cases unless they give a good amount of
            intelligence or mana.<br>
            <br>
            Wisdom or Charisma are more or less throw in stats for a shadowknight. I wouldn't ever
            spend any points inreasing either of these.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight Basics<br>
            </strong><br>
            In the next section we will cover skills and tactics on a level by level basis. Before we
            get to this we need to cover the basic starting abilities of a shadowknight. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Harm Touch</strong><br>
            <br>
            One of the defining skills of a shadowknight is the ability to harm touch. Harm touch
            allows you to do direct damage to your opponent once per game day. Once used it will
            recycle in exactly one day of game time(not actual playtime). It is important to note that
            harm touch can be resisted or partially resisted but that it is resisted less than a
            normal spell. The damage formula is (10*level)+1 from level 1-40. From level 41-60 it
            becomes (20*(level-40))+401. <br>
            <br>
            Examples:<br>
            <br>
            A level 1 shadowknight will harm touch for 11 damage maximum.<br>
            A level 23 shadowknight will harm touch for 231 damage maximum.<br>
            A level 60 shadowknght will harm touch for 801 damage maximum. <br>
            <br>
            Harm touch has often been the cause of many shadowknight complaints. The common argument
            is that lay hands &gt; harm touch. I personally agree with this assessement but I also
            feel that we should be accepting harm touch for what it is rather than comparing it to our
            goodie goodie counterparts. <br>
            <br>
            At early levels harm touch is an excellent source of damage. At those levels it can often
            cut a monsters hit points in half. At these levels I recommend saving your harm touch as
            long as possible and only using it if absoleutely neccesary. There are many times during a
            fight when you think that you will lose. However by saving it until the end you will find
            that you often are able to pull away from these without wasting it. The pitfall to this
            tactic is that it can be resisted or partially resisted which may result in death. <br>
            <br>
            As you begin to gain in levels you will find that your ace in the hole is becoming less
            and less effective as a damage disher. It is still a good source of damage however.At
            later levels I usually attempt to save my harm touch for one of three situations.<br>
            <br>
            When solo I use it about midway through a battle if I think it is going to go bad. On
            monsters which run this might push them into running early which can save your life.
            Either way it allows you to get a good idea of whether or not you are going to win or lose
            before you reach the point of no return(when your run speed is too slow to escape) and
            then make the proper choice.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            In groups I usually save my harm touch for a dangerous situation. Harm touch is an
            excellent taunt. When a monster locks on a caster and they are going down fast this may be
            the only way to rescue them until the healer can pump them with enough hit points. <br>
            <br>
            Harm touch can also be used as an emergency way to stop a monster. There are times when a
            monster breaks snare, or darkness or whatever method of slowing them down that your party
            is employing inside of a dungeon. Sometimes this leads to hairy situations where the mob
            will move into the aggro range of other monsters. Harm touch can be used in these
            situations as an emergency kill. They are usually low enough in health by this point that
            it will kil them or slow them to a near stop. This has saved my life more than once.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Bind Wound</strong><br>
            <br>
            Bind wound is a popular method of reducing downtime. It allows you to heal yourself to
            reduce downtime. It requires a bandage which limits it's usefuleness at early levels for
            an untwinked character. Magicians can summon bandages however which can save on bandage
            costs. <br>
            <br>
            At later levels bind wound is an invaluable skill for reducing downtime, especially for
            shadowknights without regeneration. It heals (bind wound skill/4) per bandage rounded
            down. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Taunt</strong><br>
            <br>
            The taunt skill can be used to attempt to draw monsters off of other players. This skill
            is often used to draw monsters off casters or injured tanks in your party. It will not go
            up on it's own unless you train one point into it.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Slam</strong><br>
            <br>
            The slam skill is a special variant of the bash skill which you obtain at level 6. It is
            only available to large races shadowknights. It is a secondary attack which can be used in
            addition to your weapon skills. Until you obtain(and train in) the bash skill it will only
            do one damage per attack but does have a chance of stunning your opponent. After you train
            in the bash skill slam will do the same damage as a bash but it does not require a shield.
            <br>
            <br>
            The slam skill is linked to the shoulder slot. This means that if a monster requires magic
            weapons to be hit then you will need magical shoulderpads to be able to slam them.</p>
