          <tr>
            <td><p align="left">This guide was submitted by: Roon Dragonclaw</p>
            <p align="left">A monk you want to be, grasshopper? Life is hard and the Way of the Monk
            more so. In all of Norrath, it is you who is the humblest of creatures, forever ignored by
            gods, and perhaps the weakest of all classes, when all is said and done as a player. <br>
            <br>
            Monks receive 20 points to distribute during character creation. It is advisable that you
            spend all your points on agility, save 5, taking it up to 100, or past that mark, if so
            inclined. Monks with greater than 100 base agility receive an AC bonus as their defense
            skill increases, greater than that possible without under 100 base agility, at any rate.
            This is useful, as at level 50, it will be rare to find a warrior within 50 AC points of
            you.<br>
            <br>
            You may only be a human, though there are rumors of an Iksar monk guild. The two cities
            you may start in are Qeynos and Freeport. The Freeport Monk Guild is by the Theatre of the
            Tranquil, and you can train and quest for various magical sashes there, yellow through
            black. The Qeynos Monk guild likewise allows you to train, and quest for headbands, again
            yellow through black. The headbands and sashes are not much .. in fact it is possible to
            attain items that are much superior for much less effort .. but I still wear a sash, as a
            symbol of achievement.<br>
            <br>
            The gods have not have completely forgetten us though. By the grace of Quellious, we are
            granted dual wield at level 1, and that miraculous ability, mend, which at high levels
            almost guarantees you a fourth of your health,&nbsp; and cycles every 6 minutes in real
            time. Monks like other melee classes also receive bind wound at level 1. As with all
            skills, they only prove really handy when one has mastered them, by level 19 or so. A
            level 19 monk who has mastered bind wound and mend can move from near death to four fifths
            of health in 5 minutes. Mend is still useful at lower levels but there is a possibility of
            it failing, or worse, hurting you at lower levels. To avoid this possibility, I would
            simply mend at 3 bubbles of health. That would leave me some hps to run, if in the worst
            case, it hurt me instead of helping. A monk also receives dodge, a useful skill to have,
            as it allows you avoid blows on occasion. <br>
            <br>
            The choice of the Deity one chooses is of little importance, one may choose Quellious, or
            be Agnostic. Unlike in the case of say Dark Elf Necromancers being either Agnostic or
            choosing Innoruuk, this is of little import. The first few levels as always are spent
            gathering exp near the city gates, within earshot of the guards.<br>
            <br>
            Freeport is perhaps the better of the two cities for monks, early on. To the east and
            south of Freeport is the Desert of Ro. North Ro offers some truly wondrous creatures for
            the monk to batter. There are armadillos and coyotes which drop absolutely nothing, of
            which the armadillo offers better exp. There are also spiderlings and fire beetles, which
            drop silk and fire beetle eyes, which will help your nightvision. These two must be
            tackled when at least level 3, be wary, for they will train on you easily. However, the
            guards are near in this zone. This is perhaps the easiest way to get from 3 to 5. <br>
            <br>
            At 5, you get one of the monks special moves, the round kick. This nifty looking move
            allows you to hit a creature for as much as 10-12 hps by level 10, at which point you
            receive the tiger claw attack. This superior attack allows you to strike a creature for as
            much damage as a round kick, perhaps more, but in substantially less time. Earlier, at
            level 8, we receive sneak, a not very useful skill which when used is easily picked up by
            creatures and caps at 113 skill.<br>
            <br>
            Level 10 is easily acquired by attacking creatures in the low level zones of, for example,
            North Ro, ButcherBlock, Misty Thickets etc. At level 10 the world opens up somewhat and
            one can begin tackling harder creatures and humanoids and even the lower level dungeons
            such as Befallen. Befallen is critical to monks questing for the sash and headband quests,
            as important items are found there. Before even thinking of going into a dungeon, make
            sure you acquire a greater lightstone, since humans have limited night vision. These are
            rare drops from willow-o-wisps and improve nightvision immensely.<br>
            <br>
            Level 12, comes around and the budding monk receives block, a more useful skill than
            dodge, as it comes into effect more often. At level 15, we receive the important Double
            Attack skill, which as the name suggests, gives you a&nbsp; chance of attacking a creature
            twice in one round, in addition to Dual Wield, which gives you four possible strikes.<br>
            <br>
            Truly, the most important skill for a monk is feign death, at level 17. This most
            important of skills for a monk allows a monk to fetch one creature at a time for his
            group, to escape near certain death at a time when a warrior will be praying to the
            Warlord for an unlikely miracle. It is best affected by the monk stopping his attacks and
            turning away or backing away as though to flee, then feigning. This may spare the monk
            death, or may allow him or her to fetch a single creature as groups of creatures will turn
            back one by one, allowing the monk to strike the last one as it returns to its location.
            The gods have however deemed that this skill be more effective for creatures under level
            35, and less so after that. A successful feign against a creature under level 35 results
            in the creature losing all memory of you. After 35, it is possible that the creature may
            'remember' you and return. This may result in the creation of unfortunate trains, and one
            must be careful in this. F!<br>
            eign pulling after level 35(and with creatures higher than level 35) is most effective if
            indeed your group or groups can fight all the creatures, albeit with some what of a
            seperation.<br>
            <br>
            By level 17 you will notice the lack of specialized gear for monks, though there is cured
            silk armor, made by master tailors and has the same AC as mesh(an armor type obtained from
            upper Guk) for less weight. This is a source of envy for low-mid level monks who watch
            warriors prance around with Mithril 2 handers and Executioner axes while garbed in full
            crafted armor and sporting an Enamelled Mithril Breastplate. Given the fact that monks
            number a smaller percentage of players than any class save rogues, enchanter and perhaps
            bards, Verant has understandably accorded us low priority and there are an incredibly
            limited number of monk specific equipment pieces in the game. Even rogues, another
            uncommon class, receive ravenscale armor, an excellent armor type for this much ignored
            class. Even the items that a monk may use, are heavily camped since all the other classes
            that need them want them as well .. and the monk is often left empty-handed as a result.<br>
            <br>
            However, budding monk, never fear! Even though a Barbarian or an Ogre warrior at your
            level in the late teens and all the way to level 40 may have have 100 more Attack and AC
            than you .. we closely match them beyond 40, since our Dual Wield and Strike are capped at
            255. <br>
            <br>
            At level 20 we receive the nifty eagle strike move which does twice the damage of tiger
            claw, and at 25 we receive the efficient dragon claw, which by level 30 does more than 35
            hps damage a strike. At level 27 we are able to disarm opponents, a very very handy skill
            in pvp, as surely an ogre warriors puffy fists hurt a lot less than that Executioners Axe.
            The second to last of the special skills we receive is the awesome Flying Kick! This skill
            when mastered and raised to 165 skill by level 33 will do upto 75 hps of damage and is a
            formidable addition to your arsenal. It recharges at a slow two and a half rounds, but it
            is very useful still.At level 50 it is not unusual to see a monk kick for 115 hit points
            .. <br>
            <br>
            (I have not included instill doubt, a fairly useless skill which makes creatures run away,
            it seems to work only on low greens even at high levels)<br>
            <br>
            At level 35 monks receive their last important skill, Riposte, this can be handy in a
            fight as this does an attackers damage, TO the attacker .. When it works, its a charm.<br>
            <br>
            By now, the mid level monk should have acquired the best jewelry and equipment that money
            can buy and should strive to bring both his Agility and Dexterity to at least 130, and his
            Strength to 120. Strength and skill in hand to hand determine whether you hit a creature,
            while Dexterity allows you a greater chance of hitting close to your theoretical maximum.
            A note here: Agility and how much a monk is carrying directly effect how often a monk will
            dodge, block and riposte, and simply cause the creature to miss. Attempt to carry less
            than 15 pounds of equipment and baggage at all times, carrying more will cause you to lose
            AC, and will cause the above mentioned skills to work less often. Though Agility is a very
            useful attribute, the law of diminishing returns applies and it not possible to 'min-max'
            agility and the other attributes beyond a certain point. All high level monks will
            invariably have well rounded stats in these three major attribute classes, AGI, DEX and
            STR.<br>
            <br>
            By level 40 and higher, one may begin to venture deep into the dungeons and in the
            outdoors it will be the rare Griffin or Hill Giant that will dare to cross your path. Your
            Dual Wield will be inching up to 230 and your Dual Strike will have hit 200. In this
            respect alone you are as powerful as a level 50 warrior.<br>
            <br>
            By level 46 one may walk the planes with the gods. Their wrath is terrible however and one
            may die often in their realms. The rewards for daring their wrath are immense, however.
            The Plane of Fear, the realm of Cazic Thule the feared Faceless One, is home to a powerful
            species of Gorilla, the Shiverback. These beings carry the most sought out after monk
            armor, having moderate AC, and excellent resistance bonuses and amazing additional
            attribute points. One may require two full groups of high level characters to acquire this
            wonderful armor however, and as always, it is the monk who must fetch them ..<br>
            <br>
            On Norrath, there are beings of almost god-like power, the Dragons, the creators of the
            Fire Giants and the brethren of Veeshan herself. These mighty beings possess incredible
            magiks and carry perhaps the most sought out after monk item.. The Cloak of flames. This
            is one of the best haste items in the game, and though as usual the monk must vie for it
            with other classes, it is a must have as it can reduce your attack delay from 36 to 27 or
            so ..<br>
            <br>
            The gods have deemed that we be unarmed warriors, for our forte is unarmed combat. We may
            use blunt weapons but they remain too heavy and are tailored to clerics. In any case we do
            not require weapons, we can train ourselves in unarmed combat to 255. We may also raise
            dual wield to 255. This, no other class may do. Warriors and other melee classes however
            make up for this with their superior weaponry and armor and hit points, and in the case of
            non-warrior melee types, with their spells.<br>
            <br>
            In a battle between a fully accouterred warrior wielding a Bloodmoon, and with high
            dexterity, and a fully accoutered monk, both with Plane and Dragon gear, the outcome is
            almost always in the warriors favor, if both are unbuffed prior to combat. Similarly, in
            combat with other melee classes the monk is almost always the loser. Any melee class with
            their 'dream' gear can vanquish a monk .. since we really dont have dream weapons, other
            than our fists .. However, having said that, monks are perhaps the most fun to play since
            one dies less, due to feign death, spends far less time camping that 'must have' item and
            can match the best warrior almost blow for blow, if not actually take that much damage,
            and all this without a weapon! We are very necessary for groups in the Planes or in Dragon
            raids and yet we earn little in the way of rewards.<br>
            <br>
            I fervently hope that Verant rewards monks, as the new race, and our new Brethren monks
            from the Iksar, grace the scene and more monk characters grace Norrath. Many have toiled
            through the levels for the most important of reasons, friendship, as we partnered our
            friends and comrades as they garned wonderful item after item, only to watch in vain as
            Verant ignored the monk. Still, to be a monk is to be unique on Norrath. No meleer can
            match the damage we do except with the best weapons available in Norrath, and that too
            through magical means. If wizards are the heavy artillery .. we are the Aden cannons :)<br>
            <br>
            And on that pithy note ..&nbsp; Go forth grasshopper! Norrath awaits!<br>
            <br>
            May you be One with the Tranquil!<br>
            <br>
