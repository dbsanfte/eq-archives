<center><b>A Final Farewell...</b></center>

<br><br>
I have quit Everquest.  I said it. I did it.  It is done.  It has been a long time coming and despite the bitterness that I have the memories are in general good ones.  However on the same note I will say that the game has gotten worse and worse since beta.  Maybe it was the shock of an amazing new game sitting beside UO and Meridian 59, or maybe the game was truly better with a tighter community.  I remember viewing GM's and Guides as friends, not opponents and trusting almost everyone I met.
<br><br>
	Things certainly have changed in Everquest.  Verant has shown again and again that despite their ramblings that Everquest was a labor of love and that the game was the most important thing to the designers, but the bottom line when push came to shove was making money.  And on that note many things that were promised never got done and many things that should have been done after the game was released were never done.  One great example of this is guildhalls.  Guilds were supposed to be a big part of Everquest; "The ultimate grouping game," where class interaction was a must and therefore guilds would be a natural and necessary element of the game.  Verant promised to give guilds the tools to be great:  Guildhalls that could possibly be custom designed in some cases, as well as guild crests and tunics to make the guild unique in the world.  However Verant, almost a year into release, backed out on this idea.  Apparently it would not be cost effective to create options for a minority of people.  Sure maybe only the uberguilds such as Fires of Heaven would have castles with Dragons guarding the entrance but god damnit it would be cool and would be one of those things that make people feel like they have accomplished something.  
<br><br>
	Perhaps the foremost reason that I have quit Everquest was because of the server that I played on, Rallos Zek.  "You knew what you were getting into"  they say.  Well quite frankly none of the RZ veterans that were there from the beginning knew what they were getting into.  Perhaps I was so naive to think that it would be a good roleplay server where PvP would be a Paladin vs Shadowknight thing; a place where High Elves and Dark Elves would war.  What nobody expected was the naked gank-fest that the server has become.  Pkers can make thousands of dollars selling stuff that they PK on EBAY so quite frankly why would they not do it?  Hell sometimes it makes me wonder why I don't do it.  I have 2 level 50 characters that could be great Pkers!  What happened no one could have predicted, however Verant could have done something about it.  Many people know about my campaign to get Rallos Zek changed to coin only.  Verant has never actually been "man enough" to confront my long letters and massive threads.  Instead they make posts on short, less intimidating threads contradicting themselves left right and center and trying to make excuses.  Why won't they change Rallos Zek to coin-only?  I honestly don't know.  It doesn't make any sense so I'm figuring that someone at Verant has an interest in the PK's continuing to gank people at portals and steal their stuff.  I won't get into the whole argument because quite frankly I don't care anymore.  My guild, Dragons of Destiny will be continued by my friends and I hope that the server is fixed soon so that they may enjoy their time on Everquest more than I could at the end.
<br><br>
	Well all of these things have been going on of a long time so the reason why I have suddenly decided to quit is not clear.  To be honest I have been thinking about it for a long time and as friends of mine will tell you there have been several times where I "quit" for a few months only to go back to the game.  However the wear of the Rallos Zek issue, and Verant's continual disrespect to the players made me snap.  I suppose it would be fair to say that Diablo II's release helped give me the final push away from Everquest, however it was but a catalyst to the reaction.  I would have quit anyway, just not so soon.
<br><br>
	This is the end for me.  I will still be at Gameznet and I'm sure that many of you will see me again here on EQ'Lizer either giving shameless plugs for another Gameznet site, or even helping the crew with some of the stuff when things get busy.  However for now I am in semi-retirement from EQ'Lizer.  I invite you all to check out the up-and coming Shadowbane (http://www.shadowbane.com/) and the site that Gameznet is creating and I am primarily working with, The Shadowbane Authority (http://www.gameznet.com/sb). 
<br><br>
	Goodbye, Good Luck, and Good Riddance.
