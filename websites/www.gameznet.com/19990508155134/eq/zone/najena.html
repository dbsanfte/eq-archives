<p>Najena is a very popular dungeon for characters level 15-30 that is located in the zone
of <a href="lavastorm.html">lavastorm</a>. To find Najena you can take a right upon
entering lavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the Najena ruins in the
distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a green fog throughout. <br>
<br>
The entrance area is not too easy you will find <a href="../beastiary/grskeleton.html">greater
skeletons</a> and ogre guards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find
<a href="../beastiary/element.html">elements</a> and <a href="../beastiary/tentterror.html">tentacle terrors</a>. The first few rooms are the ones
most often occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in the dungeon
however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in order.<br>
<br>
The first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the hallways. This
room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk right through. From this room you
will see two passages. The door to the left of here leads to some level 20ish <a href="../beastiary/skeleton.html">skeletons</a>. The passage downstairs leads to the meat
of this portion of the dungeon. <br>
<br>
You will find many necromancers and ogre's down in this area. However the prized opponents
in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the Ogre Officer. <br>
<br>
Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He is in a room with 2
necromancers. Bonecrusher is a <a href="../beastiary/frogghoul.html">froglock ghoul</a>
who is level 24. He is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This includes <a href="../equipment/fleshband.html">flesh rings</a> and <a href="../equipment/barbedwhip.html">barbed leather whips</a>. <br>
<br>
To the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will find the captains
room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly. He is guarded by several ogres
including an officer who is in the level 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to
Rathyl's room as well as the occasional <a href="../equipment/ogremaul.html">ogre maul</a>
or large <a href="../equipment/bronzeplate.html">bronze platemail</a> piece of armor.<br>
<br>
The keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to the real juicy
part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you continued straight when entering the
dungeon you would undoubtedly have noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the
entrance. Behind this sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC's in this zone: Rathyl,
Drelzna and Najena. <br>
<br>
These NPC's must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the other ones chamber
as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to party members). The Drelzna
and Najena keys are no rent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. None of these
NPC's spawn every time and there is an anti camp radius code implemented so that you
cannot simply camp by their lairs. This can be frustrating at first but with a little
practice you will be able to learn their patterns. <br>
<br>
I don't want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to chance(and it would
be hard to describe anyway) so i'm just going to roughly describe each NPC and an example
of what you might find on them. <br>
<br>
Rathyl is a necromancer who is guarded by several magicians. He is a deadly foe even after
death as his reincarnation will appear and have to be destroyed all over again! A typical
item you might find from Rathyl would be a <a href="../equipment/travbackpack.html">traveller's
backpack</a>.<br>
<br>
Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. Both the necromancers as well as Drelzna can charm.
This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps even tougher than Najena. One of
Drelzna's prized possessions is the <a href="../equipment/journeymanboots.html">journeyman
boots</a>.<br>
<br>
Najena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest of them all and
is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but this is only because of her
guards. One of Najena's prized possessions is the <a href="../equipment/flowblackrobes.html">flowing black robe</a>.<br>
