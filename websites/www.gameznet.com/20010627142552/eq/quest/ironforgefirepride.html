            This is an unsolved quest. You may discuss this quest in <a href="http://216.167.52.16/ubb/Forum111/HTML/000018.html">this</a> ongoing thread or on
            our <a href="http://216.167.52.16/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Quests&amp;number=111&amp;DaysPrune=60&amp;SUBMIT=Go">Quest
            Forum</a>.<br>
            <br>
            Here's the skinny:<br>
            <br>
            The Ironforges and Fireprides of Qeynos don't seem to like one another very much. They are
            competing as the forges in town and it appears that the competition is getting out of
            control. No biggie we all have our enemies. This one is interesting however because of
            several issues. <p>Here's a few about the Ironforges. </p>
            <p>1) Brohan Ironforge was married before his current wife. The four ironforge children
            you see at their shop are his current wives. He also has another daughter(Tayla I believe
            is her name) who has dissapeared some time ago. <br>
            2) Tayla is a half elf. Her mother(Weleana) was an elf but appears to have been eaten by
            Mammoth(I say appears because I don't buy the story. Why would mammoth kill an elf?).<br>
            3) His current wife hates both Tayla and her mother and basically seems to have wanted
            them out of the way.<br>
            4) Tayla can be found at the Maiden's Fancy in Neriak. <br>
            5) Brohan alludes to the fact that he can create you a great weapon if you can return with
            proof of his daughter's existance.</p>
            <p>Now a bit of information about the Fireprides. </p>
            <p>1) Pappa Firepride is in cahoots with the bloodsabers(shadowknights). Doing quest for
            him gives faction with them.<br>
            2) I'm not sure if it's the daughter or wife(daughter most likely) who frequents the shop
            during the day. She has a crush on the ironforges son. He thinks she is &quot;homely&quot;
            however and doesn't go in to it much further. She appears at Fish's Ale every night where
            you can get her smashed and loosen some lips.<br>
            3) There is a firepride son that a lot of people don't know about. He is a guard on the
            ironforge side of Qeynos. I can't recall his name. If you hail him though he will say that
            he is a Firepride. <br>
            <br>
            Miscellaneous facts: </p>
            <p>1) When trumpy irontoe kicks the fishermans tacklebox in to the water you can dive in
            and get it for him. If you return it to him you get Hurrietas tunic. This used to be
            called Hurrietas bloodstained tunic. Hurrieta is the name of Tayla's step-mother/Brohan's
            current wife.<br>
            2) If you turn this tunic in to the Fireprides you gain faction with the bloodsabers. He
            also seems to give clues that he thinks you are the assassin that was hired(he knows about
            it happening) and sends you to give the tunic to someone else in the bloodsabers. </p>
            <p>Now for some not really confirmed but free thinking thoughts on this quest. </p>
            <p>I personally feel that the Tayla's mother was not killed by Mammoth. Instead I think
            that mother Ironforge wanted her out of the way and hired an assassin to do the dirty
            work. With the connection between firepride daughter loving ironforge son(who doesnt like
            her but may use her for his mother) he could have set things up(knowingly or unknowingly).
            Also Hurrieta could have used her crush to manipulate the daughter in to setting things up
            unknowingly. </p>
            <p>The fisherman pulls up sorts of things and probably pulled up the tunic where it was
            thrown to be disposed(possibly along with the body). The guard near the dock tells you
            that bodies have been washing up along the shore. </p>
            <p>The reason that Firepride thinks your the assassin is probably because somethign went
            wrong. Perhaps her mother lived but is in hiding. Why else wouldn't the bounty be
            collected? Not sure about that part. </p>
            <p>I think the firepride son is there to blow things wide open. He is a good guard and not
            a corrupt one. I think he is the one who you will eventually go to and he will have to
            make that right or wrong decision(his family or for good). </p>
            <p>It's an interesting quest. It may be broken. I hope not it has a great storyline.<br>
