I didn't make it very clear, sorry :) We are looking for screenshots of the item stats when you right click on them. Also, pictures of what they look like would be great :)<br><br>I have been informed that there is also another type of plate that I didn't mention - Full plate. Lastly, Ogres can also make the same stuff Dark elves can, but in large size for Ogres and Trolls ;)<br><br>Thats about it : ) Hope I'll see some of the stuff soon =)

Congratulations to Glubgawd the Champion, Ogre Warrior of Legacy of Steel on winning The Nameless Server's "Best of the Best" tournament.
