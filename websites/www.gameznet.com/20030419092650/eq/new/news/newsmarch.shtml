      the Pureblood quest to return Blood of Nadox for Shaman characters. In

      sounds back. <BR>- Winged Death now has its particle effects back. <BR>-

      <BR>- Iceflame of E`Ci now gives a message when it wears off. 
      <BR><BR><BR>** Items ** <BR><BR>- The Potion of Corpse Retrieval is now NO 
      DROP. <BR>- Added required level to many Legacy of Ykesha items. <BR>-

      Frogloks can no longer use Scaled Hierophant armor, Scaled Mystic armor

      are now stackable: Barbarian Template, Gnome Template, Troll Template and 
      Animal Template. <BR>- Rune Smudged Bone Spear now looks like a spear in 
      inventory rather than a rapier. <BR>- Totemic Gauntlets, Dull Metallic 
      Gloves and Black Wolf Leg Plates can no longer be worn around the neck. 
      <BR>- Added Shaman to all small patchwork and tattered pieces. <BR>-

      Water if the character has the Orb of the Triumvirate. But he will not 
      summon either if one of them is already around. <BR>- Corrected issues

      to allow you to toggle your target between your two last targets (unlike 
      Tab which toggles between your character and your last target). To set the 
      key that activates this feature, just open your options window and select 
      the Keyboard Tab. If you select all categories, the entry will be the last 
      one on the list, called Toggle last two targets. This was actually added 
      with our last patch. <BR><BR><BR>** NPCs ** <BR><BR>- Undead will begin to 
      spawn again at night in Kithicor. <BR>- Shin Master Grubbus in Gukta will 
      now be more selective about who he allows to do tasks for him, and he'll 
      be speaking directly to folks (using /tell). His chatty nature was raising 
      the volume in Gukta to levels that were considered unacceptable. He will 
      also be a bit clearer about what he wants. <BR>- Shar Vahl guards will now 
      defend their city against Loda Kai poachers. <BR>- A Grimy Owl Bear Cub in

      <BR>- Mangler will no longer spawn on top of a table. <BR>- Porra, one of 
      the Enchanter spell vendors in Felwithe, will no longer spawn inside of a 
      wall. This was hurting her business. <BR>- Hutyn L`Lozz will now appear in 
      his place of business and be less likely to leave to go sightseeing in 
      Neriak. <BR>- Cleet Miller Jr. will now emote "Grumbles and looks up at 
      you" instead of saying it. <BR>- The Goblins in Solusek's Eye are no 
      longer wearing cloth armor. <BR>- Junth McMannus will now be properly 
      affected by movement reducing spells. <BR>- You should only see one 
      Rodrick Tardock, his clones have been dealt with. <BR>- Duplicate Brenzl 
      McMannus's (McManni?) have also been removed. <BR>- Waltor Felligan of 
      Halas will now cast the spells he says he will cast. <BR>- Xlixinar Arcut 
      and Drixiv Arcut will now respond properly to their quest texts. <BR>- 
      Corrected some text errors for Jortreva and Grendish the Crusaders as well 
      as Sage Xelrin, Sulgar, Warlord Gligoth, Bryce McFadden, Serna Tasknon, 
      Welno Tanlonikan, Lorekeeper_Einar and Master of Elements. <BR>- These 
      NPCs will now be asking for the correct items for their quests: Gazoon 
      Noihzog, Liteema Agner and Bolli Hillfoot. <BR>- Kodiaks in the Rathe 
      Mountains should be friendlier to Druids and Rangers. <BR>- Undead 
      Frogloks and Skeletons in Sebilis no longer have an extreme dislike for 
      each other. <BR>- Groflah Steadirt's corpse will no longer disappear when 
      he is killed. However, he is also no longer a merchant. <BR>- Moved the 
      Planar Projection for Rallos Zek so it can't be interfered with by the 
      zone exit. <BR>- Corrected the spawn times for the Minotaur Hero. <BR>- 
      Half elven female bandits will now give experience, leave corpses and be 
      aided by other bandits. <BR>- A Coerced Iiksar will now be known as A 
      Coerced Iksar. <BR>- Merchant Nora in Felwithe will once again sell her 
      jewelry supplies. <BR>- Equestrielle the Corrupted will no longer be able 
      to sense and get angry with people all the way on the other side of the 
      zone. <BR>- Niola Impholder now teaches Brewing, Begging and Alcohol 
      Tolerance. <BR>- Jusean will now give the proper quest reward when given 
      the proper item(s). <BR>- Plaguebone Thieves no longer flee. 
      <BR><BR><BR>** Zones ** <BR><BR>- Fixed some broken doors in West Freeport 
      that were opening incorrectly. <BR>- Fixed a door that was opening into a 
      wall in Highkeep. <BR>- Fixed some doors in Kaesora that were opening the 
      wrong way. <BR>- Fixed a door that would not open in Solusek's Eye. <BR>- 
      Removed the ability for characters to consume more than one key given for 
      access to the lower parts of the Crypt of Decay. <BR>- Added new sounds to 
      Shadowhaven. <BR>- Removed safe spots in Katta, Solusek's Eye, High Keep, 
      Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns, Crystal Caverns, Siren's Grotto, Plane of 
      Valor, Plane of Torment and Plane of Water. <BR>- Fixed a pathing problem 
      in Gunthak that was causing Shaman pets (and perhaps others) to disappear. 
      <BR>- Entrance to Bertoxxulous's lair is now restricted to those that have 
      the proper flag. <BR>- The pylons on the end of the pier in Timorous deep 
      no longer rotate like doors when you left click them. <BR>- Placed rocks 
      over a spot in Western Wastes that characters could get stuck in. <BR>- 
      Updated some of the pathing in Torgiran Mines to reduce the chances that 
      NPCs will "poof" in that zone. <BR>- Removed a box out in the middle of 
      Skyfire that turned when clicked but had no real purpose. <BR>- Fixed a 
      place in Burning Woods and the Plane of Knowledge where NPCs would get 
      stuck while wandering around. <BR>- Also fixed a place in Erud's Crossing 
      where sharks were getting stuck. <BR>- The Veeshan's Peak zone in from 
      Skyfire can no longer be triggered from above. <BR>- Moved the Koada'Dal 
      Forge so that it does not extend into the hallway on the second floor of 
      the building. <BR>- The teleporter from the Great Divide to the Plane of

      should no longer be spawning right next to the Cabilis entrance in the 
      Swamp of No Hope. <BR>- Trying to enter the Qeynos sewers will no longer 
      take you to Ak'Anon. We hope the citizens of Ak'Anon can forgive the 
      mess... <BR>- Fixed a problem in the Warrens that was causing the Kobolds 
      to gather under the water near the river source. <BR><BR><BR>** 
      Miscellaneous ** <BR><BR>- Corrected a spelling error ("hass" instead of 
      "has") in the text given for adding the Ring of Marr to the keyring. 
      <BR><BR><BR>** Special Deals ** <BR><BR>Prices at the Station.com Store

      <BR><BR><BR>** Become a Guide! ** <BR><BR>Greetings citizens of Norrath, 
      <BR><BR>Hear Ye, Hear Ye, for we bring before you news of great 
      importance! <BR><BR>Have you ever scoured the lands in search of 
      adventure? Do you still yearn to discover new places and new people in the 
      Lands of Norrath? <BR><BR>If so, then we have for you perhaps the greatest 
      adventure the Lands of Norrath could ever offer. It is a mission of great 
      proportions, and the journey will be a challenge to even the bravest 
      adventurers in the realm. But hear me friends when I say that the rewards 
      are well worth the perils of the journey. <BR><BR>The path is that of the 
      volunteer EverQuest Guide Program. If you are strong of will, kind of 
      heart, have a positive attitude, and are at least eighteen years of age, 
      the volunteer EverQuest Guide Program may be for you. <BR><BR>The members 
      of the Guide Program provide front line customer support and service to 
      the players of EverQuest. The Program offers a unique opportunity for you 
      to become a part of the behind the scenes action, and to be a direct 
      contributor to the greatness of EverQuest. As a Guide you will interact as 
      a representative of both the Program, and of Sony Online Entertainment by 
      delivering critical help and assistance to the players on your assigned 
      server. Your role as a Guide will also provide you with the opportunity to 
      present a variety of creative dynamic content (Quests) and events. 
      <BR><BR>If you feel that the EverQuest Guide Program community is 
      something you wish to be a part of, then we heartily invite you to point

      wonderful article up at Caster's Realm that includes information about the 
      new features that were released with the Legacy of Ykesha expansion and 
      information on upcoming zone revamps. Here is a small quote:<BR></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>The Plane of Hate is being rebuilt from the ground up to 
        correct its numerous pathing issues. The feel of the zone will remain 
        similar to how it is now but the zone will, for all intents, be a 
        completely new experience for players. <BR><BR>Veksar is the underwater 
        city in the Lake of Ill Omen and will be aimed for Level 50 ? 65 
        players. <BR><BR>The team also mentioned that the Plane of Mischief 
        revamp is continuing. One revamp was completed but was rejected by Rich 
        Waters who felt that it could be improved even further before going 
        live. <BR><BR>No exact ETA on any of the new zones were given.
