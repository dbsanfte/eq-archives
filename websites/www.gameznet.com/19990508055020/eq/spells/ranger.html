<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">

<p>Endure Fire<br>
</font><br>
This spell adds to a players resistance to fire.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Flame Lick<br>
</font><br>
Flame lick is a direct damage spell. This is a low damage spell but is great for fetching
monsters.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Glimpse<br>
</font><br>
This spell lets you take a brief glimpse at objects far away. Basically it gives you a
15-20 second period where your sight is zoomed in to the distance.</p>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">

<p>Lull Animal</font><br>
<br>
This spell will can cause animals that are normally agressive to not attack if succesful. </p>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">

<p>Minor Healing</font><br>
<br>
Minor healing is the first in the line of healing spells. <br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Skin Like Wood</font><br>
<br>
This is the first in the line of buffing spells. It adds to both the armor class and hit
points of a player.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Snare</font><br>
<br>
Snare is sort of a limited root spell. While it does not hold a monster perfectly
still(and prevent it from fleeing) it does drastically lower it's movement rate which
accomplishes nearly the same effect.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Level 15</font></p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Burst Of Fire<br>
</font><br>
This is a direct damage spell. </p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Camoflauge</font></p>

<p>This is an outdoor only invisibility spell.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Cure Poison</font></p>

<p>This spell will counteract poisons.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Feet Like Cat<br>
</font><br>
This spell will raise a players agility score.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Grasping Roots</font></p>

<p>Grasping Roots is an upgrade to snare. This spell actually roots the monster in
place(instead of slowing him down) and also does a small amount of damage for the
duration.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Invoke Lightning<br>
</font><br>
This is an area effect spell which centers around your target. Beware however it will also
damage you if you are within range. This spell is outdoor only.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Thistle Coat<br>
</font><br>
This spell creates a mild damage shield.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Level 22</font></p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Bind Sight<br>
</font><br>
This very interesting spell allows you to bind your sight to your target and view from
their perspective.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Enduring Breath<br>
</font><br>
Enduring breath is a water breathing spell. This is important if you wish to go to some of
the underwater locations in the game. It is also useful if you get rooted while
underwater.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Harmony<br>
</font><br>
I'm not really sure what this spell is supposed to do. I believe it is similar to a friend
style spell. It will change the way the target views you. I really have no information on
this spell as it was broken when I tested it.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Ignite<br>
</font><br>
Ignite is a direct damage spell.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Light Healing<br>
</font><br>
This is the second in the line of healing spells. It heals roughly 25 points of damage. </p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Skin Like Rock<br>
</font><br>
This is the second in the skin series. It may not be stacked with others in the line(see
skin like rock). It adds armor class and hit points.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Ward Summoned<br>
</font><br>
This spell is a direct damage spell for use versus summmoned monsters(elements). It has a
very good damage:mana efficiency compared to your other direct damage spells.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Level 30</font></p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Barb Coat<br>
</font><br>
This spell adds armor class as well as a light damage shield.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Cancel Magic<br>
</font><br>
This spell will cancel out a magic effect on you or another party member. It can be a life
saver if someone in your group get's charmed or has one of those particularly nasty Damage
over Time spells cast on them.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Eyes Of The Cat<br>
</font><br>
This spell will grant a player infravision. It is really only useful for human rangers.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Invigore<br>
</font><br>
Invigore will restore a characters stamina.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Shield Of Thistles<br>

Shield of thistles is a damage shield.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Stinging Swarm<br>
</font><br>
Stinging swarm is a damage over time spell. This is a great spell to use during combat as
it will slowly eat away at your opponents hit points.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Strength Of Earth<br>
</font><br>
This spell will add to a characters strength ability for a period of time.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Level 39</font></p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Calm Animal<br>
</font><br>
This spell will prevent an animal from attacking your party by lowering it's
agressiveness.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Careless Lightning<br>
</font><br>
Careless lightning is an upgrade to invoke lightning. It is an area effect damage spell
which centers around the target.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Dismiss Summoned<br>
</font><br>
Dismiss summoned is an upgrade to the level 22 ward summoned spell. This spell does a good
amount of damage to summoned monsters and also features the best damage:mana ratio of any
ranger spell.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Heal<br>
</font><br>
This is the last heal spell that rangers will ever receive. It heals roughly 80 points of
damage.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Levitate<br>
</font><br>
Levitate allows you to levitate above ground. This can be useful if you are on a thin
ledge and the mobs are casting spells which knock you off balance(particularly useful in <a href="../zone/lguk.html">lower guk)</a>. It can also be useful in places where there is a
lot of lava or for quickly travelling over bodies of water.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Skin Like Steel<br>
</font><br>
Skin like steel is the third in the skin like series of spells which add armor class and
hit points.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Spirit Of The Wolf<br>
</font><br>
Spirit of the wolf is one of the most desired spells in the game. This spell allows you to
travel quickly in outdoor zones. It also is used in conjunction with Damage over Time
spells in a cheesy tactic known as kiting where you outrun your opponent while the DoT
spells slowly eat away at his hit points.</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#00FFFF">Level 49</font></p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Bramblecoat<br>
</font><br>
Bramblecoat is the last in the line of thistlecoat spells. It adds armor class and a small
damage shield.<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br>
Ensnaring Roots<br>
</font><br>
This spell is an upgrade to the level 15 grasping roots spell. This spell does a decent
amount of damage as well as rooting your prey.<br>

based attacks.</p>

<p><font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Superior Camoflauge<br>
</font><br>
Superior camoflauge is an upgrade to camoflauge. While they both render you invisible this
one works indoors as well as outdoors.<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffff00" face="Arial" size="2">Wolf Form<br>
</font><br>
This spell allows you to take the form of a wolf also taking on some of it's
characteristics. Most important being that NPC's and monsters will react to you as if you
were a wolf possibly preventing you from being attacked by certain mobs.<br>
