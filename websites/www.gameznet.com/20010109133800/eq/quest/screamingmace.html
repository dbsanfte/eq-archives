    Mace</font></td>

<p>The <a href="../equipment/screamingmace.html">screaming mace</a> quest is one of the
most fullfilling quest you can do between levels 14-25. This quest can be done by a full
party of level 14 characters, and can be done solo at around level 22-25 depending on your
class/race combination.</p>

<p>This entire quest takes place inside of <a href="../zone/crushbone.html">Crushbone</a>.
First thing that you need to do is go see the dwarven smith. He is located in the small
building that is near the mine area. To get here from the entrance you must take a left
and go across the bridge. Once you cross the bridge just basically follow the path. After
you go down the hill you will see a building. Inside this building is a jailor who you
will have to kill. Then you will see two dwarven smiths and an elven priest. Talk to the
middle dwarven smith(actually you can probably talk to either smith but I always spoke to
the one in the middle, so for safety purposes speak to him). Tell him that you are here to
set him free and he will begin rambling about how he wants his freedom but the taskmaster
scares them, yada yada yada. Then ask him about the king or emporer and he will speak of
the high quality ringmail that is worn by this beast.</p>

<p>There are several parts of this quest but you really only need to concentrate on the
final two(bracer of battle and dwarven ringmail). Each piece that you find can either be
kept or turned in for the item that it returns depending on your class, race, and needs.</p>

<p>The first mob that you might want to worry about is the Taskmaster. He hangs out to the
right of the castle near the slaves. He seldomly spawns but when he does he has a chance
of carrying some magic +2 AC earrings. You can either wear these earrings(for the armor
class, although I feel that the <a href="../equipment/onyxearring.html">onyx earrings</a>
are a better choice) or you can return them to the dwarven smith. If you return them to
him he will give you a blade mold which can be used for blacksmithy.</p>

<p>The second mob in this quest is the Instructor/Trainer. This is a large orc who can be
found training other orcs on top of the large hill in the middle of the zone. He very
rarely carries a <a href="../equipment/shinybrassshield.html">shiny brass shield</a>. You
can elect to keep this weapon(a wise choice or a poor choice depending on your class) or
you can turn it in to the dwarven smith in exchange for a sludge mold.</p>

<p>The third item that you will need is the one that will be the most dangerous. You now
need to kill the Emporer/King and hope that he is sporting the <a href="../equipment/dwarvenringtunic.html">dwarven ringmail tunic</a>. If you are a small
race you might think about keeping this item to wear on your person until you get a second
one. However you can turn this item in to the dwarven smith as with the items above. This
time he will give you a dwarven mace which has a damage of 8 and an attack delay of 35.
Not a bad weapon, however it's just a stepping stone. The smith will also send you to go
speaking to the elven priest standing in the next stall. The priest can enchant this mace
for you(and turn it into the screaming mace) but first you need to do something for her.
She wants you to kill the Warlord and bring proof of his death.</p>

<p>The fourth item that you need is the hardest one to get. You need to find the Warlord.
He can be seen patrolling the area from time to time. He is a level 14 or so mob, but that
isn't the problem. The problem is if you attack him he is going to run and bring help. So
you must be careful to root him in place and then try to take care of him before root runs
out. If you are lucky he will be carrying a <a href="../equipment/bracerofbattle.html">bracer
of battle</a>. This is a fine piece of armor for this level, however it can also be turned
in. This time you will turn the bracer into the elven priest rather than the dwarven
smith. The priest will give you a <a href="../equipment/prayercloth.html">prayer cloth</a>
in return for the bracer. </p>

<p>Many players get to this step and think, what? What did I do wrong. Well it is
important to NOT give the priest the mace at the same time as the bracer of battle. You
need to give her the bracer alone first. Then after she hands you the prayer cloth you can
give her the mace. When she asks, &quot;do you have something else for me?&quot; then you
can hand over the prayer cloth and voila you get one shiny screaming mace.<br>
