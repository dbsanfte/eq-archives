     Eduin(Tarew Marr).</font><b>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">King
     of Fighters</font></b><font size="2"></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">What’s
     that you say. King of the fighters? A shaman? Aye, let me explain…</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Which class
     can melee blues solo above level 40, get back up and ready to fighting
     within a few minutes and also be able to choose to run and kite the mob to
     death with DoTs or DD or even root and nuke the mob should the need arise
     if things go poorly?</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Only one -
     the Shaman..</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">But
     you’re taught differently, you’re taught to be a good little priest and
     sit reading your book, meditate, jump up and heal, or buff, or maybe
     they’ll let you cast a spell on the mob itself (a de-buff naturally,
     don’t want the Shaman to get to hurt it).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Settle
     down, I’ll go over the details of how I see the Shaman class. Much is
     contrary to what you have heard elsewhere, much is little understood by
     those who aren’t high level shamans because they simply don’t
     experience the Shaman’s point of view.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Firstly, I
     will outline the main &quot;lines&quot; of Shaman spells - every spell they
     receive falls within one of these categories and to be honest, the mix of
     these changes only slightly throughout the Shaman’s career. However the
     way they are used <b>will</b> change, and often. However, even despite this
     there are only three overall eras of the Shaman’s life. The beginning
     (levels 1 to 19), the middle (levels 20 to 33) and the ascent to higher
     power (levels 34 to 50).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The second
     part will deal with those levels as I outline the ways I enjoy to play. Now
     not everyone will have the same likes and dislikes as I do. I play for
     maximum fighting and uptime, to be always involved in the action. It would
     be very boring if I didn’t get that chance. The shaman <b>can</b> play in
     the ways you have seen described as a &quot;reservist&quot;. But they are <b>so</b>
     much more that you are greatly limiting the experience you can have.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">But as I
     said, its just my opinion.</font></p>
     </font><b>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
     Spell Lines</font><font size="2"><i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Utility</font></i></font></b></p>
     <font size="2">
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Great
     fortune gives the Shaman a raft of abilities that will not be directly
     combat related, but serve a purpose. As well as the basics - gate, bind and
     summoned vitals – the Shaman gets Levitate, Enduring Breath and a host of
     other spells that make it enjoyable to be self-reliant. But with the except
     of root/enstill these are not for combat.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">However
     this isn’t the best part, the combination of Cannibalize (level 24) and
     Regeneration (level 24) or Chloroplast (much better – level 34) give you
     an inbuilt mana stone and the closest you will get to the much demanded
     Enchanter spell Clarity (speeds mana recovery) this side of signing for the
     yellow robed team.</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Damage over
     Time (DoTs)</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The great
     combat strength of the Shaman are their spells that hurt a beast over time.
     These are your best, most mana efficient ways of hurting a beast. And they
     are unparalleled. Although a Wizard’s Direct Damage will do as much
     damage at similar levels in a shorter time, your DoTs keep you in that
     ball-park. Only the Necromancer can get close (and many of the spells are
     shared).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Use your
     DoT spells, use them often. Test them on yourself, (one at a time only
     please), and see how fun your damage can be. You think you’re going to be
     left behind when you hit 49 as a Shaman, then they hand you Ice Comet as a
     no quest needed, 42 second DoT!</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Pets</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">This is the
     final great spell line of the Shaman. However, you need to work damn hard
     to get there. Your pet makes you extremely independent of other players and
     the need to group but also adds a great deal at higher levels. This marks
     your ascent to power and although the strength of the earlier pets is often
     a dis-appointment to some Shamans, they <b>are</b> effective even then and
     will only become better and more use later on.</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Debuffs</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">And now we
     have the really good lines out the way, the middling ground can be
     examined. The problem with the debuff line is that you only have one
     effective spell – Togor’s Insects at level 39. That’s it. The
     disempowerment line (which supposedly reduces mob damage inflicted) is
     negligible in combat. The Malaise line (I refute Verant’s incorrect
     spelling) is <b>always</b> more trouble than it is worth (using it to get a
     mob that resists your DoT or DD spells find the Malaise itself resisted!).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">But that
     one spell is a beauty. Togor’s Insects <b>will</b> reduce mob damage in
     combat by apporixmately 60% because it will slow the mob’s attack speed
     on an effective basis to the way a mob would slow a Player Character. This
     is <b>very</b> unusual but its effect is great. The earlier spells (Drowsy,
     Walking Sleep and even Tagar’s Insects) can be useful but their mana (and
     more importantly time) requirement often makes them of little use.</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Nukes</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Some people
     rate the Direct Damage of the Shaman. I do at times, it has its use and can
     be used to overlap the damage from a couple of DoTs to ensure that <b>very</b>
     few other players can outnuke a Shaman. Its useful - nothing more.</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Healing</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Again its
     useful and for a few levels you will be pretty reliant on it. But in
     healing you aren’t hurting and in not hurting your requiring more heals
     in the combat. It’s a self-defeating circle for all but a few levels.
     Moreso, below level 19 you are <b>killing</b> your party trying to heal.
     Firstly you don’t have the mana, secondly, the level 1 HP buff Inner Fire
     is twice the healing spell that the level 1 Minor Heal spell is (20hps for
     10 mana compared to 10 hps for 10 mana). And Inner Fire’s ratio (20/10)
     even beats the level NINE spell Light Healing (40/25) for post combat
     recover.</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Buffs</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">And here at
     the end of my scale of usefulness. Buffs.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">But, you
     say, the Shaman is the king of buffs. Yes they are, by far. However buffs
     are generally useless. And its related to the design of the game. Verant
     coded a game where numbers weren’t going to be vital. Sure they are <b>nice</b>
     and at higher levels (34 plus) have a noticeable benefit but overall this
     line is the biggest drain on a Shaman and the biggest waste of time.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Example.
     Level 1 Shaman buys Strengthen. It adds 10 strength to the PC. All the
     tanks you group with say, &quot;strength please&quot;. Ask them why? They
     will say, &quot;so I can do more damage&quot;.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">THE
     STRENGTH BONUS DOESN’T KICK IN UNTIL LEVEL 20!</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">In the main
     for at least 33 levels, Shamans are asked to buff and the <b>only</b> thing
     that is doing is adding to downtime. The buffs are not equivalent to the
     damage a shaman can do in melée. The only thing that has happened is the
     group needs to wait for the Shaman to recover (downtime) or fights without
     them and takes more damage (downtime). It’s a no-win situation.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Shamans are
     the king of buffs. They get some nice ones at higher levels (Talisman –
     the stackable HP buff and Dexterity – which I will explain later). But
     for the majority of your life they are a pointless waste of resources that
     people expect. Be strong. Say NO! Explain why.</font></p>
     </font>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
     Three Ages of Shamans</font></b><font size="2"></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Often, the
     Shaman guides break the class down much close than three levels. And there
     is a lot of justification for that. The role of the Shaman can change
     greatly at each spell rank as they balance their strengths against
     weaknesses.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">However,
     I’ve found that there really are only three portions.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><i><b><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The Early
     Days</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">NEVER EVER
     heal in combat until you are level 9. NEVER EVER EVER cast Frist Rift in
     melée. And always think to yourself &quot;I am a tank which can heal up <b>after</b>
     the fight and nuke a <b>runner</b>&quot;. Because that is what you are all
     the way to level 14.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Its amazing
     to watch the number of new shaman that seem to think a Frost Rift for 12
     damage is better than a cracked staff thwack for 13 when the cracked staff
     delay is quicker than the spell refresh and will <b>never</b> get
     interrupted. But you will see them.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The problem
     with Shaman at this stage is that they think caster. And they aren’t.
     Certainly there are some nice touches. At level one a Burst of Flame will
     pull a mob to you saving the aggravation of trying to intercept those non-aggro
     mobs, Inner Fire lets you heal up pretty quick after a fight. A player who
     has been a mid-level hybrid fighter would fine this role suitable. Know
     your limits, understand that your spells won’t get you out of them and
     heal up <b>afterwards</b>.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">You may as
     well not bother with the buffs. They aren’t worth the paper they are
     printed on. Debuffs the same. Your DoTs can add some bite but generally
     fights will not last long enough. And of course you have a very good DD at
     level 14. But only at level 15, when you get channelling, can you then rely
     on it.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">This can be
     a fun time for a Shaman. The levelling is fast, the close community in
     Halas and Everfrost is welcoming and you don’t actually have to leave the
     ‘frost at any point in these first 18 levels (theoretically you could
     stay in the Frost to level 50 but that would be an incredibly slow and
     tedious path).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The only
     tough part is deciding whether to stay exclusively to the Tundra or try
     your hand at Blackburrow. I have always followed the former. Blackburrow is
     one of those places that can be impossible to play for vast periods of
     time. But it is the place to earn money. My philosophy, however, is that
     you don’t need the money. A Shaman is happy in patchwork and a cracked
     staff to level 20 (although personally I have a fondness for the big two
     handed war-hammer sold in Halas Magic Shoppe – meticulous saving with an
     untwinked character can see them gain this at level 12 from Tundra loot
     alone).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">You don’t
     have to stay in the Tundra there are a lot of places that you can level.
     But the community in Halas, as I’ve said, is close. I have always found
     this comforting – almost its own little world away from the horrors of
     Greater Shoutdark or the Camping Camps of Ro.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Whatever
     you do, enjoy it, play your &quot;hybrid fighter with a nice sting in the
     tail at the end&quot; to level 19, grab your new Healing spell and head out
     for wilder game. Or not depending on your choice.</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The Trying
     Middle Times</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana"><br>
     Hell on earth this is. For myself, a player who likes to be in action and
     combat and have as little downtime as possible this level range is quite
     awkward. And you will spend a lot of your gaming life in this
     &quot;hole&quot;. But the Shaman <b>is</b> still effective – the problem
     is it will cost you in downtime until level 24. As you had to trade off
     money against fast levelling in your Early Life you now have to trade of
     fun for quicker levels.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">I chose fun
     but there is no need to. For only five levels between 19 and 24 (when you
     get regen and canibalize) you can sit with your face in a book, popping up
     only to heal and occasionally DoT a mob. Hit 24 and again you can
     cannibalize effectively and greatly reduce the downtime if you want to burn
     and melee – something you can still do so rather effectively. Depending
     on group balance you will always find times at this level that you are
     forced to be the main healer or even on occasion (past 24) the nuker if
     your group needs burns.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The Shaman
     can do a lot in this time. But it can do nothing well. In a group a Shaman
     will always be wanted but often it can be a rather boring existence. Of
     course this will depend on you, some people will enjoy this. Play what you
     enjoy first (remember I’m no god who must be obeyed rigidly, I just enjoy
     my class). If that is your priority you will get a lot out of the Shaman.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">However
     there is an alternative – kiting.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Well kiting
     is a touchy subject. Some people hate it, others love it. Some people will
     go from level 9 to 50 on their own kiting. Even some Shamans who can solo
     more effectively at certain levels without kiting!</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Its
     possible. It works. It can work well. Some mobs give really good solo XP
     (Wooly Mammoth – calves and adults, Griffawns, Scythe Beetles. Some mobs
     give atrocious solo XP (all other Griffxxxs, all other Beetles).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">A simple
     drill. A Shaman can kite (some) adult mammoths at level 19. Just use DoTs,
     count to 42 or 120 depending whether it is disease of poison and re-apply.
     SoW lasts ages. The problem is you <b>will</b> get resisted (guard them)
     and sometimes you run out of mana (you need a &quot;track&quot; – work
     out a path you can run, then meditate and count the meditation
     &quot;ticks&quot; before you have to run again without the mob catching
     you).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">But go
     elsewhere the kiting is far easier. Often you can do it with Direct Damage
     nukes and kill the mod faster but have a longer meditation afterwards.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Is kiting
     the answer to powerlevelling?</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Yes and no.
     A good group, at any level, fighting the right mobs will <b>always</b>
     level faster than a solo kiting the best mobs they could be kiting.
     However, groups break up, are imbalanced, take time to form. A whole host
     of delays and problems can affect groups. This isn’t the case for kiting.
     All you need is you and a med full of mana.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">So
     experience is faster grouped. But kiting is easier to get going. Swings and
     roundabouts. If you play 24/7 and you’re just racing to 50 – kite. If
     you aren’t and know some good people then group. I find it fun to stay in
     one area for a good number of levels and get to know the people there. It
     makes forming a good group very fast and reduces some of the possible
     drawbacks that can keep a group player from levelling faster than a kiting
     player.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Eventually
     you will hit 24 and a new Direct Damage and DoT spells. Then 29. New DoT,
     new Greater Healing, Inviibility and Ultravision (how did I manage without
     it!). Then finally you will hit 34 and the game will change forever. And
     how…</font></p>
     <i><b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">The Ascent
     to Power</font></b></i></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">A high
     level Shaman is the strongest battle class in the game. There, I’ve said
     it. Sure the wizards and Druids can use travel spells but that doesn’t
     help them when a mob pummels them into the ground in less than 20 seconds.
     A Shaman can stand up to that barrage, hit the mob with a big drowsy, find
     the mob is already on its pet and then just apply a couple of DoT spells to
     help his friend finish the job.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Or a Shaman
     can go out looking for bigger game, fine a giant at level 34 and kite it.
     Either DoT or DD or, best of all, nuke it to half then come near your pet
     and circle as your furry companion finishes off the mob that won’t stop
     chasing you (an acquired technique which is great when you feel like being
     on your own and still noticing experience gain).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Or a Shaman
     can group and in that group they can do anything, melee, heal, nuke, DoT,
     debuff. Use their pet (it makes no difference to experience gain – in
     fact its so much faster usually that you get lot more experience). You name
     it the Shaman can do it.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">There is no
     competition for the all around ability. Other classes show more strength in
     each area (except the buffs which are now actually useful <b>in moderation</b>)
     but none can cover all the bases in the way the shaman can. You are not a
     tank – you can’t touch their ability at doing that. You’re not a mage
     you can’t really get the mana to the sort of level where you can nuke
     again and again and again.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">But you are
     a tankmage. A battlewizard who can cover any part of a fight, from pulling
     to healing you can fill that role (although you are <b>far</b> more
     effective using Togor instead of even <b>needing</b> a heal).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">This
     portion is the easiest for a Shaman. For sheer speed of levelling you will
     want to go to Nagafen’s Lair (Solusek B renamed) but you could also group
     up in Lower Guk or perhaps go solo (near the edge of either) or out in the
     plains on the giants, most of which will be blue to near level 50.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">I
     personally recommend Solusek B. Again it’s a place that builds a
     community like Everfrost or (in my time in the mid levels High Keep
     although I hear its not as friendly today) as the place is not rich with
     easy campable items (there are a few but if you need them you get them
     quickly). You might also find a group to go deep, into the mouth of hell
     where the Fire Giants and Lord Nagafen himself can be found.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Regrettably
     a Shaman has yet to solo Lord Nagafen. Very disappointing.</font></p>
     </font><b>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Overall</font></b><font size="2"></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">To finish
     (and therefore not really a summary) a few words on stats. The Shaman needs
     two. Wisdom, for mana and Dexterity, for channelling.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Most
     casters don’t realise the importance of Dexterity to channelling. Shaman,
     who have a good dexterity buff at higher levels see it plainly. When you
     add 40 to your Dex, your ability to cast through hits rises dramatically.
     For a battle mage this is vital, you must be able to cast DoTs and DD
     through two or three hits. With high Dexterity you can.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">For any new
     Shaman the recommendation I would make for the bonus points is 25 to Wisdom
     and 5 to Dexterity.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">However,
     and this is theory, for a <b>twinked</b> Shaman. I would suggest 25
     Dexterity and lots of plus Wisdom items as the twink. Why? Well plus Wisdom
     items also tend to add mana as a bonus over and above the mana that the
     Wisdom adds anyway. Dexterity items don’t?</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">So say you
     want to add 25 points of dexterity and 25 points of Wisdom. Adding 25
     points in Wisdom items is probably good for 40 mana. Adding the 25 dex is
     good for 0 mana (remember this is in addition to the mana wisdom adds). So
     by putting the points in Dex and using plus Wisdom (and mana) items, the
     Shaman has more overall mana than one who has the higher base Wisdom but
     has to sacrifice clothing slots for Dexterity items.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">It’s a
     theory and I would be interested in finding out from anyone who does this
     the benefits. They would have excellent channelling right from level 15.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">In closing,
     I want to re-iterate. More than anything have fun with your Shaman. They
     are the most rounded character in the game and therefore capable of giving
     a lot in return for your time. The ability to always be involved but also
     save the day with a heal or a nuke is something that I have enjoyed
     constantly and still do.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">These are
     all my thoughts, they aren’t gospel, you may read it differently. But as
     far as I can tell this is based on real game experience. And its fun.</font><br>
