          <tr>
            <td valign="top">Najena is a very popular dungeon for characters level 15-30 that is
            located in the zone of <a href="lavastorm.html">lavastorm</a>. To find Najena you can take
            a right upon entering lavastorm and follow the mountains. You will see the Najena ruins in
            the distance. Najena is a spooky dungeon filled with a green fog throughout. <br>
            <br>
            The entrance area is not too easy you will find <a href="../beastiary/grskeleton.html">greater
            skeletons</a> and ogre guards that range in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you will find
            <a href="../beastiary/element.html">elements</a> and <a href="../beastiary/tentterror.html">tentacle terrors</a>. The first few rooms are the ones
            most often occupied by characters level 15-20. There are two other areas in the dungeon
            however for characters of higher levels. They must be visited in order.<br>
            <br>
            The first area is a secret room that will be to the left down on of the hallways. This
            room lies behind an illusionary wall that you can walk right through. From this room you
            will see two passages. The door to the left of here leads to some level 20ish <a href="../beastiary/skeleton.html">skeletons</a>. The passage downstairs leads to the meat
            of this portion of the dungeon. <br>
            <br>
            You will find many necromancers and ogre's down in this area. However the prized opponents
            in this area are Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the Ogre Officer. <br>
            <br>
            Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near the bottom of the stairs. He is in a room with 2
            necromancers. Bonecrusher is a <a href="../beastiary/frogghoul.html">froglock ghoul</a>
            who is level 24. He is sought after for the magic items that he carries. This includes <a href="../equipment/fleshband.html">flesh rings</a> and <a href="../equipment/barbedwhip.html">barbed leather whips</a>. <br>
            <br>
            To the right of the bottom of the stairs and down a corridor you will find the captains
            room. The captain is a level 27ish mob who is quite deadly. He is guarded by several ogres
            including an officer who is in the level 24-25ish range. The captain carries a key to
            Rathyl's room as well as the occasional <a href="../equipment/ogremaul.html">ogre maul</a>
            or large <a href="../equipment/bronzeplate.html">bronze platemail</a> piece of armor.<br>
            <br>
            The keys you get from the monsters in this area will allow you to go to the real juicy
            part of this dungeon: behind the Najena sign. If you continued straight when entering the
            dungeon you would undoubtedly have noticed a Najena sign with some magicians guarding the
            entrance. Behind this sign lies the three major spellcasting NPC's in this zone: Rathyl,
            Drelzna and Najena. <br>
            <br>
            These NPC's must be visited in that order. Each NPC has the key to the other ones chamber
            as well as having a key out of their chamber(to hand out to party members). The Drelzna
            and Najena keys are no rent meaning that if you log out they will dissapear. <br>
            <br>
            I don't want to get into specifics here as something has to be left to chance(and it would
            be hard to describe anyway) so i'm just going to roughly describe each NPC and an example
            of what you might find on them. <br>
            <br>
            Rathyl is guarded by three magicians. He is a deadly foe even after death as his
            reincarnation will appear and have to be destroyed all over again! A typical item you
            might find from Rathyl would be a <a href="../equipment/travbackpack.html">traveller's
            backpack</a>.<br>
            <br>
            Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers. This may be the toughest fight of them all perhaps
            even tougher than Najena.<br>
            <br>
            Najena is guarded by a couple of magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest of them all and
            is the most powerful alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but this is only because of her
            guards. One of Najena's prized possessions is the <a href="../equipment/flowblackrobes.html">flowing black robe</a>.<br>
            <br>
