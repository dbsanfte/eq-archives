          <tr>
            <td><font face="Arial" size="2">Monks are in the long run, the most effective pure melee
            class available, though many players aren&#146;t in it for the long run, so they may go
            for pure warriors or paladins who can dish out much more damage earlier in level than a
            monk can. The use of your body as a weapon can be an advantage at earlier and especially
            later levels as you need no fancy 2 handed monstrous blade to damage enemies, although you
            will be outdamaged for most of your levels in one stroke. This doesn&#146;t mean that you
            are completely under hitting, it means that it takes a very high level monk to pull off
            hits for double 60s like big swords are known for; however, instead of 2 hits a round for
            massive damage you get in 4 or 5 attacks in a round for respectable hits that may not
            inspire awe like a slash for 80 does - but it adds up very quickly.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Monks are also badly hindered in armor choices that limits us
            greatly in lower levels especially. Cloth armor is lightweight and will give you some ac
            before you seek out some pieces of leather or woven and then mesh. Mesh is a staple of
            monks for standard armor, and then the magical pieces of special armor that higher levels
            will eventually begin to gather themselves in.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our class is decked out with many special skills and the
            special attack that is used together with our typical punches and jabs .</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 1</u> - Dual Wield</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The skill that allows us even at low levels to get more
            than the one punch in a round. It will not work very well until around level 15, which is
            when warriors get Dual Wield anyway, but it is a nice skill to start training before it
            gets very useful.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Mend</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A monks only way of healing themselves besides bind wound.
            It will give about 25% or 1 bubble of health on a success no matter what you are doing at
            the time when you use it. It is a risky skill to use at lower levels in a fight because it
            tends to backfire and hurt you occasionally, though after the low 20&#146;s it works very
            reliably and I haven&#146;t failed once for about 10 levels .</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Bind Wound</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Just like every other class&#146;s skill, it reduces down
            time like mend does but cannot be used efficiently in a battle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Dodge</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is an impressive skill when it is later in levels, at
            lower levels you will barely ever get a dodge off, but still nice to have.</font><ul>
              <ul>
                <li><font face="Arial" size="2">Kick</font></li>
              </ul>

            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your starting special attack like the one used by warriors.</font></p>
              </blockquote>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Minimal damage but still good to have until level 5 with
            round kick. This starts off the series of special attacks used by monks to dump extra
            damage during a fight throughout all levels.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 3</u> - Safe Fall</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now this is a GREAT skill now that they have fixed it and
            the skill works properly. From high distances a monk can just glide over rocks and dunes
            and mountains and not worry about damage at all.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 5</u> - Round Kick</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is your first special attack in a series that starts
            with Round Kick and ends with the impressive Flying Kick. It is very useful as it adds
            another attack to your arsenal, though it has a slower cycle rate to use it during a
            battle. Your special will almost always do more damage than a punch when landed correctly.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 8</u> - Sneak</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I actually never even picked this skill up, it seems like a
            waste of points to me, but it is supposed to let you get through areas undetected. I am a
            little less cautious than that and prefer to barge in and use Feign Death (One of the BEST
            skills we ever get) to get through mobs of creatures basically unhurt. Basically.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 10</u> - Tiger Claw</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the second special attack of yours that will
            replace Round Kick. It is MUCH better as it recycles about twice as fast as Round Kick and
            does as much or better damage when trained.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 12</u> - Block</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Used to block attacks and it is gotten at around the same
            time as Dodge begins to work. Block however is a much more useful skill and works to avoid
            attacks more often than Dodge will.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 15 </u>- Double attack</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At level 15 the monk&#146;s whole concept changes to as
            intended. You don&#146;t do as much damage a hit but you start getting off 4 hit combos
            and avoiding hits at the same time. Double attack will help you get in another hit or hits
            after your Dual Wielded punches and Tiger Claw strike.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 17</u> - Feign Death</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh yeah, now this is a SKILL. It won&#146;t work much
            before you practice it constantly, so practice it CONSTANTLY. As your skill goes up you
            can begin to pull and avoid mobs you don&#146;t want to pull with FD. It can also drop you
            in the middle of a fight to wait for a heal instead of running about panicked and probably
            dying. It may seem cowardly to stop helping the group when you are about to die, but
            waiting for a heal helps them more than just dying and not being there for them. Section
            at the end of guide about all the uses I have found for FD.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 20</u> - Eagle Strike</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your next attack to take the place of Tiger Claw. It
            recycles at the same rate but does more damage and hits more often, more like an upgrade
            then a new skill.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 25</u> - Dragon Punch</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Yet another upgrade on the strike series of attacks. This
            works so much better than Eagle Strike it is truly something to look forward to. Max
            damage on this changes with strength obviously but I can expect a hit for 40 with it
            occasionally.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 27 </u>- Disarm</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What a neat little skill, it is quite useful because all of
            the mobs for levels to come do not use magic weapons typically, so disarming that fine
            steel scimitar can tip odds in your favor because a mob will hit for less damage without a
            weapon. Unlike monks.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 30</u> - Flying Kick</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the awe inspiring final manually used special
            attack to take the place of Dragon Punch yet again. After this you will keep this to 50 so
            no more hassle in training a new attack every 5 levels that doesn&#146;t hit well at all
            at first. I recommend keeping a LOT of practice points open for this when you hit 30, it
            is a very difficult skill to use properly until it is a higher skill. It is a damn spiffy
            looking attack and hits for massive amounts of damage then you are used to doing. The only
            drawback is that it recycles as fast as Round Kick did, so much slower than the strikes
            would, but still a great skill when you see how much those level 50 monks do with it.</font></p>
            <u><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Level 35</u> - Riposte</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another automatic used skill like Dodge and Block. It has
            you avoid an attack but with a catch, it allows you another attack as a counter strike
            even as you don&#146;t take damage. Nifty.</font></p>
            <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="2">Those are the monk&#146;s impressive array
            of skills, now PRACTICE them as much as you can.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Strength - It involves how much you can hold without being
            encumbered, although this does not matter to a monk as even over 15-17 pounds is about as
            encumbered as you want to get ever. It also deals with max damage for hits, which is a
            good thing to have, but not as important for monks as it is for other melee classes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Stamina - Deals with the amount of hit points gained each
            level, it is roughly 1 hit point a level for every 5 points you have in stamina. Nice to
            have as well, but not important especially as you are avoiding hits instead of merely
            having more hit points to be able to take it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Agility - Now here is where you drop a lot of effort on.
            Agility is what the monk does best, avoid damage. It directly relates to ac and the chance
            to dodge, block, riposte, dual wield and double attack successfully. So, this is one of
            the PRIME requisites for a monk to have.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Dexterity - Here is the other most important statistic for
            a monk. This stat helps you hit more often, hit better ac, and the amount of attacks you
            get in as well. You miss less often with Dexterity, and with Agility they miss more.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wisdom - Eck.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Intelligence - Eck.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Charisma - I would say it is completely useless but you
            penny pinchers may want items to help reduce item costs from merchants. The only thing I
            ever buy or bought is food and drink though.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, as a monk the human screen will dictate how much
            points you get to spend besides your base stats. It is always 20 points that I recommend
            be split between Dex and Agi depending on what you want more out of your character. I
            think 10 10 is good for both though, and seeking out new agility and dexterity increasing
            items are a favorite pastime of monkeys.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">And now to how to play a monk. As if you didnt know
            already.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A monk is a tank. Pure and simple, though albeit not as
            brute as a buff warrior or a paladin. We have and get no mana or spells. We do however
            pick up all these skills and magic attacks to compensate. We specialize in smaller attack
            damage that adds up (until a higher level when we really start to DISH damage instead of
            nibbling at hit points really fast). A weakness however, is that they decided to not give
            us taunt whatsoever. The best we can do to get a mob off a spell caster or healer is to
            smack it around as hard as we can until it turns to us. Flying kick is also a skill that
            works just as well as taunt when used right. If you take into account when a mob is
            casting or turning and then interrupt it with a well timed flying kick for 70 damage they
            tend to get a bit pissed off. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We average less hit points a level then a warrior or any
            ogres or trolls as well naturally. Our style is not to get more hp&#146;s to take more
            damage, but to take less damage overall. A monk's special skills and abilities need to be
            practiced and learned so they can hit harder, more effectively, or save your life in a
            pinch. Like when to use mend, when to use feign death, how to pull a single mob out of a
            cluster conveniently. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I tend to get some weapon envy - for me it is 2h slashers
            that hit so nicely - that nice shiny Gigantic Zwiehander or Dark Reaver that swipes
            mob&#146;s heads off so cleanly. Weapons are to be envied naturally - that&#146;s why I
            play a little Sk just so he can wear plate mail and slash things in half for fun. But even
            though we CAN use 1h and 2h blunt weapons, it isn&#146;t worth it at all. Our weight is an
            important factor, and I guess you could dual wield 2 screamers if you wanted to your
            attack would be down and damage as well as your dodge block riposte skills from how heavy
            they are. As long as you keep your hand to hand and dual wield skills maxed out, it&#146;s
            fine to try out maces and stuff until you decide that they just really suck. Truly.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Basically though, you need to learn how to play a monk for
            yourself - I can say though, that in the long run, a monk is the smack down pure melee
            class. Sorry guys. ,</font></p>
            <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="2">- Fun with Feign Death -</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">FD is really a very good skill that so many are envious of.
            It can save your life so much that it can seem like your best skill, and it may be -
            besides your attacks. Feign Death is just a skill that makes mobs think that you are dead,
            thus avoiding you - it has limits though as all skills do. First, feign will NEVER work if
            it says &#145;Azuris has fallen to the ground&#146; or whatever your name is. That means
            you failed and you might as well get up and run like hell again until you can try again.
            Also, if you feign when your melee attack is on, even though it says it turns your attack
            off, it automatically fails you - so you need to go through a quick process of turning off
            attacks to FD reliably. Now, I am not sure if this is a myth or not, but it really seems
            to work more often if you turn your back and your attack has been off for more than just
            an instant. Soo, turning off attack and running away a little ways seems to help odds of
            them believing it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have also come to believe they use a saving throw a la
            AD&amp;D systems, to make sure the mob doesn&#146;t think you are faking it. I see a
            difference also in how smart the mob is, obviously none of them are very smart, but the
            casters, and more intelligent of creatures like an Inferno Goblin Priest will just go
            about nuking you while you lay there, though a same level Inferno Goblin Champion - which
            is just a melee mob - will believe it almost always. So it deals with casters and levels
            most noticeably.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Feign Death Pulling -</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This trick deals with when there is that annoying cluster
            of mobs that you can&#146;t take all of at once, so here is a way you can get them one at
            a time if you are careful. Have your pull spot reasonably far away, like around a few
            corners and far enough away that they don&#146;t sense you automatically. Determine a
            target you want and have everyone else assist on it, then run off from your group - or if
            you&#146;re solo - and smack it around for a few hits and immediately run back. DO NOT get
            all of them to your pull spot where your group is, just enough space so they won&#146;t
            know when you get up again. Sooo, while they are all clambering after you trying their
            best to eat you, you simply fall down, and they will confusedly stand there for a little
            while. This takes some patience, but soon after, they will climb over your body and move
            back to their spot, and here&#146;s the best part, ONE AT A TIME. So, when the last is
            still standing on you, wait for it to walk back a ways and then nab it before it&#146;s
            comrade&#146;s notice at all. You can take them best one at a time, but I think it is
            possible to get 2 3 at a time if you want as well - just be careful, because it isn&#146;t
            often that your party members can FD with you - so don&#146;t get them killed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Feign Death Kiting -</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is a very difficult maneuver that takes a lot of
            practice and it doesn&#146;t work on many types of mobs. It works very well on giants and
            other extremely slow stupid types. This isn&#146;t pure kiting as you aren&#146;t leading
            the mob around stupidly, but I couldn&#146;t come up with a better term for it, so&#133; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The trick is to spot a large preferably red mob alone that
            you can pull to a spot near a zone. I like the spot in oasis next to the south ro zone for
            sand giant killing, myself. So if you can spot one, hit it and run (Sowed ALWAYS) and get
            back to your spot as quick as you can, then feign. As soon as your FD pops back up stand
            and whack it in the back as it starts to meander away and fall down as fast as possible,
            like instantly. At first if you aren&#146;t used to doing this and can&#146;t try fast
            enough they will get a very painful round in on you and it won&#146;t work if you
            can&#146;t hit it without being hit, so buffs and Sow are a MUST. You can keep trying
            until you have gotten the rhythm and if you get good at it, the kiting gets very easy and
            basically boring. And by the way, solo exp for red mobs is really nice exp .</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Feign Death Passthroughs -</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Often, mobs around your level as you do this and not really
            high (and not casters a lot of times) have no idea that you are still alive after you have
            FD&#146;ed and gotten away if you do it out of their sense range. So, if you have just run
            really quickly through an area full of spawns of creatures around your level and then
            feigned with all of them over you, as they return to their spots, often they still think
            you are dead and leave you alone since you are away from them still. Needing to get past
            an area of spawns this is an option, to just run through, take the damage and then wait
            for them to leave as you lie there.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This does NOT work on everything, for example giants,
            guards, griffins, and other higher level mobs always know when you have gotten up, so if
            you let them run off for a while you can run and then feign again before they get to you.</font></p>
