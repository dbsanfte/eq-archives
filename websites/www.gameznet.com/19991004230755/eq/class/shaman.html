            Shamans are a strange class in Everquest. They can do a bit of almost everything from
            melee to all manners of casting, and are one of the most versatile classes in Everquest.
            The shaman is billed as an offensive-minded cleric according to the documentation, but
            that's really the druid's role. Druids are better offensive casters than shaman are, and
            can almost compete with wizards for effectiveness at times. Shaman are not as powerful at
            striking their enemies down, but are far more effective in wearing them down with curses,
            poison, and other dehibilitating effects. Shaman are also far more effective than druids
            are at building up themselves and others through haste, ability buffs, and utility
            enchantments. And shaman can melee better than any other priest class.<br>
            <br>
            Weapons: <br>
            <br>
            Shamans can use most 1H and 2H blunt melee weapons in the game. These are generally
            effective weapons that are a little slower or weaker than slashing weapons are. They are
            also generally a bit heavier. Blunt weapons are still pretty effective overall, and there
            are a lot of high-quality magic ones out there.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans are also able to use all &quot;standard&quot; axes. I say &quot;standard&quot;
            because shamans are not able to equip throwing axes or battle-axes. But there is a weapon
            type known simple as &quot;axe&quot; that shaman's can use. This includes the famous
            polished granite tomahawk, which is a fantastic weapon. Unfortunately shamans can never
            develop the skill to wield slashing weapons, and must rely on their base offense score to
            hit. This means shamans will almost always be better off using a blunt weapon anyhow.<br>
            <br>
            In a similar fashion, shamans DO have the ability to develop the piercing weapons skill,
            but have almost no weapons to use in doing so. There are about 3 or 4 piercing weapons in
            the game the shaman can use. None of them are as good as the corresponding blunt weapons
            of equivalent levels.<br>
            <br>
            Armor: <br>
            <br>
            Shamans can wear most armor. They can equip up to, but not including, plate mail. Shamans
            can equip a shield. In most cases shamans can equip the powerful magic armor that exists
            in the game, including the highly sought after rubicite. The lack of plate mail is a very
            slight disadvantage to the shaman class as shamans do get banded mail available to them
            which is nearly as good anyhow. After that much of the magic plate in the game will be
            warrior, paladin, or shadowknight only anyway.<br>
            <br>
            Special equipment:<br>
            <br>
            Shamans don't get much of anything here. I can say that the developers really ignored the
            shaman when they created equipment. They would argue with me I suppose, but it is obvious
            that they simply added shamans to some of the other equipment that they created for all
            other classes. Shamans realistically do not have any class-specific items at all. Very,
            very recently we have discovered some shaman-specific weapons and armor around. It has
            only occured in the most unbelievably remote areas of the game, though; places like
            dragon's hoards and in the fear plane. These areas are accessible only to huge gatherings
            of lvl 45+ individuals rallied up in big groups of 30 or more. So don't get your hopes up.<br>
            <br>
            On a lighter note shamans can use almost all equipment that clerics can, and most of the
            mana-bonus items that pure casters can get. Shamans also will be able to use all equipment
            limited to the large races. There are a limited number of such items available, but some
            of the nice 2H hammers do fall into this class of items that only the big races can
            handle.<br>
            <br>
            Ability Scores:<br>
            <br>
            Shaman races by and large are big, strong, stupid, and unpleasant. By the books the main
            attributes of a shaman are his stamina, wisdom, and charisma scores.&nbsp; You are going
            to want to add points to your three prime requisites more than anything else.<br>
            <br>
            In the past it has been determined that wisdom is the most important for several reasons.
            Mainly it's because wisdom is known to affect the maximum mana your shaman can have each
            level. That's important. After this the big idea is that shamans can buff the other two
            abilities on their own. Since shamans can never buff wisdom it makes sense to add as much
            wisdom as possible early on.<br>
            <br>
            This makes a lot of sense, except that wisdom does not really make much of a difference to
            your overall mana. At most it seems to add about 1 mana per level for every 5 or so points
            of wisdom, and that's a generous estimate. Shamans I have talked to without lots of bonus
            wisdom do fine without really noticing a lack of mana. To be honest, no matter what you do
            you are not going to have an abundance of mana to spare. Shamans simply do not have a lot
            of mana reserves to drain in Everquest.<br>
            <br>
            Stamina in the trickiest stat to judge. There are unconfirmed rumors that stamina has a
            significant bearing on your fizzle rate. Fizzling appears to be based on your level,
            ability rating in the spell's category, and your stamina rating. In some of the testing I
            have seen<br>
            stamina appears to have a far greater effect on fizzle rate than wisdom does on a shaman's
            mana totals. Stamina also is supposed to affect your hit points, but not signifcantly. In
            fact it barely matters at all. 20 points of stamina may mean 1 or 2 extra hit points per
            level. Keep stamina in mind for fizzle rates only. Whether stamina really affects how
            often your spells fizzle is still up in the air, but in this writer's experience it seems
            likely.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            The last ability, charisma, is actually quite useful. Charisma is likely to affect how
            creatures resist all your spells. Again, there is no science to this and no confirmation
            from the developers, but extensive testing by shamans has suggested that 10-20 points of
            charisma is going to make a significant difference in overcoming NPC resistance to your
            spells. Even if this is not guaranteed, charisma is the most useful ability in the game at
            every level to all characters. It affects how much you buy and sell for as well as how
            your reputation is affected by faction hits.<br>
            <br>
            All this means the shaman races are pretty much equal in the shaman ability scores, with
            trolls just a tad bit behind. Trolls do get the benefit of regeneration. Regeneration is
            undoubtedly the best racial ability in the game and more than compensates for the slight
            difference in abilities. Trolls also have better combat-specific stats than ogres do with
            higher dexterity and much higher agility. Agility adds directly to your AC and is probably
            the best combat stat of all the four. Strength unfortunately does NOT make much of a
            difference between ogres and trolls until after level 20 when real bonuses start to kick
            in. Stamina is also negligable in it's effect on your hit points.<br>
            <br>
            Barbarians have slightly better shaman-specific stats than ogres do, but both ogres and
            trolls are far better melee and solo races than barbarians are. Barbarians however do not
            suffer from the racial hatred that plagues the other two evil races, and are far less
            likely to be soloing at any given time.<br>
            <br>
            All in all, Barbarians are fine shamans and will give you the least headaches
            faction-wise. Trolls and Ogres are slightly better off overall, but more frustrating to
            develop because of their faction penalties. It should be said now that all ogre and shaman
            gods are considered evil and anyone that plans to ever see the inside of a good-aligned
            city should not think about playing a troll or ogre shaman. Religion matters to the
            inhabitants of Norrath and most cities will never accept an evil shaman despite thousands
            of messages that say your reputation has increased.<br>
            <br>
            That being said I have found that it is not impossible to increases your rep, as well as
            that it is often not necessary to do so at all. The evil cities can give you anything you
            need; it just takes more time to get it. You also miss out on 90% of the quests in the
            game. Again, that's not a big loss in my experience.<br>
            <br>
            On a side note there is currently an issue in Halas where the barbarians come from where a
            human thief in killing young barb shamans that complete the Bloodforge hammer quest. So be
            warned that some quests you do CAN effect faction in your home zones. Trolls and ogres
            seem to be able to accept this better than the barbarians I know, who are petitioning to
            have the rogue removed.<br>
            <br>
            I would rank the races in this manner:<br>
            <br>
            Trolls have the least downtime, have the best melee stats, and are the easiest to solo
            with.<br>
            <br>
            Ogres are the most powerful in melee at high levels and have the best overall prime
            requisite abilitie scores.<br>
            <br>
            Barbarians are the best casters of the three and have the advantage of not being a hated
            race.<br>
            <br>
            I suggest you choose the race you like the best. All are well balanced in the overall view
            of things.<br>
            <br>
            Skills:<br>
            <br>
            The shaman in melee:<br>
            <br>
            Shamans are surprisingly effective at melee throughout the game. In the early levels
            (1-10) a shaman will be practically as effective as any true melee class. Shamans do not
            get as many skill points in melee skills as those classes do, but this won't matter much
            for awhile. Shamans are limited to [ ( lvl + 1 ) x 4 ] ability points per level in all
            weapons skills. This will keep them from being true warriors throughout the game. But all
            shamans get a slam attack by virtue of being a large race, and that is a significant
            advantage.<br>
            <br>
            Currently slam only does one point of damage, and never increases. But it does stun
            targets effectively, and adds a second attack that no other pure caster gets. It is
            perfect for disrupting enemy casters by timing it properly. It also is great at stunning a
            fleeing monster and preventing his escape. As a shaman gains levels he may have the odd
            role where he is the only character capable of stunning an enemy, as most warrior classes
            opt for 2H weapons or dual wield over using a shield. So be prepared to use slam over the
            long haul.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans also get respectable hit points at about 21 or so per level. That's going to be
            enough to hang out in a battle and take some hits. You will always want the best armor
            possible at any time, and shamans can wear all armor that isn't raw plate. That's most of
            the good armor in the game, and certainly enough to be melee-proficient for your first
            20-30 levels.<br>
            <br>
            Around lvl 20 you will notice that your shaman is no where near the effectiveness of your
            melee class party members, but you can still get in there and mix it up with your slam and
            your weapons. You will have adequate hit points to survive some attacks and enough armor
            to absorb some damage.<br>
            <br>
            On another note, shamans also have a unique line of spells that allows them to transform
            from a semi-melee caster into a near-melee non-caster. At level 19 shamans can cast
            Frenzy. It doesn't work like a normal spell that you pay the cost of and it takes effect.
            Instead you cast it and it continues to drain your mana until you run out. In exchange for
            this Frenzy adds greatly to your strength and also boosts your AC and attack speed
            significantly. Later spells along this line also add to your Hit Point regeneration
            considerably. This spell line won't make you a warrior, but it does allow you to melee
            better than any other non-melee class at a significant cost.<br>
            <br>
            The shaman as a caster:<br>
            <br>
            Shamans are most likely the most versatile casters around. In most basic terms they have
            respectable offensive spells that do Direct Damage (DD) and Damage over Time (DoT). These
            are the spells that kill MOBs and are easy to understand. Cast them and watch as the enemy
            takes damage.<br>
            <br>
            Aside from the lvl 1 burst of flame, all shaman DD spells are all based on cold, so they
            aren't too effective in Permafrost and some other zones. That stinks for young barbarians
            but is great everywhere else. Most creatures are not very frost resistant. Shaman DD
            spells are some of the least effective DD in the game in terms of how much mana it takes
            to deal out an equal amount of damage. Shaman DD spells are relatively quite expensive.
            But while they are not efficient, they are certainly effective. In a party situation you
            may want to drop a big ice blast or two on a tough monster for a quick kill. Shamans
            cannot keep up with wizards or druids in dealing massive damage throughout combat, but
            they can contribute effectively if it is necessary.<br>
            <br>
            DoT spells, on the other hand, are far more effective at dealing damage for the mana they
            cost you. Since your damage is spread out over a minute or two you get an overall much
            better damage ratio to how much mana it costs you. Shaman DoT are all based on either
            poison or disease attacks. Poison spells generally do their damage faster, while disease
            spells are slightly more mana efficient but take longer. Shamans can stack up both a
            poison and a disease spell to really wear down a monster quickly.<br>
            <br>
            In personal combat when alone DoT is certainly the way to go. You will almost never need
            DD; just begin with a DoT or two and go to melee. Let your weapon and spells wear the
            creature out. With changes to DoT made lately poison spells have become more useful
            in-group combat as well, as some of them only take under a minute to resolve fully.<br>
            <br>
            There tends to be a bunch of players crying about &quot;kiting&quot; by shamans and
            druids. Kiting is using Spirit of the Wolf along with some DoT spells to wear down an
            enemy and kill it without ever having to risk melee. Contrary to popular opinion kiting is
            NOT a particularly fast way to level, especially with the changes made recently to DoT
            spells. It is effective, though, and relatively safe. Usually you are still better off
            finding a good group and helping out in a dungeon. Since shamans are pretty
            party-oriented, this is usually a complaint left to druids to absorb.<br>
            <br>
            Aside from the obvious damage spells, shamans have the very subtle buffing and debuffing
            spells. These spells will add to any physical attribute of a character or take away from
            any physical attribute of an NPC (non-player character).<br>
            <br>
            These spells are generally underappreciated by non-shamans because you cannot tell the
            specific effects as easily, yet they are probably much more useful in most cases. The
            shaman Disempower and Drowsy line of debuffs are particularly effective, as they can slow
            down an NPC's attacks or considerably cripple his ability to deal damage. NPC's attacks
            are all based on their raw ability scores (ie. they do NOT work the same way players
            attacks do) so when you take away from an NPC's strength and stamina it DIRECTLY affects
            the maximum damage that NPC can do and how well he is attacking overall. 20 points of
            strength removed from an NPC can translate into 10-20% less damage from EVERY hit that NPC
            scores. And he won't be able to score as many hits, either.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, shamans have the fantastic ability to reduce the ability of an NPC to resist
            any kind of magical attack. The Malise and Insidious Fever lines can take down at least 15
            points of any resistance. 15 points of resistance is a significant difference in how often
            creatures will resist offensive magic. DD spells get a special break since DD get
            partially resisted a lot, and that means more direct damage happens when an NPC is
            Malised.<br>
            <br>
            And that's just for starters. On the other end of the coin is the shaman's ability to buff
            the stats of his party members. Shamans are most effective in giving out strength bonuses,
            but all physical abilities are available. Shaman buffs tend to last a considerable time at
            low levels and eventually last for very long stretches at high levels. Effects of a
            shaman's buffs are less noticeable than his enemy debuffs since characters don't work
            exactly like NPCs do. But every buffed stat probably adds around 5% or so to a characters
            overall combat effectiveness. It's not a lot on its own to get one stat buffed up 10 or 20
            points, but all of them together is a godsend. You're talking 15-20% more overall combat
            effectiveness when strength, dexterity, stamina, and agility are all buffed appropriate to
            the character's level. That's significant. No other class comes close to beefing up his
            fellow party members in raw statistical advantage.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans also have other spells that add direct bonuses to AC, hit points, magic
            resistance, and attack speed. Clerical AC bonuses are actually a bit better, but ours work
            just fine when no cleric is around. And the bonus to attack speed is not to be
            underestimated. It should always be maintained on your group's tanks when possible. Same
            thing goes with magic resistance, which is obviously a handy ability to have in effect.<br>
            <br>
            Overall there is no argument that shamans are the kind of beefing up themselves and their
            party members for long-term benefits.<br>
            <br>
            Shamans also get a short line of odd utility spells that tend to be pretty helpful. Most
            significant and useful of them is the Spirit of the Wolf spell. It very simply adds about
            30-40% to your running speed. That may sound simple, but once you are travelling around in
            30% less time than before it's great. Even better is the simple fact that now you can
            outrun most NPCs, and suddenly life outdoors is practically safe again. It's a spell that
            can still help out in dungeons, but not that much since you can't escape in many crowded
            dungeon situations. Spirit of the Wolf is easily the most useful spell in the game and a
            perpetual case for class jealousy amongst non-shamans or druids. Shamans get it 5 levels
            earlier than druids do as well.<br>
            <br>
            Another killer spell is Spirit Pouch. Lots of players miss out on it because it summons an
            item that disappears when you log out. If you put anything in it, you lose those items as
            well. For this risk you get an item that can hold other items of all sizes and makes
            everything in it weightless. This is such a tremendous bonus as characters start running
            into weight limits it's unreal. If you want to make friends with a monk just summon up a
            spirit pouch or two for them. This is probably the shaman's second most useful spell
            overall, and probably the least appreciated spell in the game.<br>
            <br>
            Along these line shamans can summon up food and water for themselves and their companions.
            That's a handy ability all throughout your career in Everquest. They also get some other
            odd spells like charm animals, invisibility, shrink, and other things that are in the
            spell lists here. The final tip to this cap comes at high levels when shamans are able to
            actually summon up a pet for themselves. Shaman pets are sort of an odd bonus that they
            get in order to help them melee when they are stating to become real cannon fodder for the
            tough creatures around lvl 30. The pet is under the ability of a necromancer or magician
            pet, but the shaman himself is far better equipped to handle melee anyway. In the end its
            a wash. The pet lines of spells start at lvl 29.<br>
            <br>
            Last but not least the shaman's healing ability is worth noting. Shamans heal exactly the
            same as druids do. That's to say that shamans are not primary healers, but are effective
            healers nevertheless. Usually shaman's heals come one circle after the cleric's
            corresponding spell does. In the shaman's case this stops at lvl 29 with greater healing
            for +300 hits. It's the tradeoff shamans must accept for their great versatility in all
            other areas. In exchange for less direct healing ability shaman are better at reducing
            downtime. Shamans get a regeneration line of spells that works very well AFTER a battle at
            getting back into the game. This line works great with cannibalize, a spell which does
            direct damage to you in exchange for adding to your mana reserves.<br>
            <br>
            The shaman as a herbalist:<br>
            <br>
            Shamans have the unique ability to create potions. There is absolutely nothing to get
            excited about here, as this skill is currently being re-worked. Someday Verant will get
            around to fixing this skill and I will re-submit more information about it. Right now it's
            just a way to waste money on weak potions that do things your spells can do better. Sorry,
            but that's the truth.<br>
            <br>
            Developing your shaman:<br>
            <br>
            When you start as a young shaman whelp you are best advised to purchase all your available
            buffs first. Don't even worry about DD until you have all your healing and buffing spells.
            You can melee like a champ for a long time as long as you keep up your strength and
            dexterity spells. Add in the occasional DD when you pick up Burst of Flame and you can
            level quickly.<br>
            <br>
            I advise that you pick up as much armor as possible as soon as you can. Armor is far more
            important than weaponry is in all cases and will continue to be so throughout the game.
            Always strive to maintain the best AC you can. Your club is a good weapon for quite a
            while, although you should strive to pick up a rusty morningstar and worn great staff from
            decaying skeletons as soon as possible. Once you aquire a 2H blunt weapon be sure to use
            it every level and keep BOTH 1H blunt and 2H blunt equal at all times. You get exactly 4
            skill points times your level, plus 4 more points, and you should strive to keep your
            combat maxed at all times. It is very easy to keep both skills up if you do it from the
            start and alternate within every level. It can be very frustrating to learn one all the
            way from 0 if you make it to the teens and you never bothered to practice.<br>
            <br>
            You should start to learn how to best use your slam ability at this point. Remember that
            slam only does one point of damage. You want to use it constantly ONLY on non-spellcasting
            NPC. If you are fighting someone that can cast spells you must save your slam until you
            see him begin to cast. Once he pauses hit him with the slam. You will be surprised how
            much more effective you are this way, and you will survive many more battles.<br>
            <br>
            Also learn to time your offensive spells in with your enemy's attacks. As soon as you see
            him strike you want to immediately hit the cast button. Your DD and DoT spells mostly have
            a casting time equal to the delay time that an NPC has. So if you start to cast when he
            has just started to recover, you will often get your spell off without interruption.<br>
            <br>
            The first few levels are very easy to advance through. Save all your money and buy all
            your spells. Remember that sitting down doubles your mana and hit point recovery. Try to
            keep aware of where you are, because you will die from time to time and you need to find
            your corpse. By typing /loc you get a +/- divination of your location on the zone that
            will dramatically help you find your corpse. Hotkey /loc in your combat keys so you can
            hit it whever you get in trouble. Even if you are running away it will still give you some
            clue as to where to go. If you die somewhere hard to reach there is a /corpse command that
            will summon your body to you. This can help when monsters are hanging around your corpse
            or it is under water. <br>
            <br>
            Once you get to lvl 4 make sure to train yourself in channeling, as it allows you to cast
            spells faster and occasionally allows you to recover from being hit and still cast
            successfully. You can easily kill white creatures at this point and probably have no
            problem with a single yellow creature when you are fully buffed and full with mana. Up
            until lvl 4 you will get a full refresh of water and food when you get killed. I suggest
            that at the end of lvl 3 you die once near home and get some free food for the last time
            in your career. After that you need to buy it for a while until you get summon water at
            lvl 5 and summon food at lvl 9.<br>
            <br>
            At lvl 5 be sure to get as many spells as you can afford. You want your ability buffs,
            scaleskin, and spirit pouch, as well as drowsy and sicken. Then get frost strike when you
            can. Scaleskin is a much-maligned spell that is very, very useful. Kill some snakes for an
            hour and store up 20-40 components. Just don't store them in your spirit pouch. Using
            sicken and drowsy with all your buffs you will notice a major difference in your melee. By
            now you should have learned that you always want to fight near a zone entrance or close
            enough to the guards that you can make it to them when you are under 2 bubbles of health.
            You are still able to take on yellow creatures for a while, but watch out since you start
            losing experience when you die at lvl 5.<br>
            <br>
            At lvl 8 you get meditate. This dramatically reduces your downtime and makes you feel less
            like a melee character at last. Now you can think about blasting away with your DD spells
            at last. From here on out you will be casting significantly and your melee will begin to
            fall behind the warrior classes more and more. By now you should think about grouping up
            when you can, or you need to be soloing blue monsters. Whites and yellows can be a real
            risk at this point.<br>
            <br>
            At lvl 9 you finally get SoW. Be happy with yourself, you are now a shaman. You can start
            making good money by hanging out in high level areas and /auctioning off SoW to high level
            characters. I would do it all the time when I was broke. Many players wil give you a
            platinum per cast. You also get tainted breath, your first really effective DoT spell. Use
            it whenever possible. Also make sure you have summon food and water and light healing. All
            are important. Get Spirit of Bear when you can, it helps overcome fizzling. SoW allows you
            to solo whites again without much risk. You can keep this up for a long time to come.<br>
            <br>
            At lvl 14 you want to buy almost every spell. This is going to be expensive, so buy Spirit
            of the Snake first and save a few gold. Be sure to buy the debuffs at this level, and the
            new AC buff Turtle Skin. Disempower is the most effective one for the cost. Spirit Strike
            is a pretty powerful DD spell you will want as well.<br>
            <br>
            You get dodge at lvl 15. This is not much of a big deal since you have a fairly low skill
            cap. Still, it can help you avoid an attack every few combats and is worth training a few
            points in.<br>
            <br>
            At lvl 19 you are pretty advanced. Most likely you know how to run a shaman by now. If you
            made it to this level I am confident you don't need any further help from me. Turn around
            and help out the other shaman whelps in your home city become big and powerful like you
            now are.<br>
            <br>
            There is nothing quite like the feeling that a free SoW and super-ability buff can give a
            newbie. Be sure to help them out when you can. They'll usually thank you for it.<br>
