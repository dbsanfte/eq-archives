<p>The fiery avenger is perhaps the most powerful weapon in the game. It is definately the
most awe inspiring. There is something about seeing a flaming sword in front of your eyes.
It has a damage of 35 and a delay of only 45. Perhaps more importantly it casts inferno
shock randomly when it succesfully hits which will deal a whopping amount of damage.<br>
<br>
It has long been believed that this would be a paladin only weapon and it has even be
stated as being such by Aradune himself. However the prototype in Beta was useable by all
classes who could wield a two handed sword and was two handed. This may very be simply so
the GM's could show it off and is the most probable scenario. Another difference is that
the high level paladin swords were moving to one handed and not two. Either way whatever
happens with this sword I am sure it will be perhaps the most powerful weapon in the game.<br>
