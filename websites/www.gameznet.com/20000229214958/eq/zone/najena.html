                        dungeon for characters level 15-30 that
                        is located in the zone of <a

                        find Najena you can take a right upon
                        entering lavastorm and follow the
                        mountains. You will see the Najena ruins
                        in the distance. Najena is a spooky
                        dungeon filled with a green fog
                        throughout. <br>
                        <br>
                        The entrance area is not too easy you
                        will find <a

                        skeletons</a> and ogre guards that range
                        in the 15ish level range. Deeper in you
                        will find <a
                        href="../beastiary/element.html">elements</a>
                        and <a

                        terrors</a>. The first few rooms are the
                        ones most often occupied by characters
                        level 15-20. There are two other areas in
                        the dungeon however for characters of
                        higher levels. They must be visited in
                        order.<br>
                        <br>
                        The first area is a secret room that will
                        be to the left down on of the hallways.
                        This room lies behind an illusionary wall
                        that you can walk right through. From
                        this room you will see two passages. The
                        door to the left of here leads to some
                        level 20ish <a
                        href="../beastiary/skeleton.html">skeletons</a>.
                        The passage downstairs leads to the meat
                        of this portion of the dungeon. <br>
                        <br>
                        You will find many necromancers and
                        ogre's down in this area. However the
                        prized opponents in this area are
                        Bonecrusher, the Ogre Captain and the
                        Ogre Officer. <br>
                        <br>
                        Bonecrusher is in a room to the left near
                        the bottom of the stairs. He is in a room
                        with 2 necromancers. Bonecrusher is a <a
                        href="../beastiary/frogghoul.html">froglock
                        ghoul</a> who is level 24. He is sought
                        after for the magic items that he
                        carries. This includes <a
                        href="../equipment/fleshband.html">flesh
                        rings</a> and <a
                        href="../equipment/barbedwhip.html">barbed
                        leather whips</a>. <br>
                        <br>
                        To the right of the bottom of the stairs
                        and down a corridor you will find the
                        captains room. The captain is a level
                        27ish mob who is quite deadly. He is
                        guarded by several ogres including an
                        officer who is in the level 24-25ish
                        range. The captain carries a key to
                        Rathyl's room as well as the occasional <a
                        href="../equipment/ogremaul.html">ogre
                        maul</a> or large <a
                        href="../equipment/bronzeplate.html">bronze
                        platemail</a> piece of armor.<br>
                        <br>
                        The keys you get from the monsters in
                        this area will allow you to go to the
                        real juicy part of this dungeon: behind
                        the Najena sign. If you continued
                        straight when entering the dungeon you
                        would undoubtedly have noticed a Najena
                        sign with some magicians guarding the
                        entrance. Behind this sign lies the three
                        major spellcasting NPC's in this zone:
                        Rathyl, Drelzna and Najena. <br>
                        <br>
                        These NPC's must be visited in that
                        order. Each NPC has the key to the other
                        ones chamber as well as having a key out
                        of their chamber(to hand out to party
                        members). The Drelzna and Najena keys are
                        no rent meaning that if you log out they
                        will dissapear. <br>
                        <br>
                        I don't want to get into specifics here
                        as something has to be left to chance(and
                        it would be hard to describe anyway) so
                        i'm just going to roughly describe each
                        NPC and an example of what you might find
                        on them. <br>
                        <br>
                        Rathyl is guarded by three magicians. He
                        is a deadly foe even after death as his
                        reincarnation will appear and have to be
                        destroyed all over again! A typical item
                        you might find from Rathyl would be a <a
                        href="../equipment/travbackpack.html">traveller's
                        backpack</a>.<br>
                        <br>
                        Drelzna is guarded by 2 necromancers.
                        This may be the toughest fight of them
                        all perhaps even tougher than Najena.<br>
                        <br>
                        Najena is guarded by a couple of
                        magicians. Najena is perhaps the rarest
                        of them all and is the most powerful
                        alone. Drelzna may be a tougher kill but
                        this is only because of her guards. One
                        of Najena's prized possessions is the <a
