                    guide will serve as a strategy for those of you who wish to hunt at the dungeon of
                    Befallen. I have spent a great amount of time in this dungeon, and have decided to pass
                    along my opinions, strategies, and tactics regarding this undead wonderland. It should be
                    said that while this is designed with clerics in mind, much can be used by other classes.
                    I will proceed with stages of increasing reward and difficulty, including both soloing and
                    grouping strategy. For those of you who live under rocks, Befallen is in the West
                    commonlands, two zones west of Freeport. The best way to find it is to run west through
                    the newbie garden at Freeport, scale the sandy mountains to left of you in the East
                    Commonlands and follow them til you zone into the West Commonlands. Then continue to run
                    along the sandy mountains until you come across a hole in the side of the mountain with a
                    blue glow. Be careful of Hill Giants, Kizdean Gix, and wandering Ghouls. Walk through the
                    short hallway, careful not to step on all the meditating PCs, and proceed into the
                    dungeon. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>You have arrived.</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You've just zoned into Befallen and were greeted by a Ghoul
                    who decided to gnaw on your arm as you oriented yourself to the first hallway. You quickly
                    turn around and zone, asking yourself why you traveled through so many zones to get
                    whooped up on. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Welcome to Befallen.</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Like many other popular hunting grounds, you have just
                    experienced a &quot;train.&quot; In this case, the ghoul (who resides in the third level)
                    will wander around feasting on youngsters in the first level until some seasoned vets
                    answer the numerous shouts of &quot;GHOUL!&quot; and &quot;Stop training from the third
                    level!&quot; and put the smack down. Don't be discouraged! This happens all the time. What
                    you did is the most common (and effective) form of fighting and retaining experience in
                    Befallen. Retaining experience means earning experience, while not dying (some people are
                    content with just gaining experience, but I enjoy retaining far more, trust me). Learn
                    when to turn tail and haul arse to that zone. Clerics, when you hit 2 bubbles left of
                    health, and you've got two skeletons on you, cast Divine intervention and make a dash for
                    the door (Note: Divine Intervention = 1st level cleric spell renders the caster
                    invulnerable for 30 seconds). This is the most important fact of life for you &quot;power
                    levelers.&quot; Use the easy zone access to save your life and the life of your party.
                    Also, clerics, if you are in a group, cast Divine Intervention and tank that Ice-Boned
                    skeleton while your party members zone to safety. Well enough about running away, let's
                    talk hunting! </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>You seek revenge (Levels 5 through 8).</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now it's time to assess your prey. In the first level,
                    there are NPCs of varying difficulty, though most of the spawning types are good solid
                    fights for level 5-8 PCs. I recommend collecting all the stackable giant rat parts you can
                    (stackable means you can have up to twenty, rat ears, for instance, in one inventory
                    slot). These make surprisingly good cash when you sell them in bunches of 20 or so.
                    Please, do your fellow Befallen hunter a favor and remember to destroy what you do not
                    take off your fallen adversaries. So, let's see, soloing at levels 5-8 can be quite
                    profitable, as long as you stay away from the Llrodd Skeleton near the well, the
                    shadowknight in the room next to the Llrodd, and getting double and triple teamed. Oh
                    yeah, I forgot, GET BOUND in Freeport. It will save you headaches, and you'll get quite
                    good at making the run from Freeport to Befallen. :P Putrid Skeletons can be tough for
                    casting classes early on especially if coupled with a regular or a few giant rats.
                    Remember to con everything, and run to the zone when you are overmatched. Clerics Note: A
                    huge part of hunting in Befallen is the temptation to nuke every walking corpse with Ward
                    Summoned. Don't. I'm sure if you are playing a cleric you've read somewhere how to save
                    your mana for healing, rather than offense. No where is that theory applied better than
                    when fighting Undead masses. You can solo decently in Befallen with your normal blunts,
                    adding a Ward here and there. The nice thing about Divine Intervention is that it's
                    relatively cheap mana-wise, so you should always have that handy. When I hunt in Befallen,
                    and I have full mana, I can routinely take things down that con red, even up to 4 levels
                    above my own. This is why we are clerics. We punish the dead. I do not recommend this
                    unless you know the lay of the land, and are very good at timing your ofensive spells in
                    combat. Though there's nothing like lighting up a greater skeleton with 4-5 Wards, it
                    seriously hampers your efficiency in achieiving experience. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>You seek a deeper revenge (Levels 9 through 14).</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">You been clobbering the denziens of the first level,
                    avoided the trains of Dread Bones, Ice-Bones, and Acolytes, and even managed to take down
                    that &quot;gatekeeper&quot; shadowknight and picked up his key. You are curious about what
                    lies behind the locked door. You finally figure out how to operate the door with your
                    newfound key (ugh! that took me 15 minutes the first time :P), and you venture inside.
                    Approaching the crumbled staircase, you see a Bard running for his life with 5 uglies
                    chasing him up the stairs. You turn tail but you are slain by (insert tough Undead here)
                    before you can fumble with the darn key and run to zone. That was my first experience with
                    the second floor. Ok, as a spellcaster, I IMPLORE you to group before venturing
                    downstairs. With that in mind, we enter my group strategy section of Befallen. This
                    dungeon is a dangerous place, but with efficient grouping skills and competent members,
                    you can level up like no other place I know of. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Formation of your crusade.</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Begin by sitting in the entrance to Befallen and shout
                    around for a couple of folks to join you for some undead bashing. Before entering, make
                    sure you have at LEAST one tank, and at LEAST, one cleric or druid (the slacker healers).
                    This is definitely one of the few places where a wizard can be substituted for with a
                    cleric (Cleric's Wards rival Wizard's Bolts, but for other creatures, I have to give props
                    to wizzies, obviously). Ok, game on. You want as many clerics as you can get your hands on
                    for four fairly obvious reasons; to take the mana load off from 1)buffing, 2) healing, 3)
                    creating food and water and 4) burning with wards if the situation calls for it. Those
                    four functions create a large burden on the cleric to manage his mana efficiently, and to
                    meditate whenever possible. A great idea is to stake out one of the rooms on the second
                    level, and send your tank to pull things into your room. This is a good way to start each
                    battle, as each group member can flow into his/her role easily, if all the uglies are on
                    the tank. Watch for spawns inside your area, however, and idiots who get in over their
                    heads and train a bunch of uglies through your room while you all have your noses in your
                    books. Nothing creates panic more than to see a MOB show up while you are all at half or
                    less mana, or even worse, tanks at half or less health. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A couple of final thoughts...</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Be courteous to your fellow man (elf, dwarf, etc.) and open
                    that 1st level door for anyone shouting for help. Whether the person is in need of an
                    escape, can't find their key, or is retrieving their corpse, they need someone to open the
                    door. Also, if someone trains a bunch of baddies up to the zone point, and there's 5 or 6
                    people medding in that corridor, get your nose out of the book and be a sport; join the
                    fight. You can always zone out of the fray if that ghoul is giving you a good once over.
                    Apologies to those above 15th level or so, but I haven't been able to research the third
                    floor much. When I do, I'll append this guide. As always, let me know what you think. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Updated: 9/14/99</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Alot of time has passed since writing this guide, and I
                    should have appended it sooner. I have now reached the 20th level, and can fairly say I
                    have become an expert at Befallen. Before I wrap up the Third Floor, I'd like to thank all
                    of you who emailed me with tidbits of information. There are too many people to list, but
                    you know who you are! </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Back into the depths of Befallen...</b> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now you have decided to penetrate the deepest part of this
                    Undead lair, and you need to know what lies ahead. Well, let's start with the door, shall
                    we? As you approach the steps down to the 3rd locked door, there is a spawn at the top of
                    the stairs. This spot is usually occupied by a greater skeleton, but can be a variety of
                    ugly things, with the toughest being a necro acolyte, ghoul, or ice boned skeleton, and
                    the weakest being a large skeleton. As you go down the stairs, there is a spawn point on
                    both the left and the right of the door. These points can bring the toughest, non-special
                    MOB in the whole dungeon; the theurgist. These are the head necromancers and are between
                    17-20 in level. They are very hard to solo when they have a pet, I would recommend only
                    taking them in when in a group; their DoTs are wicked and they can hit fairly hard for
                    being casters. Other spawns at this point include ice bones, greaters, ghouls, and lesser
                    necros. Keep in mind that the cruelest of skeletons lurks behind the door, and will open
                    the door and come to the aid of its comrades. This fiend I speak of is the elf skeleton,
                    around level 20, and hits hard and fast. This creature is important to dark elves as it
                    drops pieces of mallet for the Thex Mallet quest. Be wary of the elf if you are under 18
                    or a caster, because it can rip you up. This is a good place to mention the level range of
                    the third floor. I would suggest that you wait and get a full party of 16s or 17s before
                    you even attempt to cross the threshold here. A wiser choice would be several 18s or 19s
                    IMHO. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With the glass key from the Ogre SK in hand, you open the
                    third door and arrive at the elf skeleton's spawn point. Move fast, for that fiend spawns
                    rather quickly. Proceed down the hallway and feel around the right wall for a secret door.
                    Here you can walk through a portion of the wall, and are quickly met with two spawn
                    points, one behind a chair, and the other in the middle of the small room. Conquer these
                    foes and continue on to a vast cave-like chamber. There are two or three weak spawn points
                    at the edges of this room, but they are slow. This is a good thing, because you have
                    arrived at the most coveted spot in the third floor. This is a relatively &quot;safe&quot;
                    place to rest and meditate from your battles. I use the word &quot;safe&quot; with caution
                    as no one, no where can be completely safe, so still be careful. There are three rooms for
                    you to choose from as you sit against the back wall of the cavernous room. To the left,
                    there are two special spawns, in addition to several normal spawns. This room contains the
                    thaumaturgist, a level 20-22 necro very much like the theurgists. It is this thaumaturgist
                    which drops the coveted Gossamer Robe (AC 8, casters only, white appearance). The Gossamer
                    Robe is the rare drop, and the common drop is the thaumaturgist's robe (AC 5, AGI +3,
                    casters only, brown appearance). These robes fetch a very nice price: Gossamer gets
                    between 30-60pp in the Freeport Area (I got nearly 100pp in the Qeynos area) and the Thaum
                    Robe draws between 20-40pp. That's not all. She usually drops the Dagger of Marnek (weak
                    damage/delay, but INT +3, +15 vs. Magic, necro only) which can get around 20pp as well. If
                    you think that's plenty for this room, there is still Priest Aziz, a rare spawn who drops
                    the blackened wand, which is part of a monk quest. He's a tough necro, a little stronger
                    than the thaum or the theurgists, but well worth the story. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The middle room contains the broken well. This is the room
                    you fall into when you jump down the well near the Llrodd skeleton on the first floor.
                    This is a great way to reach the third level if you are trying to join a party already
                    down camping, or even when invisible to drag your corpse to the door for an easier rescue.
                    So don't be surprised if a group tells you to meet them on the third floor, and to just
                    jump down the well...just make sure you TRUST them...hehe. There are two spawn points in
                    the well room, as well as one leading into the well room, just FYI. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The room on the right is the reason you see 25+ level PCs
                    in Befallen, for there spawns the Troll SK with the BBC, or Bone Bladed Claymore. The
                    Troll, IMHO, is a pussy cat in full plate. I've never had a problem killing him, even when
                    I was 16 or 17 in a full group. Yes, is harm touch is rough on a caster type, but if you
                    are prepared to heal that unlucky chum, you'll be allright. There are about 5 spawn points
                    in the short hallway and in the SK room, so it is best to keep it clear while waiting for
                    the Troll to spawn. I have heard rumors that the Troll will only spawn WITH the BBC once
                    or twice per RL day. Who knows. I've spent 5 hours at a time down there, and killed the
                    troll about 6-7 times, and got one BBC. I'm sure others have had different experiences. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The rest of the third floor consists of 4-5 rooms that
                    contain normal spawns, save one. There is a female drow SK which drops the barbed
                    leggings, but I have never seen her. Most of the time, when someone wants to hunt the
                    third floor, they are talking about &quot;camping the thaum and SK.&quot; Always be wary
                    of trains, and have a great time! You will see less high level campers with the new
                    &quot;Yield&quot; rule, so you should make some very good money down here for your level,
                    and come out with a couple of nice items to sell/trade at your server's next bazaar to
                    boot! </font></td>
