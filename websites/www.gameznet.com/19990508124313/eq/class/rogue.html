<p></font><font face="Verdana" size="1">So.. you want to be a Rogue do ya? </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Maybe this guide will help you on your way... and maybe
it will help you on another choice for a class. All in all &#133; this guide was written
to help any adventurer out weather rogue, cleric, mage, or any of the other classes. </font><u><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Race</font></b></i></u></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">So... the first question is... what race do you want your
rogue to be?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Halflings are said to make the best rogue... with
naturally high dex and agility... as well as decent strength and stamina. They also wear
small sized armor... which is lighter and cheaper then both medium and large type armor..
which adds to their playability. They also get infra-vision... which helps on those dark
Norrath nights..</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">My personal favorite is the wood elf, for many reasons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">-First, they are natural rogues by sorts in their high
agility and dexterity make em wonderful at their trade. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">-They also have the option of wearing both small and
medium armor, where a Halfling can only wear small. This plays a greater factor in some
magic armor that is medium&#133; and some magic armor that is small. This allows the
Wood-Elf and Dark-Elves to wear both... which adds to the amount of toys they have access
too. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">-Wood-Elves also have foraging... a rogues best friend.
Foraging helps a rogue stay out of towns and hunt for a long time, and help them get food
when t would otherwise be impossible without the help of other players. Though the
foraging skill does not go up for wood-elves that aren't druids or rangers, the skill it
begins at is adequate enough to supply yourself with food and water.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">- Wood-elves also get infra-vision... which edges them
above the human and barbarians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Dark-Elves come in second in my choice for a rogue... and
nearly are as good as a wood-elf... if not equal to them in diversity. The one thing that
Dark-elves have over Wood-elves is Infra-vision... but their race/class combo makes them
hated throughout Norrath. If you choose to be a thief-type and role-play evil more...
maybe Dark-Elves would be a wiser choice then Wood-elves.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">-Barbarians also have a strength... though many
weaknesses to go with it. The slamming ability of the barbarian class gives Barbarian
Rogues an edge over their counterparts... allowing them to stun their opponents (for a
little damage) and then whirl around for a backstab. The slamming ability, however, never
goes up in skill for a rogue.. so you have to be content with 1 - 4 damage with it.
Barbarians also have the ability to wear both medium and large type armor (which makes
them edge out human-type rogues) as well as being an excellent fighter. Barbarians,
however, along with humans are blind as a bat when it comes to night. If you choose a
Barbarian of any type... you need to get a Greater Lightstone as soon as possible, or find
yourself stumbling into camps of monsters and dying often.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">-Humans rogues have two weaknesses. They are limited to
medium armor and have no infravision. If you choose a Human rogue... make sure to read
what I said about Barbarians.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">-I would not recommend a gnome or a Dwarf as a rogue...
though Dwarfs tend to have the stats. They might have the numbers down.. but to me its
hard to imagine a successful gnome or dwarf rogue. They might.. however.. be better Rogues
then humans and/or barbarians... but I'm not too certain. Also Dwarfs never seem to like
Rogues.. although not KOS by the dwarf guards.. it was a very hard time to get a
shopkeeper to deal with you. I ruled out Gnomes fairly quickly just going to Ak'Anon
once... I despise that city. =P Also they never liked me much after I killed all their zoo
exhibits.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Whichever the class, pick the one you want to be by the
area you are in and what type of character you want to be. Being the &quot;Ultimate&quot;
rogue with best stats would lead you to be a Halfling, but that won't help you much if all
your friends are Barbarians. So choose a race with both the class in mind and your
preferences. How you use ability points is another factor, which brings me to my next
Topic.</font><u><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">How to Spend your Ability points</font></b></i></u></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Spending your ability points is really flexible..
depending on what you want to do with your rogue. I'll just basically tell what each stat
does and tell you my preference.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <i><b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Strength</b> - </i>Strength basically affects your
  damage a little bit, but more importantly how much you can carry. If your a small class,
  (dwarf, gnome, Wood-elf, dark-elf, halfling, etc) you want your strength to be at least in
  the 70's... to be able to wear your armor and higher for the medium/large classes...</font></p>
  <i><b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Dexterity </b>- </i>Dexterity supposedly affects
  how often you hit in melee combat, but haven't seen this shown much. Dexterity does affect
  missile/throwing weapons however, so if you are planning on using archery or throwing..
  make sure you have a decent dexterity. Dexterity also determines the rate at which magical
  effects on weapons take effect, so dexterity will play a more important role later on in
  your career as a rogue. Dexterity also slightly affects the usage of your skills.. Such as
  pickpocketing, picking locks and what not. Dexterity is one of the prime Requisites for a
  Rogue... at least thats what Verant leads you to believe.</font></p>
  <i><b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Agility</b></i>- This is the mother of all stats
  for a Rogue, as well as any melee class in my opinion. Agility is the skill that most
  directly impacts your character in his AC.. So the more agility you have the less you get
  hit. (Does wonders when combined with dodging and parrying). A high agility is what makes
  a Rogue a worthwhile melee class. Another Prime Requisite for Rogues here.</font></p>
  <i><b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Stamina</b></i> - Stamina affects your Hit
  Points&#133; as well as how tired you get while fighting. You might want to add a point or
  two here if you see yourself needing more hitpoints, but is totally un-needed in my
  opinion.</font></p>
  <i><b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Intelligence</b></i> - Intelligence, though more
  important for mage-type characters, is an important stat none the less. It affects how
  fast you learn skills... so if you envision yourself with multiple-types of weapons.. you
  might want to add a few points here. I found that an intelligence of 75 lets me learn
  quite quickly... allowing me to learn piercing, slashing, archery (somewhat), and un-armed
  combat pretty quickly without being behind in skill.</font></p>
  <i><b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Wisdom</b></i>- The only thing wisdom does for you
  is affect your resistances slightly. Other then that.. it doesn't really seem to affect
  anything else.</font></p>
  <i><b><p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Charisma</b></i>- Charisma might be important for
  you, because your going to need the edge you can get when dealing with NPCs. All in all
  everyone will hate ya... but a high charisma might help you get your faction up with some
  classes. If you&#146;re a Dark-Elf good luck. =P</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">How to start off...(A guide from 1-20)</font></b></i></u></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Starting off is hard in any class, but luckily its nearly
all the same. You just go out and kill things out in the newbie gardens and scrounge up
some money for basic Equipment. Kill the local ruined-pelt giving animals
(wolf/cats/bears) for patchwork armor and get a tailor (or be a tailor yourself) to make
some patchwork. You also want to stick with that training dagger start off with and get
another rusty/tarnished dagger as soon as possible. Though you might not always use a
dagger... and prefer a spear or other piercing weapon.. a dagger is nice to boost your
skill relatively quick, since you hit a monster a lot more with a dagger, which is a
greater chance to increase skill per fight. This goes for all weapons... find the one with
lowest delay and use that to boost skill. Also lower delay weapons help out on the
higher-level critters in hitting em.. and I seem to do much better with lets say a
tarnished dagger then a tarnished spear on monsters that con as gambles or low tombstones.
Stick to the newbie gardens until at least level 5.. doing some exploring before then to
where you'll hunt next. Always know your surroundings as well, it helps a lot with
locating your bodies. At level 3 make sure you throw a point into dodging. It
&quot;primes&quot; the skill up and it will increase by itself eventually. At level 5 or
6... you should be out of the newbie gardens and maybe a zone away or two. Around these
levels... group with a cleric one or two levels lower then you... both you and the cleric
will gain experience quickly killing off some of the undead around. Also practice some of
your skills while resting and in combat... especially pick pocketing at level 7. You
shouldn't use your practice points much unless its in a trade skill or the
&quot;basics&quot; you MUST spend on skills to start learning them. Also a trade skill
might pop in as well as archery/throwing... where it is wise to spend some points. Save
some points up though... since skills later will need some boosting. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">At level 10... you get your most prized skill....
backstabbing. Backstabbing makes you a viable component in any group, which is when you
should start considering dungeon hunting and being in groups of more then 2 people. When
you get level 10... you might want to consider pumping in a good 15 points into
backstabbing since its a somewhat hard skill to increase quickly. Safe Fall at level 12 is
also a skill that tends to refuse to go up much... so might want to prime it up a bit. You
might also be considering either store-bought leather.. or maybe player-made metal armor
now.. if you have the plat for it. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">At level 13, you get parrying. This skill is a
much-welcomed added defense which lets you get hit less by blocking an attack. Only spend
a point or two here... it eventually goes up by itself. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Then comes the level 15/16 combo. Here you get Double
attack and Dual wield... Which are just add so much to a rogue I can't put it into words.
If you trained up something besides piercing.. such as slashing.. Have your Primary weapon
as a piercing weapon and your secondary weapon as either piercing as well.. or maybe a
minotaur axe or Tentacle whip (The life-tap abilities help a lot), whatever you want.
These two skills tend to have a slow start... so primer them up if you have training
points to spare.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">At level 18 comes another Rogue-specific skill... the Art
of Poisoning. This skill doesn't come to play much til level 20... when you get to make
your own poison. During the beta.. poisoning wasn't in yet (at level 10).. but it seems
like a wonderful skill to have. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">At Level 20.. comes the ability to make your own
poisons.. which will help a lot for that apply poison skill... as well as the last name
that you can have bestowed upon you. Make sure you petition a GM if you want your last
name (unless they changed that). You also get Disarm traps at level 20, which would be
real helpful if there were many traps to disarm. The abilities of a rogue don't seem to
come in too often.... below 20 that is.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Remember that speed is a much needed quality in all your
weapons that you get... Rogues tend to to better hitting a lot then hitting for a lot, but
always have balance between damage and weapon speed.</font><u><i><b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Level 20 and beyond...</font></b></i></u></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">If you haven't been grouping yet... I am surprised you
have gotten this high. now its ESSENTIAL to be grouping. Use your skills to add to the
groups your in and be a viable team member. Some skills, such as Disarm traps and such not
seems like they would be valuable skills, but they come into play during the deep-dungeon
expeditions. Instill Doubt is a nice welcome to your arsenal, causing enemies flee (and
showing their backsides for a nice backstab). Disarm also is a nice skill.. which lets you
take the weapons your enemy is using (adding to the coin purse a lot there). Basically,
your abilities beyond 20 truly increase in the new toys or items you get. A rogue,
probably as much or even more then a warrior depends on the equipment he has a lot... with
the rogue tending to have more cash then the warrior to buy this equipment. The upside to
this, however, is that you get a bunch of cool toys to play with . =P This alone makes
Rogues a much more appealing class then their nearest coutnerpart.. the Monk.. though the
Monk is one of the true masters of avoiding damage, Rogues come in at a close second but
with the added fun of all the nice toys that are available (especially for the
wood-elves... since they can wear both small and medium sizes and quest for a lot of
stuff). Remember to make a lot of friends... since you need em. =P The most important
thing to remember is to have fun, is a game after all.</font></p>

<p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">The Downsides to a Rogue</font></b></i></u></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">There are, however, lots of downsides to a Rogue. They
are hated by most every race, (except Halflings of course), and that makes it a challenge
sometimes. They also don't have the nice abilities of a magic-using class of getting
spells every 4 or 5 levels... so at higher levels Rogues might tend to get a little boring
(unless you can keep getting better and better equipment). They are however more enjoyable
then a Warrior.. as you can see with a high-level backstab skill. They are, however,
limited to 1-handed weapons... which makes it a kind of disappointment damage wise (as you
see all the warriors completely destroying a monster with a halberd or other 2-handed
weapon). Although we dodge melee attacks well, we take some hard hits from spells, making
us weak to some higher level monsters (having less hitpoints then the other melee
classes). This is where a lot of magic/fire/cold/poison/disease resisting magic items come
to affect for the Rogue. Rogues also tend to be a class ignored by the programmers (their
skills are somewhat incomplete and not very usable at times), and that tends to hit them
hard from being truly balanced with all the other classes. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">Your choice of character really is determined by how you
want to play. There is no &quot;best&quot; class, there are no tank mages... which makes
this game all the more enjoying. Rogues can be a worthwhile class, as all classes can be,
and to me they are the class I would enjoy EverQuest the most as. But that is why you have
eight slots.. To explore all the racial and career opportunities provided by each class. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="1">All in all... although Rogues seem to be more popular now
we are in the final... many people may find themselves struggling with a Rogue... as all
classes seem to have, which can make the game frustrating. If you choose the Rogue because
they can pick pockets... your going to be somewhat disappointed with the class in the long
run. If you chose a Rogue because all their abilities and characteristics seems like the
type of character that you would have the most fun with, then the game will be much more
enjoying in the long run.</font></p>
