            <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">Burning Woods</FONT> - Telin Darkforest,
            location positive 3000 positive 3000. Things to ask: What Forest?,
            What Answers?, What Evil?, Whta do you suspect?, What Change?,
            What about Innoruuk?, What action? - He will give you a worn
            note. (Telin Darkforest is a ranger and his faction is Faydark's
            Champions)</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">Greater Faydark</FONT> - Find Faelin
            Bloodbriar, spawns at location Positive 1500, Positive 550. She
            has a place holder which is an orc, can't remember if it is a
            pawn or a centurion. Give her hte note and she gives you Faelin's
            Ring.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">Kithicor Woods</FONT> - Giz X'tin, he
            is kos to you, but if you turn into a wolf, you are safe. He
            spawns at random times from what I can tell, I got him during
            the daytime, so I didn't have to worry about the undead. Give
            him the ring and he will give you a Dark Metal Coin. As soon
            as you turn this in, a level 50 Tier Dal Reaver will spawn and
            chase you. You can kill him or just leave. You don't need antyhing
            else from here.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">Burning Woods</FONT> - Telin Darkforest,
            give him the Dark Metal Coin and he will give you a Worn Dark
            Metal Coin.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">East Karana</FONT> - Athele, location
            is negative 3600, negative 1600. Give her the Worn Dark Metal
            Coin. *WARNING* After giving her the metal coin, you have to
            complete the rest of the quest, up to killing the corruptor without
            stopping, becasue all the spawns after turning in the coin are
            triggered by turning in items. *WARNING* She will give you a
            Braided Grass Amulet for the coin. Find Nuien (spawns near, triggered
            from turning in coin). Give he the Braided Grass Amulet. He gives
            you the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet and triggers Sionae to spawn.
            Find Sionae and give her the Frayed Braided Grass Amulet and
            she gives it back and triggers Teola to spawn. Teola spawns on
            the other side of the zone and will walk to the &quot;gathering&quot;
            You can go find her or just wait till she gets to the gathering.
            When she gets to the gathering and has the Frayed Braided Grass
            Amulet, a Dark Elf Corruptor and two Reavers will spawn. They
            spawn on the mountain range across from the village. It is best
            to have a group of people up there to intercept the Corruptor.
            The 3 mobs will rush toward the gathering and kill everyone there.
            Your job is to kill the Corruptor before the Reavers get to the
            camp and kill everyone. You can kill all 3 mobs or just the corruptor.
            When he is dead, he will drop a Fleshbound Tome. If Athele is
            still alive, give her the Fleshbound Tome and she will give you
            an Earth Stained Note. If you didn't save the camp, then you
            will have to wait for Athele to respawn. Handing her the note
            will cause her to despawn.</P>

            <P><FONT COLOR="#00ffff">Misty Thicket</FONT> - Ella Foodcrafter.

            them food. When you find her, give her the Earth Stained Note.

            it's time to do some foraging! If you were smart and read this

            in Kaladim B, in the Everforge. Follow the story and he will
            ask for a Jade Reaver. Go to City of Mist and kill Black Reavers
            until one drops a Jade Reaver. Take it back to Kinlo and he will
            give you Enchanted Clay. Find any pottery wheel and combine the
            Ancient Pattern, Platinum Speckled Powder and the Enchanted Clay(requires

            to kill.</P>
