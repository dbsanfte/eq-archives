            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            Inner Flame<br>
            <br>
            This discipline adds 4x your base damage to every blow landed for 12 seconds. It is
            important to note that this only adds to your base damage not to your total damage. It has
            a base reuse time of 30 minutes. <br>
            <br>
            Let's take a high end example and assume a monk is using Ton Po's Bo Stick of
            Understanding(dmg 44 delay 40). This will add 176 points of damage to each and every
            landed blow during that 12 minute period. The numbers will be a bit lower depending on the
            damage of the weapon(or your fists).<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Warrior</strong><br>
            <br>
            Furious<br>
            <br>
            This skill will cause you to riposte all attacks against you for 9 seconds.&nbsp; It has a
            base reuse time of 60 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue</strong><br>
            <br>
            Rogues receive no new disciplines at level 56.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight</strong><br>
            <br>
            Spirit Tap<br>
            <br>
            Spirit tap is an upgrade to your lifetap line of spells. It is a 150 hit poit lifetap for
            144 mana. This is the exact same ratio as your level 51 spell with a slightly longer
            casting time but it allows you to tap more hit points at a time.<br>
            <br>
            Life leech is still a life saver but spirit tap will make you more effective at self
            healing if need be.<br>
            <br>
            Steelskin<br>
            <br>
            Steelskin is an upgrade to the level 39 shieldskin. It can absorb a much greater amount of
            damage however. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 hit points.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            It has the same pitfalls as the original however in that it is a one time damage absorber
            that only works for melee damage. It also requires Jasper as a reagent which can run a bit
            expensive to use in every battle.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin<br>
              </b><br>
              Counteract Disease<br>
              <br>
              This spell is an upgrade to the cure disease line of spells. It is
              more effective against higher level diseases that would normally
              take several casts using the older cure disease spell.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Yaulp III<br>
              <br>
              This is of course an upgrade to the Yaulp line of spells. It is a
              self only spell which grants +30 strength and +12 armor class for
              the 18 second duration.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
              Chill Sight<br>
              <br>
              This is a self only ultravision spell. Ultravision is of most use
              to human rangers but can also be useful to elves as well as
              ultravision gives slightly better night sight than infravision.<br>
              <br>
              Greater Wolf Form<br>
              <br>
              Greater wolf form is an extremely powerful spell for rangers. Not
              only does it grant an increase to running speed and changes to
              factions but it also increases ATK by 40 points.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The ATK is perhaps the most useful aspect of the spell as it can
              dramatically increase your damage output over the course of a
              battle.<br>
              <br>
              The weakness of this spell is that it can only be cast in outdoor
              zones and will cancel itself upon zoning.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 57<br>
            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            100 Fists<br>
            <br>
            This discipline will grant the monk haste for 15 seconds. During this period all of your
            attacks will have their speed increased. The base reuse delay is 30 minutes. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Warrior</strong><br>
            <br>
            Precision<br>
            <br>
            This discipline will give you a greater chance of hitting your opponent but has the side
            effect of also allowing you to be hit more often. It is sort of like a reverse evasive. It
            lasts for 3 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            It has a base reuse time of 30 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue</strong><br>
            <br>
            Kinesthetics<br>
            <br>
            The discipline of kinesthetics will grant you instant double attack and dual wield success
            for 18 seconds. This means all four of your attacks will land every time you swing. In
            addition this can also allow you to double backstab. <br>
            <br>
            The base reuse delay is 30 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight<br>
            </strong><br>
            Vampiric Curse<br>
            <br>
            Vampiric curse is a DOT lifetap. It heals you for roughly 200 hit points of damage over
            time. Even if a monster dies you will still gain the hit points. It is by far the most
            efficient lifetap you will ever receive.<br>
            <br>
            That having been said it also is more of a taunt than your normal lifetaps. Because the
            hit poits take a while to be transfered to the caster it is probably not your best bet for
            healing during combat especially when considering the taunt factor.<br>
            <br>
            I would recommend using this spell for downtime healing.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin</b><br>
              <br>
              Superior Healing<br>
              <br>
              This is the last in the line of paladin healing spells. It heals
              approximately 600 points of damage for 250 mana. This is also the
              last in the line of shaman/druid healing spells which makes
              paladins quite effective filling in as a healer.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
              Greater Healing
              <p>This is the long awaited upgrade to the heal line of spells. It
              is the final heal that rangers will ever receive. It will heal 300
              hit points for 150 mana. For perhaps the first time in a ranger
              career you will actually be somewhat useful(although borderline by
              this level)&nbsp; for healing during combat.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 58<br>
            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            Monks receive no disciplines at level 58.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Warrior</strong><br>
            <br>
            Fell Strike<br>
            <br>
            This skill will add four times the base damage of your weapon to your damage for 12
            seconds. For example if you are wielding a Bladestorm(dmg 30 delay 45) you will get 120
            points of damage added on to each succesful attack.<br>
            <br>
            It has a base reuse delay of 30 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue</strong><br>
            <br>
            Blinding Speed<br>
            <br>
            This discipline will haste you for 15 seconds. This means that you will attack much faster
            than normal. <br>
            <br>
            The base reuse is 30 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Shadowknight<br>
            </strong><br>
            This is your final pet spell. It summons a level 44 necromancer pet. This pet can hit for
            up to 47 points of damage and can also lifetap. It is a great damage dealer and can take a
            decent amount of damage before dying.<br>
            <br>
            Nullify Magic<br>
            <br>
            Nullify magic is an upgrade to the cancel magic spell. By this level cancel magic will
            fail to cancel most spells without multiple casts. Nullify magic does a much better job.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Paladin<br>
              </b><br>
            Nullify Magic<br>
            <br>
            Nullify magic is an upgrade to the cancel magic spell. By this level cancel magic will
            fail to cancel most spells without multiple casts. Nullify magic does a much better job.<br>
              <br>
              Symbol of Naltron<br>
              <br>
              This is an upgrade to the symbol line of spells. It adds 525 hit
              points to the selected player but requires an expensive
              reagent(Peridot).<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
            Nullify Magic<br>
            <br>
            Nullify magic is an upgrade to the cancel magic spell. By this level cancel magic will
            fail to cancel most spells without multiple casts. Nullify magic does a much better job.<br>
              <br>
              Shield of Spikes<br>
              <br>
              This is an upgrade to the rangers line of damage shield spells. It
              can be cast on other players or on yourself and will grant a 17
              point damage shield. Any damage done to a player with shield of
              spikes will cause the attacker to take 17 points of damage in
              exchange.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              This may not sound like a heck of a lot of damage when you are
              taking 120+ damage per attack but it adds up. It is especially
              useful when cast on the parties primary tank.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 59<br>
            <br>
            Monk</strong><br>
            <br>
            At level 59 monks receive not one but two new disciplines. I find this somewhat surprising
            since they receive no disciplines at level 60.<br>
            <br>
            Silent Fist<br>
            <br>
            This discipline will allow your next succesful dragon punch/tail rake(for iksar) to do an
            additional amount of damage. It also has a chance of stunning your opponent. The weakness
            of this skill is that many monks have probably not used this attack in some time opting to
            go for the flying kick instead.<br>
            <br>
            It has a base reuse delay of 7 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            Ashen Hand<br>
            <br>
            Using this discipline will cauase the next succesful eagle strike to do an obscene amount
            of damage(appears to do around 8-10x base damage). It has been reported to also have a
            chance of instantly killing your opponent. I have not been able to confirm this in my
            testing but it may have certain level limitations set in place.<br>
            <br>
            The base reuse delay is 72 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Warrior</strong><br>
            <br>
            Fortitude<br>
            <br>
            This skill grants a warrior invulnerability to melee attacks for 8 seconds. This is
            greatfor tanking ultra mobs or for saving yourself in a tough situatino. It does not
            affect magical attacks. <br>
            <br>
            It has a base reuse of 60 minutes. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Rogue</strong><br>
            <br>
            Duelist<br>
            <br>
            This discipline adds 4x the weapons base damage to the amount of damage you do with each
            attack for 12 seconds. This means if you are using a bloodpoint for example(dmg 10 delay
            21) that you will receive 40 points of damage bonus for each attack. <br>
            <br>
            It has a 30 minute reuse delay. <br>

            </strong><br>
            Cascading Darkness<br>
            <br>
            Cascading darkness is the last in your line of darkness spells. It will stack with all
            DOTs other than previous darkness spells.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            This spell can do around 1150 points of damage over a long duration. It also slows as well
            as a snare spell.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The downside to this spell is an extremely long casting time. This means that if you plan
            on using it for fear kiting you need to use it to open your fetch and you better hope it
            is not resisted.&nbsp;<br>

              </b><br>
              Ressurection<br>
              <br>
              This spell allows a paladin to not only ressurect a player(thus
              teleporting them to their corpse) but also restores the majority
              of experience lost(around 90%).&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
              Calefaction<br>
              <br>
              This fire based spell will do up to 450 points of direct damage to
              your opponent. It casts quickly(only a 2.5 second cast time) but
              has a ridiculously long recast delay of 45 seconds.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              If you need to dish damage in a hurry then this spell can be a
              good last resort. The long recast seriously limits its usefulness
              however.<br>

            Aggressive<br>
            <br>
            This discipline will cause you to do more damage on your attacks for 3 minutes. The
            downfall is that it also causes you to take more damage. <br>
            <br>
            It has a base reuse delay of 30 minutes.<br>

            </strong><br>
            Asystole<br>
            <br>
            Asystole is an upgrade to the level 39 spell heart flutter. It will stack with all DOTs
            other than heart flutter.<br>
            <br>
            This spell does 69 points per tick over 10 ticks(one minute) for a total of 690 damage. It
            also debuffs(lowers) your targets strength by 40 points and its armor class by
            approximately 20 points.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            When used in conjunction with boil blood and cascading darkness a level 60 shadowknight
            can DOT for around 2300 points of damage in addition to their other abilities.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Drain Spirit<br>
            <br>
            Drain spirit is the last in your line of lifetap spells. It lifetaps for 226 points of
            damage for 189 points of mana. This is a 0.836 ratio compared to the 0.973 ratio of
            previous lifetaps and the 1.125 ratio fo life leech.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The weakness of the spell is it's long casting time.<br>

              Resolution<br>
              <br>
              This is the last in the line of a paladins courage-&gt;daring line
              of spells. It adds 250 hit points and 15 armor class to the
              targetted player.<br>
              <br>
              Shield of Words<br>
              <br>
              This is the last in the line of a paladins armor line of spells.
              It adds approximately 32 armor class to your target.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Ranger<br>
              </b><br>
              Enveloping Roots<br>
              <br>
              This is an upgrade to the grasping roots line of spells. It roots
              your target in place for a longer duration of time and also does
              up to 110 points of direct damage when cast.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              One can argue over the merits of root vs. snare for hours. The
              bottom line is that snare is the spell of choice in most cases.
              Root however can be quite useful for crowd control or if in a
              crowded area.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The crowd control useage involves the ranger dragging a mob away
              from the party and then rooting it. The ranger can then return to
              the battle and hopefully root will buy the party enough time to
              kill the other mobs or at least enough to do a decent amount of
              damage.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Thorncoat<br>
              <br>
              Thorncoat is the last in the line of the bramblecoat line of self
              only buffs/damage shields. It adds 32 points to your armor class
              and also acts as a long lasting 5 point damage shield.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <strong>In Conclusion<br>
            </strong><br>
            In my opinion the majority of hybrid complaints are coming simply from grass is greener
            syndrome. There are a few areas however where hybrids have legitimate gripes such as the
            lack of quality spells on hybrid armor in comparison to melee armor.
              I think that this is an area that perhaps deserves some looking in
              to.<br>
              <br>
              While I do not play a ranger very often I must agree that from the
              outside looking in it appears that the ranger class is the one
              most shaken up in expansion. I am not saying that I believe that
              rangers are underpowered. I still think it is a fine class.
              However there are a couple of areas that might merit looking
              into.&nbsp; These would include the defensive skill caps set upon
              rangers and the recast delay on calefaction.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It might be wise to replace calefaction altogether with a new
              ranger only spell. Not only is the recast delay limiting but the
              spell is less mana efficient than the level 52 firestrike. I think
              that a level 59 ranger deserves a bit more than that.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              I have no problem with rangers receiving less defensive skill
              points per level than shadowknights or paladins. Shadowknights and
              paladins currently receive 3 per level post 50. I think that 2
              points per level or even only 1 per level would be a benefit to
              the ranger class. 1 per level would cap their defense at 210 which
              would help a bit. Let's not forget that they also have quite a bit
              less armor class on their tolan's darkwood or thorny vine armor.
              The two of those combined make rangers very poor tanks. <br>
            <br>
            There are also certain scenarios where a melee class is much more valuable than a hybrid.
            I think these cases are few and far between however. I also feel that hybrids need to
            accept their role as a hybrid and not expect to be as good as their parent class in what
            their parent class does. Hybrid advantage lies in their flexibility.
              I still feel despite the problems that are alluded to by many that
              hybrids are very fun to play and very powerful
              post-expansion.&nbsp;<br>
