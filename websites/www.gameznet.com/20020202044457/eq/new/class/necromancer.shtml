     <p align="left" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Necromancers
     delve in the dark art of animating and mastering the dead. The life of a
     necromancer is one of isolation. You will be treated poorly by most NPC's
     that view&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that your black art as evil. It will not be
     uncommon to be shunned by your own race(unless you are a dark elf). The
     necromancers guilds are often underground or outside of town. Perhaps it is
     the summoning of undead that these mortals fear, or perhaps it is your
     somewhat sizeable amount of power.<br>
     <br>
     Many races can be necromancers including humans, dark elves, gnomes and
     erudites. Dark elves are probably the best choice even though an erudites
     base intelligence is a few points higher. This is due to the fact that
     necromacners are not only accepted but they are embraced by the dark elves.
     While necromancers of other races will have problems finding places to shop
     a dark elf necromancer will feel right at home in Neriak.&nbsp;<br>
     <br>
     Many players tend to think of necromancers simply as masters of the undead.
     While they are in fact the true masters of undead beasts they also feature
     one of the widest variety of spells in the game. To fully understand all of
     the spells which a necromancer has at his disposal we will group the types
     of necromancer spells below.<br>
     <br>
     First and foremost are the pet summoning spells. Every circle you will
     receive a new summoning spell. These pets are vital to your soloability.
     There are two popular tactics associated with using your pets.<br>
     <br>
     The first tactic is most effective at lower levels and all but suicidal at
     higher levels. This tactic is to firstsend in your pet to attack the
     monster. While your pet is tanking the monster you will get off your DoT
     spells(not many at lower levels but the lost grows as you go). When your
     pet gets down to about half health you will run and and share the damage
     load with him. You can always heal yourself with your lifetap spells so
     this is a rather effective tactic.<br>
     <br>
     The second tactic is less effective at lower levels but is the safest
     tactic at higher levels of play. This is to once again send in your pet to
     tank the monster. Once again you will fire off all of your DoT spells as
     quickly as possible. You will then use your offensive spells until you get
     low on mana. Heal your pet as well as you can and then meditate during the
     battle. The reason you will not personally enter the battle is because you
     will not last long with a high level monster striking you for 90+ points of
     damage and your melee capabilities are going to dish a lot less than you
     would be able to by meditating and launching spells.<br>
     <br>
     Now that we have covered summoing spells we will cover the spells which
     will be your most effective offensive spells under most circumstances.
     These are damage over time spells(DoT). These spells have a great damage to
     mana ratio however it will take a couple of minutes for them to do full
     damage. These spells are very effective when used in combination with your
     pet. Most importantly necromancers receive four seperate stackable lines of
     these spells including the heat blood, clinging darkness, poison and heart
     flutter lines of spells. When you stack the four of these together you will
     be very effective in a long fight.<br>
     <br>
     The most unique line of spells that a necromancer has are your lifetap line
     of spells. These spells have two effects. First they do direct damage to
     your opponent, and second they take those hit points and use them to heal
     yourself. There are two types of lifetap spells. The first is the lifetap-&gt;lifespike
     line of spells which can be used from long range. Second is the vampiric
     embrace line of spells which are more effective but require you to actually
     touch your opponent(without wielding a weapon).<br>
     <br>
     Another interesting type of necromancer spells is the siphon spells. At
     level 1 you receive siphon strength which not only weakenes your opponent
     but it also strengthens you. Higher strength will raise your ATK rating
     which is still quite useful at lower levels. Weakening the monster will
     mean that you or your party will absorb a bit less damage over the course
     of a fight which is always a good thing.<br>
     <br>
     Necromancers get several buffing and utility spells which most mage types
     do not. These spells can be beneficial to other party members. Spells
     included in this category are endure spells, cure spells and even spirit
     armor(an armor class buffing spell). The dark empathy spell will allow you
     to heal others while taking hit points away from yourself. This makes you
     more useful to a party even though your DoT spells will be less useful than
     when solo. This is due to the fact that a well balanced group will kill a
     monster too fast for DoT to take full effect.<br>
     <br>
     The ward-&gt;expulse-&gt;dismiss-&gt;expel-&gt;banish undead line of spells
     make necromancers the ultimate undead slayers. They receive these spells
     one circle later than their cleric counterparts however necromancers
     commonly have much higher intelligence than a cleric has wisdom. This extra
     mana means that necros will never be much behind their cleric counterparts
     even in the levels when necromancers are one spell behind.<br>
     <br>
     Adding to their undead mastery are several undead utility spells such as
     the calm line of spells for use versus undead, the hungry earth(undead
     root) spell and the charm undead line of spells.<br>
     <br>
     As if undead mastery wasn't enough necromancers can also cast anti-summoned
     spells all the way up to the expel summoned spell. These spells are
     extremely effective versus summoned foes such as elements.<br>
     <br>
     Just when you were beginning to think that you had too much power already
     the charm spells will begin to appear. Necromancers can not only charm
     undead beings but also(at a later level) living mobs. Some view charm as a
     mere parlor trick however it can be very effective in the proper
     situations. The weakness of charm is the unpredictable(and often short)
     duration.<br>
     <br>
     The word of shadow line of spells are area effect spells which center
     around the casters. I honestly would not recommend using these spells
     unless you are attempting to finish several monsters at once. Once you use
     these spells the monsters will often all turn and attack you. Necromancers
     usually don't have enough hit points to sustain this kind of offensive
     onslaught.<br>
     <br>
     The locate corpse spell which you receive at level 1 will make you a
     popular person in large outdoor zones. It is often hard to find ones corpse
     in outdoor areas and this spell will make your life easier. If you click on
     a player and then cast this spell it will point you in the direction of
     their corpse if it is nearby.<br>
     <br>
     The level 8 shadow step spell will be very useful for those situations when
     a monster begins pounding you a bit too much. It will teleport you a nice
     distance away and hopefully allow your group members a chance to taunt him
     off of you in that time.<br>
     <br>
     More important however is the level 16 feign death spell which will make
     the monster believe that you are dead(while you lay motionless). When
     successful this will buy you the time to heal up or to allow the monster to
     back far enough away for you to run or gate.<br>
     <br>
     Many useful necromancers spells are self only however. These include being
     able to grant yourself infravision and the ability to see invisible foes.
     Necromancers receive damage shields via the grim-&gt;banshee aura lines of
     spells. These damage shields are self only however. Necromancers also get
     invisibility at a relatively low level(8). Once again this is a self only
     spell. Breath of the dead will remove the need for air and acts as a water
     breathing spell.<br>
     <br>
     One of the largest weaknesses of necromancers is the lack of root spells.
     You will not be able to root living beings until level 34. Your darkness
     line of spells(engulfing darkness etc) will slow your opponents noticeably
     however and will need to act as a poor man's root spell in the meantime.<br>
     <br>
     Another weakness is the lack of good direct damage spells. Your lifetap
     spells and poison bolt will be your best direct damage spells throughout
     most of your career as a necro.<br>
     <br>
     All that having been said I feel that necromancers are perhaps the most
     interesting class in the game(right up there with druids, enchanters and
     bards). You can do a little bit of everything. Necromancers are probably
     the most suited class in the game for solo play. With recent changes your
     pets will no longer take a share of experience in a party unless they dish
     out the killing blow. This makes necromancers(and magicians) a much more
     viable option for group play than they once were. There was a time when
     necromancers were viewed as a great solo class who was often not on a
     groups &quot;must have&quot; list. At this point they are not only a viable
     solo class but also one of the more useful classes for group play as well.<br>
