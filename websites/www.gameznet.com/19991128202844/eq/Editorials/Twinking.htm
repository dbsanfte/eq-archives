                        <td>I was in black burrow last night when
                        I noticed a few people in steel plate.
                        They were level 5, so I said, ah
                        twinkies. Now normaly I have nothing
                        against it, but something struck me as
                        odd, they were the only 2 people in an
                        area where there are usally 5 or so. I
                        decided to dig a little into this. I
                        created a new character, leveled him to
                        level 2, and went into black burrow. Upon
                        entering the room, I asked if I could
                        join into the rotation. The 2 in steel
                        said no, leave you idiot. I said, there
                        are 5 monsters that spawn here, I'm sure
                        you can share, one said no, we can't, and
                        logged off. I wondered where he went. I
                        found out soon enough, he had gone on his
                        higher level char, and began to kill
                        anything that spawned. I then just left
                        the room, and they began to insult me a
                        few times, called me a few names, nothing
                        too big. The thing that upset me was,
                        that if you are a twinked char, people
                        usally know you have a higher level, but
                        if you use your higher level as a way of
                        saying, get out of this room it is mine,
                        then you are ruining the whole effect of
                        a newbie area. It doesn't matter how
                        twinked you are, for all I care you could
                        have a crimson robe of whatever, but you
                        are still a newbie character, and you
                        have to live up to being one. You are not
                        a level 50 wizard or what ever, you are a
                        newbie. A newbie can't use a 1100 dmg
                        spell to get other newbies out of the
                        area. No, they have to live with what
                        they have. If you are twinked, you aren't
                        supposed to just say, oh you can't kill
                        these or I will go on my high level
                        character and kill them all so you can't
                        have any. You are supposed to take up and
                        live the rules of the area, as a newbie.
                        Not as a level 50 wizard bully, but as a
                        level 10 newbie fighting the monsters you
                        are supposed to be fighting. I feel that
                        if you are going to just use your higher
                        level to keep people out of the area,
                        then it is pointless to even make a new
                        character. The world is set by an eco
                        system. If you ruin an area, the world
                        takes damage. So if you are going to
                        twink a character, please play the
                        character in the sense of the character,
                        not as the higher level.<br>
