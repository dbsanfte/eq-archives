<br><br>


I don't know what it is,  I don't know why I feel this well, nor why 280 000 other human beings feel like this but one thing is for certain:  There's something about Everquest.  After my "Final Farewell" I was able to successfully quit Everquest mostly thanks for a barrage of new games that came out during the "cold turkey" period (<a href="http://www.gameznet.com/reviewz/rpg/diablo2-1.shtml">Diablo 2</a>) and a fantastic one afterwards, namely <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/reviewz/rpg/cronocross.shtml>Chrono Cross</a>.  Well both of those games are at least partially beaten… I haven't gone through all 3 modes in Diablo due to sheer boredom, and I haven't seen all 9 extra endings for Chrono Cross because I have been playing that game 10-hours a day for the past 3 weeks.  However as I sit here tonight, bored out of my skull, I found myself going back to my compulsions from the past year and a half of my life:  Opening my browser, going to Casters' Realm, going to the Vault, and finally checking what updates JC has done on our own site, EQ'Lizer.  It was then that I found myself actually contemplating re-installing the game, and logging back on.  I will apologize right away for the bad movie and other remarks that will undoubtedly make it into this little editorial (just look at the title!)
<br><br>
I cannot…. I will rephrase, will not get back into Everquest.  I won't let myself.  It is just an addiction that takes up too much time.  I do admit that if building your character was not a full time job I would probably still be playing the game to this day, despite all of the issues I outlined in my <a href=http://www.gameznet.com/eq/Editorials/farewell2.html> Final Farewell</a>.  However it is because of my compulsions tonight that I am going to go over and explore just what it is about Everquest that draws me, and 279 999 other people to it.
<br><br>
The first thing I thought of is the sheer coolness factor that you experience every time you play.  I love having an alter ego that casts powerful magic, and going back to Crushbone to obliterate armies of orcs with my level 50+ is undeniably rewarding.  That is just plain fun, as much as the newbies do complain ;) Summoning that "crappy" level 49 enchanter pet and daring D'Vinn to hit me (baby one more time) to cackle in glee as my minion gives him a spanking is about as good as it gets!  I think it is the sense of power that people get when having a high level character, because you have worked hard for it.  You can go back to your roots and say, take that Dorn!  You have lived the life and now you are rewarded for it.  It is a real shame how bad 51+ is becoming with the whole full time job deal (and yes, it is very much a full time job for those that don't know) because I would LOVE to have a few level 60 characters.  That would be tons of fun.  The simple fact is that leveling in Everquest is not fun but it is a means to an end.  The things that you do when your character is "maxed out" are the things that make Everquest a truly fun game:  And the drive to get there is what is so addictive to a certain extent.  I also thing the "big boom" theory comes into effect here (yes, I made up this theory, so bare with me).  The theory is simply that people want to be able to do the really cool things that they have been looking forward to.  As a newbies you see the possibilities in front of you and you really look forward to them.  Even when the game was first out and newbies had no idea what was in store for them, they imagined (or KNEW) how cool high levels would be; I know that I always dreamed of that 40' tall pet that would unleash a whole load of whoop-ass on whatever I told it to!  Wizards look in awe as they see their more experienced brothers shooting sunstrikes for 1615dmg, for example.  A bard would look at a higher level bard zooming past at the speed of light… not looking at 'em for very long hehe.
<br><br>
Now  that I'm thinking, the part about social interaction comes to mind.  Ok, so it isn't like I'm going to a party, and lets be honest:  We would all prefer to go partying than play EQ, however various things restrict that…  Weeknights, alcohol tolerance (which is undoubtedly less than your ogre warrior's) or those unfortunate sods that just don't have any friends.  Now if you have ever turned down a party to keep playing Everquest I would kindly ask you to smack yourself.  Good.  Now that that is out of the way, here I go on social interaction in Everquest.  I said earlier that leveling was a means to an end and this is very appropriate here as well.  As you level you will meet other people and chances are you will meet a group of friends eventually, beit in the guild or just a regular group.  When it gets to plane runs, or to the extreme Veeshan Peak runs -  hell for that matter just drunken racing through Kelethin - the focus of the event is just a group of friends having fun together.  I remember having fun like this in Meridian 59, and the Realm (which was not much more than a chat room with some fighting) it just didn't involve a fully immersive 3D world and an addiction that is regarded as significantly more potent than crack.  It is this social interaction that makes the game world into a gaming community:  The biggest one for that matter.
<br><br>
Lastly is what I like to call the "top dog" factor.  If anyone else has seen that cool-screenshot of the new expansion armor on that wood elf chick, they kinda know what I am thinking here…. People want to be the best.  They want to look the coolest and they want to be the strongest.  I know on Rallos Zek, the amazing PvP'ers prided themselves on that fact, and I know that there is perhaps nothing as cool as seeing a half-elf paladin, in full plane or Kunark armor, wielding that fiery avenger.  That, my friends, is nirvana and that is what people work towards.  Image is, in fact everything.  I was the cool- low level bard when I played who pranced around in full lambent just asking to be attacked by some PK.  And ya know what?  I looked damn good.  And ya know what else?  I didn't loose a single piece, and I never lost a fight.  But the thrill of it and the pride of having that armor was what drove me, to play hard, and to have fun.  And I was the top dog of the newbies in Greater Feydark.  Now I have that need again, but this time I want to be the top dog of the server, the most powerful person of my class, or at the very least the best dressed ;)
<br><br>
On a personal note, I never achieved what I always wanted:  A high level paladin.  Perhaps this is the drive that tries to pull be back to Everquest.  Ever since beta I thought that I would be that level 60 paladin (well level 50 at the time) that was wielding the Fiery Avenger, with the best armor in the game, looking slick, and taking down monsters with a swoop of my holy blade.  Obviously the Fiery Avenger didn't turn out to be the uber-weapon of the game that I still maintain it should be.  I've now heard rumors that the new drop of one of those new dragons, green dragon scale, is for a new quest - for the infamous Green Splinted Armor.  Who knows the truth behind that but it would be cool if it was put into the game.  That I guess is what I am saying - the game is about social interaction and pure, unadulterated coolness that you really can't get anywhere else.  A great "old-school" RPG like Chrono Cross or Final Fantasy, can make you feel genuine emotions, but absolutely nothing beats hanging out in Kelethin, impressing newbies and letting them bask in your greatness:  It is a feeling that is simply found nowhere else other than on-line gaming.  I guess I'll just have to wait until Shadowbane to feel that way again, but look out would-be Shadowbane fans:  I'm gunna rule the greatest empire that ever set foot in… errrr whats the Shadowbane world called? And I'm gunna be the most powerful character in the game.  Yeah, right ;)  But I'm gunna be out there trying hehe =)  Well anyway, until next time, I will again slip happily into Everquest retirement and observe from a safe distance;  despite not playing, there is a part of me that will always be looking at what is happening in the Everquest world, just like I've been keeping an eye on Meridian 59 (it was shut down about 2-3 months ago, for those that are wondering) and The Realm (Sierra doesn't own it anymore, but its still kickin).
<br><br>
Your in Our World Now…. Nope, still out of it, and I think it's gunna stay that way!
