While i am in the habit clearing out the mailbox and finishing up things that should have been done months ago I figured I may as well get the new message boards online. This is something that is long overdue. The classic EQ'Lizer message board still remains but there are now a whole slew of new boards hosted at <a href="http://www.gamezportal.com">GameZPortal</a> for each class, each server and several other topics such as Quests, Equipment, Class Comparisons etc. <br><br>One thing that should be noted is that since these boards are on GameZPortal and not GameZNet you will need to register at GameZPortal's(takes 15 seconds) message board to be able to post there. For those who don't feel like registering at GameZPortal the classic message board is still available.<br><br>New Feature: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/base.html">Message Boards</a>.

Alright as promised here is a huge(by current standards at least) quest update. Most of these are new quests that we did not have posted before. A couple of them are updates to older quests. <br><br>All of these quests are verified by me with the exception of Call of Flames. I am not 100% positive if this is the real quest or not. I do believe that it is though from checking information. I have not been able to get anyone to confirm to me that this is in fact the quest though. So take this one with a grain of salt. I'll follow it up a little more and let you know one way or the other soon.<br><br>New Quests: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/barnaclebreastplate.html">Barnacle Breastplate</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/steinofmoggok.html">Stein of Moggok</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/burningrapier.html">Burning Rapier</a>(ROG), <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/qeynosgnollfang.html">Gnoll Fangs</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/cratedelivery.html">Crate Delivery</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/reservemilitiatunic.html">Reserve Militia Tunic</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/shakeystuffing.html">Shakey's Stuffing</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/electrumbladedwaki.html">Electrum Bladed Wakizashi</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/callofflames.html">Call of Flames</a>(RNG).

I keyed in URLs tonight for all of the NPCs listed in the EQCompendium searches over at <a href="http://www.gamezportal.com/eqr">EQ Reference</a>.  Now, when you search for armor, weapons, or miscellaneous equipment, there will be a hyperlink to the appropriate spawn page in the beastiary (assuming the NPC has its own page).  Nothing too phenomenal, but still pretty cool.  <br><br>I'd also like to mention that I'm flying out tomorrow for Mardi Gras 2000 and will be gone for a week of drunken debauchery.  Feel free to email additions or corrections for the spawn guides, etc and I will post them up as soon as I get back.  Groovy.

Today marks the one year anniversary of EQ'Lizer. Hard to believe it's been a year already. My how time flies when your having fun.<br><br>A year ago we were the only site which gave an extensive equipment and quest sections, we were the only site which had spells above level 20 posted for every class. Times have changed. Now you can browse through the net and find any number of sites which offer quests, daily equipment updates, zone guides, spells as well as news and our staff consisted of one person(myself).<br><br>At this time last year the game was on the closing days of beta testing. It had already gone gold and was readying a mid-march release. It has grown and matured much since then. In the initial months we were quite hard on Verant for in my opinion rushing the release. There are still certain moves that I might disagree with but all in all the game is vastly improved from a year ago.<br><br>I just wanted to take the time to thank all of the editors and readers who have been through these gates in the past year. All the editors have done a great job from Iuons to Fyndhorn to most recently Buck Satan and a good number of other editors(such as T and Welor) who are too many to mention. Thanks for making EQ'Lizer the site that it is today and here's to another year in operations.

<p><strong><font color="#f0f0f0">Veeshan Funeral</font> </strong><small>Posted Friday, February 25, 2000 by <a href="mailto:jcsmith@gameznet.com">jcsmith</a></small><br>
I just received word of a funeral that will be taking place on the Veeshan server. Rather than put it in to my own words I will just directly quote the mail...<br><br><blockquote>It is with great sadness that I convey that one of our guildmates has passed away in real life.  Durwood Doowrud (Ron Renza, Age 53) was well liked by many in Norrath and other on-line worlds.  GM Lady Daegarmo of Veeshan has scheduled a funeral event for our guild <Chaotic-Order> and friends to pay last respects.  This event will take place on Saturday, Feb 26th, 3pm Pacific in the Temple of Solesk Ro, by Tazgar.  The ceremony will include Durwood's corpse, a few words said by some of our guild officers, Durwood's body committed to the Lava, a toast with "Gnomish Spirits", and some of us will take a naked lava bath to sacrifice some exp in his honor (He fell in Lava a lot, a personal guild thing).  GM Lady Daegarmo will then transport all to the Ocean of Tears where "Something Special" will happen that Verant was kind enough to do.  All who knew him are welcome to come and pay last respects.<br> <br>Regards,<br> <br>Tazman O'Devillin<br>Level 40 Paladin, <Chaotic-Order>, Veeshan</blockquote>
