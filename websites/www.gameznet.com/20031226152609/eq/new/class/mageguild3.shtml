<P align=left>I have played every race class combo there is but i keep going 
back to my Magician. The magician is one of the harder magic classes in the game 
but you are self sufficient and you can summon your verry own tanks they come in 
a variety and i will tell you about them latter but for now just be assured that 
you are THE class of the game. At lvl one your spell will do a measly 4 to 6 dmg 
but as you go along they are second only to wizards but then agian wizards dont 
get pets to help them out. Your main spells will be your summon spells but DON'T 
rely on them too much rember all summoned items will vanish after you camp out 
for more than 5 minutes. The main damage spells of ours are evocation and 
conjuration they are your bolt , rain , and direct damage spells and can be 
verry useful in groups. When Soloing NEVER use rain the monsters will turn 
agianst you and rip you apart but if you find your self with 2 monsters you cant 
handle leave your pet to die that is why you have him. Soloing is our main way 
of getting experience to gain lvls but if you do like me and solo till lvl 35 no 
one knows you and cant vouch for you in a group till you start and grouping with 
people is a great way to make friends. WORD TO THE WISE : when grouping dont try 
to tank let the warriors monks pallys do that you sit back let you pet melee and 
you hit it with spells. Getting your melee skill up is useless after lvl 16 if 
you melee you die that is that monsters hit too hard for you to even try and 
tank my life at lvl 35 is a measly 530 with FULL BUFFS and i go down FAST when 
trying to tank.</P>
<P align=left>Your pets come in a variety i will talk about EARTH first. He has 
the most HP and does the 2nd least amount of damage at lvl 35 he does 20 to 34 
with melee hits and no damage with his spell but he roots the monster which 
means it CAN'T chase you. Next is fire he hits fastest and has a damage sheild 
(when a monster hits him they recive damage also) His magic atack is weak but he 
uses it often and he has 2 types of regeneration. Next is Water this is the pet 
with the 2nd least amount of life and most damaging magic attack he has 1 type 
of regeneration and can die fast if you find yourself out gunned. The last but 
not least is Air he hits hardest and has a high agility his magic attack may 
stun a monster so he is good agians monsters that can cast spells he also cast 
invisabilty on himself when not fighting so if you lose sight of him he may be 
right there beside you. IF YOU USE INVISIBALITY WHEN YOU HAVE A PET THE PET WILL 
KILL ITSELF. you need gems to summon a pet from lvl 4-12 it is malacite which is 
6 silver per for me and from 12-16 you need lapis luzule which is 1 gold per for 
me from lvl 16-60 you need malacite agian.</P>
<P align=left>the races that can be magicians are Dark Elfs Gnomes High Elfs 
Eurdites Humans . The Dark elf is a bad choice for a number of reasons he is 
hated by almost everyone his intellagence is lacking but he is also good because 
of his high agality and dex. Gnomes are the best they have an experience 
penility but their int is second best they have high agi but have low dex and 
charisma. the high elf is the medium for the Magician they are in the middle on 
everything. The Humans only good thing is they Have an experience 
bonus.</P><FONT color=#ff9900>Nagazel Akeram'Desmaga with the Angels of Fate
