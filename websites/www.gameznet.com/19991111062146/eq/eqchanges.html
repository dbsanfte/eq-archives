            <p align="justify">I&#146;d like to first thank everyone who read and complimented my
            first draft of this editorial. It meant a lot to me. I&#146;d also like to thank
            AllaKhazam for being the only site that actually posted my editorial. I hope I&#146;m not
            totally off base with these suggestions, but from player response, I seem to have my
            supporters. However, these are still just my ideas. I&#146;m only human. </p>
            <p align="justify">( Or High Elf, however you choose to look at it ) ( Chicks DIG the
            pointy ears )</p>
            <p align="justify">Lets get started, shall we? *Deep Breath*</p>
            <p align="justify">Many hard aches have arisen from people looting NO DROP items they can&#146;t
            even use on accident. If the item is NO DROP, and the person looting can&#146;t use the
            item, please don&#146;t let them loot it. If coding this in affects too many aspects of
            the game, perhaps at least highlighting NO DROP items in RED.</p>
            <p align="justify">Party buff toggle - I don&#146;t know about shamans, the king of buffs,
            but even as a cleric sometimes it does get a little annoying ( that is putting it lightly
            ) casting the same buff, on every party member repetitively. Would it be THAT hard to make
            a toggle where the buff takes MANAREQUIRED x PARTYMEMBERS and buffs the entire party?</p>
            <p align="justify">On the note of buffs, the Endure / Resist spells do not last long
            enough. They all fade so quickly it gets annoying having to put them back up.</p>
            <p align="justify">Enemy Poison - This gets me kind of annoyed as a cleric. It seems that
            most high level poisons are dealt in DOT form, not poison form. What does this do? Well,
            it makes all of those poison healing spells you gave us useless. Is there really a reason
            to deal poison in a DOT form instead of making it actual poison that we can cure?</p>
            <p align="justify">City guards are currently the target for easy money and easy EXP. They
            still drop steel weapons, which sell for a significant amount more than fine steel
            weapons. They also seem easy for their level. You might want to stop by Rathe sometime and
            check this out. Seems the way to a fast 50 is also coated with platinum now. </p>
            <p align="justify">Ingame message boards are only in Qeynos and Highpass Hold. Please
            place them in other cities.</p>
            <p align="justify">Many people lose items to bugs in the game, and aren&#146;t given them
            back by the GM, usually due to lack of proof. Exactly how are we supposed to get proof?
            Just so some of you other web sites know, Evil Eye sacks are NOT safe, and anything in
            your 1<sup>st</sup> melee slot that does not attack isn&#146;t safe either. We have had
            many item loses due to Evil Eye Sacks going poof for no good reason.</font><font face="Arial"></p>

            going to waste. Now, I understand you have to upgrade the AI, but placing a few rare
            spawns, and a few named creatures with items never hurt a zone. I found my trip to Kedge
            enjoyable, as I believe many others would.</font><font face="Arial Black" size="1"></p>
            <p align="justify">Permafrost</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> - Behind the Ice Giant
            Diplomat, NOTHING is itemized. It would be nice to see one or two items behind here, or

            <p align="justify">Plane of Fear </font><font face="Arial" size="2">- Toning up the enemy
            difficulty - Good. Making it so enemies can see you from out of nowhere, thus you get
            attacked by too many at once, making the zone near impossible - Bad. Is it THAT hard to
            let people zone in safely? I mean, this was even an idea Verant was talking about for
            awhile, but then for some reason decided not to follow up, and instead just raised the
            monster difficulty. I don't think Verant realizes some of the almost low tactics people
            have resorted to just to do the Fear plane. ( Not that Verant is any better, making the
            zone point unsafe for all ). I could be wrong, but there are two current ways people have
            of &quot;doing&quot; Fear plane. The first way involves waiting on servers to go down, and
            when they come back up, wait on the spawn. Fear plane starts out empty because of a zone
            crash bug in the zone. Secondly, a known way of doing Fear plane is to move everyone in
            your party to a &quot;safe hill&quot; so to speak. Its not a safe zone, its just a hill
            where the fewest spawns walk by. Both methods are also known to fail at times. To my point
            - Verant, make it safe to zone in Fear. I seriously doubt you battle tested the zone after
            you upped it in difficulty. Otherwise, you'd see how much fun it is to zone in.</p>

            in my ENTIRE time in EQ, seen a buggier spell. You CANNOT resist this spell, even when it

            need to do in a dragon fight). Dragons seem to damage the party plenty without their fear
            spell. It seems just to ruin the event and make it so strategy isn&#146;t a factor
            anymore. </p>
            <p align="justify">Secondly, please BACK OFF the dragons Verant! Level 50s seriously don&#146;t
            have that much to do. Please remember to make them doable, and playtest them! With a FAIR
            number of chars. I mean, your servers can&#146;t support THAT many people inside one
            particular zone at once anyway! Verant always seem to forget to up the amount of loot
            dropped by the dragons when they up them in difficulty. The dragon still drops 4 items,
            and splitting them among the slayers is not a pleasant experience. </font><font face="Arial Black" size="2"></p>
            <p align="justify">Dynamic Quests</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> - Near non-existent.
            I don&#146;t want to HEAR this as a solution, because I rarely ever see a dynamic quest,
            and the loot from the ones I have seen have been horrible for the level of the mob. To fix
            this, perhaps you might want to consider a Quest-specific guide class such as the ones
            found on Ultima Online. And PLEASE make the loot for the quest decent. We enjoy a good
            role-playing experience and we thank you for that, but don&#146;t blow it at the end by
            dishing out items that are useless.</font><font face="Arial"></p>
            <p align="justify">Universally needed items</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></p>
            <p align="justify">Every player in the game needs some items, and the rare nature of them
            has caused problems ingame.</font><font face="Arial Black" size="1"></p>
            <p align="justify">Fishbone earring</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> - On approximately
            a 6 hour spawn ( yes we know the spawn time, and yes, every time it is nearing spawn time,
            Qeynos Hills fills with people ready to end poor little Hadden&#146;s life ). </font><font face="Arial Black" size="1"></p>
            <p align="justify">Journeyman Boots</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> - Everyone wants a
            pair, but if you want a pair, you better get in line. Najena is packed with Jboot campers
            all the time. Period.</font><font face="Arial Black" size="1"></p>
            <p align="justify">Glowing Black Stone</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> &#150; Poor
            Qeynos Hills newbies. Not only do they have the Fishbone Earring spawn to deal with, but
            they have to fight with high levels at the decaying ruins because of one item that drops
            there. Such a shame.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;<i></p>
            <p align="justify">Solutions</i> - Place the items ELSEWHERE. You did it with the Najenas
            book, why not do it for these items? OR, how about a Quest for these items since they are
            needed as much as they are? Make the fishbone earring no drop, as it is used as a trade
            item it seems. </p>
            <p align="justify">( WOOHOO! You did an alternative Jboot quest! THANKS VERANT )</p>
            <p align="justify">Make Ghoulsbane NO DROP. There is a serious camping problem on this
            item by people using it for twinking and selling purposes. Make others move out of the way
            for the REAL paladins.</font><font face="Arial"></p>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="justify">Faction</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> </p>
            <p align="justify">Old dueling faction hit still effects many. Some faction we lost is
            near impossible, if not impossible to regain. Not only that, but many high level quests
            involve royally ****ing over your faction. Is this our reward for wanting to do something
            new in the game? Just how many paladins do you actually think won&#146;t want a Soulfire.
            PLEASE make town factions a little more feasible to gain. Merchant faction especially.</p>
            <p align="justify">Aviaks and Centaurs need a faction hit to them. Many people kill these
            creatures for EXP, while the nearby enemies just sit there and watch their own race get
            slaughtered.</p>
            <p align="justify">There is a faction bug in the game where once you have taken so many
            faction hits by a particular faction, you can no longer increase faction in that faction.
            The place where this is most evident is with the Frogloks in Lower Guk. Dying seems to be
            a temporary fix for this bug.</font><font face="Arial"></p>
            <p>Miscellaneous issues</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></p>
            <p align="justify">Wrist pouches and Belt packs need to be wearable</p>
            <p align="justify">If there isn&#146;t a flag to declare FRIENDLY guild wars, with no item
            loss, make one. Many guilds WANT to have a friendly war with another guilds but don&#146;t
            want to risk item loss.</p>
            <p align="justify">Casino games! Card games especially =) Put them in so players can
            gamble with each other at the fine gambling establishments we have in the game. =P</p>
            <p align="justify">Shaman slow spells currently are canceled by Enchanters slow spells
            that are inferior.</p>
            <p align="justify">Fix the NPC multiple harm touch bug</p>
            <p align="justify">Place Enchant Metal spells in Erudin so good races have somewhere to
            get the spells. Place Large sewing kits in Neriak.</p>
            <p align="justify">Why can&#146;t players write in blank books and scrolls? The items to
            do so already exist on vendors.</p>
            <p align="justify">Go LD while trading, and items in the trade window disappear</p>
            <p align="justify">People who leave the group / go LD while the leader is zoning bug the
            group</p>
            <p align="justify">Quivers are currently pointless. Bags are much cheap and hold your
            arrows. Give them a use - perhaps make them fit on the ammo slot and let the bows use all
            the ammo inside the quiver.</p>
            <p align="justify">Let people fish on the boat again</p>
            <p align="justify">When you drop your money or item onto the bankers name ( The one above
            your inventory slots ) the item or cash will disappear. </p>
            <p align="justify">If you go linkdead while holding an item, it may be destroyed when you
            reconnect.</p>
            <p align="justify">Why aren&#146;t pit traps detected as traps? I mean, they ARE traps,
            and Verant uses them much more than any other type of trap in the game. Why can&#146;t
            rogues DETECT them? </p>
            <p align="justify">Please put chat in one window and battle stuff in the other. </p>
            <p align="justify">Wrap the guild names under the names (and/or allow me to turn OFF just
            the guild names if I want). </p>
            <p align="justify">When you revive / resuscitate / resurrect a corpse, and the person
            misses the message or says no, you still miss the EXP from the spell. Please fix this.</p>
            <p align="justify">Fix the friends and ignore list so you can add more than 20 people.
            Make the lists player specific, not account specific. Make /ftell work.</p>
            <p align="justify">Make Inns more of a &quot;Safe&quot; place to be. Put guards around
            them or something. They shouldn't be totally safe, but it is kind of ridiculous how
            dangerous they are currently. Also, you might want to make it so people could buy a bind
            from an Innkeeper for 5p after you made them safe.</p>
            <p align="justify">To solve the bind problem - perhaps a yes / no box to pop up when
            binding someone, instead of making bind zones where people can be bound.</p>
            <p align="justify">Oh, I got a KICK out of this one guys =) This bug is just WRONG. It
            seems when a female's name is rejected during character creation, their breasts get
            bigger. ( This is no joke &#150; I was thinking it was when I saw it myself the first time
            )</p>
            <p align="justify">Lastly, this isn&#146;t real important as a whole, but my cleric put
            more than 50 training points into 2 fields of specialization before you guys fixed it. Now
            neither of those fields will train. Would be nice if I could specialize in Alteration,
            being a cleric and all. </p>
