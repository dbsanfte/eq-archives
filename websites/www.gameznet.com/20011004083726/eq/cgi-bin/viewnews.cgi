<p><strong><font color="#f0f0f0">Patch Day</font> </strong><small>Posted Wednesday, August 15, 2001 by <a href="mailto:greatsmith@gameznet.com">greatsmith</a></small><br>
It came a day late, but here it is! The problems in Kael were fixed: charming there is again possible, and the giants who didn't see invisible the last three weeks (towards Tormax and the arena) will now do so again - be careful. In addition, Celestial Tranquility has had another stacking issue fix. Finally, be sure to look for those newspapers in your home city that popped up a few patches ago. Lots more changes have been put into place on the new PvP server, Sullon Zek, including one that will allow more feasible combat between two players of very different levels. Finally, if you were dying to have a custom helm when they came out, but your class's crown couldn't be made into one, go back and check! From the patch message, it's unclear whether the new crowns will have the same graphics as other classes - you might want to find that out before you go handing it in.<br><br>The full patch message can be found <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/patch.jsp">here</a>.

I haven't been very busy to the visable eye on the site recently, but I've been working off line, doing a lot of quest compiling.  I hope to have around 300 new quests added to our database in the next week or two.  It takes a LOT of time to get these correct and I like to verify if they work or not, as much as I can.  =-)<br><br>I'm also working here and there on getting the spell searches up to date.  Tonight I made sure the cleric spells from level 1 to 24 were all up to date and then I added all the level 29 cleric spells.  I hope to finish up the cleric spells list tomorrow, when I have more time.<br><br>Rashaka Khawn 53 Mnk, Tarew Marr (aka Foramen)

I'm sitting here staring at the daunting task of converting the 10,000 or individual pages of EQ'Lizer to accomodate new adcodes by the end of the month. Our newer pages are a snap to do this for, simply changing an include file. EQ'lizer an older page however and as a result it's going to require a lot more work. The inconsistencies in our ads over time and the way they are listed in the html files makes writing scripts for these rather difficult. <br><br>So I wanted to get your inputs here. We have two real choices. The first is the easiest of the two. That involves changing the adcodes of all of the older pages and keeping everythign running as smoothly as we have for the past several years.<br><br>The second option would involve us updating EQ'Lizer(god forbid) to use the new design we currently use at <a href="http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq">EQ'Lizer v2.0</a>. Currently that page has been used as our news site with EQ'lizer updates thrown in. I could easily modify it to be both however. We could keep classic EQ'Lizer listings and allow you to sprinkle in news if you like as we have in the past. If we go this route it would be a lot easier on our staff here for future updates to the site and it should make navigating the site easier. I would also do some modifications to the design there to make things a bit more simple for those in lower resolutions. The only downside to that is that in order to preserve the links from older pages from breaking you might have to deal with some pages being different looking than others, at least in the short term.<br><br>We aren't nazis here however and I wanted your input. Feel free to <a href="mailto:jcsmith@gameznet.com">let me know</a> how you really feel.
