I keyed in URLs tonight for all of the NPCs listed in the EQCompendium searches over at <a href="http://www.gamezportal.com/eqr">EQ Reference</a>.  Now, when you search for armor, weapons, or miscellaneous equipment, there will be a hyperlink to the appropriate spawn page in the beastiary (assuming the NPC has its own page).  Nothing too phenomenal, but still pretty cool.  <br><br>I'd also like to mention that I'm flying out tomorrow for Mardi Gras 2000 and will be gone for a week of drunken debauchery.  Feel free to email additions or corrections for the spawn guides, etc and I will post them up as soon as I get back.  Groovy.

I have added Permafrost to the list of zones on the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/notsocommon.html">Not-So-Common Spawn Guide</a>.  I didn't list any of the giants or other high level critters enroute to Lady Vox, however, as they are unitemized.  If good screenshots are submitted for some of them tho (the IG Diplomat or Priest of Nagafen for example), I'll post them up.<br><br>Soon, I'm going to break down each of the different Planes in the same manner as the other guides.  I'm very familiar with all of the Fear and Hate spawns, but the PoA is pretty sketchy.  If someone has the time to put together and submit a list of spawns with the items they drop it would be much appreciated.  I'd rather have a good solid listing rather than post incorrect or missing information.

Today marks the one year anniversary of EQ'Lizer. Hard to believe it's been a year already. My how time flies when your having fun.<br><br>A year ago we were the only site which gave an extensive equipment and quest sections, we were the only site which had spells above level 20 posted for every class. Times have changed. Now you can browse through the net and find any number of sites which offer quests, daily equipment updates, zone guides, spells as well as news and our staff consisted of one person(myself).<br><br>At this time last year the game was on the closing days of beta testing. It had already gone gold and was readying a mid-march release. It has grown and matured much since then. In the initial months we were quite hard on Verant for in my opinion rushing the release. There are still certain moves that I might disagree with but all in all the game is vastly improved from a year ago.<br><br>I just wanted to take the time to thank all of the editors and readers who have been through these gates in the past year. All the editors have done a great job from Iuons to Fyndhorn to most recently Buck Satan and a good number of other editors(such as T and Welor) who are too many to mention. Thanks for making EQ'Lizer the site that it is today and here's to another year in operations.

I just received word of a funeral that will be taking place on the Veeshan server. Rather than put it in to my own words I will just directly quote the mail...<br><br><blockquote>It is with great sadness that I convey that one of our guildmates has passed away in real life.  Durwood Doowrud (Ron Renza, Age 53) was well liked by many in Norrath and other on-line worlds.  GM Lady Daegarmo of Veeshan has scheduled a funeral event for our guild <Chaotic-Order> and friends to pay last respects.  This event will take place on Saturday, Feb 26th, 3pm Pacific in the Temple of Solesk Ro, by Tazgar.  The ceremony will include Durwood's corpse, a few words said by some of our guild officers, Durwood's body committed to the Lava, a toast with "Gnomish Spirits", and some of us will take a naked lava bath to sacrifice some exp in his honor (He fell in Lava a lot, a personal guild thing).  GM Lady Daegarmo will then transport all to the Ocean of Tears where "Something Special" will happen that Verant was kind enough to do.  All who knew him are welcome to come and pay last respects.<br> <br>Regards,<br> <br>Tazman O'Devillin<br>Level 40 Paladin, <Chaotic-Order>, Veeshan</blockquote>

The <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/notsocommon.html">Not-So-Common Spawn Guide</a> grows even larger today, as I have added Runnyeye to its list of zones.  The main update, however, is that the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra.html">Ultra Spawn Guide</a> is now accessible via the Beastiary.  It lists the most powerful spawns in the game in much greater detail.  The majority of the information relies on user submissions, so I encourage you to submit the needed info if you know it, as it would be much appreciated.  The Special Resistances field, for example, is blank on each spawn.  Basically, if certain spells are constantly resisted, or the spawn is impervious to some sort of attack, <a href="mailto:eqstaff@gameznet.com">let us know</a> and it will be added to that field.<br><br>At the bottom of each Ultra Spawn's page, you'll see there is a place for three different strategy guides.  I feel that this would be a great place to share tips on how to successfully defeat these spawns with the least amount of casualties (ie. what resistances are best to have, what spells are most effective, etc).  Any well-written guide will be posted up, with credit due.  If more than three guides are submitted, the best three will be posted for everyone to view.  I hope to see as many guides as possible, so please send them in.

Alright. I'm beginning the long process of wading through my mailbox this morning and getting to all these submissions that have been sitting there for the past week or two. Lots of quests sitting in the mailbox and a couple of items. Bear with me as I get to all of these. I'm also working on the spells database as well as the last couple sections of the equipment advanced search engine.<br><br>The quest page is going to need to be revamped pretty soon. It is becoming a rather large load time. We will be splitting it up by zones to make for the smallest load times possible. You will still be able to use the quest database at our <a href="http://www.gamezportal.com/eqr">EQ Reference Page</a> to search for quests or get a complete listing but no more long load times.<br><br>For starters I have posted a new Akanon quest.

Cazic Thule and Najena are now online in the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/notsocommon.html">Not-So-Common Spawn Guide</a>.  My intentions are to finish off all of the dungeon zones first before beginning on the Planes, or any other zone for that matter.  People have been extremely helpful and the guide is starting to really make some progress.  Plenty of levels and screenshots are still need to be put up tho, so keep them coming.  <br><br>The additional spawn guide I continue to work on is what I call the "Ultra Spawn Guide".  It's going to list the all-powerful spawns... basically any MOB that requires an army to defeat.  It will denote a lot more information in much greater detail to each spawn.  I'm still in need of a couple screenshots for this guide if anyone would like to contribute.  If you have Innoruuk, Dracoliche, Cazic Thule, or Maestro of Rancor screenshots please <a href="mailto:eqstaff@gameznet.com">send them in</a>.
