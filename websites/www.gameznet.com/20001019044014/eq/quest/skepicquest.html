          <tr>
            <td valign="top">This quest begins in the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/overthere.html">Overthere</a>
              and results in the shadowknight's particle weapon.&nbsp;<br>
 <font SIZE="2"><br>
              </font>This quest begins at an NPC named Kurron Ni who spawns near
              the docks in Fort Danak. This NPC is a rare spawn so don't be
              discouraged if he is not there the first few times you check for
              them.&nbsp;<br>
 <font SIZE="2"><br>
              </font>Do not worry if you are killed on sight at the fort. Kurron
              spawns near the docks and you will be able to swim or invis
              yourself to get to him. He is also far enough away from other
              NPC's that you do not have to worry about them aggroing you when
              you are there.<br>
 <font SIZE="2"><br>
              </font>If you ask him what he seeks(do not ask him what his
              mission is or he will attack you) and then agree to his terms(tell
              him &quot;I agree&quot;) then he will tell you that he seeks three
              pieces of <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/darkforgearmor.html">darkforge
              armor</a>(helm, chest and leggings) and 900pp.&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"><br>
              <br>
              Before turning in these items you need to gather up a good party
              and have them accompany you. Two groups would be best.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Handing these items in to him will simply gain a raise in
              TrueSpirit faction and he will say that his mission is nearly
              complete. He will reward you with no items. If you ask him what
              mission he will tell you of his treachery and then attack you.<br>
              <br>
              At this point you must kill him. Upon killing him you will find a
              &quot;Note to Duriek&quot; on his corpse. You will need this for
              the next portion of the quest.<br>
              <br>
              NOTE: You MUST first hand in these items or he will not drop the
              note. This has been tested and confirmed.<br>
              <br>
              Duriek can be found overlooking the newbie area in Paineel. He is
              upstairs in the newbie area looking out through the glass. If you
              hand him the note he will tell you a story of his apprentice. He
              will also tell you to &quot;take this for your efforts.&quot; but
              no item will be given. I'm not sure if this is broken or not. I
              have contacted Verant about it with no response. Someone has told
              me that Verant responded to this on a public board saying that no
              item is supposed to be given but I was never able to find the
              thread. Either way you receive TrueSpirit faction and are able to
              continue the quest.<br>
              <br>
              If you ask him what apprentice he will give you further
              background. Tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and
              he will ask you to prove your worth first. Duriek is aging and is
              in need of a <a href="coughelixir.html"> cough elixir</a>. This is obtained via a
              <a href="coughelixir.html"> side quest</a> in
              Neriak.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Upon returning the cough elixir to Duriek he will inform you that
              he was trying to create a corrupted ghoulbane. Unfortunately he is
              no condition to gather the components. His previous apprentice was
              searching for them when he met his demise.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              He needs you to find a tome for him. This tome can be found in <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/thehole.html">The
              Hole</a> on Ratman Guards. The best place to find these guards is
              by taking a left upon entering the first fortress and then take
              another left and pass down past the pool. Between this area and
              the old city beneath it Ratman Guards spawn fairly commonly as
              patrollers.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Beware that these rats are extremely tough. They hit for 370s, are
              very magic resistant and have a ton of hit points. The tome is a
              rare drop on them so you are likely going to have to kill several
              of them to obtain one. Our first encounter with one we had 7
              people and no deaths but we had a high level party and Turgur's
              stuck on the first attempt. In later raids we had as many as 25
              people and might lose 5-8 people each attempt. A lot of it depends
              on if you can get Turgurs or another speed reducing spell to stick
              early.<br>
              <br>
              Handing the Tome to Duriek will grant another faction adjustment
              and will reveal what items he will need to complete the corrupted
              ghoulbane. He requires:<br>
              <br>
              1) Blade of Abrogation from the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/planeofair.html">Plane
              of Air<br>
              </a>2) Soul Leech from Cazic Thule in the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/planeoffear.html">Plane
              of Fear<br>
              </a>3) Ghoulbane from upper guk.&nbsp;<br>
              4) <a href="decrepitsheath.html">Decrepit Sheath</a> from
              a Qeynos <a href="decrepitsheath.html"> side quest</a>.<br>
              <br>
              Returning this items to him will result in a corrupted
              ghoulbane(dmg 16 delay 34 effect dismiss undead sk only 1hslash)
              and will send you to seek out Lhranc in the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/cityofmist.html">City
              of Mist</a>. This item is not much use to a shadowknight of this
              level but it is required for the next portion of the quest.<br>
              <br>
              Lhranc spawns approximately at location 0,0 in the City of Mist.
              This is just before the Reaver area near the large hut with all of
              the Goos. He spawns in the middle hut right past the big goo
              house. He spawns at the bottom and the two NPC's who spawn
              upstairs are not placeholders. Upon speaking with him he will
              reveal what he needs to forge your weapon.<br>
              <br>
              Each of these steps is believed to be a sub-quest although the
              details on these subquests are sketchy. The Will of Innoruuk
              subquest has yet to be found. What is known of the other quests is
              listed in their subquest text(click on through). The items he
              requires are the:<br>
              <br>
              <a href="headofthevaliant.html">
              Head of the Valiant</a><br>
              <a href="heartofaninnocent.html">
              Heart of an Innocent</a><br>
              The Will of Innoruuk<br>
              <br>
              If you hand those items in along with your Corrupted Ghoulbane he
              will forge you a weapon that will cast shadows accross Norrath.&nbsp;<br>
