          <tr>
            <td>Clerics are the most powerful healers in all of Norrath. Clerics are the best class in
            the game at healing and buffing other players. The ability to cure diseases and protect
            players from other dangers is their prime domain. Clerics are the only class in the game
            who can ressurect the dead. They can banish undead in a with their mighty spells that can
            rival those of a wizard. When it is all said and done every party is always in need of a
            cleric. <br>
            <br>
            That having been said if you are considering a cleric you will need to know a few things
            up front. Do not be caught up by the fact that clerics can wear <a href="../equipment/plate.html">platemail</a> and wield <a href="../equipment/ogremaul.html">ogre war mauls</a>. If your primary reason for
            considering a cleric is because you believe they can fight well and also cast spells then
            get that idea out of your mind right away. In <a href="http://www.everquest.com">Everquest</a>
            clerics are not very strong on the meelee side of things. At lower levels(1-12) you may be
            able to stand toe to toe with your enemies healing yourself and getting away with it.
            However at higher levels the life of a cleric is one of a healer. Your duty in a group
            will be to heal, buff, and god forbid ressurect your team members. If this sounds like
            your kind of fun then a cleric is definately for you. If it does not excite you then you
            will probably be better off with another class.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics can don most armor up to and including platemail and they can use most blunt
            weapons. This makes them the best suited of the pure casters and priest classes when it
            comes to meelee. However cleric weapon skills only go up at a rate of 4 points per level
            in comparison to 5 points per level for a true meelee class. In addition to this clerics
            only gain one defensive skill that being dodge(at level 15). Clerics dodging skill maxes
            out at Very Good where a meelee classes dodging skill can raise much higher. In addition
            meelee classes gain parry, riposte and disarm. Meelee classes also receive double attack
            and in some cases duel wield, bash, slam and kick. This means that while clerics can fill
            in as a tank at higher levels they will not be able to actually meelee anything blue to
            death(unless they have a couple people healing and rooting for them and a lot of time to
            spare). This is not only a problem with clerics and combat but with all other casters
            other than hybrids. <br>
            <br>
            The ability to dawn powerful armor such as platemail is definately a plus but it also
            makes decisions tough on a cleric. Plate armor is extremely expensive. Clerics are the
            only non-hybrid casting class which has to not only buy spells but also has to save money
            up for plate mail at the higher levels. This can make a clerics life one of poverty. <br>
            <br>
            As with all other priest classes clerics gain the channeling skill at level 4. Channeling
            allows you to regain your concentration and continue casting a spell if you have been hit
            in the middle of casting your spell. This does not always work and will work very seldomly
            at first. However it is a great skill and will save your life more than once at higher
            levels. It is important to remember to train at least one point in this skill after you
            reach level 4. <p>Clerics also gain meditate at level 8. Once you get meditate your life
            will be much easier as you will have less downtime waiting to regain your mana. It is
            important to remember to train at least 1 point into meditation once you hit level 8 so
            you can begin practicing this great skill. <br>
            <br>
            The last skill which clerics attain is specialization at level 30. Specialization allows
            you to specialize in a particular school of magic. For example you can specialize in
            Evocation and be more powerful using your offensive spells. Most clerics will choose to
            specialize in Alteration or Abjuration which will allow them to be more efficient with
            their healing and buffing spells. <br>
            <br>
            Enough of this boring stuff let's get to the <a href="../spells/cleric.html">spell</a>
            breakdown:<br>
            <br>
            Clerics are the most powerful healers in the game. They generally get their healing spells
            one circle before other priest classes. Meaning that while druids and shamans must wait
            until level 19 to get the heal spell clerics will gain that spell at level 14. Clerics are
            also the only class in the game that gets the complete heal spell at level 34. This spell
            will be very important for fighting the highest level(45+) mobs in the game as it is the
            only spell or ability in the game that can heal a warrior completely at those levels. <br>
            <br>
            Clerics buffing spells are also very powerful. The main strength of a clerics buffing
            spells is the fact that there are three different lines that can be stacked. The
            courage-&gt;center-&gt;daring-&gt;etc line of spells adds both armor class and hit points.
            The holy armor-&gt;spirit armor-&gt;etc line of spells adds armor class. There is also a
            third line of spells the symbol of transal line of spells which grants additional hit
            points though this line requires a spell component. With the combination of these three
            buffs a cleric can buff a player to extremely high statistics that are unattainable with
            the buffs of any other class.</p>
            <p>Clerics have a very useful line of spells that begins with divine aura(at level 1).
            These spells grant the cleric total invulnerability for a brief period of time. I cannot
            tell you how many times these spells have saved my tail. This spell not only can be used
            for self evasion but also will allow you to remain confident in your ability to stay
            behind and heal your party members making sure that they all get out because you know that
            you can divine if things get bad. The higher level versions of this spell(including the
            level 29 divine barrier) not only render you invulnerable but also regenerate your hit
            points and stamina.<br>
            <br>
            Clerics also feature a calming line of spells. These spells can be very useful inside of
            dungeons. Clerics never receive invisibility versus normal monsters(though at level 14
            they do get invisibility to undead) but calm spells can be used as a substitute to
            invisibility if used carefully. Calm can also be used to limit the number of monsters that
            your group will have to face. Say for example you come up against 3 different monsters and
            your group has no chance of defeating all three. You could calm two of them and then pull
            the third out with a spell. Your group will now only have to fight one monster at a time.
            Be careful with these spells however becauase if the monster resists he will be very angry
            and will charge straight for you.<br>
            <br>
            As we mentioned at the beginning of this guide clerics are the only class in the game
            which can raise the dead. At level 29 clerics gain revive which basically teleports a
            player back to his corpse saving him a lot of travel time and potential danger. The level
            39 and level 49 variants of the spell not only teleport the player to his corpse but also
            restore a portion of the experience that the player lost upon death. This is the one line
            of spells that truly gives clerics their own identity. <br>
            <br>
            Clerics are also mighty warriors against undead foes. Clerics offensive spells versus
            undead are by far the most powerful versus these beasts at the early levels. Necromancers
            also get these same spells but not until a circle after the clerics. Undead are plentiful
            in the game and frequent many dungeons including <a href="../zone/befallen.html">Befallen</a>,
            <a href="../zone/najena.html">Najena</a>, <a href="../zone/unrest.html">Unrest</a>, and <a href="../zone/lguk.html">The Ruins Of Old Guk</a>. If powerleveling is your game then you
            will be happy with a cleric if you stick to undead dungeons. At higher levels(24+) wizard
            spells begin to become just as efficient versus everything as clerics are versus undead.
            They never become more efficient than cleric spells they do however has a faster recast
            time. This means that clerics at higher levels will still be better than every other
            casters versus undead other than wizards and they will be close to them.<br>
            <br>
            Verus non-undead monsters cleric offensive spells could use a lot of help. There are three
            different lines of spells that work on all monsters.<br>
            <br>
            First there is the stun-&gt;holy might line of spells which stun your opponent for a brief
            period of time and do a small amount of damage. These spells are only really useful versus
            casters or runners and then they are only useful in a group. They have a long recast delay
            which limits their usefulness. <br>
            <br>
            The second line of offensive spells is the word of pain-&gt;shadow line of spells. These
            are person based area effect spells. Word of pain may allow you to take out low blues when
            you first receive it at level 9 however after that these spells are only really good for
            clearing hall trash. Only time you can actually use these spells to kill blue monsters is
            if you have several clerics all casting the same spells. <br>
            <br>
            The third line of offensive spells are the only ones that are really useful. This is the
            strike-&gt;smite-&gt;wrath-&gt;etc line of spells. These spells are the only thing that
            allows a cleric to be able to solo anything blue(non undead) post level 20. These spells
            have a pretty bad damage:mana ratio in comparison to the spells that other classes
            receive. They also briefly stun your opponent. One problem is not only the bad damage
            ratio but also the fact that they have a long recast delay. But by far the biggest problem
            with this line of spells is that they are few and far between. For example strike is
            totally useless around level 6 or so, smite becomes useless in the low 20s, and wrath is
            totally useless by around level 40. That having been said you will still be glad to have
            these spells as they do allow you to stand some kind of a chance against your foes and
            also are great for cleaning up running prey. <br>
            <br>
            One other glaring weakness in the cleric line of spells is the lack of utility spells.
            Clerics basically have two utility spells at their disposal. The first is the reckless
            strength line of spells. These spells are somewhat useful but they pale in comparison the
            a shamans spells. The second is the invigore line of spells which restore a players
            stamina. While this is useful you rarely have the extra mana to spend in a battle on
            restoring ones stamina. <br>
            <br>
            Now let's assume your convinced that you want to be a cleric. What race should you choose?
            As always I feel that race is purely a matter of personal playing style but some races are
            more suited for the task than others. My personal favorite pick would be a <a href="../race/dwarf.html">dwarf</a>. Dwarven clerics are good for several reasons. They
            have naturally high strength, stamina, and wisdom which are very important statistics for
            a cleric. The glaring weakness of a dwarven cleric lies in his agility. I would recommend
            you pour most of your training points into agility and give it at least a score of 80.
            Spread the rest between strength or wisdom.<br>
            <br>
            All in all I feel that clerics are a very good class and one that is neccessary in this
            game. There will always be a place for you in any group. However don't be surprised if at
            higher levels you become nothing more than a band aid. You will spend the majority of your
            time with your nose in the spellbook trying to meditate for mana. This is a challenge in
            itself as you try to balance the amount of mana at your disposal with a players need to
            get healed. It will take careful timing to get the most out of your mana and not waste
            any, all the while you may have some panicked tanks. If this is your idea of fun and
            challenge then a cleric is the class for you. If you would rathe be the disher of
            punishment then perhaps you should choose another class.<br>
