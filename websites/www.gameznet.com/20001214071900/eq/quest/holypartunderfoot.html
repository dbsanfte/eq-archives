            <td valign="top"><font size="2">I'm spilling my guts out here... It's going to be long and
            fairly detailed, I need some typing practice anyway.<br>
            <br>
            I was helping my good friend Riae Soulmender in Dagnor's Cauldron trying to find that
            elusive Bilge aqua goblin when suddenly Riae mentions that he found some exiled Paladin by
            the docks of faydwer. Naturally I felt obligated to go investigate. Off to butcherblock I
            went in search of something interesting.<p>I get to the docks and to my surprise I find a
            friendly young Dwarf fisherman by the sea.</font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>&quot;Hail Dru Razbine&quot;, I said. He responds back about his fishing
            spot and tells me how he needs to fish for food now that he is banished from Kaladim. I
            listen in on his story of woe and how he was stripped of his Cape of Underfoot by Datur
            Nightseer, the leader of the Paladin Guild in Kaladim. Turns out he was chosen for a very
            important task by Datur, failed, and was banished. If only he had a brave Paladin to help
            him. &quot;I think you've found your best hope Dru, let me help you,&quot; I said to him,
            hoping for the chance to redeem my newfound fallen dwarf paladin. He jumps at the chance
            maybe seeing something in me that reminded him of himself back in his younger years. He
            goes on to explain the unfortunate circumstances surrounding what has happened. He was
            sent by Datur Nightseer to carry the Chalice of Conquest to a noble band of Paladins in
            the Mountains of Rathe. Dru then informs me that the Chalice of Conquest is very special
            indeed. Rumor has it that Brell himself delivered the Chalice to the Church of Underfoot
            himself. Drinking from the Chalice of Conquest assures you of victory, howerver only good
            natured people can drink from the cup. If someone of an evil past drinks from the cup,
            they suffer the wrath of Brell. He goes on to say he was able to make it to the group of
            High Paladins in Rathe Mountains but while he was there a band of orcs attacked the camp.
            During the melee an opportunistic Blue Orc was able to sneak into the camp and steal the
            Chalice! Dru was busy fighting off the attacking orcs to notice the artifact being stolen.
            After the fight was over Dru chased the orc off into the sunset to no avail. When Lord
            Datur Nightseer heard of the events that took place from Dru, he chose to blame his once
            noble paladin and banish him from Kaladim. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>After his tale ended he handed me a container with two slots. He told me
            that once I found the Chalice of Conquest and the Candle of Bravery, combine them, and
            return the case to Lord Nightseer. &quot;Candle of Bravery?&quot; I asked, having never
            heard of such an item. He explained that is a Ceremonial candle lit when the Chalice of
            Conquest is to be drunk from. He told me to get the Candle of Bravery I would have to get
            both the candlestick and the candle, the latter of which burnt out long ago and he did not
            know where Priestess Ghalea aquires them from. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>From this point I'm off on my quest for the Chalice of Conquest, Candle
            of Bravery, and most importantly- To restore Dru Razbine to his former glory of being a
            Paladin of Underfoot. First, thanks to Riae Soulmender who reminded me who she was, I went
            to Kaladim to speak with Priestess Ghalea of the Church of Underfoot. I made my way to the
            cleric guild inside Kaladim and asked the Priestess about the Candle of Bravery. She
            explains that the candle itself is very difficult to make and only one person is able to
            do this task: Dok of Halas. She told him that if I needed one made I would surely need
            some Soil of Underfoot to give to Dok. For the Soil of Underfoot I had venture to Lesser
            Faydark and lay waste to some Fairies, and pick up four portions of Fairy dusts. After
            this tedious task I returned the dust to Ghalea and she gave me some blessed Soil of
            Underfoot. I then knew my journey required me to take the boat to Antonica.</font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>After a long boat ride, followed by a long run, I made found myself at
            the Paladin camp in Rathe Mountains, the same Paladins who give out the Armor of Ro molds.
            I find Nicholas, the dwarven Paladin, and ask him about the Chalice of Conquest. He fills
            me in, with more detail, of the orc attack that fateful day and the events that followed.
            Turns out that after the attack, a passing ranger helped Nicholas track down the blue orc
            to an orc camp in the near by Lake Rathe. At this lake the found the blue orc's dead body,
            appearently the orc had taken a fatal blow during the fight but had enough stamina to make
            it back to the camp, and a group of orcs too powerful for just the two of them to take on.
            Nicholas decided that it would be best to go back and get help from the other Paladins.
            The next morning when the Paladins returned to the orc camp they found it deserted with
            some orc remnants scattered about. They found a bracelet with the name &quot;Klunga&quot;
            on it, a shovel, a bag of cauldron prawns, and two sets of tracks leading away from the
            camp. Nicholas went on to say that the orc camp has now been taken over by green orcs and
            advised me to stay away. I thanked Nicholas for the information and then asked him what he
            knew about the Candle of Bravery. He gave me a piece of the broken candlestick and went on
            to say that the Rathe Mountains are not only overrun by monsters, but by evil druids as
            well! Appearently an odd druid somehow managed to brake the candlestick and steal a
            portion of it during a fight between the druids and the paladins. Nicholas even remembered
            the druids battle cry, &quot;Long live the green!!!&quot; Nicholas told me that if I was
            able to find the other piece of the candlestick, the make of the candlestick would surely
            be able to put it back together. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>Against Nicholas' advice, I went to Lake Rathetear in search of clues. I
            found the orc camp that he mentioned, dispatched the surrounding orcs and found an
            abandoned orc shovel on the ground, which I promptly picked up. I found no other clues or
            tracks however, so I went back to Rathe Mountains in to find the odd druid who holds the
            remaining portion of the Candlestick. At this point I searched and searched and searched
            but could not find any druids that seemed... well unordinary to me. Luckily for me an old
            friend of mine, Bohr Blackblade of Fires of Heaven, a fellow Dwarven Paladin, passed
            through the mountains and stumbled upon me. I informed him of what I was searching for. He
            sat down for a moment to think, like many wise dwarfs do at times. He stood up and told me
            that the only &quot;odd druids&quot; he knows of in the Mountains of Rathe would be the
            Unkempt Preservers. He then told me he was in a bit of a rush and he hoped he helped out.
            I waved goodbye and then started looking for Unkempt Preservers. I indeed found them and
            after killing the evil druids for almost a full day I felt discouraged. I took a bit of a
            rest and decided to give it another shot. Then out of nowhere I heard, &quot;Long live the
            green!!!&quot;, as a dagger pierced my shoulder from behind. I quickly showed her what a
            Dwarven Paladin is made of and I'm sure she will regret what she started for all eternity,
            the druid fell dead at my feet. I did indeed find the Base of the Candlestick on the body
            and felt with these components I should make my way to Halas to find Dok. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>I was unfamiliar with Everfrost and Halas, and everything inbetween.
            After a days journey wandering the Snowy Peaks I found a cave with surrounding Barbarian
            Warriors. I found myself at Halas at last. I was able to find Dok in the building aptly
            named &quot;Dok's Cigars&quot;. When I hailed him Dok told me how I would find no cigars
            for they had run out and I should leave. I informed him that I was not there for the
            cigars, but for the Candle of Bravery. &quot;Candle of Bravery? I'll need the candlestick,
            or pieces of it, a pouch of Soil of Underfoot, and a honeycomb to make that magical
            item,&quot; he told me. Of course I had every component accept the honeycomb and none of
            the local shops had any instock. I reluctantly left Halas and started the journey for
            Misty Thicket, where I had heard Bixies dropped the Honeycomb I was after. Lucky for me a
            friendly druid named Tryst Trustolid was kind enough to take me to Misty Thicket in a
            flash. I found a Honeycomb in one of the local shops and my friend Tryst was able to get
            me back to the Karanas. From there I was able to run back to Halas and turn in the items
            to Dok. He must have been a shaman because I was sure I felt some magic pulsating from the
            Candle of Bravery when he handed me the item. I placed the Candle into my container given
            by Dru Razbine and was already halfway to my goal!</font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>At this point I was all out of clues. I had a bracelet with the name
            Klunga on it, and an abondoned orc shovel. &quot;Where could the Chalice be?&quot; I asked
            myself over and over. The blue orc, Klunga?, had it last and now he is dead. I finally
            went back to Nicholas to ask about the orc remnants to see if I missed something. He
            reminded me that he found the shovel, the bracelet, and a bag of cauldron prawns when he
            looted the camp. Cauldron prawns! How could I have been such a gnoll and missed that clue,
            surely it meant that the Orcs were from Dagnor's Cauldron. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>So I rode the boat back to Faydwer and headed to the Cauldron. When I
            arrived I found that my old friend Dalas Soww was there looking for the elusive Blige. I
            asked him if he had seen any orcs in the area and he quickly led me to the only orcs he
            knew of, the orc scout camp high atop of a rocky hill. I thanked him and he went along his
            way. So I was onto them now. I found the orcs and they were going to give me the
            information I needed to find the Chalice! Even though I was very good at the Orc Language
            they would not respond to my questions. I showed them that Dwarves do not appreciate such
            lack of cooperation. I had to resort to violance. I slaughtered the Orcs and every time
            they came back to the camp I slaughtered them again. Still no information. However I did
            notice an odd pattern. Roughly every 6 hours there would be four orc at the camp instead
            of three. However this fourth orc that was appearing was still just a plain Orc Scout. But
            I was determined, and continued the Orc slaughter, I needed to redeem Dru! Finally, days
            later, a new orc appeared at the camp. It was an exiled orc legionaire. &quot;Could this
            be what I have been looking for?!&quot; I questioned myself. Sure enough he followed suit
            as with his orc brethen not responding to my questions so I dispatched him. However this
            orc, instead of dropping Rawhide armor, dropped a note. A bloodstained note. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>The note had some very interesting information, the spelling was sloppy
            as is all Orc Literature. The note read a little something like this: &quot;Dis is a notis
            of the death of Klunga~ He tryd to reedeam himsef by stealig a Dwarv cup~ When he drunk
            from cup at lake he died~ We drug his body back to Calldrin~ We burnd bodi in fire pit
            here~ We bury cup here~ We killd gnome castor here~ We tink he knows sumtink~ Den all is
            gud~&quot; </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>I deciphered the note I found on the Orc with my brother Xiae
            Soulmender, a very intelligent High Elf wizard. We decided the message stated that Klunga
            was the blue orc that stole the cup, he was not injured during the battle in Rathe
            Mountains but died from drinking the cup. His fellow orcs brought Klunga's body and the
            cup back to the Cauldron. The Orcs then cremated Klunga's body in the fire pit at the Orc
            Camp, and buried the cup elsewhere. The only thing we weren't quite sure about was the
            Gnome caster. Who was it? And where was he? While scouring the Cauldron for answers I
            noticed my brother Diae Soulmender, a Ranger, walking to the Estate of Unrest. I asked him
            if he could try to track down this Gnome Caster. He was able to make short work of that
            task, finding Ghilanbiddle Nylwadil very quickly. Ghilanbiddle was at a camp with some
            companions of his. I asked Ghilanbiddle if he knew anything about the Chalice of Conquest.
            He told me that he knew the Chalice was buried within the Cauldron but he did not know
            precisely where, however he did know someone who does. He explained using his arcane magic
            he would be able to resurrect Captain Klunga and have him lead me to the cup. He required
            a few items to do this task, a item that was once owned by Klunga, a portion of his blood,
            and most importantly, 100 gold coins. I had the bracelet klunga had owned, and also 100
            gold coins. But what could be the portion of blood? &quot;Is it possible the bloodstained
            note itself is what he requires?&quot; I asked myself. I decided it was worth a try. I
            traded him the note, the bracelet, and 100 gold coins.</font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>Sure enough he responded back saying the he had successfully resurrected
            Klunga's soul to the place he was laid to rest. Ghilanbiddle also told me that Klunga's
            soul would need something to dig up the Chalice with. I sure was glad that I picked up
            that abandoned orc shovel at the Orc Camp back in Lake Rathetear. I ran to the Orc Camp
            where I found the exiled orc, and found a skeleton named Captain Klunga. I gave the
            scattered fallen bones the shovel. I have to admit I jumped back a bit with the bones came
            together to form a skeleton twice the size as I. Klunga, wordless, started walking in a
            straight line towards a distant point in the Cauldron. I followed him into the water and
            swan close behind to follow, my only fear now was that a passing adventurer would kill
            Captain Klunga before he was able to dig up the chalice. We made it across the Cauldron to
            a remote spot. Klunga paused a moment, a brown bag appeared at his feet and then he turned
            on me! I unsheathed my Ghoulbane,&nbsp; and dismissed him back to the realm of the undead.
            When I picked up the brown bag where Klunga paused I found none other then the Chalice of
            Conquest! Overjoyed I made my way back to Kaladim. Ran through the halls, past the Bank of
            Kaladim, through the halls of the Church of Underfoot and kneeled before my liege, Lord
            Datur Nightseer, the noble Paladin leader. I placed the Chalice into the container and
            combined the two items. I handed the container then to Lord Datur Nightseer who, in
            return, gave me a Cape of Underfoot for my troubles. The Cape itself was not very useful,
            a simple 4 armor class and maybe 5 extra stamina. I believe the cape to be more of a
            status symbol in Kaladim and almost forgot about Dru Razbine himself. I ran to him, cloak
            in hand, seeing in his eyes that he knew my quest was over and he would be able to back to
            Kaladim. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>Dru Razbine exclaimed, &quot;Jiae, you're definitely a finer Paladin
            then I. Take this holy weapon, but be careful what you do with the magical charges it
            possesses, for I know of only one cleric that can recharge the magical effect. The cleric
            I speak of went to the lava filled plains of Antonica and has not been heard from since.
            Thank you Jiae, I will now be able to walk the halls of Kaladim again...&quot;</font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>When I examined the blade closely I found no magical effect or charges,
            does this mean I must search out the cleric in the lava filled plains of Antonica? What
            does she hold in store for me? A refined weapon? Possibly our grandest holy sword of all?
            We shall she in the future fellow Paladins, I call on you to help find the missing pieces
            regarding this Cleric!</font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>Half elves and erudites are left out. Now keep in mind I was able to do
            this SOLO, at level 40. As you can see it is not our best weapon out there but if a lower
            level group stumbled upon this weapon it would be made use of. Unfortunantly I don't know
            the levels of the fairies, unkempt druids ect... because they were all green. My guess is
            a group of high teens-twenties can do this quest. </font></p>
            <font size="2"><p>In my opinion howerver, I believe it to be part of an ongoing quest,
            concerning that Cleric in Lavastorm? Najena? Solusek Ro/A/B?&nbsp; </font></p>
