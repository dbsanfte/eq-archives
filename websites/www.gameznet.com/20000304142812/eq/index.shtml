I wanted to take the time to plug a new Everquest news site by the name of <a href="http://www.thesky.org">TheSky.Org</a>. How best to describe the site... oh forget it why lie? I'm just too lazy to type it up in my own words. Anyway here's a description from the webmaster.<br><br><blockquote>Just wanted to get the word out that me and a team of friends have started a great new site called TheSky.Org (<a href="http://www.thesky.org">http://www.thesky.org</a>). Our goal: To provide the EverQuest community with an online 'news ticker', updated daily with general news, server specific news, and forum posts by the EQ team. (Our forum logs section will eventually evolve into a megaplex of every post made by any EQ staff member in the past and present!) All info is collected from the many EQ related sites across the internet and presented in clean, "plain jane" form for easy surf-free reading. <br><br>Our hope is that TheSky.Org will not be competition for various sites (like EQLizer), but a gateway of EQ information to all the great sites that are out there.<br><br>So please, drop by and enjoy the fruit of our labors thus far!<br><br>- John "Syruss" Wooldridge (syruss@thesky.org)</blockquote>

Alright time for an equipment update and some miscellaneous blabber. Three new pieces of equipment this evening as well as two updates to older pieces of equipment.<br><br>Starting tommorrow we will be adding a couple of new names to help us with news coverage. It is important to point out that EQ'Lizer defaults to no nonsense coverage. This means we default to only telling you new features on our site, new equipment, new quests etc as this is the way we have always been.<br><br>However if you wish to receive full news coverage you can <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/advanced.shtml">Customize Your News</a> to add any areas that you desire and to omit any areas that you do not want to be notified of.

<a href="http://www.gamespot.com">Gamespot</a> has posted up an <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/kunark_pre/index.html">interview</a> with Everquest producer Brad McQuaid. The interview covers Ruins of Kunark. Here's a highlight...<br><br><blockquote>GameSpot: How [if at all] will Ruins of Kunark specifically address issues like camping static spawns with good loot and specific zone overcrowding? <br><br>McQuaid: It doesn't - it adds a new playable race and a new continent to explore, increasing the size of Norrath by over 30 percent. Improving the camping situation is a continual process of moving treasure around and making sure that highly wanted items are not class specific and the product of quests. Specific zone overcrowding is generally solved by retuning zones, often making less frequented zones</blockquote>

While i am in the habit clearing out the mailbox and finishing up things that should have been done months ago I figured I may as well get the new message boards online. This is something that is long overdue. The classic EQ'Lizer message board still remains but there are now a whole slew of new boards hosted at <a href="http://www.gamezportal.com">GameZPortal</a> for each class, each server and several other topics such as Quests, Equipment, Class Comparisons etc. <br><br>One thing that should be noted is that since these boards are on GameZPortal and not GameZNet you will need to register at GameZPortal's(takes 15 seconds) message board to be able to post there. For those who don't feel like registering at GameZPortal the classic message board is still available.<br><br>New Feature: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/base.html">Message Boards</a>.

Alright as promised here is a huge(by current standards at least) quest update. Most of these are new quests that we did not have posted before. A couple of them are updates to older quests. <br><br>All of these quests are verified by me with the exception of Call of Flames. I am not 100% positive if this is the real quest or not. I do believe that it is though from checking information. I have not been able to get anyone to confirm to me that this is in fact the quest though. So take this one with a grain of salt.

I keyed in URLs tonight for all of the NPCs listed in the EQCompendium searches over at <a href="http://www.gamezportal.com/eqr">EQ Reference</a>.  Now, when you search for armor, weapons, or miscellaneous equipment, there will be a hyperlink to the appropriate spawn page in the beastiary (assuming the NPC has its own page).  Nothing too phenomenal, but still pretty cool.  <br><br>I'd also like to mention that I'm flying out tomorrow for Mardi Gras 2000 and will be gone for a week of drunken debauchery.  Feel free to email additions or corrections for the spawn guides, etc and I will post them up as soon as I get back.  Groovy.

I have added Permafrost to the list of zones on the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/notsocommon.html">Not-So-Common Spawn Guide</a>.  I didn't list any of the giants or other high level critters enroute to Lady Vox, however, as they are unitemized.  If good screenshots are submitted for some of them tho (the IG Diplomat or Priest of Nagafen for example), I'll post them up.<br><br>Soon, I'm going to break down each of the different Planes in the same manner as the other guides.  I'm very familiar with all of the Fear and Hate spawns, but the PoA is pretty sketchy.  If someone has the time to put together and submit a list of spawns with the items they drop it would be much appreciated.  I'd rather have a good solid listing rather than post incorrect or missing information.

<p><strong><font color="#f0f0f0">One Year Down</font> </strong><small>Posted Monday, February 28, 2000 by <a href="mailto:jcsmith@gameznet.com">jcsmith</a></small><br>
Today marks the one year anniversary of EQ'Lizer. Hard to believe it's been a year already. My how time flies when your having fun.<br><br>A year ago we were the only site which gave an extensive equipment and quest sections, we were the only site which had spells above level 20 posted for every class. Times have changed. Now you can browse through the net and find any number of sites which offer quests, daily equipment updates, zone guides, spells as well as news and our staff consisted of one person(myself).<br><br>At this time last year the game was on the closing days of beta testing. It had already gone gold and was readying a mid-march release. It has grown and matured much since then. In the initial months we were quite hard on Verant for in my opinion rushing the release. There are still certain moves that I might disagree with but all in all the game is vastly improved from a year ago.<br><br>I just wanted to take the time to thank all of the editors and readers who have been through these gates in the past year. All the editors have done a great job from Iuons to Fyndhorn to most recently Buck Satan and a good number of other editors(such as T and Welor) who are too many to mention. Thanks for making EQ'Lizer the site that it is today and here's to another year in operations.

Both Crushbone and Solusek A have been added to the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/notsocommon.html">Not-So-Common Spawn Guide</a>.  I've also been adding all the information being submitted to the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra.html">Ultra Spawn Guide</a>, as well as a couple strategy guides.  Good stuff.  We could use more of the strategy guides tho, so keep them coming.
