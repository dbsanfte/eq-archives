            Twink - low level player equipped with high level items.<br>
            <br>
            We've all seen them - the lvl 5 Paladin with the Ghoulbane, MM shield and Full Plate;
            &nbsp; the lvl 10 Wizard with a SMR;&nbsp; the lvl 17 Ranger with dual Ebony Blades and
            full Ivy Etched armor - it's how we view the Twinks of Norrath which I am addressing.<br>
            <br>
            There are several basic viewpoints on twinks and twinking which I can <br>
            summarize into three basic reactions I've seen.&nbsp; Admiration.&nbsp; Jealousy.
            &nbsp; Digust.<br>
            <br>
            The first is becomming more common, as the players of EQ universally level up, and more
            and more people create Twinks of their own.&nbsp; The admiration comes from the knowledge
            of what it must have taken that person in camp time, trades, and platinum to give their
            secondary character such nice items.&nbsp; A good twink takes alot of effort, and when
            well done is quite impressive to see.<br>
            <br>
            The second is generally held by those who simply don't have a higher level character but
            wish that they did.&nbsp; It's not uncommon to see people with this attitude begging for
            items or coin.&nbsp; I've found the best way to deal with this is to remind them that the
            begging skill is for<br>
            NPC's.&nbsp; A complaint that often accompanies this view is &quot;Damn power leveling
            twinking @#$#@#$, I'm not a geek like you, I can't play 24-7&quot;.&nbsp; Verant's handy
            Ignore command works well here, as the Have Nots will always complain about those who have
            more.<br>
            <br>
            The digust attitude is a bit more understandable - the basis here is that <br>
            Twinks are a form of cheating.&nbsp; Giving the high level weapons and armor to a low
            level character can be seen as bypassing the natural progression of leveling that should
            occur.&nbsp; EQ is most closely based on the old text base pen and paper RPG.&nbsp; When
            you create a new character in D&amp;D, you don't get to start them out with the best
            weapons - cheating is self defeating and robs you of the fun of the game!&nbsp; The whole
            point of the old role playing games was adventure -&nbsp; discovering the weapons and loot
            as you went along, not making <br>
            an invincible diety that can easily defeat all foes.&nbsp; No risk =&nbsp; No excitement!<br>
            <br>
            However, given the limitations of the graphics based RPG world that EQ is, Verant has not
            been able to keep up with player progress.&nbsp; Lvl 50 was reached much more
            &nbsp; quickly than anyone could have anticipated.&nbsp; And what do you do you do now, if
            you have reached level 50, killed the dragons mulitiple times, killed the gods multiple
            times, acquired<br>
            all of your class specific armor, done every quest you could find?&nbsp; Well, <br>
            the obvious answer is to create a new character!&nbsp; And having put so much time in to
            EQ - the above mentioned would be nothing short of months and months of work - what truly
            &nbsp; valid reason can be put forth that you should NOT give your new character nice
            items.&nbsp; If anything,<br>
            you deserve to have nice items for your second, third, fourth ect. characters.
            &nbsp; Besides, it's just plain fun!<br>
            <br>
            Verant has taken certain measures to make sure this doesn't go too far in extremes.
            &nbsp; No drop armor on the planes won't be gotten until you are 46+.&nbsp; Weapons don't
            proc until your level is high enough.&nbsp; You need faction with races and guilds before
            you can start some quests.<br>
            <br>
            But where does twinking go too extreme - where does the role playing really end, and plain
            twink mania come in?&nbsp; How about taking your level 1 char all the way to 20 without
            killing a single mob, by repeatedly doing some quest like Tumpy's Tonics?&nbsp; It's
            really just a form of buying experience, which to me really defeats the purpose of the
            game, which is adventuring.&nbsp; But it could be argued that having already made lvl 50
            there is nothing new about leveling the standard way, and it is simply a faster way to get
            your new char to a level where you can group with your friends.<br>
            <br>
            Whatever view you take on twinks, they are always going to exist, and are going to
            increase in number.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do suggest making one before you go too harsh the
            criticism.&nbsp; If you keep playing EQ, it's rather unavoidable that you will reach lvl
            50, and you may find yourself wanting to make a new character, and wouldn't it be nice if
            they had a mithril plated harmonica, or a flux bladed toe nail clipper...<br>
