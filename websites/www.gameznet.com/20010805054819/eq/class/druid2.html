            <br>
            What is a Druid?<br>
            <br>
            A simple question, but one that should be answered before we get started. A Druid is
            someone who takes the Direct Damage (DD) spells of a Wizard, the healing spells of a
            Cleric and a few other assorted handy spells, and then taking it all down a notch. Our DD
            spells aren't as good as a Wizards, and our healing spells aren't as good as a Clerics,
            but you will have your hand in both, which means your spells are in high demand. A Druid
            is easily the best soloer in game at earlier levels, as your Damage Over Time (DOT) line
            of spells and Spirit of Wolf (SoW) will let you kill enemies that almost every other
            player in the game will be shying away from, even 3 or 4 levels down the road. We are
            capable of almost every spell or its equivalent in the game.<br>
            <br>
            So now you should know that we can do just about everything with our spells, however our
            melee skills are not what most people on seem to think they are. I have found that that
            most non-Druids seem to find the Druid somewhere between a mage and a warrior type for
            melee, however we what most fail to realize is that we a much more geared towards the mage
            side. Even with full buffs, I can usually only do about a quarter the damage that party
            tanks can do. The bottom line here is that if a mob attacks us, we can take it for a few
            moments, but wont last long. We might even get a few spells off. When a mob attacks a
            mage, their hit points are so low they either go into a panic or make it clear that they
            cant do anything with a mob on them.<br>
            <br>
            How Much Wisdom?<br>
            <br>
            Some people will tell you that you don't need a high wisdom to be a Druid, and this is
            true. You don't need a high wisdom to be a druid, you need it to be a good Druid. When you
            spend a few hours camping a mob for a few point addition to your wisdom, or buy a Platinum
            Ruby Veil for the low cost of 1200 Platinum for a +7 wisdom, you will be kicking yourself
            that you didn't put all available points into that score. No other stat will serve you as
            well as this. Here is a run down of what each stat does for you.<br>
            <br>
            Strength-Your armor weighs so little you will rarely be encumbered, and it wont be long
            before you have a strength buff anyways. Best to ignore this stat.<br>
            <br>
            Dexterity and Agility-Both combat stats, and since you don't have the armor or weapon
            selection to do anything above par here, they should be considered secondary at best.<br>
            <br>
            Intelligence-I use one type of weapon, and my spells and my scores stay maxed with the
            default setting, extra points are moot.<br>
            <br>
            Wisdom-Determines your mana, your lifes blood.<br>
            <br>
            Charisma-Helps change prices, but there is almost nothing for you to buy at a vendor
            besides spells anyways.<br>
            <br>
            Spells<br>
            <br>
            We are one of the few classes in the game that can solo red opponents, and the only ones
            that can do it with ease and as an xp gaining system. A Shaman may be able to do it once
            in awhile, but their low Wisdom scores will usually put them one or two spells shy of
            killing most reds. Mages and Necromancers, when they get a good pet, have told me that
            they can solo the occasional red, but this is rare. This can be used to your advantage as
            well to get items that would not normally be available to you, and can be used to make
            some very quick cash.<br>
            <br>
            Sadly, we are gipped in Direct Damage spells. Our DD spells are usually the same as an
            Enchanters, with Wizards and Mages commonly having higher DD spells. In addition, we only
            get a new DD spell once every ten levels, so we advance slower than others as well.
            However, there are times when we will win burn wars even against a Wizard when our DOT
            spells are accounted for.<br>
            <br>
            Which naturally brings us to the Druids Damage Over Time series of spells. My personal
            favorite line of all our spells, because they are capable of doing more damage than most
            DD spells their level than for a lower cost. The only trade off is the spell takes about a
            minute to completely work, which is not a very high price to pay for some of the most mana
            efficient spells in existence. Here is a little story I experienced first hand on the
            power of our DOTs. While fighting a level 30 goblin, a high level Druid stumbled across me
            and my party. He decided to give us a hand, and at the start of the next fight cast
            Drifting Death, the most powerful DOT we have. Being level 30, this goblin was even with
            me, so I was casting Combust for 177 damage a cast. I managed to get 2 casts off, but to
            everyones surprise, Drifting Death in about 20 seconds managed to out damage me and our
            everyone else in my party as well. The moral of this story: do not under estimate your DOT
            line of spells.<br>
            <br>
            Our healing spells are not very useful until level 19 when we receive the spell Healing.
            Our two spells before that are barely enough to offset the damage most enemies that level
            are capable of. And our final healing spell, Greater Healing is the first spell that is
            actually capable of saving someone in a tricky situation, with a heal of roughly 270
            damage, far more than most mobs are capable of hitting for. In addition, we get a
            regeneration line of spells, but only at a very high level. At 34 we receive Regeneration,
            which heals 6 points of damage every 6 seconds, a useful spell when cast on your tanks,
            but will rarely save yourself or another caster. And our other regeneration spell,
            Chloroplast, does double that.<br>
            <br>
            Then we have our very useful shield and buff line of spells. The Skin Like Wood line is
            very helpful in increasing your AC and making you more combat worthy. It will keep you
            alive longer in combat, and at later levels it will give your tanks the time necessary to
            get a mob off you, while most other casts would be running in fear. The damage shield
            provided by Thistlecoat line is almost laughable, but the extra AC is always welcome. I
            never let either of these spells run out. The next line, Shield of Thistles, grows
            exponentially more useful as you get higher in levels. At first, the spell lasts so short
            a period of time, it usually wont even last an entire combat, but higher level versions of
            the spell will last longer and do more damage. And not just the fact that the damage gets
            higher, but higher level mobs will hit two or three times a round, effectively doubling
            and tripling the damage. And even a level 50 tank will be begging for a spell that adds 45
            damage a round to their total.<br>
            <br>
            And last, but certainly not least, we have the best low level spell in the game, Spirit of
            Wolf. This spell basically doubles the speed at which you can run, meaning you can now
            &quot;kite&quot; enemies, escape Giants and other certain death scenarios. This will also
            be your most requested spell after you receive it, so be prepared to either go /anon or
            receive many tells asking for the spell..<br>
            <br>
            Most other spells are either self explanatory (See Invisible, your teleportation line,
            etc) or are all but useless (Befriend Animal, Feral Spirit, and similar spells). Since
            some of you are either asking why this line is useless, or contesting the fact, let me
            explain. First know that I am comparing this line to the pets Mages, Necromancers, etc.
            get. Second, if the spell fails, the animal will immediately attack. And once your spell
            does wear off, which will usually be before the end of your first fight the animal will
            attack you. Not a very useful hunting partner. Next, it wont even attack mobs of much
            higher level than itself, which gets rid of the strategy Mages and Necromancers have of
            leaving the pet behind to save yourself. If you can think of a better use than
            entertainment value, feel free to exploit it.<br>
            <br>
            Equipment<br>
            <br>
            With your armor maxing out at leather and your weapons limited to blunt and scimitars, you
            don't have much of a selection. Since you cant melee very well, I suggest going for items
            that will enhance your stats. For instance if you want a huge mana reserve, go for wisdom
            items, agility and dexterity items if you simply must melee, etc. My personal preference
            is for a larger mana cap, however if you picked a high starting wisdom you can take your
            items in almost any direction. I have done a little adding with the items on the EQ'lizer,
            and have found a wisdom of at least 171 possible (not even counting what is in Fear).<br>
            <br>
            Your weapon choice is less than expansive as well. I have found very few decent 1H Blunt
            weapons, and only a few more good scimitars. Paired off with a good shield though, you can
            have a very effective stat increasing combo. Staves are probably the better choice earlier
            on though, as staves will more suit your purpose, and have better stats earlier on.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Kiting<br>
            <br>
            Other classes have become so upset that we have this ability, they have actually tried to
            have it banned. Since that probably has your attention, I will explain what the benefits
            are, and how to accomplish it. First off, kiting allows you to kill mobs that con red,
            something almost every other class in the game would shy away from. You start by casting
            SoW on yourself, and then finding a mob you wish to kite. Cast your highest level DOT on
            him (excluding the useless and often resisted Immolate), and run for the spells duration
            (usually a minute). Stop, cast again, repeat. Extremely simple, but if done wrong it can
            still be deadly. What most fail to realize is that a red mob can pick apart a caster very
            quickly, and casting a DOT takes time. Sometimes its enough for the mob to catch you,
            sometimes it isn't. You have to find the slower mobs that will not catch you before you
            can cast. <br>
            <br>
            The benefits of this are obvious, high exp gains, lots of cash, good items. Down time is a
            little long, but the pay off is the right price, especially if you are strapped for cash,
            or cant find a group.<br>
            <br>
            Levelling<br>
            <br>
            1-7 The higher you get, the more difficult it gets, for one reason: you don't have
            Meditate yet. Your mana will be used up every fight, and you will have to wait to
            replenish it after every fight, making down time extremely long. A word of advice, invest
            in Snare. I have found this spell more useful than the level 24 Ensnaring Roots.<br>
            <br>
            8-13 You get Meditate at level 8, and things will get much easier. Though you will more
            than likely have to group for these levels, they are the stepping stones to a much easier
            solo life. <br>
            <br>
            14-18 With both your first DOT and SoW in the same spell set, this may be your best level
            for spells in the whole game. Here you will be introduced to kiting, which usually ranks
            at least in the top 5 for reasons to become a Druid. If you want to hit a dungeon, Paw,
            Blackburrow and Crushbone are all good for this area.<br>
            <br>
            19-23 Your first teleportation spells, a new heal and a new DD spell will make this an
            extremely welcome level. To start with, you will never have to get on a boat again, you
            heals become useful and you can do up to 122 damage or so. Kiting is still highly
            recommended at these levels. Runnyeye, and the high level gnolls in Paw and Blackburrow
            are still fair game.<br>
            <br>
            24-28 A good time to start moving up to higher level dungeons, such as Unrest, Permafrost
            and Solusek A. And you knew it had to come eventually, its about time to give up kiting
            and start grouping. I have found that down times become too long, and the pay off not
            enough. Killing 3 blue mobs is more beneficial than 1 red. Also the ever cool Wolf Form =)<br>
            <br>
            29-33 Dungeons you have been in before, and for the more daring out there, the first
            denizens of Lower Guk become a viable option. You will also get Combust and have a DD
            spell for 170 damage.<br>
            <br>
            34-43 Time to start moving into the last of the high level dungeons. Mistmoore, Lower Guk
            and Nagafens Lair will be prime hunting spots. In addition, you get the first of the
            Regeneration line of spells, and a long awaited upgrade to Greater Wolf Form. A well
            deserved DD spell awaits you at 39, Fire Strike.<br>
            <br>
            44-50 Some VERY powerful spells await you here, and they will serve you well in the Plane
            of Fear. Time to hunt down the most powerful equipment in the game, and tangle with
            dragons, and face the mighty Cazic Thule himself.<br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, remember that a Druid has his hand in just about everything, but because of
            this, other casters will begin to pull away from you in terms of &quot;specialized
            spells&quot; at higher levels. A few examples such as the Clerics Ressurect line,
            Enchanters Clarity (mana regeneration) spell, Str debuff and mob enchanting, Wizards
            massive damage capabilities in the Ice Comet spell, capable of 1120 damage, where you will
            most likely cap at 600, and Necromancers have been promised the ability to become a Lich
            in the expansion. <br>
            <br>
            Its simply a choice you must make, high levels in this game represent their class in the
            extreme. Clerics become so beneficial to a party, you would be crazy not to want one,
            Wizards become the epitome of DD power, Enchanters become capable of sitting down and
            watching two giants fight each other, and you become capable of nearly every type of spell
            in existence.<br>
