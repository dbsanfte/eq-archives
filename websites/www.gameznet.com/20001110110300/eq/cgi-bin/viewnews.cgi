Things are beginning to slow down once more. I would expect the equipment updates to continue to slowly taper off until Velious is launched a month from now. I will be doing my best to take this time to update the bestiary, zone guides and effects listings during this period. I do have a few new items for you today. Also of note is that Rheumguls(the shadowknight reward weapon from the Plane of Air) has received an upgrade. This upgrade makes it arguably the best shadowknight useable weapon currently discovered. <br><br>New Piercers: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/imbuednorthmanlongdagger.html">Imbued Northman Long Dagger</a>.<br>New Leggings: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/imbuednorthmanringleggings.html">Imbued Northman Ring Leggings</a>.<br>New Shoulders: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/witheredleathershoulderpads.html">Withered Leather Shoulderpads</a>.<br>New Rings: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/apprenticering.html">Apprentice Ring</a>(NEC).<br>Updated 2HSlashs: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/rheumguls.html">Rheumguls</a>(SHD).<br>Updated Magic Armor Sets: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/witheredleaderarmor.html">Withered Leather Armor</a>.<br>Updated Hole Spawns: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/notsocommon/hole/commanderyarik.html">Commander Yarik</a>.<br>Updated Effects: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/effects/siphon.html">Siphon</a>.

It also aims to inform players on specifics of some of the spells which monsters will be casting on them. <br><br>The section is pretty small at the moment but will continue to be updated with time. Every spell effect that is added requires a lot of cross-linking which can take some time so bear with me. We are also in the process of renovating our Zone Guide sections.

Not much information on them other than their drops however as noone on our server has yet to attempt Veeshan's Peak. I have also went through and renovated the Venril Sathir and Trakanon Ultra spawn pages to make them easier to navigate through the items. <br><br>Today's update also includes the rather dissapointing(in comparison to other class rewards) shadowknight Test of Tactics rewards. The second item was the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/blacksilkenveil.html">Black Silken Veil</a>. We are still missing any paladin rewards. Last but not least is a new Veeshan's Peak item from Silverwing.<br><br>New Ultra Spawns: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/silverwing.html">Silverwing</a>, <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/hoshkar.html">Hoshkar</a>, <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/pharadar.html">Phara Dar</a>.<br>New 1HSlashs: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/scimitaroflifestealing.html">Scimitar of Lifestealing</a>.<br>New Necklaces: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bloodsoakedamulet.html">Bloodsoaked Amulet</a>(SHD).<br>Updated Ultra Spawns: <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/trakanon.html">Trakanon</a>, <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/venrilsathir.html">Venril Sathir</a>.

Today's update features nothing but Test of Tactics rewards. This should cover all class rewards from the Test of Tactics with the exception of the paladin and shadowknights.

I cleared my own pics directory this morning along with some other miscellaneous updating. This is not the spawn update I alluded to yesterday. Still have quite a few spawns in the mailbox but the images need to be cropped up and I did not have the time to do so this morning.

Geez, it's been a long time since I've had time to hit the site with any updates.  I've been pretty busy working on all the new Epic quest guides.  I've pretty much gotten everything complete except for the druid and wizard one.  I will be able to finish those once someone finishes them and I get in contact with them to be able to get the info from them.  =)<br><br>I've almost finished up the site itself, as far as making pics smaller , which in turn will make them faster to load.  I should be uploading most of the info in the next day or two.<br><br>Btw, just a tidbit of info for people that like to listen to music while playing EQ, winamp has a new plugin called <A HREF="http://www.execpc.com/~zor/SneakyAmp/">sneaky amp</A>.  It monitors keyboard strokes and allows you to change songs, volume and pretty much do anything with winamp that you can do on the face, by only typing in commands.  This works with while in EQ and is totally undetectable by everquest or anyone else, so you don't have to worry about them trying to say you are cheating!  =)<br><br>Also, for those guilds unfortunate enough to have never heard of Roger Wilco, I suggest that you check out <a href="http://www.rogerwilco.com">http://www.rogerwilco.com</a> and download this program.  It's totally free and it allows many many people to connect in a sort of chat room and talk, with a microphone and your basic speakers so that you can communicate with anyone else that is in the channel, my guild recently started using this and it seems to work great!  I've had up to 20 people in one chat session and no one says you can't do more.  This also works while in the game!<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>Foramen Magnum of Black Company, 53rd Druid, Tarew Marr
