<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" align=center>This guide was 
submitted by Akaran of Veeshan. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" align=left>Ok, this is a 
generally easy, but long, task. Most of the problems you'll face are on the 
Qyenos side of the continent. And if you run real fast through HighHold, you 
won't have much problems there either. By the way, it makes sense to stop and 
get bound in Rivervale when you get there, but that's a little ahead of things. 
Starting at the West Gate, make sure you have some food, water, and some type of 
light source (Lightstone or Greater Lightstone; even better is Serpent Sight). 
You don't need Speed of Wolf (SoW) but it might be helpful if you get caught in 
the middle of a train. Don't forget to be fully armed and armored because 
chances are you WLL meet up with somthing big and ugly. By the way, if you're a 
Paladin or Shadow Knight, you might want to wait on your trip uintil your "Lay 
Hands" or "Harm Touch" is able to be cast again. I'm not kidding about these 
nasties, and it's always good to be fully prepared for any lengthy trip. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" align=left>Ok, from the West 
Gate, head West into the Eastern Commons. Simply follow the path, don't go off 
on any splits in the path, just keep walking until you get to the West Commons. 
In the EComms, just keep your eyes open for Young Kodiacs, Black Bears, 
Black/Shadow Wolves, Lions and Lionesses. Oh, and there's a rather large Griffen 
that spawns in there too. Once in the WCommons, you can either follow the right 
edge of the map or the path. I generally follow the right edge, but be careful 
becaue you'll have a chance of running into some Orc/Derv Camps and a Mummy/Skel 
spawning ground. Keep folowing the edge until you hit the entrance to the 
Kithcor Woods. Watch out for Kodiacs, Orcs, Zombies, ect. In Kithcor, it's 
probably dark. It's ALWAYS dark in Kithcor.&nbsp; At night highlevel&nbsp;undead 
spawn but they despawn on daylight so do not run through until it is morning. 
&nbsp;Keep your eyes open and your weapon ready. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" align=left>Usually I'm through 
this zone so fast I don't bother to stop and look at the locals, just keep going 
until you hit the fork in the path. If you are feeling daring, go ahead and 
follow the fork on the right which goes to HighHold Pass. If you're feeling 
intelligent, go on the left hand path and head into Rivervale. Once in 
Rivervale, scream until you get bound. If you can't find anyone to bind you, go 
into Misty Thicket and ask there, donate if necessary. (East and West Commons 
aren't fun to go through naked) Stock up on provisions if necessary, and try and 
refrain from making any short jokes. Also sit and heal, meditate to recover any 
mana spent. This is very important, because you're going on the path through 
HighHold, which is, arguably, the NPC training ground for the Fear Plane. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" align=left>Leaving Rivervale, 
follow the path back to the fork. Go on the path on your right, head to HighHold 
Pass. Once you hit HH, start running and don't stop. Don't stop to read this 
guide, don't stop to grab a drink. Don't stop to help or heal, if you do you'll 
probably be dead. (Ignore this if you're above level 15 or so.. if you're that 
level go in and have fun) At the entrance you'll be in the middle of an Orc 
Spawning ground. Run. Go straight. You'll cross two bridges in sucession, then 
have a chance to turn twice, don't. After the second brach on the path, you come 
to a third turn on your left. Take this turn. And pray. This is Gnoll spawning 
ground, so go through it very quickly, if you get hit keep running because the 
zone isn't far ahead of you. Soon as you hit East Karana sit and take a 
breather. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" align=left>Well now, that was 
fun, wasn't it? The trip through East Karana is a vacation. Don't look down, 
however. Take the right hand ledge and walk through this zone. I saw no monsters 
here at all. Just keep walking and stay close to the mountainside. (It's a long 
way down) Eventually the edge will lower down to a open field, get on it and 
kiss the ground. From there, start walking and cross the wooden bridge into the 
nest Zone, North Karana. Ok, durring the trip through most of the Karana's, I 
didn't see much hostile. Much, that is. I hear stories of Griffens, Hill Giants 
and other biggies. And I saw a number of Silvermist Wolves, a varied assortment 
of Bears, and a Bandit. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px" align=left>Through north Karana, 
don't deviate from the path, don't take either of the two left turns you'll see. 
West Karana is HUGE. Bears, bugs and other biggies spawn here, so be careful and 
back away from anything that cons higher than blue to you. Also, avoid the big 
barns near the farms. You'll see what I mean. Bandits, both caster and 
non-caster hide in there, and will attack upon sight. Just stay on the main 
path, don't take any of the branches on the track. Near the end of your journey, 
you'll see a human on the track (usually). He's a bandit, and a hard one to 
kill. (Yellow to me when I passed through the area at level 9) Leave the track 
long enough to put alot of space between you and him, then once you've safely 
put a large ammount of space between the two of you, get back on the path and 
zone into Qyenos Hills. </P>

From the Qyenos hills, you're set. Just follow the path down into Qyenos, and ask for a bind.

That wasn't overly difficult, but if you want to have a higher survival rate (or lower, depending) go with a small group. This means you can have more people covering your back, but it also means that you'll have a greater chance of attracting somthing nasty.
