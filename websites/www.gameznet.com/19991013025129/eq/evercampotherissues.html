            by <a href="mailto:irbrien@bigpond.com">Elronn</a></p>
            <p>This piece is meant to be an exploration of issues that have been brought home to me
            while I have been playing a Wizard on Tunare server. It is not meant to be a bash as I
            think this is the best online game so far. They have got so many things right that
            predecessor games haven't.<br>
            <br>
            On Camping<br>
            <br>
            Is there a viable way to stop camping? I don't believe so. To understand camping, we have
            to look at the underlying reasons. People camp for 3 main reasons. <br>
            <br>
            These are:<br>
            <br>
            1. to obtain a powerful item for your character.<br>
            2. to obtain an item for another character who couldn't otherwise obtain it due to
            insufficient power.<br>
            3. To sell for monetary gain. This is usually so the character can buy spells or, buy a
            more powerful item. In the case of the item, they will probably buy it because even higher
            level groups are camping this choice item and there is no chance of them being able to get
            it legitimately.<br>
            <br>
            As you can see, there is a very powerful force encouraging people to camp. We must I think
            accept that camping is a normal part of the game. I can already hear some people crying
            &quot;but why don't they go elsewhere?&quot; Well, the other areas are as heavily camped
            and we all want our characters to become the most powerful they can, and to do this they
            require certain items. This is a player right as I see it . However I'm getting off the
            issue. The problem is excessive camping where a group camp a respawn spot and wont let
            anyone else have a turn. There are a number of contributing issue to this, number one
            being why do they stay so long? <br>
            <br>
            Well, the blame if any for this one should be laid at the game designers feet. It
            generally gets to respawn rate of the item and in a lot of cases it is woefully long. The
            warlord bracer respawn in crushbone can be anywhere from one to eight hours and this is an
            item that is part of a major quest. Number two is the new lore item rule where you can
            only have one of a specific item in your possession or bank. Has this new rule improved
            things? Again sadly no and from my observations, it has made camping worse. Sure it has
            made it so the players camping for an item for themselves or another player wont stay for
            more than one time. But..... they would have done this one time only. It's the money
            makers who are the problem in this area and the lore rule doesn't deter them. <br>
            <br>
            Here's roughly what they do if they are camping the Dvinn dagger in Crushbone. The party
            kills Dvinn and a group member who doesn't have a dagger loots the body. They then go
            outside and sell it for immediate profit or, transfer it to a newby character that a
            second player has created for this purpose. Meanwhile, the rest of the party is still
            camping the monster inside.<br>
            <br>
            So what are the alternatives?<br>
            <br>
            1. Verant should up the respawn rate for items and we would find that camping numbers
            would decline very quickly. It would also depress the resale market due to a glut. I can
            already see this happening with regard to ruined totem staffs. They started at 25 pp and
            are down to 12 last I saw. Needless to say, these items are fast to respawn.<br>
            2. Get rid of the lore items except in special circumstances. It isn't<br>
            working and is just wasting everyone's time. This means longer camping times.<br>
            3. Remove the no camp/no respawn zones. These cause more fights over trying to get other
            players to co-operate and stay out of them and once again, slow everything down.<br>
            4. Institute random item respawning across the board, except in special circumstances such
            as quest items. This would be easy to do. All verant have to do is divide all the magic
            items in the game into tables based on power. (say from levels 1 -26) When you kill a
            monster of a certain level, the game consults the table for that appropriate level and
            chooses an item. They could also program that a that monster of a certain level has a
            certain chance of having a magic item. For example, Dvinn in crushbone might be a 25th
            level monster. When you kill him, the game might have that he has a 50% chance of an item
            from table 12, a 30% chance from table 14 and a 5% chance from table 16. <br>
            <br>
            Simple! Doing this would add a bit of uncertainty to the game. It would also increase the
            number of monsters respawning magic items and therefore encourage people to kill other
            creatures. They could also expand this to include normal items. It would be great if there
            was a chance of finding something non-magic but interesting on other creatures. Maybe for
            example, an orc pawn has a 1% chance of dropping a 3pp gem. This would be a bonus and make
            some players day.<br>
            5. If we are really serious about the camping, they could also code it in so that a player
            can only loot a lore item a number of times per month. So after your 5th Dvinn dagger,
            that's it for the month.<br>
            6. Alternatively, they could code it so that the game keeps track as to how many times a
            party has killed a &quot;special&quot; monster and the next respawn is a monster that is
            extremely challenging for the levels of that party. It would then hunt them down and
            ignore others.<br>
            7. One wonders if the player numbers add to all these problems. When I was first looking
            at eq, I though it was stated that there would only be 1500 players per server. Now I am
            told it is 2000. Now it is possible that hardware requirements are capable of handling
            this increased number, but has the game been designed for this number? This may just be
            myth but if they have increased the number of players on each server without adjusting the
            game, it is possible that population pressure is responsible for some of the camping
            problems.<br>
            <br>
            Part of the fun of the game is having good items for your character. I believe game
            designers have a duty of care when it comes to this and wasted time. I mean by this that
            it doesn't really matter if every fighter has a Dvinn dagger and a bone bladed claymore.
            We play the game to get them and shouldn't spend hours of fruitless effort getting one.
            This doesn't mean that I am proposing that there should be an onslaught of these items.
            No, the changes I am discussing here could go too far the other way and that would mean no
            challenge and therefore the game would become boring. If every fighter has the Dvinn
            dagger and Bone bladed claymore, they should have to go through some sort of challenge to
            get it. An important point is that the players aren't in competition against each other,
            rather they are in competition against the game. The attitude that we must restrict an
            item so everyone of the appropriate level and class can't have one is absurd and should be
            stamped out.<br>
            <br>
            On The Issue of Class Balance<br>
            <br>
            The classes are fairly well balanced in my opinion. There are discrepancies that need
            work. The most unbalanced class are the (straight) Warriors. I commend Verdant on their
            action to fix this. I look forward to seeing how the fighters benefit. The only point here
            I would make is that part of the fun of the game is how your character improves as it goes
            up levels. I have heard that some classes max out at 40th level. If this is the case, it
            needs changing. I say this because there is a serious decrease in incentive to keep going
            if you cant see steady improvement.<br>
            <br>
            On the issue of Binding<br>
            <br>
            Only some spellcasters can bind themselves anywhere. This is a an anti-game fun issue as
            far as I can see it and I don't know why they made it this way. At the moment, we wait for
            the fighter (again) to run through up to 3 or more zones so he can have the privilege of
            getting his body back. In the meantime, everyone waits.<br>
            <br>
            Alternative:<br>
            Allow spellcasters to bind anyone anywhere or include a higher level spell called bind
            party. Once again remember the game is about fun and challenge. Is it fun or challenging
            wasting time running back to the area where you party is? I don't think so.<br>
            <br>
            On Matter of Guilds<br>
            <br>
            Great idea and easy to form. It would be good if guild officers could have a command to
            list guild members on and offline.<br>
            <br>
            Guild quests for initiation?<br>
            <br>
            I would like to see a system where a prospective member could be assigned a quest
            appropriate to their level to attain membership. When they brought back their proof and
            gave it to a guild officer, they would receive experience and maybe some money.<br>
            <br>
            Ok, if you've stuck with me this long we are nearly there. We are entering the area of my
            personal bias now. I play a soon to be 21st level Wizard called Elronn on the Tunare
            server (no it has nothing to do with L Ron Hubbard) My two pet beefs are magic resistance
            and the spell Force Shock.<br>
            <br>
            On Force Shock<br>
            <br>
            So many people complain about this spell that there must be something wrong with it. I am
            one of them. Where as my lower level spells were never resisted by greens and very very
            occasionally by blues, force shock is resisted by blues a significant amount of the time.
            I think verant should recheck their statistics on this spell (maybe someone missed
            something.) It should be effective from the level you get it. It should be remembered that
            we have a limited supply of mana before we med. Even one resist by a blue creature is
            serious.<br>
            <br>
            Magic Resistance<br>
            <br>
            The bane of my life! I understand why this is in the game. It is a control method but I
            think it is one too may. Pure spell casters like my Wizard are already controlled by the
            following: Low hit points (means you die quickly when you attract the monster attention),
            Low armour Class ( means the monsters can hit you more easily), Mana ( Means you can you
            can only blast so many times before you have to<br>
            med. <br>
            <br>
            Medding is when you pull out the big target and stick it on your back while you stick your
            nose in your spellbook. At this stage the level one monsters start hitting you in the back
            even though you are level 20 and can kill them quickly), monster attraction (This is when
            if you do too much damage to a monster, he ignores the world to hunt you down. He then
            discovers your lack of fighting ability, low ac and low hp), spell disruption (see
            previous point. This happens when the monster is hitting you while you are trying to
            cast), and damage reduction( This is some sort of system where your damage is reduced
            relative to the level of the monster you are fighting). As you can see, we are already
            pretty well controlled. Add onto the top of this, magic resistance and it is perhaps one
            control too many.<br>
            <br>
            Solution<br>
            <br>
            Remove magic resistance. Rework the damage reduction system so that if you attack over
            your 6 level limit, you do decreasing amounts of damage. I would change this because there
            is nothing more frustrating than being a piece of furniture when your party is fighting.
            This ranks low on my fun-o-meter. Even if the party attacked a monster that is going to
            kill them because it is high red, we should be able to scratch it like the fighter types
            can. Fighters also seem to do different amounts of damage according to the level of the
            monster. For example. If a party attacks a monster that is red to them and the fighters
            are doing 2-4 damage per hit, the wizards top spell might do 1-10 damage. He can only cast
            about 6 of them so the party will still go down but at least he has contributed to the
            fight. A sliding scale of damage reduction would be more fun that this all or nothing
            stuff. That just ruins game enjoyment and makes your spellcaster feel like he is useless.<br>
            <br>
            Well, that's it. I hope that some of my points have made you think as that's what this
            paper was supposed to do. I am looking forward to any replies. <br>
            <br>
            Please do not feel the need to flame me for having proposed something you don't like. Also
            if I've got a point wrong, I'd love to hear about it. As I pointed out at the beginning,
            most of this is from personal observation and from talking with other people.</td>
