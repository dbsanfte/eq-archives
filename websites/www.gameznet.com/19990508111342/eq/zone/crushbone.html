<p>Crushbone is the home to the Crushbone <a href="../beastiary/orc.html">Orcs</a>. This
zone is located in <a href="greaterfay.html">Greater Faydark</a>. If you are coming from <a href="felwithe.html">Felwithe</a> you can hug the zone edge to the right. When you see the
fires in the distance you will realize you have come to the entrance to Crushbone. This
dungeon is designed for characters 5-15 with the castle area holding some mobs to please
characters in the low 20's. <br>
<br>
There are several major portions of this zone. The front area(near the entrance) is
designed for lower level characters and contains mostly low level monsters(5-8). Up on top
of the hill you can find some monsters in the 8-12 level range. To the left of the
entrance and over the bridge you will see what looks like a small hill. Beyond that hill
leads to the mine area. The monsters back here range in the 8-10 level range. If you were
to turn right at the entrance and follow the wall you would be led to Crushbone Castle.
This contains the meaty monsters. You will find many mobs level 8-15 inside of the castle.
You will also find most of the name NPC's at the castle area. The emporer and the
ambassador are by far the highest level mobs at Crushbone(levels 18 and 19ish). <br>
<br>
Crushbone is the originating point of at least two different quests. These are the <a href="../quest/crushbelts.html">Crushbone Belts/Shoulderpads Quest</a> and the <a href="../quest/screamingmace.html">Screaming Mace Quest</a>. There are several good magic
items to be found in this zone as well.<br>
