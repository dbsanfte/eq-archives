          <tr>
            <td>With the addition of Kunark to the world of Norrath we have seen ten new levels of
            experience. These levels have given players more to aspire to and has also brought with it
            a whole slew of new(alleged) problems. <br>
            <br>
            One of the most debated of these is the melee vs. hybrid power shift in Kunark. Many
            hyrbids have complained that the new skill caps combined with the addition of disciplines
            have shifted the balance of power to pure melee types despite the hefty experience
            penalties of a hybrid.<br>
            <br>
            I have argued over this matter for quite some time on the message boards. In doing so I
            find myself constantly quoting the same information. Rather than continuing to do so I
            have decided to post the facts here to <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/index.shtml">EQ'Lizer</a>
            and let you make your own decisions. Of course I could not write an article such as this
            and not give my own opinions on the matter.<br>
            <br>
            I have split up this editorial into a few different sections to ease up on the load times.
            The first section handles the introduction and covers the basic information. The preceding
            sections cover new spells and disciplines on a level by level basis. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Introduction to Disciplines<br>
            </strong><br>
            I'm not going to get into spells because if you are reading this document i'm quite sure
            you already know how spells and mana work. Disciplines are a newcomer to Norrath however
            and many non-melee classes are still somewhat misinformed regarding them.<br>
            <br>
            Disciplines are not gained every level. They are spread out over different levels(almost
            every level). They can not be used over and over again. Each discipline has a base reuse
            time. These vary depending on the discipline. After using a discipline you will not be
            able to use any other discipline until the reuse time has expired. This means if the reuse
            time is 45 minutes you better be careful of when you pick to use this discipline. The
            reuse time decreases depending on your level. It will decrease one minute per level. The
            monks Stone Stance discipline for example has a 12 minute reuse time at level 51 but
            decreases to a mere 3 minutes at level 60.<br>
            <br>
            Many hybrids have based their comparison of themselves to melee classes post 50 on the
            more powerful disciplines. Some disciplines can be extremely powerful. It should be noted
            that these disciplines have a long reuse delay. One of the most common arguments I have
            heard is regarding melee defensive skills and their use against ultra mobs such as
            Trakanon or Venril Sathir. While these disciplines make melee types much more effective
            tanks against these mobs it should be noted that in most situations they will not be used.
            Meanwhile hybrids can be casting their spells in every battle. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Skill Caps<br>
            </strong><br>
            One major concern among hybrids is the raised skill caps of Kunark. Melee types have seen
            their skills rise substantially higher than hybrids in some cases. Rangers for example do
            not gain any defense points post 50 which signifigantly hurts their ability to tank.
            Meanwhile paladins and shadowknights see only 3 weapon skill points per level.<br>
            <br>
            This is fine if the spell selection can make up for it. Many concerned hybrids feel that
            it does not do so.<br>
              <br>
              I wanted to give a detailed comparison of each classes skill caps
              in this spot. Alas it proved to be a bit difficult to track down
              all of this information in such a short amount of time. I will
              fill this section in later as I obtain all of the information.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Kunark Equipment<br>
            </strong><br>
            The release of Kunark presented us with a plethora of powerful new equipment. Weapon wise
            most classes made out about equally with a great set of new weapons. Monks probably made
            out the best with the addition of a large number of one and two handed blunt weapons which
            feature extremely favorably damage:delay ratios. This should be expected however as monks
            needed these weapons to maintain their damage advantage over warriors and hybrids.<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps more controversial is the new kunark armors. All melee types and hybrids received
            new armor with the exception of monks. Monks received crescent armor but this was not up
            to par with shiverback hide. Other classes received a full set of new armor.<br>
            <br>
            This new armor is unique because it features an extremely high armor class but sacrifices
            the statistic and resistance advantages of planar armor. In return each piece can cast a
            different spell. <br>
            <br>
            The problem lies herein. Hybrid armor casts older spells in general that the hybrid has
            been casting for 20+ levels. Melee armor casts spells that these classes have never been
            able to cast, often nicer spells than the hybrid armor. Hybrids also suffer from lower
            wisdom or intelligence as a result which lowers their mana pool if they choose to go with
            the new armor. Melee types only lose out on strength, dexterity or agility which we all
            know affect your melee skills only slightly.<br>
            <br>
            To illustrate this fact you can take a look at the shadowknight gloves and helm. In
            exchange for a measly 7ac and two spells you will probably never use from those
            items(engulfing darkness and deadeye) a shadowknight loses 5 str, 14 int, 35 mana, 35 hp,
            10 vs cold, and 10 vs magic. For a level 60 shadowknight with 150 intelligence that would
            mean a loss of 203 points of mana. With that mana he could cast those two spells several
            times. <br>
            <br>
            To make matters worse these spells take twice as long to cast as the original versions
            which makes them less and less useful. For example the fear effect on shadowknight boots
            might make them useful for fear kiting. The problem is the low level fear expires many
            times almost immediately and then the shadowknight is left with a long casting time to
            recast(which will be interupted the majority of the time). <br>
            <br>
            Last but not least notice the large discrepency in armor class between the warrior and
            hybrid armors. I feel that the warrior armor should always have higher AC but in some
            cases(such as the gloves) it is ridiculously high(ac16 to ac25).<br>
            <br>
            To illustrate this fact here is a piece by piece comparison of the Kunark Armors. For
            hybrids I have listed the level at which they receive each spell normally. <br>

            I thik from the above illustration it is plain to see that melee types made out very well
