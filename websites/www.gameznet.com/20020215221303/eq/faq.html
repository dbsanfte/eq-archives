		  We get a ton of email here at EQ'lizer, and we can't answer everything. So we figured we would take some time to answer some of the most frequently asked questions that we find in our Inbox.
		  <p><font color="#FFFF00"><I>Q: How come you don't have [insert item here] listed? I can't find it on your equipment list!
		  <br></I></font>
		  <font color="#66CC00">A: Because nobody has submitted that item to us. It's not our fault, honest! If you can find a screenshot of this item to submit to us, we'll most likely post it. Since we don't have access to every piece of equipment out there, there are always going to be a few items that slip through our fingers(especially in the case of new items).</font></p>
		  <p><font color="#FFFF00"><I>Q: Why don't you list approximate prices for items on your page? This would really help me!
		  <br></I></font>
		  <font color="#66CC00">A: We don't do this because prices are drastically different for different items across different servers. On some servers, a blackened iron bastard sword is 300pp... On others, it can be 900pp. There really would be no way that we could keep up with changing server economies and such. This would be a lot of work, and we don't want people using our listings to control the economy on their servers, it just wouldn't be right.</font></p>
		  <p><font color="#FFFF00"><I>Q: Hey, I know you don't have [insert item here]'s location printed on your web page, but I really need to know, could you reply to me and tell me please?
		  <br></I></font>
		  <font color="#66CC00">A: No, sorry. If we don't print a location of an item, it's because we don't know for sure, or the person that submitted that item specifically requested that we don't reveal the location. We respect their wishes by not printing this on the page, or by giving it out through email.</font></p>
		  <p><font color="#FFFF00"><I>Q: Could you help me with [insert quest here]?
		  <br></I></font>
		  <font color="#66CC00">A: No, sorry. If we know it, it'll be posted on our quest page. As far as beyond that, 9 times out of 10, we really can't help.</font></p>
