            Additional Information by: Akaran DeHawk<br>
            <br>
            <font SIZE="2">The armor of Ro quest for the Paladin armor is one of the most time
            consuming quests we've yet seen. I'll try and outline the quest and add some spoilers for
            the folks who are utterly lost when confronting the paladins.<p>The quest begins at the
            Paladin camp in the Mountains of Rathe. Each of Norrath's Paladin guilds are represented
            here.</p>
            <p>To begin your quest, hail each Paladin and they will talk about the armor pieces. Each
            piece requires you to bring back an item to them.</p>
            <p>Before we begin I must note you MUST be viewed &quot;amiably&quot; or higher before you
            turn into any of the items. To do this visit each of the paladin guilds are Norrath and do
            some tasks to gain their acceptance.</p>
            <p>One note i'd also like to add to this is when asking if you are &quot;an honored
            member&quot; in the various guilds, even if they say that you are, this is *NOT* a
            gurantee that you will get the molds as this has happened to me already. So lets begin!</p>
            <p>Nicholas the lovable and oh so friendly dwarven paladin asks you to see Lord Datar in
            Kaladim and gain his loyalty.</p>
            <p>First off, make sure you are up to amiably with the dwarven clerics/paladins. The bone
            chip quest given in the paladin's guild is a quick way to being liked. After you have
            gained enough faction Nicholas asks you to return the Kilij plans to him before he will
            give you the mold. Search the desert of Southern Ro to find what he asks, specifically,
            look for a sand giant that isn't like the others. Once you obtain this and return it, the
            Boots of Ro mold is yours.</p>
            <p>Abigail is the High Elven paladin and requires you to return to her two dark cauldrons
            from the evil Teir`Dal. For this part start your quest in Mistmoore, the cauldrons you
            seek are fairly deep in so bring a powerful party with you. <br>
            <br>
            The cauldrons reside on the Ancille cooks which appear in the kitchen. This is an
            extremely dangerous area and should not be attempted without a strong party. Once you
            return the two cauldrons to her, the Breastplate of Ro mold is yours for the taking.</p>
            <p>Elisabeth sends you on a journey to find and slay the Nightfall giant that lurks in the
            west commons of Freeport.</p>
            <p>This one is tricky as the giant only appears at nightime, hence his name, Nightfall.
            Once you slay him and he's a bit tough, take his head and return it to her and the Greaves
            of Ro mold will be yours.</p>
            <p>Marianna holds the mold for the vambraces and this part of the quest gets very nasty.
            She tells you that some sharks have infested the waters near Qeynos and asks you to bring
            back 2 rotten shark portions to get the mold. These can be found in Erud's Crossing.</p>
            <p>Once you arrive at Qyenos, head for the docks and wait for the boat to arrive. Big Note
            here: At 36 when I engaged the sharks they tore me apart. I had to get some friends of
            mine to show up and do some massive spellcasting while I tanked for them.. I'd suggest
            doing the same, or at the least, bringing some backup. The plague sharks can be found in
            the water near the docks... and they are honestly on a 2hr spawn clock (no joke). If you
            don't see them immeadately, keep an eye out whenever the boats arrive.. they usually tend
            to swim around once the boats show up.. probably looking for any stray dwarves or gnomes
            that fall off. Once you get two portions of their diseased flesh (somthing to the tune of
            Rotten Shark Parts) return them to Marianna for the Vambraces of Ro mold. </p>
            <p>Joanna tells you that a fellow sentry, while venturing to Qeynos, was bitten by a wolf
            and now preys upon travellers in the hills, seek him out and return his locket and the
            Gauntlets of Ro mold is yours. Sentry Alechin supposedly walks the path from Lake Rathe to
            the Stone Bridge in South Karana. At night, his form is changed to that of a werewolf.</p>
            <p>I've yet to hunt him down as he is extremely elusive (at least to me or I'm in the
            wrong place). The locket will only appear when he is in werewolf form. Rumor has it that
            he is a named werewolf, although his name eludes me. For this one, you are on your own.</p>
            <p>Now, go speak with with Thomas, he holds the Helm of Ro mold. Your quest here is to
            return to him 2 skulls from the undead cyclops that lurk the plains. Head over to South
            Karana and start looking, it's quite a while before one actually appears and a tracker is
            essential for this. Once you return the skulls the helm mold is yours. Thomas will also
            speak to you about Lord Searfire, the dwarven smith who resides in the Temple of Solusek
            Ro, in the Lavastorm Mountains. He holds the secret to forging Ronium, the metal which the
            armor is composed of.</p>
            <p>Last but not least there is David, the Erudite Paladin. This lovely man who holds the
            bracer mold asks you to swim the waters of Lake Rathe and return to him 2 goblin nets from
            the deepwater goblin net masters. The goblins are a bit tough so bring some friends.
            Finding them is difficult if you do not have a tracker and the goblins swim all about the
            lake so its a good idea to have 2 trackers when searching. Be warned, if you are of low
            level do NOT engage the deepwater goblins that also swim the lake. These are extremely
            dangerous spellcasters who also pack a mean wallop with their fists.</p>
            <p>[NOTE: David is a paladin of the Deepwater Knights of Erudin. Currently there is NO way
            to raise faction with the Deepwater Knights. This is a longstanding bug which has yet to
            be fixed.]</p>
            <p>After you have gathered your molds your off to the Temple of Solusek Ro to meet Lord
            Searfire. Again your faction comes into play. You must be viewed Amiably or above, like
            with the rest of the Paladins, before he will tell you about Ronium. Shadowed men give a
            faction hit when killed or giving the Erudite in Southern Ro money for a scroll does too.
            There is also some place in Mistmoore but i'll let you find that out. <br>
            <br>
            Once your faction is high, Searfire will give you a cauldron to mix the Ronium in. Combine
            2 enchanted platinum bars(each in a seperate slot) , 1 bar of Melatite, 1 block of
            Mistmoore Granite, 1 Sands of Ro, and finally, some Soil of Underfoot. Once combined you
            will now have 1 bar of Ronium.</p>
            <p>Head to a forge and get your smithing skill up to master level. Now some folks say you
            don't need it to master level but i'm paranoid so I did it anyway. Once in the forge place
            the mold and 1 bar of ronium in it, DO NOT add water.<br>
            <br>
            Click combine and presto! You have a piece of the armor. 1 bar is required for each mold.
            I hope this helps my fellow Paladins in their quest to gather their sacred armor, it's not
            the best armor, nor the best looking (back to steel colored we go, save for the lovely
            copper boots and bracers) but in the end, the armor is quite good until you make it to the
            dreaded fear plane.</p>
            <p>Here is also a list of the temples where you may gain faction:</p>
            <p>Abigail: Felwithe Cleric's Guild or Paladin Guild<br>
            Nicholas: Kaladim Paladin and Cleric's Guild<br>
            Marianna: Temple of Life in Qeynos, Also the Knight's of Thunder Guild<br>
            David: Erudin, Deepwater Knights [Currently Non-Erudites can not seem to get any quests]<br>
            Joanna: Temple of Marr in Freeport also the Paladin's Guild<br>
            Thomas: Knight's of Thunder in Qeynos</p>
            <p>That's all there is to it. I hope this helps in obtaining the holy armor. Most of what
            I have outline in this guide is just a repeat of what the Paladins and Lord Searfire will
            tell you. The locations however are either to the best of my knowledge or I have actually
            gotten the items from them.</font></td>
