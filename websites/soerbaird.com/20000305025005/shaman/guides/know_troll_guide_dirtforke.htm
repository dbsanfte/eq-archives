                  <p>Greetings all. Since there seems to be a need for Shaman 
                    tactical guides, I decided that I would sit down and write 
                    one. I have finally reached the 19th level of enlightenment, 
                    and let me tell you, things only get better from here. All 
                    levels before 19 were utterly hellish, but now I can truly 
                    see the power of the Shaman, the Troll Shaman, coming to light.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">I. Why choose a Troll Shaman?</font></b></p>
                  <p>1. Regeneration. Regeneration is truly an awesome ability 
                    to have. It allows you to rely significantly less on healing 
                    for yourself, and more on the healing and buffing of others 
                    in your group, or offensive spells if you are solo. It is 
                    VERY nice to have when kiting the enemy, or simply running 
                    from a fight when low on health. Also, Regeneration and Chloroplast 
                    spells at later levels DO STACK on your existing Troll Regen. 
                    Cannibalize takes away 50 hit points and gives you 25 mana. 
                    Having fast hit point recovery is a vital advantage to the 
                    Shaman for the purpose of casting more and better spells.</p>
                  <p>2. Infravision. Ogres get this as well, and it is an invaluable 
                    benefit. One less buff you will have to cast on yourself.</p>
                  <p>3. Great stats. I personally think Trolls have the most efficient 
                    stats for a shaman. Shamans need to be strong and have stamina, 
                    but no where near as much as an Ogre has. Put as many points 
                    as possible into Wisdom, this should get you a 95 - not bad 
                    at all - and the rest into Agility and Dexterity. Your Strength 
                    and Stamina will be over 100 by default - more than enough 
                    for a priest class, and high enough to get you a decent bonus 
                    to your damage and hit points at later levels. </p>
                  <p>4. Cooler look. If you're an Ogre, you're just an oversized, 
                    obese, ugly humanoid. If you're a Troll, you've got big floppy 
                    ears, long pointy nose, and lots of chest detail down to that 
                    pot belly. We don't look nearly as stupid (facial expressions) 
                    as Ogres do; on the contrary many of our facial expressions 
                    are conivial and sly, even sinister. This is my opinion of 
                    course; others may differ. ;)</p>
                  <p>5. Better newbie area. Now, I've never actually BEEN an Ogre, 
                    I'll be the first to admit that. But, Innothule Swamp is an 
                    excellent newbie area, with lots of things to kill. We're 
                    also closer to the Orc camps of Southern Ro. I've been to 
                    the Ferrott and it just doesn't look that good for anyone 
                    past level 5. Running and swimming through the swamps here 
                    is excellent for raising your Swimming skill without even 
                    thinking about it. </p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">II. How does the Shaman 
                    solo?</font></b></p>
                  <p>In my opinion, the Shaman stands right behind the Druid as 
                    the best all-around solo class in the game, and at later levels 
                    probably surpasses them in terms of raw damage dealing power. 
                    We don't get their teleport spells, but we DO get Spirit of 
                    the Wolf and Spirit of the Cheetah for the speed that is key 
                    to both escaping and kiting your opponent, as well as excellent 
                    &quot;Damage Over Time&quot; spells. Here's a breakdown of 
                    what you'll be doing all the way to Level 20:</p>
                  <p><b>1. Level 1-5:</b> You'll be in the swamps of Innothule, 
                    killing froglok tads, lesser kobolds, and moss snakes. Like 
                    most priest classes, you start with a protective magic and 
                    a healing spell. Inner Fire, and Minor Healing. There is a 
                    Shaman quest in Grobb you should do to acquire a free Burst 
                    of Flame spell. Yay! By the way, another Shaman showed me 
                    a really neat trick: You can use the spell Inner Fire to heal 
                    yourself! When you cast Inner fire, it gives you 20 hit points 
                    for 10 mana, a very efficient spell indeed! In addition, it 
                    is an Abjuration spell, a skill which is generally slow in 
                    getting up because it is not cast as frequently as other spell 
                    types. Minor Heal gives you 12 hit points for 10 mana. Of 
                    course, you'll still want to cast Minor Heal frequently, to 
                    get that Alteration skill up. </p>
                  <p><b>2. Levels 5-9:</b> Frogloks are your main quarry at this 
                    point, both regular and the froglok fishermen. Mushroom-man 
                    trackers and water moccasins also. Around Level 7 or 8 you 
                    might try taking out the guards at the gates to Guk. As you 
                    go deeper into the swamp beware of kobold hunters, froglok 
                    foragers, and the dreaded Jojo: a very high level kobold that 
                    will eat you for lunch. You will probably want to find the 
                    large, stone hand out in the swamp. It is here that both Troll 
                    and Ogre Shamans can purchase their disease and poison spells, 
                    which are the mainstays of a Shaman's offensive potential. 
                    At level 9 you will get Spirit of Wolf, a key element to safe 
                    movement throughout most parts of Norrath. </p>
                  <p><b>3. Levels 10-14:</b> At these levels many Trolls will 
                    start thinking about going to South Ro, Oasis, and North Ro. 
                    At level 14, you receive Spirit Strike, a decent direct damage 
                    spell. Combine this with Tainted Breath (poison spell), and 
                    Spirit of Wolf, and you have a moderately effective way of 
                    kiting a creature. Here are some effective combinations with 
                    these spells:</p>
                  <p>a. Root and Blast: Do like the wizards do. Root your opponent, 
                    hope like heck that it holds them in place, and lay into them 
                    with Spirit Strikes. You should be able to get in 3, maybe 
                    4, at level 14, doing 250 points of damage. Beware, however, 
                    that your spells will fizzle more often than you would like. 
                    Fortunately, Verant made some recent modifications to fizzle 
                    so that one or two fizzles do not completely screw you.</p>
                  <p>b. Root, Disease, Poison, Blast: While the level 5 Sicken 
                    spell is a poor man's disease spell, it is effective in virtually 
                    stopping your opponent's hit point recuperation. It is very 
                    low mana and casts fairly quickly. Once cast, Sicken makes 
                    your Tainted Breath spell that much more effective, since 
                    your opponent won't be regenerating 1 or 2 hp per tick. After 
                    Sicken and Tainted Breath have been cast, use your remaining 
                    mana to blast. If you have a little mana left, you might want 
                    to cast another Tainted breath near the end of the fight to 
                    insure your opponent's fate. </p>
                  <p>c. Root, Disease, Poison, Kite: Kiting for a Shaman really 
                    isn't very effective until Level 24. Kiting for a Troll or 
                    Ogre Shaman can be particularly difficult and dangerous because 
                    you are killed on sight by merchants and other NPCs you might 
                    run by during the kite. Before you kite, always know the zone 
                    you are kiting in EXTREMELY well.</p>
                  <p>Always try to kite somewhat near the zone exit, because it 
                    is fairly common for things to go wrong. For obvious reasons, 
                    always be fully buffed with Spirit of Wolf and all other buffs 
                    you normally use. At level 14, the buffs I consistently used 
                    were Inner Fire, Feet like Cat, Turtle Skin, and of course, 
                    Spirit of Wolf. <br>
                    <br>
                    You can start out your kite with a Root, or just lay into 
                    it with a Disease spell right away. Root is a double-edged 
                    sword. If it works, then you'll PROBABLY have time to hit 
                    them with disease, poison, and a blast or two before you start 
                    running. If it doesn't work, then you'll have wasted 30 precious 
                    mana and have the monster chasing you already. The tricky 
                    part when you're running away is getting your spells off before 
                    they pound you. It's not that a little pounding is bad for 
                    a Troll Shaman. On the contrary, Shamans can take quite a 
                    beating, but even as a Troll Shaman your hit points are not 
                    going be anywhere near those of a melee class. You have to 
                    time it somewhat carefully because you need to stop, be motionless 
                    for 2 seconds, and then cast. If your spell is out of range 
                    when you try to cast it, don't worry --- keep clicking that 
                    spell button! By the time that creature comes within range 
                    of your spells it will be only a few seconds before it is 
                    upon you. Those precious few seconds are the time it will 
                    take for you to get off your spell, and start running again. 
                    When the creature is almost dead, you can turn around to engage 
                    directly. </p>
                  <p><b>4. Levels 15-20: </b>You'll be killing crocs and orcs 
                    in Oasis, orcs and gnolls in Highpass, kodiaks in West Commons, 
                    and possibly heading into a few dungeons here and there. Actually, 
                    I waited on entering any dungeon until I was level 19 and 
                    had the regular Healing spell. At level 19, you will receive 
                    the first of your powerful disease spells. This one, Affliction, 
                    does roughly 300 points damage: 25 initial, and 5 points per 
                    tick to 300. Remember, since mobs regenerate 1 hit point per 
                    tick, this effectively makes it 4 hit points per tick. Kiting 
                    can be made much more effective with this spell. You also 
                    get a couple of resistance debuffs: Malise and Insidious Fever. 
                    These aren't really that useful, however, until you have the 
                    mana to cast them. At level 24 you will get a nice poison 
                    spell (Envenomed Breath), which, in combination with the full 
                    length of Affliction, do around 500 damage to your opponent 
                    while you run around at a safe distance from them. </p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">FACTION: </font></b></p>
                  <p>Troll Shamans have advantages and disadvantages to their 
                    race. The biggest disadvantage by far is the KOS, or Killed 
                    on Sight, factor. You MUST CON EVERYTHING in a new, previously 
                    unexplored area. If they scowl at you, and are 'ready to attack', 
                    then that creature will attack you, simple as that. Once you 
                    reach level 34, or so, you may want to take some time to get 
                    faction up at strategic points around Norrath. These points 
                    include High Keep, Qeynos, Halas, and possibly Greater Faydark. 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>High Pass/High Keep:</b> Ah, the city besieged by baddies. 
                    Easy to make a name for yourself here killing orcs. Kill enough, 
                    and you will be able to move through High Keep to East Karana. 
                    I wouldn't stop to chat with anyone, though. As always, con 
                    everything before you make a move in its general direction. 
                    If you know the way through High Keep to the Karanas already, 
                    you should be able to avoid merchants, notorious for kicking 
                    Troll and Ogre butt when they least expect it. By killing 
                    the orcs first your faction should rise enough with the guards 
                    and the citizens to allow you a pass-thru to the Karanas. 
                  </p>
                  <p><b>Qeynos:</b> Again, one must pass through the Karanas to 
                    get here. Actually this one might not be too difficult. You 
                    can get to South Karana using the Ferrott-Mount Rathe-Lake 
                    Rathe route, but again, there is a bridge to cross. The place 
                    to increase Qeynos faction would be Black Burrow, I am sure. 
                    Kill lots and lots and lots of gnolls! </p>
                  <p><b>Greater Faydark: </b>You probably don't have to bother 
                    with this, but if you're ever in this zone, know that it is 
                    patrolled by the Wood Elf guards, and you never know where 
                    you might see one wandering. Kill lots of orcs near and in 
                    Crushbone to raise faction enough to wander this zone somewhat 
                    safely. </p>
                  <p><b>Halas: </b>You get here by travelling through Black Burrow, 
                    and I believe you raise faction by killing Ice Goblins en 
                    masse. It actually would be nice for a Troll or Ogre Shaman 
                    to be able to make a pit stop here and pick up spells and 
                    alchemy supplies. Also, Permafrost is a good dungeon, supposedly 
                    improved upon in recent updates with better equipment and 
                    more and varied monsters. </p>

                  <p>Shamans are powerful. They can:</p>
                  <p>1. Summon food and drink for themselves or others.<br>
                    2. Levitate over water or mountains, or cast levitate on others.<br>
                    3. Breathe underwater indefinitely with Enduring Breath (or 
                    cast this on others).<br>
                    4. Run faster than everyone else (except Druids and Bards) 
                    with Spirit of the Wolf, and later, Spirit of the Cheetah.<br>
                    5. Wear chainmail armour, as well as certain kinds of magical 
                    plate at later levels (Druids can't!). <br>
                    6. Summon a magical pouch for heavy items to be contained 
                    in. (They have no weight while in this pouch!)<br>
                    7. Cast invisibilty to animals, and regular invisibility at 
                    later levels. <br>
                    8. Cast some of the BEST buffs in the game. <br>
                    9. Cast good &quot;damage over time spells, and some of the 
                    BEST damage over time spells in the game at later levels.<br>
                    10. Summon pets (wolf spirits) at later levels (34+).<br>
                    11. Amazing regenerative powers at later levels, both for 
                    mana and for hit points!</p>
                  <p>There will be other and better Shaman guides written by others, 
                    I am sure. I am only level 19 right now, but as I rise into 
                    the upper ranks I will update this document further with new 
                    strategies for this awesome, well-balanced class!</p>
