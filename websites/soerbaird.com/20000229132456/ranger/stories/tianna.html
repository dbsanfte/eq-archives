              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ugh. 
                I woke up one morning behind a tree in Surefall Glade. I looked 
                around me dazedly to confirm that yes, indeed, I was behind a 
                tree. I stood up slowly and it hit me -- I had spent all of the 
                previous evening carousing with my beloved Findail and a couple 
                of friends that we hadn't seen in a very long time. We had a blast, 
                consuming great quantities of fishwine and scaring all the people 
                on the Qeynos dock with our levitating and staggering hither and 
                thither over the water, dock and boat. And I had awakened still 
                drunk. Not a good way to start the day, especially when my goal 
                for this day was to become a master fletcher, like my father before 
                me. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Shaking 
                off the tendrils of hazy sleepiness, I decide on making a run 
                to town. I needed to go to the bank anyways. I stepped around 
                the still sleeping form of my betrothed and headed off through 
                the caves to the hills surrounding Qeynos. Not many were yet awake 
                and the dawn was dewy and sweet smelling. The run was pure exhilaration 
                and I was able to think clearly again by the time I reached Qeynos. 
                I ran straight to the bank and then headed back to Surefall. No 
                time to dawdle today. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Back 
                in Surefall I bought up all of the arrow parts that I could carry 
                from Jarse Kedison and quickly made my way into the bear caves, 
                so that I could be clear of any distractions. Fletching has been 
                difficult for me, and it requires the utmost concentration on 
                my part. Still, I continue with it, in memory of my father. I 
                settled down, balancing the book of fletching on one leg and bringing 
                my backpack full of arrow parts closer to me. I pulled out the 
                pieces I would need and started toiling away -- 'point, shaft, 
                nock, fletch', over and over again, sometimes badly mangling the 
                shaft or fletch, but most times coming up with right serviceable 
                arrows. In no time at all, I had depleted my stock of parts, and 
                a bundle of arrows lay on the ground next to me. I got up, stretched, 
                and started to run back to Jarse. I figured he'd want to buy my 
                arrows to sell to other rangers, and I could get better parts 
                and learn to put those together. This is what I was thinking as 
                I stepped lightly around the sleeping bears, patting the little 
                ones on their heads. Imagine my surprise at suddenly coming face 
                to face with a poacher! He didn't even have a chance to really 
                see me before I leapt to attack him, my scimitar flashing. Although 
                he put up a good battle, my rage and fighting skill helped me 
                get the better of him. I took his head to Gillarian, who had told 
                me of the poachers that would have long ago made the bears of 
                Surefall extinct, without the help of the rangers and druids sworn 
                to protect them. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Jarse 
                took my arrows in exchange for more arrow parts, and I set to 
                fletching again. These arrows were more difficult, but much nicer, 
                and I took pride in seeing how well they looked when I had done 
                with them. Again I trundled my load back to Jarse and again bought 
                more parts, always upgrading and learning to make better arrows. 
                He commented on my growing skill and I began to grow excited at 
                the prospect of holding the title of master. At long last I exhausted 
                my reserves of money and yet had not quite attained my goal. It 
                was close though. I began to think about the treant wood bow staff 
                I had set aside for the day that I could try making a Trueshot 
                bow. I remembered that I needed to get some Dwarven wire from 
                a recalcitrant dwarf in the city of Kaladim. It was so close. 
                I decided to go back home, even though it was a long journey, 
                and attempt to make my Trueshot bow in the land where it was born, 
                the Greater Faydark.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                I had made the trip between Surefall and Kelethin many times, 
                and as such, knew the best route to take like the back of my hand. 
                I nudged Findail to tell him of my plan, but he was still fast 
                asleep. He knew the tricks of how to camoflauge himself and others, 
                and could call down the spirit of a wolf to quicken your feet 
                and speed your journey. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                trip would be much longer without him, but he looked as if he 
                could sleep forever. I could not wait. I left him a note and started 
                my journey. My path was clear and the journey uneventful, until 
                I crossed the old timber bridge and found myself in the Eastern 
                Plains of Karana. I shivered and wondered how I could get across, 
                without knowing how to camoflauge myself. I knew how terrible 
                the claws of the griffons could be, especially when a lion or 
                two joined in. I cursed myself for my foolishness and was just 
                about to turn back, when I saw that the way was open before me. 
                I scrunched up my determination and I ran for my life, aiming 
                for a certain gorge that could be easily traversed, if one knew 
                the way. Throughout this heart-pounding run I had to quell the 
                urge to look behind me to see if I was being followed, and I gave 
                a wide berth to an evil eye that I spotted in the distance. Soon 
                the walls of the gorge loomed over me, and half of the most harrowing 
                part of the journey was behind me. I rested for a short time, 
                in the lee of the mountain. Gathering my fortitude again, I prepared 
                to climb halfway up the wall of the gorge and run along the tiny 
                path that I knew was up there. First though, was a short sprint 
                to the place where one could find a way up. I sprinted in and 
                rounded a curve and stopped dead in my tracks -- for there were 
                two evil eyes and a vertitable carnival of minotaurs ahead. I 
                must admit I was shaking with fear at this point. I had lately 
                learned how to sneak up behind monsters and escape their notice, 
                but I hadn't been practicing this skill at all. Even while mentally 
                kicking myself for that, I decided to try and sneak along the 
                wall. Much to my surprise, it actually worked, and I was able 
                to come to the place where one can begin to climb without any 
                of them noticing me. I was terrified to turn my back and start 
                to climb, but I had to. So I climbed up. Once at the tiny ledge, 
                I began to quietly walk towards the far end of the Gorge, heart 
                beating very fast. I jumped for joy when I saw the entrance to 
                the goblin clan of Runnyeye's caves. I had made it, and the rest 
                of the run ahead of me was nowhere near as dangerous. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                rest of the journey was uneventful. Trantor Everhot was as chancy 
                as always, but he gave me a spool of his dwarven wire once he 
                saw that I had a couple of his favourite drinks to give to him. 
                I arrived in the sweet city in the trees of my birth, and I was 
                nearly ready to attempt to create a Trueshot bow. I gathered up 
                all of the supplies that I would need (still more arrows to make 
                though, before I could feel comfortable enough to be called a 
                master, as well as all of the components for the bow) and headed 
                into the less populated area of the forest (the Lesser Faydark 
                as we call it) to do my fletching and my first bow attempt in 
                peace and quiet. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                the arrows I was making began to seem trivial to make, I decided 
                it was time. Even though I didn't expect to be able to make the 
                bow right away, my heart skipped a beat as I gathered the materials 
                together in my lap. I opened the book on bowyering and laid it 
                tenderly on the grass next to me. I gathered the treant wood staff 
                into my lap and began to move the plane in a gentle sweeping motion 
                over the staff. When the curve was just right I began to attach 
                the dwarven wire and the micro-servo and I botched up the whole 
                job. The staff cracked and now I'll need to get another. </font></p>

                I feel I learned from the experience. And there's lots of arrows 
                left that I don't know how to make. I will learn them and try 
                again, and again, until that bow is mine. In the meantime, I got 
                together the materials for an ashwood bow, and was quite happy 
                when I made it just fine. </font></p>

                bad for my first bow attempt! </font></p>
