              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                personally use this zone to develop all of my characters when 
                they first begin. This zone is easily hunted from seasons 1 to 
                15. You can either start by gaining a few quick levels in Greater 
                Faydark, or head right over to Steamfont. It's not a dangerous 
                trip and you can see the directions by following the maps on this 
                site. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                a level 1, stick to the rats, kobold runts and decaying gnome 
                skeletons. There are three distinct areas to find them. One is 
                in front of the windmills heading from Ak Anon. You'll see a large 
                valley to the right of the road. That valley and its surrounding 
                areas should provide you with near unlimited prey. This area is 
                usually populated with more players due to the fact that you are 
                in the middle of two guards. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                an alternative, there are dragon bones straight out from the city. 
                You can hunt around there and be close to a guard if you get in 
                trouble. Be warned however, there are 4 skeleton spawn points 
                around the bones and if you get too close, they will eat you for 
                breakfast, cackling the whole while. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                third site is usually far less busy and has a lot more creatures 
                in my opinion. The main drawback is there is no guard close should 
                you choose to run. This site can be found by heading left when 
                you exit the city, or if you are coming from the lesser faydark, 
                it will be on your right. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Things 
                to note while fighting decaying gnome skeletons, rats and kobold 
                runts. Kobold runts and the decaying skeletons will attack on 
                sight for any race I have seen so far at the lower levels. So 
                be warned as you are fighting and keep an eye out on your surroundings 
                as multiple enemies at this level can be the death of you. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                far as loot, the decaying skels have often been known to carry 
                around various rusted weapons and coin. The kobold runts are also 
                nice because they can carry various sizes of bags and boxes and 
                the occasional rusty dagger, as well as coin. Rats drop various 
                portions of their anatomy, but you can sell all of it for some 
                copper at least and most of the items are stackable except for 
                the ears and fur.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Important note here.. DO NOT go to the city to bind or sell. There 
                is a clockwork jeweler that often sits at the entrance of Ak Anon 
                that will kill any follower of Tunare.. and as you know, most 
                of us Rangers are. You can sell at the vendors at the mill if 
                you are fighting there, the huts up by the city if you are fighting 
                by the dragon bones (you'll have to duck to enter the little houses) 
                or if you are fighting out by the newbie kobold camp, there is 
                a vendor that sits beside the teleport ruins. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Continue 
                killing these baddies until you are level 3. Once you hit 3, you 
                can go after some tougher enemies. These include Runaway Clockworks, 
                Diseased Rats and Spiderlings. I personally never fight the diseased 
                rats. They have little if any loot and it is VERY annoying to 
                have to wait around for your disease to wear off. Go after the 
                spiderlings; they have good loot in the form of spiderling silk 
                and are pretty good experience for a couple of levels. Make sure 
                you /con them though as they vary from level 3 to 4. At level 
                3, you would be hard pressed to beat a level 4 spiderling. Also 
                note that the spiderlings and their mechanical cousins will gang 
                up on you if they see you beating on friends. If you want to try 
                the runaway clockworks, they are the same levels as spiderlings 
                (3 to 4) and they drop coin as loot and the occasional black box 
                fragment. (worthless) The thing I love about fighting the clockworks 
                is that "ting" when you hit them :) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
                you hit level 4, the fun starts. You can continue to solo, but 
                you'll have a harder time doing it as there are less roaming mobs 
                that will con blue to you. Your best bet is to hit the kobold 
                camp, which is to the left of the city proper, with a small group 
                of level 4's and 5's or so. Three kobolds spawn in that camp and 
                another spawns nearby on the hillside. If you want you can solo 
                the one on the hill, but it is more time consuming. The kobolds 
                at the camp range from level 4 to 6, so you'll get some good exp 
                there. Occasionally a kobold shaman will spawn, but he isn't much 
                tougher than the others with the exception of some minor spell-casting 
                abilities. Like their younger siblings, the kobolds drop various 
                containers and pretty decent coin for this level. I have also 
                seen them drop semi precious stones (malachite and jasper.) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                is another kobold camp in this zone, but it is patrolled by harder 
                creatures and there are more that spawn (4 spawn at camp and one 
                on hill.) If you have a larger group and can follow the <a href="newbiesteam.gif">map</a> 
                (I edited it to show you level areas) on this site, you might 
                do well there as it is lessed camped. You can reach level 7 with 
                these techniques so far, although you'll find 6 to 7 is tough 
                by staying at camp. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
                I hit level 6, I like to take my party up to the windmills (or 
                you can hit the area where the other kobold camp is.) At the windmills, 
                you can take kobold scouts, pumas and rogue clockworks. These 
                enemies range from level 5 to about 8. The kobold scouts are a 
                little tougher than the kobolds and drop the same kind of loot. 
                The rogue clockworks are pretty good exp and they drop blackboxes 
                (can be used to affect faction.) Be wary when fighting the rogue 
                clockworks as they often bring rogue cleaners with them. These 
                rat-like beasts don't hit too hard, but they are annoying and 
                can group quickly. I have seen the cleaners rarely drop backpacks 
                (don't ask me where they put them.) The pumas are by far the hardest 
                at this level, yet yield a greater experience reward. They hit 
                pretty hard and fast for their level, but the most dangerous fact 
                is that you can not outrun them. They often yield ruined cat pelts 
                which you can work on your tailoring with. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                battling these monsters, you'll become more familar with the zone 
                and you'll wonder where to go now. By now you should be level 
                8 to 9. From here you have a couple of different options depending 
                on you modus operandi. My personal path leads me to start taking 
                on skeletons and young ebony drakes. These enemies can be found 
                in two main places in the zone and there are a couple of notable 
                skele spawn points. The skeletons hit hard and have lots of hit 
                points, but they often drop pieces of gold as loot along with 
                various cloth armor. The fire drakes have mediocre loot and they 
                hit pretty hard because of their fire based breath attack (if 
                you are level 9, you can help somewhat with endure fire.) You 
                can hit the roaming skels at the mills, but that often attracts 
                the attention of annoying and deadly giant plague rats. Make sure 
                when you hit level 8 and 9 that you train to get spells and dodge.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                You can try camping the dragon skeleton, but this brings up two 
                problems. One is that area is often camped. Two is that there 
                are three skel points at the tail end of the dragon skel and any 
                two adjacent skels are linked. My favorite place in the whole 
                zone is to go out by the "cogs" and fight the skeletons out there. 
                You'll need a good group of 3 to 4 people around level 9 to do 
                this. A cleric will really help as they can heal and have ward 
                undead. The nice thing about this skele spawn area is that there 
                are 5 spawn points there. They are widely spread out and none 
                of them are linked. You won't have to worry too much about roaming 
                enemies either. IMPORTANT NOTE: Keep an eye on tracking if you 
                decide to hunt here as this is where the Minotaur hero spawns 
                randomly. He is a very aggressive level 45+ that will tear the 
                zone's occupants (even guards) to shreds when he gets on a rampage. 
                You can easily make a few plat in money per hour and hunt this 
                area until level 12 or 13. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
                you hit level 12 or 13, you can either move into the minotaur 
                caves (check out our <a href="steamminos.html">guide</a> to Steamfont 
                mino hunting,) or stay out in the fields outside of the mino cave 
                entrance. Inside the mino caves you will find a few wandering 
                minotaur slavers ranging from level 12 to 15. Occasionaly they 
                will carry the much-coveted minotaur battle axe that is a favorite 
                weapon around these levels. Be careful when fighting minos though 
                as they often group up and cause havoc in numbers. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You 
                can venture outside the caves to find giant Rogue Clockworks, 
                Earth Elementals, Harpies and Lesser Ebony Drakes. These monsters 
                all range from levels 12 to 15 and usually offer pretty good experience. 
                However, most of them drop little if any loot, yet the Earth elementals 
                can drop precious stones. Keep in mind that the Lesser Drakes 
                and the Harpies have fire based attacks which can affect your 
                entire group. The clockworks and elementals tend to group up as 
                well, so be careful. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
                you hit level 15, you are essentially done with this zone. You 
                can find an occasional blue enemy, but they yield little if any 
                exp. The only reason I see people stay is to maybe gather minotaur 
                axes for sale in other areas. </font></p>
