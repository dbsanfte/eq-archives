              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Traveling 
                alone has always been my true love. I suppose that is why I became 
                a member of Faydarks Champions. I love to wander through the land, 
                exploring every hill and valley until I know the land like the 
                back of my hand. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was 
                exploring in the Commons when I came upon a pass in the hills. 
                I followed this pass and it led me to a forest. The dense trees 
                blocked out the very light of the sun and an strange chill went 
                down my spine. I immediately knew this place was dangerous and 
                yet I felt so at home. The place drew me in and I began searching 
                for signs of its inhabitants. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
                the tracks of a human led me to a rangers station. I entered the 
                station and started a conversion with Morin Shadowbane. I learned 
                then that the forest I had discovered was named after the great 
                wood elf ranger, Kithicor. Kithicor was not always the dark place 
                that it is now. Some darkness has entered the woods and now threatens 
                the very existence of the forest. It consumes the forest and Kithicor 
                himself. Morin desperately tries to hold ground against the darkness 
                but the rangers are losing and are in dire need of assistance. 
                Morin told me that if I was up to the task that they were in great 
                need of weapons and information. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
                told me that the rangers here required the legendary Ebony Blade. 
                I had heard of this blade and knew that it was to be found in 
                lands that I, being young and inexperienced, would be unable to 
                obtain. But information, I was good at gathering information. 
                Morin went on to explained that there was a dark messenger, one 
                that lived beyond death, that carried information to and from 
                the darkness that consumed Kithicor and the undead camps in Karana. 
                He went on to explain that if I were able to apprehend this messenger 
                and bring back any information that he might be carrying, that 
                I could have his sword as my reward. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I promised 
                Morin that I would do my best to do this for him, for my love 
                of the forest, and for my devotion to my brother rangers. I left 
                him then and started upon my long journey. I traveled throughout 
                the land asking all that I encounter if they had any news of this 
                messenger. I journeyed long and hard and everyone I asked had 
                the same story. There is no messenger, he does not exists. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I traveled 
                throughout the lands of Highpass; journeyed into the Karanas; 
                visited the wee little folk of Rivervale and still no messenger. 
                I fought goblins in Misty Thicket, gnolls in East Karana, and 
                the Orcs that block the pass but everywhere it was the same. No 
                one had seen him and most had never even heard of him. Tired and 
                frustrated I turned back to Kithicor. I had failed and my head 
                hung low as I returned to Morin to tell him my sad tale. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
                I approached Morins cabin to deliver the news of my failure, I 
                encounter a beautiful wood elf. I could tell by her dark green 
                armor that she was a ranger of many seasons. Her beautiful smile 
                and graceful presence brought joy to an otherwise sorrowful day. 
                I ventured into a conversation, intrigued by her beauty, but in 
                actuality, avoiding my unpleasant task. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tansia 
                was her name and we sat about idly chatting. Eventually I confessed 
                to her the purpose of my travels and of my ultimate failure. She 
                smiled and for an instant my heart sank as I thought she was thinking 
                me the fool. "I have good news for you brother ranger", she said. 
                "Recently I was traveling back from Qeynos when I caught sight 
                of this messenger. I know for a fact that you can find him if 
                you travel to the undead camps of West Karana."</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The 
                journey to West Karana was not that far and if I hurried I could 
                reach it by nightfall. Invigorated by her words, I thanked her 
                and quickly left. It was a long hot journey; full of perils along 
                the way; but as the sun began to set, I came to West Karana. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Donning 
                my best camouflage, I left the path and headed south towards the 
                undead camps. There were many signs of things that walked without 
                life. Some were old and some were not, but the tracks foretold 
                of an evil presence. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                was not long before I came upon some fresh tracks and my pulse 
                quickened as I raced to encounter with my prey. Would this be 
                him? Would I finally see the object of all my trials? </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                all my journeys I have encounter many of the living dead. Many 
                have I fought and few have I feared. Call me young, call me foolish 
                but I was never prepared for what was about to come. Foolhardily, 
                I raced toward an unknown foe and it was not long before I caught 
                sight of it. At first I thought that it was like many of the other 
                living dead and quickly engaged it in battle. But this was no 
                ordinary ghoul, he stood half a head taller than any that I had 
                seen and he delivered blows that cracked my ribs when he struck. 
                The fight had barely started but I knew the fool I was. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
                delivered blow after blow and it would not be long before the 
                buzzards would be cleaning the meat from my bones if I did not 
                turn to run. I swung one last time and turned to run only to find 
                that my legs had not the strength to move. My foe was greater 
                than I and there was not to be done. I turned back to my foe and 
                valiantly fought, knowing full well that it would be to my death 
                and not his. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He 
                swung quick and hard and the obvious end was near. I said my final 
                prayers as I swung my sword and axe for I knew that soon I would 
                face Tunare. The world went black and next thing that I was to 
                see would be in another world. And when I opened my eyes, the 
                billowy white clouds and blue sky was all that I could see. That 
                is, until he leaned over me to apply another bandage.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I 
                could tell by his painted face that this was not the heaven I 
                had prepared for. He stood now and towered over me. He was as 
                tall as the trees, or so it seemed to me. The muscles of his arms 
                fought against the constricting bands of his armor and I knew 
                him to be a barbarian of the frozen north. He looked to be a great 
                warrior. His armor was torn in places and he bled from many others. 
                He had recently fought a great battle and he was the obvious victor. 
                A wolf sat by his side and he spoke to it as if it understood 
                him. It seems that he had seen the battle and come to my aid. 
                He fought off the messenger just as I fell and he nursed me back 
                to health. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sitting 
                up I glanced around to see the messengers corpse laying near our 
                camp. My new found friend informed me that he had searched it 
                and that it had upon it some note that he had no use for; that 
                I was welcome to it if I wanted. I rested a little longer to regain 
                my strength. I rose then took the note from our common foe. Sitting 
                by the fire I slowly unrolled it to see what it might be. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
                heart leapt as I came to realize that this was the information 
                that Morin required. I rested a little longer with the barbarian 
                and his wolf. I thanked for him all his help and asked if there 
                was anything that I could do for him. "A few rations if you have
