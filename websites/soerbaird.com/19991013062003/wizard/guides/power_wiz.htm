                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>Let me start by saying that I start all my caster characters 
                      on Faydwer for one reason, easy money and experience. I 
                      have tried wizards on Odus and Antonica but I find that 
                      leveling is slow and tedious.</p>
                    <p> First off if you are a high elf or wood elf caster type 
                      (I define casters as mana wielding non-hybrid classes) don't 
                      worry about this little beginning, skip to the first section.</p>
                    <p> For gnomes, I suggest an immediate departure from Steamfont. 
                      Why you ask? Because Steamfont in my opinion is one of the 
                      worst experience gaining areas for a defenseless caster. 
                      You can find the zone to Lesser Faydark by following the 
                      road you encounter while leaving Ak'Anon. Once in Lesser 
                      Faydark follow the right wall until you happen upon a second 
                      zone entrance. Zone through and you shall find yourself 
                      in Greater Faydark! Your journey is now over. </p>
                    <p>For dwarves, try to make your way to Greater Faydark as 
                      soon as possible, because although Butcherblock is for your 
                      level, you will find it extremely tedious finding creatures 
                      your level that are close by guards in case something happens. 
                      When you leave Kaladim you shall also see a road. Head left 
                      on the road until you encounter the fabled crossroads. Turn 
                      left again and follow the road to the Greater Faydark zone 
                      entrance. For Humans that start in Freeport, gain a level 
                      or 2 and then take the boat to Butcherblock. Follow the 
                      road until you hit the crossroads (don't get discouraged 
                      it's a long walk) and turn left. Follow the road into Greater 
                      Faydark.</p>
                    <h4>Levels 1 to 4</h4>
                    <p>At level 1 try to stay near Kelethin or Felwithe. I leveled 
                      my gnome wizard near Felwithe because Wood Elf guards are 
                      very slow. Try to attack Decaying Skeletons, Bats, and Giant 
                      Wasp drones at levels 1 and 2. But be careful--giant wasp 
                      drones tend to swarm, and if you're not careful you'll end 
                      up with 4 wasps all attacking you at once.</p>
                    <p> Also at level 2 take the occasional orc pawn or pixie 
                      trickster but /con them first.</p>
                    <p> At level 3 I went to Kelethin and hovered between the 
                      &quot;orc lift&quot; and orc camp, picking off stray pawns. 
                      If you cannot afford your spells when you hit level 4, I 
                      suggest doing the bard mail delivery quest that requires 
                      you to take mail from Felwithe to Kelethin.</p>
                    <h4> Levels 4 to 8</h4>
                    <p> At this point the paths diverge. You can choose to stay 
                      in Greater Faydark, or move off to Butcherblock.</p>
                    <p><b><font color="#660000">Greater Faydark</font></b></p>
                    <p>At level 4 I partied with maybe 1 or 2 friends my level 
                      and fought on the &quot;orc hill&quot; in the orc camp because 
                      I needed money for my spells and centurions drop some of 
                      the best money for their level.</p>
                    <p> At level 6 or so I went to the bandit camp which is located 
                      roughly at negative 1100 negative 400. 3 bandits spawn but 
                      they swarm, so try to get a party. The spawn rate is a bit 
                      slower, but the loot in money is good and the experience 
                      is also acceptable.</p>
                    <p><b><font color="#660000">Butcherblock </font></b></p>
                    <p> From Greater Faydark, the Butcherblock zone is found by 
                      following the road left from Felwithe.</p>
                    <p> At level 4 stay near the &quot;2 houses&quot; which are 
                      found by following the road that starts at the zone. Suggested 
                      creatures at level 4 are large snakes, and giant skunks. 
                      As you become higher level move further down the path. The 
                      only problems with this area are A) there is almost no loot 
                      whatsoever and B) many higher level creatures such as goblin 
                      wizards roam around the road.</p>
                    <p> Also at level 7, maybe level 6, you can go to the skeleton 
                      spawn points, the tower and the ruins. This is some of the 
                      fastest experience you will get but the loot consists of 
                      cloth and bones.</p>
                    <p> On a final note if you are on the road and you see a NPC 
                      ogre, run like the wind. It is either Corflunk the ogre 
                      warrior (roughly level 10) or Zarchoomi his shaman wife 
                      (roughly level 11).</p>
                    <h4>Levels 8 to 12</h4>
                    <div align="left"> 
                      <p>At this point (level 8) you should start heading into 
                        Clan Crushbone in Greater Faydark. Stay near the entrance 
                        and the &quot;trainer hill&quot;. Orc centurions drop 
                        good loot, 1 or 2 gold per kill, plus whatever weapons 
                        they are carrying.</p>
                      <p> If you're a bit adventurous, you can go to the slaver 
                        pits which can be found by following the left wall at 
                        Crushbone entrance, crossing the bridge, and going over 
                        the craggy rocks. Once again the most you will take centurions 
                        and the occasional /conned blue slaver.</p>
                      <p> At level 9 you can head into the entrance and the very 
                        beginning of the castle. Partying is highly recommended 
                        here because all sorts of orcs will attack you that are 
                        not your level.</p>
                      <p>At level 11 venture into the Throne room of the castle 
                        and stay near a window, dropping out of it if the orcs 
                        are killing you. Also beware of the 3 NPCs that spawn 
                        in the tower (room behind the throne): Ambassador DVinn, 
                        Emperor Crush, and Lord Darish. Any one of those three 
                        will kill you so fast, you'll think you are level 2. </p>
                      <p>Although I have not tried, I hear that Steamfont skeletons 
                        are also good for experience, but as a caster (who is 
                        not tweaked) money is essential for new spells. While 
                        in Steamfont head towards the windmills and then follow 
                        wall until you enter what the players call the dragon's 
                        skeleton.</p>
                      <p> <b>[<i><font color="#660000">Tollo's Note</font></i>: 
                        </b><font color="#333333">Steamfont skeletons near the 
                        dragon skeleton or near the 'gears' are an excellent source 
                        of experience, and solo'able by a wizard at levels 10 
                        and 11. Just Root/Nuke until dead, but be ready to run. 
                        Having a Shadowstep/Gate combo is essential here. Also, 
                        be cautions about attacking these skeletons; the plague 
                        rats will assist them. Also, beware the Minotaur Hero</font>.<b>]</b></p>
                      <p>At level 12 there is a place called the Chessboard in 
                        Butcherblock. This is great exp, but no loot. Kill undead 
                        pawns, but not much else.</p>

                          and buy all you can, then put all your belts and pads 
                          in the Kelethin bank. I had two small boxes and a couple 
                          of small bags, it worked great.<br>
                          <br>
                          Every three days or so, make the run to Kaladim. Go 
                          to the bank and get out all your pads and belts, then 
                          turn them in. If you've gotten any skeleton bones on 
                          the way there, turn them in to the paladin in the back. 
                          You get TONS of exp and can sell all the loot you get 
                          in exchange for both for a pretty penny. <br>
                          <br>
                          Once you're done, talk to the postman and get a letter 
                          for Kelethin, then make the run to the butcherblock 
                          docks and get a second letter for delivery to Kelethin. 
                          Then, gate yourself back to the orc lift, make the quick 
                          run to the priest lift and turn the two letters in. 
                          Voila! Instant exp! <br>
                          <br>
                          Now go back to Crushbone and loot and buy as many pads 
                          and belts as you can, rinse lather and repeat! You've 
                          got to get the pads and belts off your kills to REALLY 
                          make Crushbone worthwhile. I've gotten at least three 
                          bubbles of EXP just from belts. Don't forget to deliver 
                          the mail, cause with your gate it's instant exp. </div>

                      <h4>Levels 12 and beyond...</h4>
                    </div>
                    <div align="left"> 
                      <p>Although under extreme debate, at level 13 I went to 
                        the Oasis of Marr. While in Butcherblock go to the docks 
                        and board the next ship. Do not get off at any of the 
                        docks in the Ocean of Tears. You will zone eventually 
                        into East Freeport, and you will get off there. Leave 
                        Freeport via the South Gate and head straight until you 
                        zone into the Desert of North Ro. Keep heading straight 
                        until you hit the beach. Facing the ocean turn right and 
                        head down the beach until you zone into the Oasis.</p>
                      <p> Now the Oasis is a pretty nasty place- Sand Giants (level 
                        30s) and Dry Bone Skeletons (level 20s) roam free. But 
                        at level 13 if you party you can kill some caiman and 
                        possibly a crocodile.</p>
                      <p> At level 15 start soloing caiman for fast experience.</p>
                      <p> At level 16 you can take crocodiles solo or fight orc 
                        warriors. Keep in mind, there are no guards here, so always 
                        look for other creatures that might be trained on you 
                        if you attack your target.</p>
                      <p> At level 17 the land of Faydwer is yours. You can head 
                        back to Crushbone and kill emissaries (level 15) or party 
                        with people in Unrest (found by going through Butcherblock 
                        to Dagnor's Cauldron to Unrest). Most dungeons give good 
                        loot while regular spawn sites give good exp.</p>
                      <h4>On a final note:</h4>
                      <p> Remember, although I find power gaming extremely helpful, 
                        I always take an hour or 2 to have some leisure time. 
                        I drink beer, hold contests, work on my trade skill, and 
                        make fun of Halflings. But that's just me! </p>
