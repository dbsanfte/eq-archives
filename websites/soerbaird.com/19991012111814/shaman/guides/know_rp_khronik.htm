                  <p>The gods had many reasons for putting the races of Norrath 
                    upon this soil, each to his or her own design. The Barbarians 
                    were born from the gods of Love and Valor, and these ideals 
                    are our calling.</p>
                  <p>Right off, I noticed that Barbarians had a brotherhood few 
                    other races shared. There are fewer of us, and the barren, 
                    twisting Northlands makes one aware of just how much we depend 
                    upon each other for survival. The world is harsh, and the 
                    gods are not always kind to us, so we must of necessity be 
                    kind to one another.</p>
                  <p>That I shower my gifts upon my own kind goes without saying. 
                    Whenever a Barbarian in need is near, I answer the call without 
                    desiring compensation. Often on my trips back to Halas, I 
                    will spend time in the newbie areas watching over the young 
                    Barbarians. I heal and buff as needed, not partaking in the 
                    battle unless dire need presents (aiding is one thing, coddling 
                    is another). I will even toss around some pieces of patchwork 
                    armor to promising young warriors and Shaman, when the desire 
                    to practice my tailoring presents itself.</p>
                  <p><b><font size="3" color="#333366">Races</font></b><br>
                    However, the real test of a Shaman is the width of his love 
                    for fellow beings. Once the raw days of youth have past and 
                    one makes that crucial journey through BlackBurrow into the 
                    outside world, things must change. We are Shaman. We understand 
                    the world as no other. We exist in both the Physical and Mystical 
                    realms and tie them both together in harmony. That the other 
                    inhabitants of Norrath do not share this wisdom is a tragedy, 
                    and is the goal of the Shaman to be the light that guides 
                    the unlearned.</p>
                  <p>I do not discriminate by race. The flesh is a shell. A human 
                    does no crime being born a human. That he has learned erroneous 
                    ways of looking at the world is his curse, but not his fault. 
                    In my kindness I will guide him, and should he not see the 
                    value of the path I show him, I mourn his loss and bid him 
                    good bye.</p>
                  <p>Elves understand Nature, but their arrogance must be cured 
                    if the world is to survive. Halflings are friendly creatures, 
                    and brothers of the forest. Their Druids are among the closest 
                    allies a Shaman has (although their tendencies to deify nature, 
                    rather than harness it as a steed, gets to be a tad foolish). 
                    I cannot help but like Dwarves. They are sturdy and forthright, 
                    and they drink Ale like a newborn drinks milk. (Besides, I 
                    find the sight of a Dwarf running under the power of SoW hysterical).</p>
                  <p>Half Elves suffer the stigma of any half breed, and I will 
                    not add to their pain by discriminating against them. In any 
                    case, their existing between cultures makes them ready travelers 
                    and explorers, which I admire.</p>
                  <p>Erudites irk me a bit. They are aloof and effeminate. They 
                    withdrew to their island as if they were to good for the rest 
                    of us, then proceeded to wage a bloody mage war that threatened 
                    the very planet. As individuals, they can be quite pleasant, 
                    but as a group, they are dangerous.</p>
                  <p>I have met few Gnomes, so I have no opinion at this time. 
                    I find their living underground to be creepy, though.</p>
                  <p>The dark races are indeed tragic. Their twisted heritage 
                    makes all but a precious few my enemy. But truth be told, 
                    I would not have a world without them. Peace is a wonderful 
                    goal for old men, but the young need adversity to grow strong. 
                    Evil exists to fire us to action, lest we grow soft in a comfortable 
                    bed. To the followers of Innoruk I say, &quot;Bring it on.&quot;</p>
                  <p>Ogre and Troll Shaman are perhaps the most troublesome creatures 
                    to me. By species, they are my foes, but by trade, they are 
                    my brothers. I will deal with a dark Shaman apprehensively, 
                    but with professional courtesy. It is odd to make trade with 
                    a being who you know some day you may meet in combat to the 
                    death, but it is one of the many paradoxes of life a Shaman 
                    must struggle to comprehend.</p>
                  <p><b><font size="3" color="#333366">Classes</font></b><br>
                    While a man's birthplace makes little matter to me, his profession 
                    greatly affects my perceptions. A man's life path is his own 
                    to choose, not some twist of fate.</p>
                  <p>Warriors are generic to me. I can respect any man who will 
                    grapple with the creatures of the world with only 3 feet of 
                    steel in his hands. But the warrior varies from the noble 
                    fighter to the loathsome mercenary. To me, your cause determines 
                    your worth.</p>
                  <p>Magi of all stripes earn my respect. As a Shaman I know the 
                    mental disciplines of wielding mana, and only an egotistical 
                    fool would not recognize their superiority in the field. Sadly, 
                    their power comes at the expense of harmony with Nature (and 
                    with that, the loss of the wisdom and inner peace it gives). 
                    Notable exceptions to this are these: Enchanters, to me, are 
                    mostly just tricksters. Parlor magicians more suited for gypsy 
                    camps than combat. I've met a few that have used their abilities 
                    for exploration, and these I tip my helm to, but as a rule, 
                    they are just charlatans. Necromancers are dark beings who 
                    make my skin crawl. As a Shaman, I have channeled dark mana 
                    to sicken and infect, and I feel dirty whenever I do. I've 
                    also just never gotten used to the idea of speaking with someone 
                    with one of the undead on a leash. (And if there ever comes 
                    a day I again run across Tovax Vmar, let him beware my vengeance!)</p>
                  <p>Bards and Druids are my brothers. They exist to aid all good 
                    people and have a certain harmony with the Universe. Plus, 
                    they can hold their own in battle. Good people all around.</p>
                  <p>Clerics and Paladins are typically good, forthright people, 
                    who I will welcome so long as they are not over-zealous about 
                    their god. I worship the gods of Love and Valor, but I recognize 
                    that they are not the only force in the heavens. Intolerance 
                    is a bane to harmony.</p>
                  <p>ShadowKnights are foul to me (the concept of Harm Touch is 
                    anathema to everything I hold dear).</p>
                  <p>Rogues are typically filthy creatures. I've met a few who 
                    are more scout than thief, but I always guard my bags in their 
                    presence. Besides, as a holy warrior, the notion of stabbing 
                    a creature in the back appalls me.</p>
                  <p>Rangers fall somewhere between Warriors and Druids. Wood 
                    Elf Rangers tend to be severely arrogant.</p>
                  <p>Monks I like, a lot. They are fierce fighters and have impressive 
                    self discipline. Their unwillingness to use weaponry seems 
                    silly to me, but I wear a bear on my head, so who am I to 
                    judge.</p>

                    Overall Goals and Attitudes</b></font><br>
                    The goal of a Shaman is to protect his children and to become 
                    a Man Of Knowledge. How you interpret that is your call. As 
                    I said earlier, I count all races my children (though Barbarians 
                    are the favored child). Beyond that, I seek to explore Norrath 
                    as much as I am capable. SoW makes that dream more of a reality, 
                    and Bind Affinity will solidify my ability to wander freely. 
                    I may join or start a guild related to helping travelers through 
                    dangerous lands. At level 25, I intend to dive full bore into 
                    Alchemy.</p>
                  <p>Often, our spells will be greatly desired in a rough area. 
                    SoW and Bind Affinity are always requested, and water is a 
                    dire commodity in the Desert of Ro. I will never flat ask 
                    for compensation for such gifts, but I will accept donations. 
                    As a Barbarian, I don't expect a free ride from anyone, and 
                    any attempt to repay the favor, however small, raises you 
                    in my esteem. People who demand SoW and other gifts earn my 
                    scorn. I am a protector, not a servant. Show respect and you 
                    shall get respect in return. Begging merely demeans you, and 
                    newbie characters that blindly ask for handouts get flatly 
                    ignored. Twinks seriously annoy me, both as a player and as 
                    a Barbarian. Handouts are for the weak. Earn your keep.</p>
