                  <h1>Divisions of The Soerbaird</h1>
                  <p class="newstext" align="left"> The Soerbaird is divided into 
                    three branches:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>The Academy</b> - Bards-in-training who serve basic 
                      duties before they arise to the rank of Filidh. </li>
                    <li> <b>The Filidh</b> - The core of the membership who carry 
                      out the business of barding. </li>
                    <li><b>The Council</b> - The guild leaders who administrate 
                      the guild and all its branches. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>The Academy</h2>
                  <p> The Academy is the training and proving grounds for any 
                    bard desiring to wear the title of Soerbaird. Bards must complete 
                    all the <a href="membership/graduation.htm">requirements of 
                    the Academy</a> to graduate into the Filidh.</p>
                  <p>Students of the Academy are expected to act as full-Soerbaird 
                    in every way: they attend guild activities, sing around the 
                    land, compose works, and try to record the land's people as 
                    best as possible. Students do not wear the title of The Soebaird 
                    until they have graduated from the Academy.</p>
                  <p>As students complete requirements of the Academy, they inform 
                    the leadership, and once all requirements are completed, they 
                    notify the Ollave of the Academy Filidh, and their membership 
                    is taken before the Council for consideration.</p>
                  <p>Once the council has voted in the affirmative, the student 
                    is then inducted into the guild and granted the title of Soerbaird. 
                    At that time, the student is expected to declare to a branch 
                    of the Filidh.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2>The Filidh</h2>
                  <p> The Filidh comprises the main body of the Soerbaird. Here, 
                    bards from across Antonica and Faydwer combine their talents 
                    and resources to spread the history and culture of the land 
                    to its peoples. </p>
                  <p>The Filidh has four branches:</p>
                  <h4><b>Balladry</b></h4>
                  <p> Bards who are a member of the Balladry Filidh compose ballads 
                    and songs. The Balladry Filidh is also responsible for organizing 
                    concerts around the land.</p>
                  <p>Responsibilities:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Write ballads </li>
                    <li>Maintain Iona Hall </li>
                    <li>Perform in concerts </li>
                    <li>Perform on request at events </li>
                    <li>Enlist bards to sing at scheduled concerts </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4><b>History</b></h4>
                  <p>The History Filidh is concerned with documenting the history 
                    of the lands and its events. They will seek to chronicle an 
                    accurate history of Norrath in a prose, rather than verse, 
                    format.</p>
                  <p>Responsibilities: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Write history (in the form of reports in Caim Hall)</li>
                    <li>Edit and verify submitted historical account </li>
                    <li>Maintiain Caim Hall </li>
                    <li>Research history for parts of Norrath </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4><b>Heraldry</b></h4>
                  <p>The Heraldry Filidh discovers and announces events around 
                    Norrath. More than just newsbearers, Soerbaird heralds will 
                    serve as diplomatic ambassadors to other guilds, and will 
                    handle sensitive cross-guild relations, ready to mediate disputes 
                    as needed.</p>
                  <p>Responsibilities:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make details of concerts known in-game by shouting across 
                      zones (or organizing that kind of activity) </li>
                    <li>Create and maintain a list of guilds and guild leaders 
                    </li>
                    <li>Make social contact with all the guilds on the list </li>
                    <li>Maintain contact with guilds, and become a source of newsgathering 
                      from them </li>
                    <li>Report any news of upcoming events to the appropriate 
                      sources in Balladry and History</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4><b>Academy</b></h4>
                  <p>The Academy Filidh concerns itself primarily with new students--their 
                    admission, graduation, and integration into the Soerbaird.</p>
                  <p>Responsibilities:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Process applications to the Soerbaird Academy</li>
                    <li>Accept new students</li>
                    <li>Monitor new students completion of requirements</li>
                    <li>Submit students who have completed requirements to the 
                      council for graduation approval</li>
                    <li>Train new students in barding</li>
                    <li>Be sure students are equipped to carry out their duties 
                      as a bard</li>
                    <li>Keep students informed and integrated in guild affairs 
                      and events</li>
                    <li>Run the AoC (Academy of Combat) to train bards how to 
                      defend themselves, and fight effectively</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>The Council</h2>
                  <p> The Soerbaird council oversees and administrates the guild 
                    and all its branches.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>The Pencerdd.</b> The Pencerdd acts as the head of 
                      The Soerbaird, presiding over the Council.</li>
                    <li><b>The Ollave.</b> The Ollave are master bards who hold 
                      Council seats. Each Ollave also heads a branch of the Filidh.</li>
                    <li><b>The Poswardd</b>. The Poswardd are the leaders of the 
                      Soerbaird on other districts (servers) of Norrath, or in 
                      other worlds. They are appointed by the Pencerdd and Ollave, 
                      and have access to the Council forum. While able to discuss 
                      guild issues, they do not have a vote on council matters; 
                      just a voice.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3></h3>
                  <h1>Associate Members</h1>
                  <p>The Soerbaird allows bards affiliated with other guilds or 
                    groups to become an associate member of the guild. Associate 
                    members are expected to complete all the requirements of the 
                    Academy before they are considered a full associate.</p>
                  <p>Associate members are allowed access to the in-guild discussion 
                    and planning, given the opportunity to perform in Soerbaird 
                    concerts, and (if part of the History Filidh) are given the 
                    ability to scribe history to Caim Hall.</p>
                  <p>Associate members (obviously) do not wear the title of Soerbaird 
                    next to their name in Norrath. Associates also may never serve 
                    on the Council.</p>

                  <h1>Non-bards affiliated with the Soerbaird</h1>
                  <p>The Soerbaird is a guild for dedicated bards, who have chosen 
                    barding as their occupation in Norrath. While this may seem 
                    strict, it is what we have chosen as a standard of quality 
                    for what we seek to accomplish in the land.</p>
                  <p>We do, however, welcome others as friends, and love to hear 
                    song and verse from those who have chosen other professions--even 
                    allowing good friends to perform in a Soerbaird concert now 
                    and then. Feel free to drop by our Iona Hall and share your 
                    songs and tales with us, or find us in one of the many taverns 
                    in Norrath.</p>
