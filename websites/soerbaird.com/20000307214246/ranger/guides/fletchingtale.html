                leaned her chair back against the wall, closed her eyes, and sighed 
                contentedly. It had been a tough day on the road, hawking her 
                wares, fighting her way through brigands, and choking on the dusty 
                paths, but she was in Freeport now, freshly bathed, and sipping 
                her favorite spiced wine at her favorite inn, the Jade Tiger's 
                Den. The commons room was nearly empty, as she had gotten in rather 
                late (actually very early in the morning, she mused), just the 
                quiet murmur of two Elven mages sitting in the far corner. She 
                took another sip of her wine and decided to head up to her room 
                as soon as she was finished. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">She 
                opened her eyes as she heard someone approaching the table, and 
                looked warily at the young man walking towards her. Human, about 
                five and a half feet tall, he struck her as quite handsome with 
                his neatly trimmed beard and jet black hair. She also noted the 
                easy way he carried the rapier strapped to his hip, the scabbard 
                well worn from frequent use. She took comfort in the graceful, 
                curved Combine blade that leaned against the wall near her left 
                hand, and watched him approach.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
                He flashed a smile and spoke as he neared her, "Art thou the Ranger 
                Sabrael, of Surefall Glade, Bowyer Extrodanaire?" She relaxed 
                a bit. "Perhaps, young lord, I may be. Dost thou seek a fine bow 
                to pair with that handsome rapier?" "Aye, that I do," he chuckled, 
                "but I have not come to buy one this night. Instead I was wondering 
                if you would share with me the secrets of their making? I desire 
                to craft myself such a weapon, for I have heard that the satisfaction 
                gained therin is unsurpassed. When I inquired of the local populace, 
                they said to me 'Seek out the lovely Ranger Sabrael, for none 
                knows the craft as she does.' And thus I stand before you now...thou 
                art easy to find, I need only follow the trail of goggling eyes 
                and broken hearts."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">She 
                smiled and motioned him to sit. He had a silver tongue, this one, 
                and she wondered if his wit was as keen. She liked compliments, 
                even when they were designed to get something from her. "Bowmaking 
                is no easy task, young lord, nor is the telling of it. It is thirsty 
                work, both. What do you have to offer me for divulging the secrets 
                of my livlihood?" She looked meaningfully at her near empty glass. 
                The young man smiled and motioned for the barkeep to bring over 
                a bottle of wine and another glass. Sabrael sighed...it seemed 
                she wouldn't be going to bed anytime soon after all... </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">

                Will you have at your disposal some of the most powerful single-hit 
                weapons in the game? Yes.<br>
                Will you find that, as one of the classes that can use a bow, 
                your life as an adventurer has suddenly become easier, as well 
                as the lives of your adventuring friends? Yes. <br>
                Will you save money? Yes. <br>
                Will you be PROUD of the time you spend and the items you create? 
                Most Definitely. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Fletching 
                is a skill that takes a lot of time, patience, and money to build 
                up, but from what I have seen, all the trade skills are like this. 
                Right up front, I will offer my opinion, that, if you are not 
                one of the four classes (Ranger, Warrior, Rogue, and Shadowknight) 
                that can use a bow, I personally would not take up fletching. 
                This is because the market, due to the fact that only those four 
                classes can even use a bow, is rather limited. However, the benefits 
                of having a bow, and being able to use one, are tremendous (please 
                see my other article on Archery). And being able to make your 
                own bows and arrows is such a plus that it is hard for me to believe 
                that members of these classes do not ALL take up fletching...just 
                for their own personal use. Of course, I would rather they didn't, 
                as this would kill the market completely...ignorance is bliss 
                (for those of us who sell to the ignorant...)</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
                Anyway, on to the basics of Fletching. As with the other trade 
                skills, you must first train at least one point in Fletching. 
                However, unlike the other skills, I would not recommend training 
                more than this, as your skill will advance quickly by making cheap 
                arrows at 4cp per try. Put one to three points in it, save the 
                rest of your training for something else, and go start making 
                arrows... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">On 
                the Making of Arrows</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
                In order to make arrows or bows, you must have: </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">A 
                supply of cash. <br>
                A fletching kit. <br>
                The correct components. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">I 
                would also recommend getting and reading the books on arrow and 
                bowmaking, as they are cheap and have good info in them. What 
                components do you need, you ask? Well, forget about bows for now. 
                I did not make my first simple hickory recurve bow until skill 
                level 30+, and even then I was failing more than succeeding. For 
                making arrows (and you will sit in a quiet corner for endless 
                hours making litrallay hundreds of arrows to get good at this 
                skill) you need 4 basic components: </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">An 
                arrow point. There are 3 different types: field points (1cp each), 
                hooked points (a couple of silver each), and bladed (several gold 
                each). <br>
                An arrow shaft...again, there are several types: wooden (1cp each), 
                bone (2 sp or so), ceramic (a couple of gold), and steel (several 
                gold each). <br>
                A fletch...either round cut (1 cp each), parabolic cut (6 cp each), 
                or shield cut (a few silver per). <br>
                And a nock...large (1cp), medium (3 cp) or small (1cp-1sp). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">To 
                start with, buy 20 each of the cheapest components...wooden shafts, 
                field points, round cut fletches, and large nocks. Now, find a 
                quiet corner, and put these items in a container like a bag or 
                backpack. Move one of each at a time into your open fletching 
                kit, until you have one of each in there, then hit combine. Voila! 
                Most likely you get a red message saying you failed, and all your 
                components in the kit disappear, gone forever. Do this 19 more 
                times and see how many arrows you get and how much your skill 
                goes up. Repeat. Rinse if necessary. Repeat again. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Keep 
                doing this until you get the message that "This item is trivial 
                for someone of your skill." Usually this will happen with the 
                4cp arrows around skill level 16 or so. This is good. Now, go 
                back and buy all the same components, except get MEDIUM nocks 
                instead of LARGE. Medium nocks are harder to work with (the more 
                expensive a component, the harder it is to make something with), 
                and will raise you skill some more. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Every 
                time you get that blue "Trivial" message, you have to start working 
                with harder materials...and more expensive ones. But remember...you 
                only have to add one component at a time, and you can go backwards 
                on some of them. What I mean by that is that a Parabolic Cut Fletch 
                is more expensive than a medium nock, so when medium nocked arrows 
                become trivial for you, you can go back to large nocks, but change 
                the fletching you use. This will still make for a harder arrow, 
                and you will save yourself money in the long run. Don't be afraid 
                to experiment. Buy a few of the components you think will work, 
                try them out, and see what messages you get. If they don't work, 
                you can always sell the components back to the merchant. For the 
                cheaper components, they even give you full value back (although 
                they give you far less than the total value of an item AFTER you 
                have made it. I usually get 7sp back on an arrow that cost me 
                1gp 2sp for basic components). </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                components of the arrows and their effects are listed below. This 
                is much more specific than the manuals found in the game, so it's 
                kind of a spoiler. You have been warned. If you want to skip ahead 
                to the part on bows, do so now. </font></p>

                parabolic cut fletch: +50 rng. <br>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Finally, 
                the nock adds range as well, smaller nocks being more aerodynamic.

                Medium nock: +25 rng. <br>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Thus, 
                the basic 4cp arrow has a damage of 1, and a range of 50. An arrow 
                with a field point, bone shaft, small nock, and parabolic fletch 
                would be damage 2, range 150. Better than the flight arrows they 
                sell in the stores, and cheaper too! Just keep experimenting with 
                arrows until your skill gets up there. If you don't have customers 
                for arrows, and you don't want to waste the expensive ones yourself, 
                then you can sell them back to the merchant for about 60-75% of 
                their value, which will allow you to keep making more arrows...

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Ok. 
                You've gotten your first 30 or so skill points now, and you are 
                bored to tears of making arrows. You want a bow, to shoot those 
                arrows out of! Well, my friend, bows are tough to make, and expensive. 
                But they are the real reason for having this skill in the first 
                place. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">There 
                are several components available for making bows. The most basic 
                requirement is a bow stave, made of some wood. Hickory is the 
                simplest and easiest to work with, and also the cheapest. After 
                that comes Elm, Ash, Oak, and Darkwood. A hickory bow stave is 
                less than 3gp, and Elm is around 3pp, Ash is 18pp or so, Oak is 
                75 pp, and Darkwood is over 250pp just for one bow stave! Stick 
                with Hickory for now. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Second 
                in importance is the string. Only 3 choices here, and all of them 
                cost less than 1gp. Hemp, Linen, and Silk, with Hemp being the 
                easiest, and silk being the most difficult. String affects the 
                damage and delay of the basic bow stave, with hemp being the slowest 
                but most damaging, and silk being the fastest and least hard-hitting. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">There 
                are other components to bows as well...planing tools and whittling 
                knives, and cams for making compound bows, but all of these are 
                HORRENDOUSLY expensive and should be avoided until much later. 
                Forget about them for now. Just stick with a bow stave and a string. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Buy 
                a hickory bow stave and a length of hemp string. Put them both 
                in your fletching kit and hit combine. That's it. If your lucky, 
                you'll have a new "rough hickory recurve bow." If not, you'll 
                be out 3gp or so and will have to try again. Thats all there is 
                to basic bow making. But because it is so expensive, especially 
                when you fail, it is NOT a good way to try to raise your skill. 
                Use arrows for that...sit in the proverbial corner making arrows 
                until your eyes bleed, and you have a high skill, then go try 
                to make a couple of bows to use and sell. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Every 
                bow requires these two components...a stave and string. What about 
                planing tools and whittling knives and cams, you ask? You want 
                to make finished compound bows? Well, I can tell you what you 
                need to know, but my fletching skill is approaching 100, and I 
                have not yet made a compound bow. The parts are just too expensive. 
                But this is what I know: </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Hickory 
                bows can only take string. That's it. No tools or anything else.<br>
                <br>
                Elm bows can be finished with a whittling knife. You cannot use 
                a planing tool on them. <br>
                Ash (and any better) bows can be finished with either a knife 
                OR a planing tool, but not both. I am not sure if an Ash bow can 
                have a single cam, two cams, or no cams at all. Not much point 
                in putting 45pp cams on an 18pp bow anyway. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Oak 
                bows can be cammed, but I am not sure if they can take two cams. 
                That would be an expensive bow to experiment with too. A basic 
                oak stave is in the neighborhood of 75pp, with cams running 45pp+ 
                each, so a failure will hurt. Two or three people have asked me 
                if I make "Runed Oak Bows," so I am guessing that it is possible, 
                if one can find a set of runes. Again, an expensive experiment.

                bows (which cost 250pp just for a stave) can have anything you

                Bow staves, but I have never seen such offered for sale. </font></p>

                far as which components do what, I have compiled a list (below, 
                much like the arrow components above), along with what skill level 
                I would recommend you achieve before trying. I will list the skills 
                as numbers and slashes, i.e. 30/35/46, which is the skill minimum, 
                the skill nominal, and the point at which the bow becomes trivial

                Ash bow staves (80+, not trivial for me yet) are damage 16, range 
                100, delay 58. <br>

                this, it is easy to see that using such combinations as Linen 
                string and a knife are a pointless waste of money. Simply using 
                silk string gives the same effect. Don't use a knife unless you 
                are already using silk. Likewise, don't use a planing tool with 
                hemp twine. Be smart about your money. String is dirt cheap, tools 
                are expensive and hard to work with. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Where 
                do you sell your bows? Who do you sell them too? How much do you 
                sell them for? Well, as mentioned previously, only Rangers, Warriors, 
                Rogues, and Shadowknights can use bows. Before I auction my bows, 
                I use the /who command to see who is in my zone. If there aren't 
                at least a few of these classes, or a lot of anonymous people, 
                I usually don't bother. I have had several people expess interest 
                in buying a bow "for a friend," but no one has yet done so. I 
                guess their friendship isn't worth the platinum I ask for my bows. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">NEVER 
                sell a bow to a merchant. They give you far less than you paid 
                for the basic materials. All you will do is lose money. Also, 
                although I have occasionally given away a Hickory bow or two (usually 
                to friends, once as part of a game for some first level Rangers), 
                I NEVER sell my bows for a loss. I spent many hard hours making 
                arrows to get my skill where it is at, and much money as well, 
                and bow parts are expensive. That is time and money I could have 
                spent earning experience and better equipping myself. That time 
                is woth money. If the other person cannot or will not acknowledge 
                this, then they don't deserve to carry one of my bows. Simple 
                as that. I also charge more if I have to travel far, or for custom 
                orders. I only know of 3 places in the world to buy bow making 
                supplies, and if I have to travel halfway across the continent 
                to hawk my wares, through dangerous terrain, then the price goes 
                up. You get what you pay for, and bows are worth the money. Smart 
                players realize this. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 
                general, I charge 1pp for a simple hickory bow. 2pp if I have 
                to travel a long ways. Elm bows cost me 3-4pp to make, so I sell 
                them for 6-7, sometimes more. Ash bows cost nearly 30pp (assuming 
                a 2/3rds success rate), so go for correspondingly higher prices. 
                I try to only mark my bows up 25%-50%, and I give good deals on 
                arrows (I was making them for my skill points anyway, so what 
                the heck...they are only arrows). I also frequently trade bows 
                for other equipment. Especially equipment that other people have 
                made with THEIR trade skills, such as armor or simple magic jewelry.

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">As 
                you are walking about using the /auction command to sell your 
                creations, be prepared to answer A LOT of questions. "What are 
                the stats on such-and-such bow," "how much for this-and-that," 
                "how do you make bows," "what good are bows," and things of that 
                nature. Selling bows and adventuring are not compatible, so I 
                do one at a time, usually making time for both during a period 
                of play. I might try to sell bows when I first sign on, then go 
                adventure for a while, then head back to town to try to sell again 
                before I sign off. Seems to work alright for me. Also, don't be 
                afraid to advertise custom bows and arrows, and make them to your 
                customers requests. Some people like high damage bows, some people 
                like fast bows, some people like some combination of the two. 
                Be flexible, and, most of all, be prepared to put a lot of your 
                time into the craft if you want to be good.</font></p>
