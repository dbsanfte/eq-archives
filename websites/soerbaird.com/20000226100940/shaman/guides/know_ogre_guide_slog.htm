                    An Ogre Shaman is, hands down, one of the best classes available. 
                    You will have the greatest strength and stamina of any race, 
                    and you will be able to cast extremely powerful spells including 
                    heals. Although any experience in EQ is much enhanced by grouping, 
                    these features will allow you to survive much longer soloing 
                    that any of the weaker races. As you progress in levels you 
                    will become much sought after by groups for your Spirit of 
                    Wolf spell (SOW - allows individuals to &quot;pull&quot; or 
                    flee much faster), for your heals, and for your considerable 
                    fighting/tanking ability. Granted, you will never be able 
                    to tank as well as a warrior, or heal as well as a cleric, 
                    but your mixture of powerful strengths makes an Ogre Shaman 
                    a best friend to many.</p>
                  <p> Another wonderful aspect about being an Ogre is that most 
                    Ogres are good role-players. I believe that this is because 
                    it's rather fun to talk like an Ogre. &quot;Me bash gud.&quot; 
                    &quot;You puny.&quot; &quot;Hmmm, lizzie is gud to eat.&quot; 
                    Etc. In addition, there are not many Ogres presently in existence, 
                    which makes Ogre territory less occupied and easier to find 
                    kills and good loot. It's also enjoyable to be the most massive 
                    PC in existence. You will inspire awe in others at your sheer 
                    size (not to mention the role-playing aspects of running away 
                    from a Gnome, like an elephant would run from a mouse).</p>
                  <p> Disadvantages of being an Ogre include 1) being hated by 
                    most races and 2) being huge. Travel to other areas is much 
                    more dangerous because you are KOS (Killed on Sight) by most 
                    races except the Dark Elves and Trolls. Having such a large 
                    body can also be a disadvantage in that in certain dungeons 
                    (especially Upper Guk) with narrow hallways, it can be hard 
                    to maneuver or get through if anyone is in your way. The size 
                    issue can be a huge bother - aka you can't even fit behind 
                    the throne in Crushbone. However, both of these drawbacks 
                    are tolerable and there are ways to work around them. For 
                    example, 1) you could kill what you need to, to improve faction 
                    if you really want to be in a particular region and 2) you 
                    can stay in dungeons that tend to be more open (Crushbone 
                    and Unrest have been good).</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">The Creation</font></b><br>
                    One of the first questions is where to put your 30 additional 
                    attribute points. I have often heard a rumor that attribute 
                    points are less valuable when over 100 - I have not found 
                    this to be the case. I tested out a variety of classes and 
                    races looking at HP and Stamina as a benchmark, and have found 
                    that class has more effect on eventual HP than does Stamina.

                        <p>As you can see, the additional HP from adding 25 to 
                          stamina is the same for a Dark Elf Enchanter, as it 
                          is for an Ogre Shaman (aka whether you're above 100 
                          or below it, the additional HP/lvl is not huge). The 
                          additional HP will eventually make a difference, which 
                          can be seen by multiplying the level 1 HP by 10 or 20. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ogre Shaman does not compete with an Ogre Warrior 
                          for sheer tank ability, but will definitely hold up 
                          under fire better than any other full casting magic 
                          user (of course, keep in mind that a Shaman can bind 
                          him/herself wherever they desire, where a Warrior can 
                          only be bound in certain spots by someone else). Ogres 
                          start out with very good Strength and Stamina, and most 
                          other things are average, except Charisma, which is 
                          very poor. </p>

                  <p>The decision of where to place your additional attributes 
                    will probably not have a large effect until you reach higher 
                    levels, so it is important to decide what kind of character 
                    you will want. If you think you would be content to stand 
                    back and cast spells - put a majority into Wisdom. If you 
                    are more interested in getting dirty and occasionally tanking 
                    - put a little more emphasis on Stamina. Strength is another 
                    good area to place some additional points - as this directly 
                    correlates to how much you can carry with you (something that 
                    does become very important when you're in enemy territory). 
                    I would not consider putting any points towards Charisma because 
                    you will never be getting great prices from NPCs as an Ogre, 
                    and secondly, because most of your selling will be done with 
                    other PCs who couldn't care less about your Charisma. </p>
                  <p> Weapon choice is somewhat clearer. You can use 1H blunt 
                    and a shield, or 2H blunt. Most shaman prefer 2H blunt because 
                    it does considerably more damage, and the loss of a shield 
                    does not make much of a difference in how often you are hit 
                    (a good offense is &#133;). Use your 1H blunt club that you 
                    get at the start, until you can get your hands on a decent 
                    2H blunt, then switch. Obtain a magic 2H blunt (aka a Glowing 
                    Wooden Crook, etc) if you can, because then you will be able 
                    to hit any magic undead you run into (shouldn't come to these 
                    monsters until your teen levels).</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">The Formative Years (Rank I - Levels 
                    1-4)</font></b><br>
                    During these tender years of Rank I, I would suggest not wandering 
                    too far from Oggok. As you exit Oggok, if you follow the path 
                    and turn left at the 2 forks, you will come to an innkeeper. 
                    Adventuring behind her is a very good place to start. First 
                    rule of thumb - ALWAYS /con what you are about to attack. 
                    Green, blue and white (if you're feeling brave) are your best 
                    bets, where yellows and reds will likely end up in a corpse 
                    recovery trip. Second rule of thumb - Always keep a reference 
                    point so that you know where you are. Pick unusual landmarks 
                    and focus on recognizing them, so that when you do die (and 
                    you will die) you know where your corpse is. Third rule of 
                    thumb - Get accustomed to picking off wandering critters with 
                    spells - using Burst of Flame to bring them to you instead 
                    of chasing them down is a valuable, timesaving skill, plus 
                    it helps keep your bearings. Grouping is usually not recommended 
                    at Rank 1-4, but can always be fun for periods.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">The Troublesome 2's (Rank II - Levels 
                    5-8)</font></b><br>
                    I say that these years are troublesome because by these levels 
                    you have gained substantial power, but still have to show 
                    restraint as to where you wander. After level 4, when you 
                    die you will lose experience, so restraint can be very helpful 
                    in the long run. From levels 5-8 I would suggest hitting the 
                    lesser lizzie camps - there are three of them which you will 
                    find if you wander behind the inn. One of the nicest things 
                    about these levels is that grouping becomes more helpful. 
                    When you are hitting the lesser lizzie camps and suddenly 
                    a couple Lizardman Mystics respawn and blind you; it will 
                    be helpful to have a friend close by. During this period you 
                    should also start working on getting better armor and weapons 
                    - admittedly a life long struggle.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">Introduction of Spirit of Wolf (Rank 
                    III - Levels 9-13)</font></b><br>
                    Level 9 brings one of the greatest boons to Shamen - Spirit 
                    of Wolf (SOW). You will become a very valuable member of any 
                    team, simply for this reason, not to mention the rest of your 
                    skills. This spell is incalculably helpful in that it allows 
                    you to run much faster than normally. It allows you to travel 
                    faster though difficult zones, and it allows you to flee from 
                    a fight that has turned out to be much harder that you initially 
                    though. At level 9, armed with SOW, the brave can consider 
                    wandering over to the stronger lizzie camps with friends or 
                    the smaller temples outside Cazic Thule. It is here that you 
                    can receive incredible payoffs from the lizards, but the region 
                    is typically busy for this reason. You should attempt to replace 
                    whatever armor you have with the stronger banded armor - which 
                    can be purchased from other PCs.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">The World is your Oyster (Rank IV 
                    - Levels 14-18)</font></b><br>
                    By level 14 you should now have a good idea of what to expect 
                    from the temples, and are starting to find it easy, being 
                    less wary of lizzie trains. The greatest blessing of level 
                    14 is Bind Affinity. Bind allows you to set your gate (or 
                    death) point. One word on obtaining this spell - it presently 
                    is not available in either Oggok or Grobb, so you have to 
                    get it in Neriak, or pay someone to buy it for you. One of 
                    the major advantages of being able to cast the spell (as opposed 
                    to having someone else cast it on you) is that you can bind 
                    yourself anywhere. Common sense become very handy in deciding 
                    where you should bind yourself&#133; needless to say staying 
                    close to zones and choosing safe locations is very wise. With 
                    this ability, exploring the world becomes much safer. You 
                    can travel anywhere and bind yourself near the zone, knowing 
                    that if you die you will not have to walk back all the way 
                    from Feerrott. Because of your newly found freedom, you can 
                    wander the lands, amazing people who have never seen an Ogre 
                    before. Take caution however, because most lands will be very 
                    dangerous to you, not because of the monsters that may lay 
                    ahead, but because of the foul guards that may inhabit the 
                    region. Any regions that have a city in or adjacent to them 
                    (besides Feerrott and Innothule Swamp) will have wandering 
                    guards of very high levels (higher 30's) who will likely kill 
                    you on sight (KOS).</p>
                  <p> A little dying trick - If you die and your corpse happens 
                    to be in a relatively dangerous area, there is an easy way 
                    to get it out of harms way. 1) Make a social button (by R 
                    clicking it) into a corpse retrieval button - /Corpse. 2) 
                    Pay someone for an invis (Enchanters have the strongest invis) 
                    while standing as near as SAFELY possible to where you died. 
                    3) Quickly run close to your corpse, and start hitting the 
                    Corpse button as you walk away from the dangerous region. 
                    Voila - your corpse is now somewhere where you can loot it 
                    with peace of mind! Now I would say that this is something 
                    you should only do if it is very necessary. For example, if 
                    you corpse happened to be right in front of the Felwithe guards.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">A New Role (Rank V - Level 19-23)</font></b><br>
                    At Rank V, you finally get a strong healing spell and you 
                    will find that your role in groups tends to shift to a healer 
                    more often. It is nice to have the option of standing back 
                    and healing Warriors or other Tanks, or choosing to get into 
                    the fray. At level 20, you can have a last name and will have 
                    more than enough experience as to what you want to do, so 
                    I will no longer presume to advise you. ;)</p>
