                                <p><b> GZ:</b> When we designed our magic classes, 
                                  we decided on 3 &quot;Priest&quot; types and 
                                  4 &quot;Magi&quot; types. I wasn't even on the 
                                  EQ team at that point - only Brad and a few 
                                  others were. I came on over 2 years ago, and 
                                  one of my responsibilities became the magic 
                                  system.</p>
                                <p>We knew that Shamans were going to be the big 
                                  races - the ones that were primitive - less 
                                  sophisticated in their worship. Shaman spells 
                                  are much more spirit/animal oriented than those 
                                  of other classes.</p>
                                <p>As for the rest - I knew that I wanted a good 
                                  'buffing' class in EQ, one that would buff in 
                                  ways not seen in AD&amp;D. A lot of the Shaman 
                                  ideas came from hours of me sitting in a coffee 
                                  shop brainstorming after a full day of work 
                                  - that and a good bit of feedback from team 
                                  members.</p>
                                <p>But to get back to topic, Shamans were designed 
                                  to be the Clerics for the more primitive races. 
                                  You will notice no race has both Shamans AND 
                                  Clerics. Shaman magic is more primal, more concerned 
                                  with individuals and making them stronger or 
                                  weaker than that of any other Priest class.</p>

                                  can really make any character into a superman.

                                  considerable. Shamans are good people persons

                                  helps out a lot.</p>
                                <p> In a stand up, one on one (or 2 on 1) fight, 
                                  you usually don't want to wait 6 min for the 
                                  damage to be done - so this is a big help, again. 
                                  Damage done more quickly means that the creature 
                                  dies faster, and that you take less damage during 
                                  a fight.</p>
                                <p> In a kiting fight, you don't care about time. 
                                  Well, I hate to say it, but kiting is chimpy. 
                                  We never really wanted kiting, but it is part 
                                  of the game. If I have a chance to balance a 
                                  spell to help parties and to help people in 
                                  a stand up fight, but that makes it harder to 
                                  kite... Well, I didn't even hesitate.</p>

                                game content. We could have worked another 10 
                                years on this game and still not have had as much 
                                content as I want (more quests, more items, more 
                                dungeons, etc.) Content is tricky, because no 
                                matter how much you have, more is always better. 
                                <p>What would I change about our players - I would 
                                  love for them to realize that we (the entire 
                                  dev team) does what we think is best for the 
                                  game. People seem to think that we hate particular 
                                  classes, or races, or cities, etc. They think 
                                  that we gimped their class just &quot;because,&quot; 
                                  or that we lowered/raised something on whim. 
                                  Everything we do we do for long term player 
                                  enjoyment, as well as keeping game balance.</p>
                                <p>I submit to you that what players think they 
                                  want and what they [really want] are two different 
                                  things. Players want, for example, to be powerful 
                                  from the start. They want to log on and slay 
                                  things (maybe not Dragons, but big things). 
                                  They want to find the Gleaming Sword of Gerard 
                                  quickly, and fight their way to fame and glory 
                                  by level 10. They want their character to be 
                                  more powerful than everybody else's, because 
                                  it is &quot;them&quot; playing it.</p>
                                <p>Ok, I may be overstating this a bit, but not 
                                  by much.</p>
                                <p>People don't really want this. Things you get 
                                  too easily are not valued as much as things 
                                  that you worked for. Games that are too easy 
                                  people play for a while, and then quit. People 
                                  have been playing EQ many hours a day for 4 
                                  months and have no sign of stopping. What was 
                                  the last game you played for this long, this 
                                  many hours a day? I think one of the reasons 
                                  that people continue to play it is that it is 
                                  NOT easy. There is always more to get - always 
                                  a chance to become greater, grander and more 
                                  glorious.</p>
                                <p>Yes, I do have a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. 
                                  I am allowed to say things like this.</p>
                                <p>So anyway, I'd want our players to trust us 
                                  a little, to think that we are at least trying 
                                  to do things that we think are better for game 
                                  play.</p>
