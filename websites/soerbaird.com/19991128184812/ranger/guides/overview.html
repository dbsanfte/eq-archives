                little bit about the Ranger- <br>
                <br>
                Well let’s see, Rangers. Part Warrior, part Druid. We get the 
                majority of the skill that warriors get, excluding bash, but with 
                a lower cap on them all. We get a few of the lower level Druid spells, 
                but at a much later level than they do. </font></font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First 
                the Warrior side of us. <br>
                <br>
                The skills we get are: Dodge, Parry, Kick, Riposte, Taunt, and 
                Disarm. Dodge Parry and Riposte are very essential skills for 
                a tank class, it helps avoid taking damage and make you last a 
                little longer. Dodge and Parry are currently capped at 130 (Ed. 
                Note: Parry is now 185 and dodge is 137) as of the time I&#39;m 
                writing this, but are being upped very soon, Riposte is capped 
                at 150 which is not planned to change. Our secondary skill, Kick, 
                is a nice addition to the damage we deal. The damage Kick does 
                goes up depending on your level. When you first get it at level 
                4, it does around 10 points of damage if I remember correctly. 
                At higher levels it does upwards of 18 damage. This skill caps 
                at 130. Next we have the Disarm skill, capped at 55 it&#39;s not 
                very useful, it&#39;s fun to actually disarm something every now 
                and then, but it&#39;s almost not worth it. Then there&#39;s our 
                Taunt skill, comes in very handy when you&#39;re the tank in the 
                group, and need to keep the MOB off the casters. It usually only 
                takes a few taunts to get the MOB on you, but at lower levels 
                it doesn&#39;t always work that great. It also loses a bit of 
                its effectiveness against high red MOBs. It caps at 150. <br>
                <br>
                Next we have our weapon skills, and weapons we can use. Our Offense 
                and Defense skills cap at 200 just like warriors, so we aren&#39;t 
                really at a disadvantage here. The same goes for our weapon skills, 
                but they&#39;re 5 points warriors per level. Rangers have a pretty 
                good selection of weapons we can use. We can use the majority 
                of 1-hand slash weapons, and about half of the 2-hand slash weapons. 
                There is also a good selection of piercing and blunt weapons too. 
                One skill we don&#39;t have much use for is 2-hand blunt, there 
                is a major lack of these weapons a Ranger can use, but that&#39;s 
                ok since we&#39;re better suited with a slashing weapon. We also 
                have the addition of Dual Wield, the use of two 1-hand weapons, 
                and Double Attack, making two attacks per round. These skills 
                cap at 200 for us as well. <br>
                <br>
                Armor, We definitely have a bit lacking in this department. The 
                best non-magical armor we can wear is Banded, while this has a 
                good AC and will last you for a long while, it just doesn&#39;t 
                hold up at higher levels. So when you start getting into your 
                30&#39;s to upper 30&#39;s, if you don&#39;t have any magical 
                plate, or plate alternatives, you start to feel the pain. The 
                only full suit of Magical Plate Rangers can wear is Rubicite, 
                it&#39;s a plate that&#39;s red in color. There are also many 
                other partial suits and various other items that we can use as 
                well. Once you get up to level 50, you may want to try for the 
                Ranger only plate in the Plane of Fear. Thorny Vine armor is a 
                green plate that has some very good AC along with good addition 
                stats. So we survive with what we can get, and learn ways to work 
                around having a lower AC than our Warrior counterparts. <br>
                <br>
                Now for the magic. We&#39;re part minor druid, we get some buffs, 
                some damage spells, and some heals. Most of these spells are a 
                small addition that can help out greatly. Our healing spells are 
                a big help for reducing downtime, our first heal at level 9 only 
                does 10 pts of healing power, but that can really add up when 
                you just got out of a battle and need to rest up. Our next healing 
                spell at level 22 does 30 points of healing power, this one is 
                a great addition, by this time the first heal spell is barely 
                moving our HP bar. Plus it comes in a little handier for healing 
                party members after a battle to lesson the load on the clerics. 
                Then our last healing spell at level 39 does about 80 points of 
                healing power. Once again by this time with 1000&#43; HP, the 
                smaller heal isn&#39;t really doing much, so it&#39;s another 
                nice addition. <br>
                <br>
                Buffs, we get a few HP/AC buffs, a nice AGI and STR buff, along 
                with a few damage shields. Our HP/AC buffs follow the skin like 
                &#42;&#42;&#42; series of Druid spells. The first at level 9 is 
                Skin Like Wood, then Skin like Stone at level 22, ending with Skin 
                like Steel at 39. We also get a few spells in the &#42;&#42;&#42;Coat 
                line of spells, these add a little AC, while doing some damage to 
                whatever is attacking you. at level 15 we get Thistle Coat which 
                does 1pt of damage, next is Barb Coat at level 30 which does 2 damage, 
                and ends with Bramble Coat at 49 which does 3damage. As for stat 
                buffing spells, we get Feet like Cat, which raises AGI by 18 points, 
                and Strength of Earth, which rises by 15 points. <br>
                <br>
                For damage spells we are lacking a bit since we&#39;re mainly 
                a melee class, but they can be a nice addition to any fight. We 
                get at least one type of damage spell every level of spells, here&#39;s 
                the list of them in order: Flame Lick&#40;DoT&#41;, Burst of Fire&#40;DD 
                15damage&#41;, Invoke Lightning&#40;AoE 22 damage&#41;, Ignite&#40;DD 
                37damage&#41;, Stinging Swarm&#40;DoT 120damage total&#41;, Careless 
                Lightning&#40;AoE 99damage&#41;, Immolate&#40;DD/DoT&#41;. We 
                also get a few spells against summoned beings, Ward and Dismiss 
                Summoned. <br>
                <br>
                There are also a few nice utility spells that we get. Glimpse, 
                which is good for a little long distance scouting. Camouflage, 
                good for running in dangerous areas. Harmony, GREAT for pulling 
                full spawn areas. Eyes of the Cat, infra vision spell. Invigor, 
                good for those long fights. Levitate, handy in Solusek and similar 
                areas. Spirit of the Wolf, probably one of the most sought after 
                spells, great for travel. Superior Camouflage, can go invis in 
                dungeons now. Wolf Form, besides looking cool, it raises your 
                ATK rating some. <br>
                <br>
                Well That&#39;s pretty much what a Ranger entails, I could go 
                on and on about this and that, but this does well to sum up a 
                Ranger. I&#39;m sure I missed some parts and may end up doing 
                a revision to this at some time. I&#39;d like to say, that in 
                the 37 levels of playing my Ranger, I wouldn&#39;t play anything 
                else. I&#39;ve tried other classes, but always ended up coming 
                back because I missed being able to do one thing or another. It&#39;s 
                a great class, and can be a great addition to any party. <br>
                <br>
                So be safe, travel the lands, and make a name for your Ranger.
