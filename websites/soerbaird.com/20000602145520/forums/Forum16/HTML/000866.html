</FONT><HR><BR>Ok folks,  Even I took the wait and see position till the Patch came out... and well, while it wasn't horrible it didn't address any of our concerns.<P>There is a lot of frustration being expressed, and really quite rightly so.  You are a paying customer of a company thats behaviour is not suiting you. As such you have a right to make your voice heard.  Unfortunatly we have all found that expressing your dismay here or even writing directly to key persons in the company has not changed this corporations actions nor increased their respect for our opinions.<P>As legal action is not feasible nor realistic and there are few other methods that would perhaps be more effective available, I and proposing and will take on the burden of organizing, publicising, ect. a petition tailored to the interests of Customers of VI who invested their time and money in playing a "Shaman" in Everquest.<P>This has been attempted several times in the past, we are all aware.  It has been sabotaged and undermined in each case.  To prevent this from happening again The Compiling and drafts of this document will not be posted to this sight, though a link might.  I will operate a very simple webpage containing only the current draft.<P>All submissions will be accepted via email. I will take all the submissions and try to make a comprehensive whole out of it.  Both specific issues and fully written petitions will be accepted and appreciated, starting today.  On the 15th of October new submissions will be cut off from being included in the petition. From that date only revisions and editing of the document will be  made, with the exception of 3 days following any new patch affecting interested parties.  On the last day of October the final draft will be presented and then unless there is a major outcry, it will be fully publicised and  a feature will be added for those wishing to "sign" it to add their mark to the bottom on Nov 1.<P>I know this sounds kind of heavy handed but I  think a timetable must be set or like so many other projects of the sort it would just drift into obscurity and apathy.  I am not a proficent or motivating writer so the Writing of the Petition will come from your Submissions.  If you want credit please include the name you want it credited to listed.<P>One last Caveat.  If I get no responses or very few I will simply discard the idea as I have better things to do with my time than work on a lost cause.   In about 3 days I'll post again and if there has been a significant response, post an address of where to look at the first rough draft.<P>Submission Guidelines:<BR>Be sure "Shaman Petition" is in the Subject line along with a few distinguishing words about your imput.  If it doesn't contain the phrase Shaman Petition my filter won't catch it and it will go to the can directly  <IMG SRC="http://www.soerbaird.com/forums/frown.gif"><P>Please avoid Pure Rants, vulgarity, and flames directed twords me.<P>Please do not send any sort of file, attached  document, or executable as for security reasons they will all be deleted.  <IMG SRC="http://www.soerbaird.com/forums/frown.gif"><P>Please DO send the petitions and suggestions to dehle@exchange.indiana.edu  <P>Thank you.<P>Welan/David.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

</FONT><HR>I have a rant.  A big one. <P>But it's not against Verant. <P>Everyone has a right to say what they think. Verant makes a change, it's going to annoy people.  Frankly it doesn't matter what kind of change it is, it is going to make some people happy, and other people angry.  That is how it is, that is how it will always be. <P>What annoys me is the egotistic attitude of many people.  You act like Verant has done nothing but single out Shamans for destruction since day one.  That is flat out not true.  That is why Verant is not going to listen to a Shaman petition for many of the things people want.  They are making changes that affect many classes, not just one.  <BR>You people complaining, you don't care about EverQuest, you only care about your tiny piece of the game.  Any changes you propose will probably affect more than one class as well, either directly or indirectly.  You may not care about that, but Verant has to, misguided as some of their efforts are. <P>Singling out Shamans?  An agenda to make the Shaman class unplayable?   Please, get a grip.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

</FONT><HR>I got into playing a shaman largely from this Website and I really enjoy this class. I also have A necro (amongst other characters) which I enjoy  as well. I also see on the Necro boards very similar rants as are posted here. It seems that each classs thinks they got the shaft. Last night after the patch I did play both characters for a bit and really didnt notice much of a difference. My biggest complaint with Verant so far has got to be with system issues...case in point, Im posting not playing cause I cant get in the game. How many times have you been discoed? lately? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

</FONT><HR>Tain, um did you respond to the right post?<P>Nobody on this thread said anything about Verant persecuting Shamans in particular.  <P>I'm not even complaining about the last patch specificly.  Honestly besides some concern about the pet change I'm not even that upset about it.  <P>What I'm concerned about is that our voices are not being heard or responded to outside of our own community.  Complaining here does no good.  Sending single emails seems to do no good either, no matter how well thought out. (see Arkands Long letter that got a 3 line blow off. - No can do, and "we'll think about it." )<P>I don't want special treatment for the Shaman class, I just want, and I think many others concur with this, to let the people making changes know that its not "just a few whiners" who are concerned about the changes, and how they affect our class.  Increaseing AWARENESS of the too quite group of people who are paying for services.  <P>Brad has spoken often and empassionedly about his "Vision" of the game.  Unfortunaly he and others on his staff have ignored whenever possible the fact that HIS vision is neither the only one nor neccesarily the best.  If he were running a free MUD he could do what ever  he wanted with his creation.  The players would be partaking of his generosity. However  Everquest is NOT Free.  This means that every customer has the right to state their displeasure if they do not feel that the product they are purchasing does not meet with their satisfaction.  If you ordered a Computer system from Sony and parts didn't work right would you sit at home and Wait for  THEM to call YOU up and tell you they were aware of the problem and would fix it?<P>I hope not.  I know I, and most other folks would be on the phone within the hour calling  and letting them know something was wrong.<P>This is an identical situation.  You are PAYING for a product, You have every right demand that that product does what it was advertised to do.<P>Before I get farther off track, let me again state that that my goal is simply to produce a petition naming our concerns ( not just mine but all that submit them) so that those in charge of seeing that customers are satisfied will see that we are not, and pay more attention to how changes in their product effect a quiet but significant portion of their paying consumers.<P>I don't have a persecution complex, I simply want to make the provider of the service I'm paying for aware of certain oversites.<P>If specific "demands" are not met, but awareness of those making the demands is increased and that those making the "demands" are not satisfied, Then I will consider our effort a success.<P>I'm sorry to single you out Tain, you just helped me clarify exactly what I am trying to propose and gave me an opportunity express my feelings on the matter.  <P>Thank you.  I hope when the finished product is produced you will see fit to leave your mark on it.  I also welcom any items you would like to submit.<P>dehle@exchange.indiana.edu (Please include the word Shaman or Petition in Subject)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

</FONT><HR>: Nobody on this thread said anything about Verant persecuting Shamans in particular. <P>How can you consider a Shaman petition as anything other than that?  You're talking about class specific things, so you are singling out the Shamans. If you are only addressing Shaman issues you are telling Verant they are specifically harming the Shaman class, or at the very least neglecting it.  Both views are looking at the game with blinders on.  <P>: Sending single emails seems to do no good either, no matter how well thought out. (see Arkands Long letter that got a 3 line blow off. - No can do, and "we'll think about it." )<P>I have to admit this concern confuses me, what more can you expect?  If they can't do something, wouldn't you rather them say that?  An acknowledgement of one new idea is also better than simply saying no to both.  What would you rather have seen the response be?  "You're right, these are great ideas, we'll get right on them."  We know that wouldn't have happened.  <P>: I don't want special treatment for the Shaman class<P>A petition for the Shaman class is asking for special treatment.  It's saying, "We believe are issues are more important than the ones you are currently working on and you should get to ours first."  I am not saying it's wrong to do it if there is enough feeling by Shamans that it's true, but it IS asking for special treatment by trying to force Verant to do things a different way than they currently are. <P>: If you ordered a Computer system from Sony and parts didn't work right ...<BR>:This is an identical situation. <BR>: You have every right demand that that product does what it was advertised to do.<P>It is not an identical situation.  If I could not load Everquest to get in and play at all then your comparison would be valid.  However, that is not the case.  Everquest still works fine.  Everquest still does what it was supposed to do.  My Shaman still does what it was advertised to to.  I can summon pets, I can cast DoTs, I can "buff" and "debuff."   The only thing my Shaman can not do as advertised is Alchemy.  Have some of those other things changed since they were first introduced?  Yes, they have.  Have there been changes to the basic functionality of the game?  Has the Shaman class been rendered unplayable?  Has it been made less fun for me?  My answer to all three is no.<P>The only Shaman specific things I would like to see is Alchemy truly implemented and an update to the Disease line.  Both have been already discussed and promised.  Because of that if a petition is brought forth with those points they will be summarily dismissed .  Verant will look at it and say, "They are complaining they want changes we already told them are going to come."<BR>That isn't going to get anything changed any faster.  It will paint a bad picture of the Shaman "community."  <P>: I'm sorry to single you out Tain, you just helped me clarify exactly what I am trying to propose and gave me an opportunity express my feelings on the matter. <P>I'm glad you did, your reply was a good example of how people can converse here without screaming, ranting and raving and making personal attacks, or sounding like you're running for public office in the Shaman community. <BR>That being said, I have not seen any issues brought up to go on a petition that I would sign on to. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

</FONT><HR>A well thought out petition with a few clear goals for shamans seems like a good idea. I think a long laundry list would not be as effective. For each item I would address how it benefits the shaman class, how it benefits other classes, how it improves overall game play --- and the ever popular, why this will keep more players in the game longer.  <IMG SRC="http://www.soerbaird.com/forums/smile.gif"> Show them that what we want is what they want.<P>Tain said: You people complaining, you don't care about EverQuest, you only care about your tiny piece of the game.<P>Actually I do care about the game, or I wouldn't take time to post. I also don't think the game will be fun if there are huge power imbalances between classes. The game works as a whole, it's no good just looking at one little segment. I do, however, think that each class should be very different and we should have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages when choosing a class.<P>If very few players are choosing a particular class to play, then it's time to upgrade that class. Otherwise I'd stick to fixing bugs and adding enhancements, and definitely ignore all the kindergarden-style complainng that starts with "but that class, has...." and ends with "no fair".<P>I'm a little concerned that while I care that the game is fun to play, Verant seems to be acting as though fun has been supplanted by goals such as preventing players from leveling too quickly and leaving the game and enforcing their original concept for the game. At best those are those are secondary concerns. It seems they can't see the forest for the trees. Maybe they are too close to the game, but sitting back and assessing how to make the game more fun won't hurt them, and should help. That's why I think a very upbeat petition would be helpful.<P>If all we accomplish is moving alchemy off their "Nice Things to Do for One Class" list and onto their "Overall Game Enhancing Things to Do" list, this will be an improvement. Maybe we can even make the "Ways to get Platinum out of the Game" list. Either of those are probably a much higher priority. I don't know why there is this delay in fixing alchemy, and I'm no expert, but I have been wondering if the new enchanter spells are a good sign that work is progressing on this aspect of the game. <P>Muna<P>I guess I can't leave this subject alone:<P>If this was a free mud, as Welan said, they could do as they please. If we simply paid monthly to play, then we would have to play the game as they changed it too, altho we would have an investment of time since the game is on-going and cummulative, unlike, say, a poker game that has a definite end and you start over. So they would have some obligation to us. But neither of those situations applies. We made an initial (say, capital) investment. Then we pay monthly for the priviledge of playing this game we purchased. This is not like buying a computer or leasing a car or signing up for TV cable, or any other consumer purchase I can think of. The discussion of how much this product can or should be allowed to change before the good faith of consumers is violated is not only interesting, but perhaps will have wider application. Of course too much abuse of consumers always ends up leading to some sort of regulation.<P> I am also interested in how easily some players accept any changing Verant does. If you read alot of mysteries, you'll know to follow the money to find the motive in most cases. So are these changes due to a deepset belief in game balancing or are they frantic attempts to maximize profits? Doesn't Sony own Verant? I also wonder how much pressure is being exerted on Verant to meet whatever original player forecasts were made.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><P>All times are PT(US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.soerbaird.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum16&number=16&thisthread=000866&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.soerbaird.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum16&number=16&thisthread=000866&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
