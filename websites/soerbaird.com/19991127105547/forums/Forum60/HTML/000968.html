</FONT><HR>I'm soooooo sick of this bashing powergamer crap.  Guess what.  I log onto everquest to get some xp, get better stuff, whatever.  When I can't do that I play my twink that has items I earned myself.  I guess this makes me some sort of asshole according to some of the "snob rpers" on this board.  If you want to be a level 22 ranger and do quests that are designed for well above your level and need higher level help with great.  If you want to sit around and speak in ye olde english and help newbies I don't care.  I play this game the way I want to play it.  I am not a "d00d".

</FONT><HR>This is not directed at you, personally.<P>I'm not a hardcore rpger.<BR>However, in EQ, the bad experiences I've had have all involved powergaming twinks. This is not to say all powergamers/twinks are jerks, just that the jerks I've run into have been . . . therefore, one tends to stereotype them.<P>What really bugs me is the staid argument that "we don't affect you." The powergamer/twink does, both directly and indirectly. They refuse to see that, and I'm not really surprised. <p>[This message has been edited by Byrn (edited 11-04-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

</FONT><HR>Well I have never twinked with stuff I camped for for my twink, I twink with spare stuff I happen to have.  And I agree, I don't like most twinks either.  If I'm somewhere and a twink asks me for help with a mob that would kill him or asks me for buffs I'll ignore him.  Thats part of a being a twink, part of the definition of a twink is someone who has a higher level character and already knows how to play the game and avoid newbie deaths.  When I'm playing my twink I don't act like an asshole, I don't ks or train intentionally or whatever.  My gripe is mainly that there is some kind of anger (most likely jealousy) of people who play to get higher level quickly so they label them "d00d powergamers".  I'm fortunate enough to have my rl gf playing a cleric sitting next to me, have a regular group of very good players, and to be in the best guild in the game.  I have been almost everywhere in the game, killed dragons, explored dungeons etc.  I'm very sorry if you haven't done that but thats what I bought this game to do, but don't take out yer jealous on me or others like me.<P>Genjuro Ekiloretu<BR>41 Ranger Veeshan<BR>Fires of Heaven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

</FONT><HR>Whoa there, Genjuro  <IMG SRC="http://www.soerbaird.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Relax a bit, take a load off...all that stuff  <IMG SRC="http://www.soerbaird.com/forums/smile.gif"><P>Both of the points in response to your post were not mean or jealous or anything, and brought up valid points that many of us have seen about powergamers or twinks. I've seen one person actually /ooc to the zone that he needed someone to give him some food. I did a quick /who and it was a lvl 16 druid. Someone who can forage or summon food and drink. When asked why he didnt just do that, he replied that it would cut into his experience gathering.<BR>That's the kind of image most of us conjure up with the word "powergamer" and as such, we will refer to people who act like that as powergamers. People like that, for lack of a better description, suck. Too lazy to utilize what thier class can do simply because they want levels quickly and too self absorbed to assist another player in need. Now if you may not fit into that particular mold, that is what is being referenced and thus, does not refer to you. Be warned though, if you give yourself that moniker, and you are offended when people talk about the stereotypical powergamers, then that's your problem and your problem alone. <P>Many of us have done all those things and are higher level, and we STILL will deride rude powergamers whenever we run into them.<BR>The same goes for rude twinks in my book. Thing is though, I've met more than one heavily twinked character who was very nice and polite to others and helpful. My main beef lies with twinks who think that since they have a twinked character, they're some kind of god. Feh. I let em die. If someone's really cool, I help them out a bit either with my primary or with my own little twink (if i can).<P>As for your accomplishments and guild and whatnot...who cares? Best guild in the game? Um, not on my server. Your girlfriend plays? Eh, so does my wife. Explored dungeons and killed dragons? Hmm, been everywhere except the planes and have avoided dragon slayings because those make the game unplayable for me from the sheer amount of data being transferred.<BR>Indeed, play the game in any manner you wish, as long as that manner does not adversely affect someone else trying to have a good time. That's the way I live my life and treat people, and that's the way I wish to be treated. <P>-Donal Rootfinder<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>No guild affiliation. I know who my friends are.

</FONT><HR>For the record, Genjuro and I have known each other in game for quite a while and his RL girlfriend as well.<P>Genjuro is upset (and rightly so) because I messaged her when I found out they were in FoH and told her I lost respect for her because of the reputation of that guild. I was too quick with my words and they were poorly selected, so I'm offering a public apology to you Genjuro and your GF (whom by the way wrote and excellent guide for our site.)<P>Like you said, we all play the game for our own enjoyment, not all of us that level slowly spit out our thees and thous and get drunk every night. Some of us have a blend of RP, PG and both. And I'm assuming you meant me as "snobby." I'd have to disagree with you.. I'm one of the more down-to-earth people in this game and I really downplay my involvement with The Glade in-game.<P>Again, I'm sorry I upset the both of you and can only hope I can at least give you a passing hail now and then.<P>------------------<BR><I>Sunmoon Solusterra<BR>Glademaster of the Rangers Glade</I><BR>http://www.soerbaird.com/ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

</FONT><HR>I have seen many people join guilds.<P>I have seen many crappy guilds.<P>I have seen a lot of people call really crappy guilds great.<P>Usually this is because of the bennies they are getting.<P>I am not bashing you Gen.  But I suspect that like a lot of people, you joined a guild that has really great bennies (Dragon hunts, Fear/Hate expeditions, sweet loot offered at low prices/good trade, etc) and also has a tainted reputation (PGers, Twinks, Rude, Eliteist, etc) . . . they exist on every server.<P>Worst part is, the guilds in question usually have 3 or 4 members that are the major problem, but because those members are "valuable" they are not booted.  Guildmasters of those high-level guilds often don't just put a foot down.  Despite the fact that Krillin is a huge bastard - KSing, (rumoured) Exploting, Quest Destroying, etc - his guild took weeks to get rid of him, and even when they did, it was because they dissolved.  Couldn't hack just booting him.  (This is a Brell occurrence.  Funny that Brell doesn't have a Hammer of Brell because of this guy.)<P>So, I would bet that FoH has some members that have been pretty dispicable throughout their rise to the range of 45-50, and are hated by a number of folks on your server.  Sunmoon was reacting to his experiences, not to you in specific.  And coming onto the Glade to fire off this post was hardly something that needed to be done.<P>It might however indicate that you need to evaluate how you're treating people, lest you become what people find unpleasant in your particular guild.<P>Sunmoon - your appology was kind, and I suspect that you had ample reason to react in the way you did.  I can only hope that Gen realizes that and is able to look at his guild (and it's members) objectively and see where you're coming from.<P>------------------<BR>Scout<BR>Master Fletcher<BR>Ranger of the Faydark's Champions<BR>The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

</FONT><HR>Well, being Genjuro's GF, I'm going to have to toss my 2 cents in here.<BR>A.) Donal - so what if I play exactly.  Genj only mentioned me because I was central to what got him so upset in the first place.  He wasn't trying to make it sound like having a GF/SO who plays makes you god or anything.<BR>B.) Have any of you ever played a high level cleric?  Don't talk to me about twinks until you have.  The SECOND I take /annoy or /rp tag off, I am bombarded by tells asking:<BR>- I'm level 2, come heal me while I kill bats plz so I can level faster.<BR>- Can you sow me?<BR>- Teleport me to Karanas, I really need to get there.<BR>- Run to Karanas and res me, I lost my exps!<BR>The fact that I'm in Ghetto Faydark doesn't seem to matter, and the tells never end.  Seeing level 10 characters in armor only obtainable by a party of lvl 40+'s may annoy you, but I actually like it.  Twinks never ask me for things I cannot do.  Twinks never ask me to spend my day babysitting them.  Twinks are usually very polite, and will ask me, via tell, if I could toss them XXXX buff (and yes, they always know the NAME of the buff) if I have the mana and time.  And they never ask from across the zone, they ask while standing right in front of me.  Twinks also never demand stuff from me, unlike Joe Blow, who wants to engage in a factinating theoretical discussion of why I will be doing the GAME a favor if I power level him.  But since Joe Blow ROLEPLAYS this discussion, he doesn't understand why it still annoys me.<BR>C.) Genjuro didn't want me to reply here, but since Sunmoon did, I'm gonna do what I want (which is what usually happens anyway).<BR>Appology accepted - to which I have to add a few things.<BR>Getting a tell from you out of the blue (while I was hunting micro servos, which is cause enough for despair in my book) saying "well, now I have lost all respect for you" HURTS.  Seeing the words "there are only 3 people in that guild worth talking to anyway" also hurts, because while I am not friends with the entire guild, I can name more than 3 of them off the top of my head who are very nice people and go out of their way to help anyone when they can.  So not only did you express the opinion that I had no taste in guilds, but also that I had no taste in friends.<BR>The arguement I was going to give you before I decided I was too upset to even talk about it goes a little something like this:<BR>I am a cleric.  I cannot run around exploring places because I have no way to do it safely.  I have no camo, I have no SoW (or jboots), I could conceivably use dinvine aura to run around then gate if I got into trouble (praying that I can channel gate through whatever is hitting me), but that is not very effective.  Esentially, my job is to use my mana to keep my party alive.  I am the ultimate grouping class.  Guess what?  People usually only need heals for things that can kill them, most of which give exp.  Since I share in that exp, and spend most of my time online keeping my party alive, I level quickly.  Do I (or Genjuro) try to power game?  No.  As a matter of fact, our modem has been on the fritz for the last 2+ weeks, so we haven't really gained much in the way of exp.  So if we're not power gamers, why did we join FoH?  Because the people in the guild are our friends.  Not every single one of them, and I'm not trying to convince anyone that my new guild is god's gift to Everquest.  However, in my experience, I have found them to be good players, generous people, and excellent friends.  That is all I want out of my guild.  If you think I should be looking for something else, well, you have different priorities than I do.<BR>At any rate, I am sorry that we had a misunderstanding, Sunny.  I considered you a valuable friend before this, and hope to continue that.  If anyone was upset by Genj's postings, please take it with a grain of salt... he was upset because I was upset.<P>Regards,<P>Juul Ekiloretu<BR>Cleric of Tunare, Disciple of T'tdira<BR>Grand Mistress of Fletching<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

</FONT><HR>Hey Juul.. nice to see you here. Like I said before, I chose my words too quickly. Once I thought about it, I know lots of people from FoH that are great:<P>Tdira/Krurk<BR>You and Genj now<BR>Maeve<BR>Teablade<BR>Mrylynn<BR>Ragnarokk<BR>and a few others I know<P>Again, I made the same mistake I was accusing you of, and that is basing a whole theory or idea based on one event, or one entity. And for that, I am truly sorry. You and I and Genj have known each other for quite some time and I'd hate to think all the good times were for naught.<P>I only left this thread open to be able to tell you guys this since I knew you came here a lot. And since this is a Ranger's board and this is more of a personal thread, I'm gonna lock it so it can slip silently down the rows.<P>I only hope with passing I can be restored to my former standing with you.. all because I opened my mouth when I shouldn't have. See, we all make mistakes  <IMG SRC="http://www.soerbaird.com/forums/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR><I>Sunmoon Solusterra<BR>Glademaster of the Rangers Glade</I><BR>http://www.soerbaird.com/ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><P>All times are PT(US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://www.soerbaird.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum60&number=60&thisthread=000968&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.soerbaird.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum60&number=60&thisthread=000968&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
