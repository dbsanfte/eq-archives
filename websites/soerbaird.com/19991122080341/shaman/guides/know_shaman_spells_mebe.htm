                  <p>My thoughts on how to use the Shaman spells through level 
                    24, as a level 25 Shaman. I would greatly appreciate anyones 
                    thoughts as well.</p>
                  <p><b><font size="3">Rank One(Level 1)</font></b></p>
                  <p>Cure Disease: Do not keep memorized, only mem on a per case 
                    basis. Also, some higher level diseases will require multiple 
                    castings, or the use of the Level 24 Counteract Disease spell.</p>
                  <p>Flash of Light: Do not normally keep memmed. If soloing outdoors, 
                    can be useful to help you get away. Blind them, step back, 
                    root them, then Cheetah yourself. Or, Blind them, step back, 
                    root them, DoT them. Many possible variances. I have never 
                    used this spell in a group though, too many other spells clamoring 
                    for the slots.</p>
                  <p>Inner Fire: Only mem when you buff it, then unmem it. Only 
                    use if no other class in group has a better spell. Very cheap 
                    to cast, so might as well.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#000000" size="3">Rank Two(Level 5)</font></b></p>
                  <p>Cure Poison: Only keep memmed if fighting creatures with 
                    bad poison. You don't want someone to die while your trying 
                    to mem it ; )</p>
                  <p>Endure Fire: Only use if fighting MOB's that use fire based 
                    attacks. I do not find it worth while to cast just for combating 
                    Fire Shields. But, it's cheap, so if you have the time and 
                    have the mana, and have nothing else you need to buff, why 
                    not.</p>
                  <p>Gate: Always keep memmed. I would add, always keep memmed 
                    in the same spell slot. I switched it once, and won't get 
                    into the details, suffice to say I always keep it in same 
                    slot now ; )</p>
                  <p>Spirit Pouch: I keep my summoned food and water in it. I 
                    also keep rusties, raw hide, cloth, or anything else you would 
                    normally destroy because of weight in it. NEVER put ANYTHING 
                    you would be upset to lose in it. Can you say, &quot;POOF&quot;?</p>
                  <p><font size="3"><b>Rank Three(Level 9)</b></font></p>
                  <p>Cure Blindness: I have never used this spell. So can not 
                    comment on it.</p>
                  <p>Endure Disease: Not worth casting to avoid Rabies, or the 
                    like. BUT, if fighting something that gives you a truly bad 
                    disease (Like Evil Eyes, or high level shamans), always use 
                    it, especially on tanks and lurer.</p>
                  <p>Sense Animals: Don't have yet. Seems pretty limited though. 
                    Any comments from those who do use it?</p>
                  <p>Serpent Sight: Cast on all sight deprived members of your 
                    party before nighttime, or in dark places. You Do NOT want 
                    them falling into a hole that you see, but they could not 
                    ; )</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Wolf: Obviously, always keep everyone buffed with 
                    this. I used to always keep it memmed too. Now I need the 
                    slot for Cheetah, so I only mem it when buffing. (Have since 
                    decided that I need to keep Wolf memmed also, for when Cheetah 
                    runs out and if you haven't reached zone yet) Only keep memmed 
                    if outdoors of course.</p>
                  <p>Spirit Sight: Only when fighting creatures that can go Invis, 
                    and or when party members are Invised. I would add, that usually 
                    someone else can and will cast it. I would save your mana 
                    for other buffs if possible.</p>
                  <p><b><font size="3">Rank Four(Level 14)</font></b></p>
                  <p>Bind Affinity: Don't forget! Every now and then, I forget, 
                    and when I gate, I am unpleasantly surprised ; )</p>
                  <p>Burst of Strength: Used before level 24, don't have a slot 
                    for it anymore. Also, I have been saving mana for debuffing 
                    and healing during fights. Warrior types said it helped their 
                    Max damage, and before level 24 I think it is worth using. 
                    But at 24, I do not have a slot I am willing to give up for 
                    it.</p>
                  <p>Disempower: If the fights are long (tank heavy or small group), 
                    I keep this memmed and use it (after I malise). If the fights 
                    are quick (burner heavy), I do not (I still malise though), 
                    not worth it.</p>
                  <p>Endure Poison: Always cast if fighting anything poisonous 
                    or that uses Poison spells.</p>
                  <p>Enduring Breath: You can use a LOT of fish scales VERY quickly 
                    in a group. If just traveling, I would rather levitate them, 
                    if anything. Faster trip too. If in group fighting underwater 
                    goblins, or whatever, I would just Enduring Breath the lurer 
                    while everyone else stays on shore. I am sure this is not 
                    always an option, but so far it has been for me.</p>
                  <p>Invis. VS Animals: Only when traveling, and only if no regular 
                    Invis is available. Works on Griffens btw.</p>
                  <p>Levitate: Wheeee, one of my favorite spells : ) In lavastorm 
                    can be very useful. Also, if you are Wolfed and Levitated, 
                    you run at wolf speed. Even over water, so much faster than 
                    swimming. Good for crossing very hilly terrain too. Plus it's 
                    fun! &quot;Flying Troll!!&quot; I love hearing that when in 
                    newbie areas, many have never even seen a Troll, much less 
                    a flying one. Har! Har!</p>
                  <p>Root: Sometimes you need it memmed, other times not. Depends 
                    on where you are and who you have in group. Ensnare is much 
                    better, so always let the Druid or Ranger do their thing instead, 
                    if possible.</p>
                  <p>Shrink: TBD</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Snake: Always keep yourself buffed with this, and 
                    any casters who use alot of alteration spells, like Enchanters 
                    and Clerics. I usually ask who uses alot of combat Alteration 
                    spells in my group and then buff those you say they do. Helps 
                    with resists. Also, I make sure my group has me Snake them 
                    before they go selling.</p>
                  <p>Walking Sleep: I have started to use this more. What I like 
                    to do is malise everything right after the other, then Walking 
                    sleep them. All from a distance of course. Depending on situation, 
                    I may then Disempower the one currently being targeted by 
                    tanks. I only do this if I am not the primary healer.</p>
                  <p><b><font size="3">Rank Five(Level 19)</font></b></p>
                  <p>Cancel Magic: Most other magic types have this. If they do, 
                    it is usually best for them to do it and leave you with extra 
                    spell slot. MOB specific use.</p>
                  <p>Endure Magic: One of the most requested buffs. Some others 
                    have it also, again, if they have it, let them cast it, so 
                    you can save your mana for other buffs.</p>
                  <p>Frenzy: Never used. At level 24 (now 25) I would rather Canabilize 
                    or meditate for more mana, not use it all up to melee. Melee 
                    is not our role. But, that's just my opinion.</p>
                  <p>Healing: Always keep memmed, even if all other 5 members 
                    are clerics (Have never been in a group with more than one 
                    cleric btw).</p>
                  <p>Malise: Always cast at least once on groups target. If your 
                    not the primary healer, try one or two more times if resisted. 
                    It does make a big difference to the other magic users and 
                    they will love you for it, or so they tell me : ) Now, if 
                    tank heavy, adjust strategy accordingly. Also, if you have 
                    an Enchanter, you may or may not want to, ask casters what 
                    combat spells they are using and go from there.</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Cat: Always have up on yourself, the lurer, the 
                    tanks, and the primary healer. If you have time and mana, 
                    do everyone else too.</p>
                  <p>Spirit Strength: Always have up on yourself and all tank 
                    types who are over Level 20 and have a Strength over 100. 
                    Damage bonus. If you have the extra mana and time, buff all 
                    encumbered group members as well.</p>
                  <p>Vision: If a very dark place, cast on self, gives you Ultravision 
                    for a short time. You can also cast on lurer if you want, 
                    but there seems to be a max range, once they go beyond that 
                    you no longer see updated view. Have not tested much, but 
                    seems to be the case. Also, you can not see what is happening 
                    around you. I do not use much except for fun.</p>
                  <p><b><font size="3">Rank Six(Level 24)</font></b></p>
                  <p>Cannibalize: Always keep memmed, also always have Regeneration 
                    buff on you. Unless in emergency situations, never cannibalize 
                    below your 80% health mark. Be VERY careful, easy to get yourself 
                    killed. I use it all the time in combat tho. If I have not 
                    taken any hits, after I cast malise, I cannibalize, then cast 
                    other debuffs, then cannibalize again in between swings. Always 
                    being careful never to go below 80% health. Of course, I am 
                    a Troll ; ) When group is resting, I med, when a tick goes 
                    by and both bars go up a bit, I stand, cannibalize, then sit 
                    down to med again as quick as I can. Again, never going below 
                    80% health. I timed it, if just medding it takes me 1m46s 
                    to regen 2 bubbles of mana. At level 24, when doing Med/Cannibalize 
                    combo, takes me 1m30s to regen 2 bubbles of mana when starting 
                    at full health and ending at 80% health never going below 
                    80% health. So, big deal you say, a whole whopping 15 seconds 
                    saved. Well, if you are down 4 bubbles of mana at end of fight, 
                    you will save 30 seconds of med time. That is 30 seconds less 
                    that group will have to wait, or as is more likely to be the 
                    case, 30 more seconds you can buff the group while other casters 
                    med up. Also, if paladins in group, or other minor healers, 
                    if they are full mana, they can heal you everynow and then, 
                    making this even faster. Plus, it's fun! It adds color to 
                    the shaman class and helps with the role play.</p>
                  <p>Counteract Disease: Only keep memmed if fighting a MOB that 
                    will give a bad life threatening disease. Same as Cure Disease 
                    spell, but more powerful.</p>
                  <p>Creeping Vision: Have not purchased yet.</p>
                  <p>Envenomed Breath: Well, lots of issues here. I will just 
                    say that if in a good group, with a couple of burners, I just 
                    debuff and heal and buff. Never cast Envenomed, no need. If 
                    in tank heavy group where each creature being targeted will 
                    last 30 seconds or more, I may, or may not, do it. Depends 
                    on my mood and what is being resisted. Thing is, I die alot 
                    more when I use Envenomed breath, than when I debuff. Any 
                    rational well thought out ideas on this appreciated.</p>
                  <p>Frost Strike: Rarely use it in group. Dont even have it memmed 
                    at the moment. If in tank heavy group, will mem it and use 
                    it to take out runners. Maybe when I get higher it will be 
                    resisted less and do more consistent damage, at the moment 
                    tho, rather debuff and use mana in other ways.</p>
                  <p>Invigor: Never used it. Have never been in a situation where 
                    need to use it. Maybe when swimming a long distance? (Since 
                    first writing this, was swimming out in water by Freeport 
                    docks trying to find that ledge that Trolls can get on, found 
                    it, but had ta do a quick memming of Invigor and cast everynow 
                    and then or would have died)</p>
                  <p>Poison Storm: Sometimes I keep this memmed. Still playing 
                    with it. In my experience, AoE spells are a great way to focus 
                    every MOB on yourself. Attention you do not want, hehe. So, 
                    jury still out, again, any rational well thought out ideas 
                    on this appreciated. Also, I like to use this when in Newbie 
                    areas when someone is overrun and asks for help, usually kills 
                    everything with one or two stragglers trying to get away. 
                    Very impressive, you get a lot of &quot;WOW&quot; comments 
                    ; )</p>
                  <p>Protect: Always buff yourself, lurer, and Tanks. If time 
                    and mana available, buff healer and rest of group as well. 
                    Lasts long time.</p>
                  <p>Regeneration: Always keep this buff on you. Have been experimenting 
                    with casting on lurer just before he runs off, and then casting 
                    on main tank at very start of fight. Just started this, but 
                    seems to work well, and the tanks love it of course : ) Also, 
                    when resting after a big fight and everyone is pretty beat 
                    up, cast on the worst one or two. Be sure you coordinate this 
                    with healers, or your mana will be wasted.</p>
                  <p>Resist Cold: Only use when fighting MOB's that use cold attacks</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Cheetah: LOVE this spell! I use it more than gate 
                    to get out of bad situations. Very quick casting time and 
                    much easier to get off when being hit. ALWAYS keep memmed. 
                    Been thinking of not memming gate to free up a slot. (Since 
                    writing this, I decided to not keep gate memmed. Well, guess 
                    what happened? I got LOST in the Unrest House. Lots of speed 
                    and no idea where to go! Hehe, pretty funny now. Luckily, 
                    I finally found my way out. But if had Gate memmed, would 
                    have been much safer. So, now I keep gate memmed if in areas 
                    that I may get lost. Otherwise, it stays unmemmed)</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Monkey: Cast on yourself of course, and on tanks 
                    and healer (helps with channeling and interrupts). If time 
                    and mana available, cast on main burners too.</p>
                  <p>Spirit of Ox: Cast on yourself of course, and on tanks and 
                    lurer. How many times has a group member escaped with less 
                    than 20 hit points? If you had Ox on them, you saved their 
                    life. How many times has a group member died JUST before zoning? 
                    If you did not have Ox on them, you killed them. If time and 
                    mana available, buff rest of group as well.</p>
                  <p> I have been told many times, &quot;Your buffs saved my life!&quot; 
                    I like that : )</p>
                  <p>People I have grouped with before are also very happy to 
                    group with me again, so I guess I am doing something right 
                    ; )</p>
                  <p>I am always open to ways to improve my methods.</p>
