</FONT><HR>Below is a recounting of the duel fought last night between two Bards, both of the 23rd Song, Toalas Liteheart and Aysha Atreides. While this was supposed to be only a duel between friends, the blood and the sweat were plentiful.<P>They had gathered in the precinct of Misty Thicket for the event, with Aysha bringing a companion with her. He appeared to be a roguish type, so I discretely hid my purse within my tunic. He took up a safe viewing position on a nearby hill. I joined him, a safe distance away.<P>It had been agreed upon that first they would fight an in a trial run, so that each could see what the other was made of. They compared battle statistics and inspected each other’s equipment. While Aysha was armored in steel legs and some miscellaneous magical pieces, Taolas did appear to be the better armed of the two. Aysha was a slender, delicate-boned woodelf who’s banded tunic offered more in the way of distracting opponents than true protection. Taolas was a half-elven man, handsomely clad in some blackened iron, but his steel breastplate would offer him more protection where is would count. Taolas also appeared to be well-versed in weaponry as well. He was equipped with a short spear and a nasty-looking halberd. Aysha had already informed him that although she sometimes fought with a whip and a dirk, she was more comfortable using her music alone. <P>The trial run went well, and did not take too long. Taolas learned the agony of a song that they both had known, as Aysha had played it on her brass horn. She flicked her whip at him a few times, but found it to be not as effective. It had been a close fight. Taolas ended up yielding and went to report that to the deputies in nearby Rivervale as was standard. The heralds announced the victory of the trial battle as belonging to Aysha. She went over to her rogue companion and played a calming tune on her lute. I overheard him tell her “You can not beat him at melee, my Dear. Not with those weapons of his. Try not to let him touch you.” She mumbled something bitterly back about being able to determine that for herself.<P>When Taolas returned, they decided to just non-competitively test the damages of their most harmful battle songs. This took hours and it was not very exciting to watch. Aysha’s companion grew bored and wandered off in search of trouble. The two Bards took turns playing short pulses of these battle songs, both with the instruments that they had been written for and by just singing the tune. No blood was shed, but I could see the sweat break out on Taolas’ brow as he tried not to flinch with each pulse of the other Bard’s songs. Aysha’s small frame trembled as she too silently bore her pain. Finally, they had had enough. Aysha went to report to the deputies that she had yielded this time, to even the tally. Taolas assessed their damages and said that he would prepare a report to be presented to the Bard’s Guild.<P>Now that they had a good feel for each other as opponents, they were ready to duel in earnest. It would be a fight to the death, unless one party yielded first. They both now knew exactly what type and how much damage the other was capable of. Aysha once again set her horn to her lips as Taolas stood stalwart and ready with his weapons in his hands. He bowed to her, and she issued the challenge by bellowing a small painful note at him. The battle was on!<P>They began with slow circling motions. The air surrounding the pair crackled with strengthening music. Taolas was rhythmically singing a magic resisting song to counter Aysha’s horn music. She played a discordant song on her horn while now and then skillfully inserting a well-timed bellowing note that shot out at her partner in sonic waves of pain. Taolas winced at the onslaught when they broke through his musical magic shield. The pair danced thus for a time, Aysha trying to stay out of reach of his twirling weaponry while remaining close enough for him to hear each note. At one point, Taolas scored a hit to her shoulder, and I saw the blood flow red down her arm. She flinched and faltered in her song, but quickly picked up the melody again. <P>It took quite some time for the two to appear weakened. Almost simultaneously, I noticed blue waves of magical sound emanating from the two of them, as they began to sing their healing Hymns. Aysha was getting quite weak, and resorted to playing her lute. She harmonized some dissonant chords strummed in between the peaceful melody of the healing Hymn. Now and then she bellowed out a painful note from a distance. Taolas was finally starting to look a little pale, and sure enough, he dropped his weapons in favor of his lute too. He began to play the exact same songs as she. It appeared that Aysha was overpowering her opponent. Suddenly, I heard a strange whooshing sound and Taolas disappeared right before my eyes. Instead of being astonished, Aysha laughed and turned around to look for the other Bard. “I know that trick!” She called out. He appeared in front of her again, and I could hear a disenchanting melody. He laughed with her at his trick, then bellowed another painful note her way.<P>The cacophony was deafening, but strangely their songs, although not played together, complimented each other to form a wondrous concert of sound and sonic flares. It was the most beautiful sight that I had even heard! I was enthralled by two graceful Bards dancing in circles, singing love songs of pain to one another, as if they were the only two people in the world. It lasted for what could have been hours, and both began to play their songs with a lot less gusto. They were tiring. Taolas cracked on a few notes that he sang, and Aysha’s voice grew hoarse.<P>Finally, Taolas called out, “Enough! I am tired. Let’s stop. We are evenly matched and this could go on for hours.”<P>“Yield then, Taolas,” Aysha taunted.<P>He did not move, instead stood there panting and not even trying to heal himself.<BR>Thinking that he was not truly yielding, Aysha bellowed another pain note at him.<P>“Stop!” He shouted. “I said I conceded! It is pointless for us to continue.”<P>“You must formally yield, Taolas, or I will kill you.” Aysha warned. She had no intention of yielding or fleeing herself. I had seen her fight before, and knew that she would fight until dead.<BR>It seemed to me, that all Taolas wanted to do was rest a bit, before accepting defeat. Aysha would not have it. She was insistent that he officially ends the duel. <P>Taolas headed to town again, to report accepting the loss.<P>Aysha, sensing that he was angry with her for her insistence, and impatience, followed him. After the heralds announced her victory by default, she met Taolas in a darkened corridor of the town. They did not know that I was straining to listen to their conversation. It seemed that they quarreled a bit, then began to discuss their strategic maneuvers. Aysha leaned over and gave Taolas a tired hug, and I saw him kiss her gently. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

</FONT><HR>Continued from above...<BR>Aysha leaned over and gave Taolas a tired hug, and I saw him kiss her gently on the cheek. They were friends again. The last I heard was Aysha challenging Taolas to a future duel without armor and using only their voices for weapons. Taolas chuckled, but offered no further response. I wonder it they will allow spectators at this event, should it occur........ </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
