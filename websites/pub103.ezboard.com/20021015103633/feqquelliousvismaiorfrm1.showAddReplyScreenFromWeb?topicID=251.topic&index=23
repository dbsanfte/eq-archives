Honestly as far as &quot;best in show&quot; my list would contain every member of VM throughout the months we spent raiding Veeshans Peak. <br>
<br>
Some names I haven't seen mentioned here that I believe should be are names like Tinnel. Tinnel was such a good player, and so much help to me/us on so many occasions, to not see his name mentioned anywhere is ridiculous. <br>
<br>
To list Soullance and not Jhelad is also fairly sad, as they were both great players and key to any victory we ever had. Not to mention the relentless and at times thoughtless Juzzam, I believe he deserves honorable mention here.<br>
<br>
No one mentioned Soullance's brother and one of VM's original enchanters Eleet. Dhouja and Eleet... they were a great team, and I never felt safer on any dungeon crawling expedition than I did when I had those two clowns with me. Callawyn of course was also a player of great skill and I would never say otherwise nor could I leave him out of any topic involving enchanters. Prizm was also an enchantress of great skill, and deserves mentioning here.<br>
<br>
Kogg was the best in show during his prime, though he got lazy and slacked off there towards the end /cough. Who could blame a shaman though, as their thankless work was so very repetitive and mindnumbing. I for one truly appreciated every moment and every buff our shaman gave out. Buud gets the &quot;Are you even here Buud?&quot; award, and Bakuba, when he played, was another shaman of great skill.<br>
<br>
Between Tanja, Malla, Teeth, and Chik...well...we had the best bards on server, easily. Truly great players all of them.<br>
<br>
Eanen deserves mentioning here due to the fact that I could send him a tell saying &quot;ok now...mess with Bordamere some&quot; and he would, and the next thing I would see is *Bordamere tells the guild, &quot;Eanen has some serious @#%$ problems.&quot;* As far as comic relief and an overall morale booster, Eanen makes the top of the list.<br>
<br>
Vandor/Ggan were a couple of characters for sure, both stubborn and cocky, both great players and both wanting to be the best. So very @#%$ happy that I don't have to spend 3 hours in &quot;the hole&quot; these days, as that was just ridiculous...but aptly named.<br>
<br>
Yoza/Kold/Wwaan, great pull team, great communication, and though I am certain I was such a pain in the ass at times that they just wanted to /q (and probably did a few times), I truly appreciate  all that each of these folks did, great people, great friends.<br>
<br>
Scarcius...the original &quot;rogue&quot; from my time in Seventh Circle...my friend, the first epic of any class on the server, truly a workhorse of a player. Talisen, though the incescant whining about that @#%$ ring almost drove me insane a few times (not that it was a long drive) Of course one can't not mention names like Hits, Xaba, and Prudance when one mentions great players...Xaba being the only one that could really beat me in a duel as far as I can remember...Damn you Xaba...and you Talisen with that damn bow...gah.<br>
<br>
Woow, Tache, Arkinia...ahhh druids. Druids are solo artists, and &quot;utility&quot; players. They port they buff they heal and at times (Hoshkar) they nuke like @#%$ mad. None were better at this that I can think of than the afformentioned crew.<br>
<br>
Clerics are about the most important class there is, and sitting at the top of that list would have to be Biffins. Biffins was much more than a cleric, he helped me run the show for a long time, and I really never thanked him for doing so..Thank you Biffins. Bordamere, although he slacked off towards the end there and hardly played, would also be one of the best clerics I ever got to work with. I too would have to mention Yalla here, as she was very dedicated, very talented, very aware at all times, and a great player.<br>
<br>
the list continues...<br>
<br>
Warriors is a tough one for me. As far as best in show...well its a tough call. The BEST warrior would have to be reltentless, wanting to tank every mob, wanting to control and drive that mob where we needed it, at all times aware of the battle at hand, of their role, and the roles of the others around him/her. The names that hit me first are names like..Storaz..Helratos..Taldadar..Otzlee and of course Poper (when he wanted to, which wasn't always..not to knock the man, he will always be remembered as a great guy and a great player). The list of warriors could go on and on. Helratos gets the award for the most heroic display (in real life this is) of any man/woman I have ever heard of in my life. Some of you know what I am talkin about , some dont....if you want to know about it, don't ask him because he probably won't tell you. Otzlee gets an award for just being overall strange..but a great guy, great friend, great player.<br>
<br>
@#%$, the list continues...<br>
<br>
Damacles and Tuldar, you guys were the unseen backbone of the guild, thankless due to the fact that you died in 5 seconds in every @#%$ fight we ever had, underappreciated, but truly talented players, great guys, wonderful teammates...<br>
<br>
So the list could go on but I will end it here, my apologies to folks I didn't list...Why is this list so long you ask? Simple..because I never got the opportunity to thank the people that made the game fun for me, because I simply dropped off the face of the earth and was gone. Before I am done here though, I want to thank a couple more folks. <br>
<br>
Darkoor, you helped me so very much near my end, when I was at the end of my rope, you made the groups, you took over when I needed a break. I know we didn't end up on the best of terms, but thank you for all you did.<br>
<br>
Ellise, one of my closest friends on Quellious...we also didn't end up on the best of terms, but you also helped me so very much, and thank you as well.<br>
<br>
I know this list is all VM people and that this server had and still has many more great players. One thing about me though is I hardly paid any mind to any of them, when I was leading VM that was all I knew or cared about...which is why quite a few people despised me I'm sure. So I mean to take nothing away from those folks, Droz was a great player, and a great rival. Dunze was a powerful Ally, and a great friend. <br>
<br>
Anyone else in VM that I didn't mention, consider yourself mentioned, except Mohogany, who I gave so many chances...so many...boggles the mind that guy.<br>
<br>
I miss all of you and wish you the best, this is my &quot;best in show&quot;. (and an hour of my friday-workday gone by...hoorah...)<br>

I learned TONS from these individuals and myself have come a long ways since Crush &amp; Swill or Lords of the Undead. To hear the names of the ppl the people I held the most respect to pre 50 makes me remember and also take in the account of that classes abilities that I as a SK never thought about. <br>
<br>
Occy paying respect to Jubilex or Nine or Kelper tell me alot about these players. I had almost forgot about Keplar it had been so long and 9 also. Was a great mind jogger for me.<br>
<br>
I did not even think for a sec about the LONG month of PoF and have kiliana pullin and Wolfing for/with me where I first met the uber dr00d. I sorry I forgot to write ya down, I just was goin back to pre-Kunark pre 50s yet we were there together.<br>
<br>
Callawyn was a AWESOME enchanter fer a ranja ) and yes sideburns was a totally great person even if he was a paly.<br>
I guess I do not have the memory I wish I could to remember all the great ones of past and VM family members who have moved on. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2740">Grimblades Reaver ~Vis Maior~</a>
