<br>
Solely only to type /who all vis (and now /who all explicit) and say hey to old friends. <br>
<br>
Was just talking to Dhouja for a half-hour last night. Webin the night before. Nida the night before that, and Tache and Deam the night before that.<br>
<br>
My point? It doesnt get any better, than keeping in touch with the great people I met during my time in Vis. <br>
<br>
Being in Vis was something that got in your blood, and mine it definitely did. <br>
<br>
I definitely wore the tag &lt;Vis Maior&gt; with great pride. Which so maybe you understand me a bit better Dark, is why I was so upset when I lost my tag due to returning to rl, and no longer having the time to raid. It was like taking away earned medals from a soldier, and then giving him a dishonorable discharge. <br>
<br>
greatful however for everything always,<br>

Were it not for a couple of familiar names on the roster Id think it was another guild alltogether. Sheesh, did Verant screw up more then usual and run half their players off or something?<br>
<br>
Anyway since the other old codgers are blabbing on about their memories, I might as well do the same, most of these have probably been mentioned, but the few I'm sure I'll always recall  as the best of their time for one reason or another..<br>
<br>
Talisen and Scar,  two guys who played rogues, back when the class was joke, but stuck with it, despite being constantly ridiculed by ignorant people (namely myself) on how much they infact, sucked. Then came RoK...<br>
<br>
Jubi for becoming completely apepoo about dueling, after swearing up and down he didnt care for pvp...(and I still say shadowstep or whatever the spell was called, shouldnt be allowed in gfay).<br>
<br>
Clarisaiaiaisssiaassaia , for giving up being arguably one of the best played, and most useful classes on the server for....an erudite....paladin...<br>
<br>
Septernal for being too skilled to be a something as lousy as a necro.<br>
<br>
Otzlee for being the first person to ever cause me to have to ask someone else to translate just what in the hell they just asked me.. (all kidding aside, needless to say a great player, funny too, once I could understand L33t, atleast.)<br>
<br>
Kepler for being too damn quiet, and of course &quot;badplan&quot;.<br>
<br>
The 800 people at the &quot;badplan&quot; nag raid.<br>
<br>
Fzoule for leting me call him fuzz for 2 years.<br>
<br>
Droz, Biffins, Greco, and Sebin for that damned 24/7 - month long hate raid. Actually that sucked come to think of it, since no one knew if umbral armor dropped in fear or hate. bah.<br>
<br>
The one dr00d at the above raid, who spent most of their time casting that wonderful wolf spell on all 80 of us.<br>
<br>
The stupid !%$@ GM who wouldnt tell me if umbral armor dropped in hate, despite my constant petitions... (see above)<br>
<br>
Rhad and Thkeron, for sticking around to 9am to help get me out after my 17 hour portal-watchin FD-athon. In what I can only assume is still the worst Fear raid in any server's history.<br>
<br>
Ezeke (I believe) for coming up with the plan for the above fear raid (&quot;Everyone just run in....and try to die {near the wall}!&quot;)<br>
<br>
Ninveh, Yoza, Storaz,Tanja, Spalter and Damacles for being euro, and coming to raids in the middle of the night, when quite afew of us  Americans (and the lesser Canadians, of course) were too lazy to bother showing up at 6pm.<br>
<br>
Bubba~ for being a decent guy, for a Canadian, and never really bitching despite dying to every mob fought in that elfy-wood plane, whatever its called.<br>
<br>
Soullance for being more uber then me~ (bastard!)<br>
<br>
Callawyn for for doing 1-60 faster then humanly possible, and making the rest of us look, lazy, which we were, but still..<br>
<br>
Tanja for being Tanja (usually followed by every agro mob with-in three zones, and then some).<br>
<br>
Bord and Jhelad...for well being the only people I can remember who didnt ever become pissed off about something the entire time I knew them (despite my best efforts). <br>
Any guy playing a human, thats willing to dance around as a lowbie in Cazic in a Bronze helm without shame, is automatically uber to say the least. As is any cleric that I can argue with about some godawful b-movie during the middle of some raid battle, and not really worry about dying.<br>
<br>
Ggan for being as good a rival as anyone could ever hope for, ....actually maybe alittle too good come to think of it.(bastard!)<br>
<br>
Koggrog for all the buffing crap he had to go through in VP and elsewhere, and coming back for more each weekend.<br>
<br>
Occy for being at the same time, the grumpiest bastard, and over all one of the greatest friends you could ever hope to come across in an online game, despite the fact he lives in florida and probably votes republican.<br>
<br>
All of MA for hoggin guk, and driving me to vow in a fit of jealousy, to create a guild so strong they'd  be the envy of everyone else on the server, destroy any player driven raid system, abuse Verant's spawn rules and continue to dominate the server for years on end and be led by the vilest bastard this side of Mississippi ,who also happen to be the spawn of foulest pits of hell its..self...er..wait.. Scratch that.<br>
<br>
And pretty much anyone who endured the 72 hour VP buff'fest weekends, but not the ones that enjoyed it, they were after all, clinically insane.<br>
<br>
Not sure what Mohogani or whatever he was called, did to piss everyone off (other then sucking at dueling) since I dont think I was all that active by then, but I do remember a fear raid or two where he was the only warrior...<br>
<br>
And finally myself, for being as longwinded as ever.<br>
<br>
By the way, anyone know what the hell that is at the old vismaior.com site?<br>
