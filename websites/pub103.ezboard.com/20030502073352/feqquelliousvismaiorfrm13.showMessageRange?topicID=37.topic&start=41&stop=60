I'd have to say that during my time with VM, and especially during my time recruiting, VM members were all skillz.  We could kill stuff with less ppl and in less time then anyone else, and we were hated for it ;p.  Racing to mobs with wraith  and other guilds definitly made for fun, eventfull evenings.  I haven't seen Xaba's name listed yet, I always thought he was a lot of fun to be with, and a good rogue to boot.  Barrel was always a skilled warrior in my mind. And I gotta give props to my favorite bards, tanja, malla, Teeth and Chikkin, you guys were great.  I can't stop laughing, picturing chikkin in full bronze on our Ntov raids.....lol /WTB armor   peace<br>

Dont think weird could even begin to describe that particular hate raid come to think of it..skipping Xmas dinner with your family just cause you're afraid drakes might be pulled while you're gone is pretty spiffy though~<br>

Will never forget the groups of people I travelled with pre 50s.  Sebin, Droz, kijah, Terren, and sorry if i missed you.  You are were good friends.  Droz, even though we were split due to our tags, You have always been a respected monk.<br>
<br>
Also, cant forget about the Original Vis Maior.  The 12 founders of Vis that came together with a common goal of wanting to be the best.<br>
<br>
Tanja - Ultimate train master<br>
Kepler - The baddest lvl 10 wizard I will know<br>
Geren - The one who started over<br>
Spalter - The ultimate Ogre Warrior<br>
Vandor - Meanest, baddest, pvp shadow knight on quellious<br>
Jhelad - Mr. Cool <br>
Drahkan - Will always remember you for soloing in fear<br>
Sonieli - Chanter that became the non-leveling paly<br>
Vebe - The ultimate nuking cleric<br>
Occy - Even though we had our differences, you were a good leader<br>
Kenzan - You showed your true colors in fear.  Lost all respect for you<br>
<br>
And for some reason, I cant remember the final person.  I wanna say koggrog but I am not 100% sure he was a founder.<br>
<br>
Woow of course gotta be my master druid counterpart in arms.  We went through some rough times together.<br>
<br>
Also to the ones I didnt mention, dont think I forgot about you.  I am typing this from work and I cant write a book right now.  You know who you are though.<br>

<br>
Woow looses points for abusing that blasted DE Mask more then myself, Jhelad, and Occy combined, ever did.<br>
Also for being one of those blasted MA guk hoggers~<br>
<br>
And Ellise looses points for always porting people to and from raids and not really complaining about it or anything else  all that much, which just isnt....natural.<br>
<br>
Jubi wasnt it? Think I remember saying to Occy something like &quot;What the {censored}?! a Gan?&quot; before I knew him all that well, in my defense he was a member of DoA I think while we were in Seventh. Though it might've been Barcus for all I can remember. Occy should know.<br>
<br>
Koggrog, and a couple others (like Scar, ha), got left behind when we bailed from Seventh to make vis, if I recall right. Which is funny for its own reasons.<br>
<br>
And actually I should confess, I lied, It was me that trained spectres on you in feerott that time, I only blamed Jhelad cause ...well, he was usually always close by when I needed to shift blame to someone other then myself....not that I did that alot or anything... *cough*<br>

<br>
after all these years, all we had to do was stroke some egos and the old fogies come runnin? heh and i was beginning to enjoy my status as Old Man Winter.<br>
<br>
Truth is, the first were the best. they did the most with the least. flowing thought? AA? haste? don't you know that it was almost 2 years before anyone that wasn't a twink had that?<br>
<br>
i will now weigh in.<br>
<br>
the best wizards were the guys who could do more than just nuke : Darkoor, Jubilex, Occy.<br>
<br>
the best bards will always be Tanja and Malla. the nicest bards will always be Teeth and Chikkin, because we all know that you have to be a little mean to be a girl bard, and a little light in the loafers to be a boy one.<br>
<br>
the best druids are Zita, Woow and Ellise. i don't think Ellise gets enough credit for her play ability. ask her to type /pl and tell you what it says, you can't fake experience. Andy, i'm listening to (that ridiculously long trance song).<br>
<br>
the best rogue is Talisen. he used to be such a ridiculously positive little wretch, always smilin, always tryin to help, rpin like a damned paladin. he gave the eventual winner of the server-wide pvp event her best run for the money, or so i hear. then we got a hold of him :P. Pepe i would have nominated, then that bastard Snoggy got in the way of our love affair~.<br>
<br>
Evercasting and Eanen. all mages take it in the ear, but these two were good to have anyways.<br>
<br>
Sonieli was the best, or so i'm told. boo. Dhouja Eleet Prizm and Callawyn are my favourite skirts, bar none.<br>
<br>
rangers suck. my favourite morsel for Trak : Tuldar.<br>
<br>
Droz, Kold are two of the most driven and least thanked people that play this game. if they played your class, they would own you. Droz is one of only two non-Vis i will nominate, because well, he's the only one that deserves it. not biased!<br>
<br>
J and Soullance are as near as you can get to what a paladin should be, RP or skill. got chops?~<br>
<br>
Ggan is the best shadowknight anywhere, on any server. this is no small praise, seeing as how thats my original class, and, if they didn't take two years to 'balance', would have been my only one. consider this when i say: Ggan is Jesus.<br>
<br>
Krelian and Drakahn were the best necros, when they were arguably the best class. NPCs from Kaladim to PoF still hear Drak's name and shiver. plus i owe him for about 20 summon/resses with the big damn coffins. Krelian is the only person i will nominate twice, he's that damn good.<br>
<br>
shamans are EQ's punching bags. if someone says rangers or mages, @#%$ YOU. i played shaman, and clerics sending me tells for agi in a gdamned VP raid (biffins!) is enough for Sainthood in the Catholic Church, 4tru.  Buba is my biased favourite. Niira Kogg and Songla are more gifted, but no one took the abuse that Buba did, breaking into two of the most Godless zones ever as the lone automated buffdispenser. and no one paid with more blood (his own) in those raids.  some people say that the old sploit that got him his Spear of Fate was a fluke. anyone that knows Buba knows that was no fluke.<br>
<br>
Tald was the best fighter, ever.  Greco was the best tank.  Storaz was the smartest. Spalter was the most engaging human being i've ever met. the world beckoned him away from his PC before he could share in some of our greatest accomplishments.<br>
<br>
the best class is cleric. the best cleric ever is Eric. too bad he knows it :P.  Yalla is a close second. she was the glue in a really rough time. i was faking it: i had a water-powered duck dipper thing like Homer over my hotkey for CH.<br>
<br>
best officer/mean lady: Prudance. you were so evil. i loved it~<br>
<br>
the best bottom-feeding, inbred, backwards, ornery, shotgun-toting, possum-eating, peach-picking, shine-drinking, front-teeth-missing, groin-scratching, square-dancing, mood-swinging, hate-mongering, squinting, chaw-chewing, rootin', tootin' son-of-a-bitch Georgia Cracker Hillbilly Tyrant was Vandor. i miss him.<br>
<br>
best duo : Kron and Faun. i always felt like such a tool when i'd say something in guild and you'd both correct me separately.<br>
<br>
funniest team: ph33l0n d33zn00tz, 3d, Brian, Dariuz, Xaba and p0rf. good times never last.<br>
<br>
funniest man alive: Buud. you are the King of Bears. i salute you and all your Sleeper's Tomb tanking glory.<br>
<br>
Best Troll : Mohogani. they say genius is next to madness. Occy crossed the line the day he guilded you.  i'll never forget that day; RL friends sent tells laughing at me.<br>
<br>
Best name: Chris. this was a majority vote.<br>
<br>
i would post my email address, but i would probably delete unfamiliar names with the seventy-nine ads for Viagra, Real Estate, College Degrees or all of the above.<br>
Stay Harder Longer in your new home at LMU!<br>

<br>
<br>
In a gay misquoted rehash version of first times talking to you, I remember you saying to me one day <br>
<br>
&quot;well your'e a recruit, you might get guilded or something, guess I should learn about you, where you from?&quot;<br>
<br>
and you asked me like two more questions...<br>
<br>
and i'm like &quot;uh so like what about you?&quot;<br>
and I'm all thinking Bord's the nicest guy, trying to get to know me and @#%$, and I start talking to him, until finally he's like <br>
<br>
&quot;Look, im' an @#%$, dont talk to me.. no serious I hate everybody, quit talking to me -- look i hate you&quot;<br>
<br>
lol I was a damn new recruit too Bord, I remember telling Tinnel &quot;er, Bord was nice, and then in like 2 tells later, he said he hates me, and he seems serious, he always like that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Tinnel's reply &quot;Hold on a sec, i'm in tell-hell&quot; <br>
<br>
lol and yah Occy, Tinnel owned, I will always remember him for &quot;taking care&quot; of me while I was a recruit, and he was the recruiting officer. <br>
<br>
<br>
I must have talked to Dhouja for nearly 2 hours last night about old Vis, truly was great days. Nobody could touch us. And when someone got close, they crumbled. I will never forget having such a desire to win on ST keys and the such, that I gave my phone number Ellise, making her promise to call me if Kland popped, so that I would be there for the guild, or the many of conversations I had with Yalla, about how we were going to farm and time Myga together, even if it meant waking up at 3 or 4am or 9am etc. Vis had the most dedicated crew. We didnt know what &quot;2nd place&quot; meant. <br>
<br>
<br>
always long-winded, <br>

Bah Bord, didnt you learn anything, stroking egos is what playing online games is all about, sheesh thought we taught everyone that while they were recruits or something. It was even in the charter....hell it was the charter.<br>
<br>
anyway, you can edit your host file in windows to stop all that spam mail from adservers or ...just stop going to all those canadian p0rn sites.<br>
<br>
Drop me a line if you (or any of you other old coots) happen to pick up another online game at odin@ellijay.com, chances are we're all lookin forward to the same up-coming game (wookie hairdressers, woot), and it could (possibly) be fun to insult all of you in real time once again instead of this message board crap~.<br>

Best wizard as twinked by a ranger: Darkoor<br>
Quickest ranger to give up because &quot;Melee is too hard&quot; :Xaviertalon<br>
Angriest Canadian: Bordamere (also won ugliest dwarf)<br>
Best cleric besides Snoggy: Vebe<br>
Player most likely to go LD: Woow<br>
Guild most likely to be Canadian: Vis Maior (also won most mispelled guildname)<br>
Player most likely to leave your password out and have a friend 'borrow' it: Eric<br>
Most used excuse for having your account cleaned out: &quot;A friend must have stolen it off my desk&quot;<br>
Wizard most likely to not help you get Ravenscale: Occy (also won most likely to ditch you in CT)<br>
Funniest EQ player ever: Putzlee<br>
Funniest fued in eq: Taldadar vs. Poper after the armor in the tree hugger plane or maybe it was Occy vs. Hanse<br>
Person to send me the most &quot;I'm not gay&quot; tells: Taldadar<br>
Strangest eq romance: Sebin and Natalii or maybe Droz and Zeena.<br>
Warrior most likely to be Canadian: Poper (also won funniest Canadian who isn't Red Green)<br>
Monk most likely to grab my boots from Kold without asking: Yoza (also won best tattoo not on a arm)<br>
<br>
Now the award you've all been waiting for: Biggest Pain In The Ass in eq. The competition was very close and it was an agonizing decision for our judges to finally award the BPITA award. After carefull deliberation the winner is...... me (bruhahaha) Its all mine..<br>
<br>
<br>
Now my list for the original cast of Quellious the Movie. The guys that I always was playing catch up with:<br>
<br>
Rogue: Hanse<br>
Wizard: Occy<br>
Cleric: Biffins (though Sebin gets a special mention too)<br>
Warrior: Greco<br>
Monk: Droz<br>
Paladin: Jhelad (or that punk Tanven)<br>
Ranger: Natalii<br>
Druid: All of MA (think it was an all druid guild with a token cleric)<br>
Enchanter: Dhouja<br>
Necromancer: Sepeternal<br>
Shadowknight: (they sucked all the way to when I quit)<br>
<br>
Well honestly I don't think I saw a necro or chanter before RoK but, just want to fill out the list. Funny enough I think that list was damn close to my group more then once. Lots of people after them but, they were the originals and I have the emotional scars to prove it. Not saying the best (though some may be) but, they are the original cast of Quellious<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*edited once again because I can't even remember all the classes in eq anymore. Its been awhile<br>

<br>
Always stealing my lines arnt you canda<br>
<br>
this is why poper beotch slapped you daily!<br>
<br>
- as much as we BS and joke<br>
<br>
Nothing replaces the old times, and I'd have to say person most likely to effect our lifes: Poper<br>
<br>
simply put, the man moved us.. wasnt loud and outspoken and he wasnt proud or arrogant<br>
<br>
he just WAS.. <br>
<br>
was always there<br>
was always the voice of reason<br>
was always ready to fight for what he belived in<br>
was always a friend<br>
was always someone you knew could love<br>
was always showing with actions<br>
was always the best<br>
was always watch Red Green<br>
was always making our day better<br>
<br>
...things changed with him gone, days seemed less funny and for months, even still there is a void about a great friend<br>
<br>
When I think back to a more orginal cast<br>
<br>
I dont think there were more &quot;legends&quot; than us.<br>
<br>
perhaps in the end, everyone took thier chance to ride out into the sunset, take that hero'es walk<br>
whieter by choice or by force<br>
<br>
In the End, no one forgets - they move on<br>
<br>
Heroes dont Die - they just fade away<br>
..but never forgetten<br>
