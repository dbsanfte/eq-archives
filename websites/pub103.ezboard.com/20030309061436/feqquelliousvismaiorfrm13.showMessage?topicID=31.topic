<br>
My name is Dennis Berg, and I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage. Although I do now know your real name, I don't know much regarding the intimate details of your life like you do of mine. You see, on or around the afternoon of October 11, 2002, you hacked into my email account at murnende@hotmail.com, changed my password and read all 59 of the personal emails I had saved there.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should give people a little history before I continue. As I mentioned before, my name is Dennis Berg. I live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and I was the person behind Bercilak Nagilfarbearer and Beowulfe Grendelbane on the Quellious Server in Everquest. You know more than that, though, don't you Balahd? You know my address and my phone number and my mother's maiden name, don't you? I'm close friends with the person that plays Kelsie Hae`leoth, and I understand it was an attempt to gather information to use against her that you hacked and read my email.<br>
<br>
You found out some fascinating things, didn't you? You learned that I have a pet name for Kelsie, and that I had a pet name for another of my friends from everquest. You saw the registration confirmation emails for most of the sites to which I posted when I played EQ. You saw a few jokes and such that had been forwarded to me and some junk mail. Nothing too exciting, was there?<br>
<br>
Did you feel like more of a man when you read the silly little poems that I wrote to Zeph? Oh yes, I called her Carebear, but then you know that, don't you? I know you do because you told Kelsie. Perhaps you'd like to know that it was because her surname in game was Tenderheart that she got that particular nickname? Would that make you feel like more of a man? It was never a secret, but instead of talking to me you had to hack my email to find out. Did that little gem accomplish your goals? How about my nickname for Kelsie? You know that one too, don't you? For the uninitiated, I call her Kitten, not that it's any of your business either. But you had to drag it out into the public eye, didn't you Balahd?<br>
<br>
Did it work? Is Kelsie your girlfriend now? Hrmm, didn't think so. I wonder what it is about acting like a complete psycho that turns women off? Are you lonely? Maybe it would be better to talk to women, find ones that share your interests and have a real genuine discussion with them. Wouldn't that work better than the mind games that you've been playing with Kelsie over the last number of months? You think that perhaps listening to them and building them up would bring more success than calling them sluts and whores and threatening to divulge all their secrets if they don't do what you want?<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, I don't have the technical knowledge you do. I can't fight you in the hacking arena. You want to hack my new password? Feel free. I've deleted everything in there. Everything else is on my hard drive. I imagine that you can find my IP and hack through my firewall, given enough time. Feel free, I really don't have any secrets. What I am going to do though is fight you in the avenues that are open to me. I'm posting here as a warning to those that might trust you. After all, murnende wasn't one of my characters in game . . . so you got my email by pulling it off the headers of email jokes that Kelsie forwarded to you. How many accounts did you hack before you found the right one? Maybe some of your friends should consider that. What private details can you offer of their lives? Enquiring minds want to know.<br>
<br>
My intent is also to inform hotmail of this breach of security. I will work with them to provide any details they require to provide me with the hard evidence I need before going to the Canadian and German authorities to see what legal recourse I have at my disposal. Assuming there is none, enjoy the feeling of power. You've made me realize that I need to be a lot more security conscious in the future. You've invaded my privacy in a way that I shouldn't have to accept, but I will. If your hope was to destroy my friendship with Kelsie, that's failed too. I've sincerely recommended that she never talk to you again, but that's for her own protection, not mine. I think that maybe you should seek help, hacking the email of someone you've never even spoken to cause pain to someone close to you isn't the most balanced behaviour I've ever witnessed.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Dennis M. Berg<br>
aka Bercilak<br>
<br>
As a note, my password for hotmail was apfsdsdu . . . not exactly what I consider to be an obvious one, so I didn't make things easy on him. I didn't ask for this, as I can honestly say that I never once spoke to Balahd, regardless of how I felt about how he spoke to Kelsie.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000033><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/beqquelliousvismaior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faeun>Faeun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FFFFCC>(11/6/02 4:02:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub103.ezboard.com/feqquelliousvismaiorfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wha?</span><hr size=1> Wha? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000033><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/beqquelliousvismaior.showUserPublicProfile?gid=warlordette>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#FFFFCC>(11/18/02 12:10:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub103.ezboard.com/feqquelliousvismaiorfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wha?</span><hr size=1> whoa..heh<br>
