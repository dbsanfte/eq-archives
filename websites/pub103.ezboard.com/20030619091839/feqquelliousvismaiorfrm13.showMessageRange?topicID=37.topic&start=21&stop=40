Honestly as far as &quot;best in show&quot; my list would contain every member of VM throughout the months we spent raiding Veeshans Peak. <br>
<br>
Some names I haven't seen mentioned here that I believe should be are names like Tinnel. Tinnel was such a good player, and so much help to me/us on so many occasions, to not see his name mentioned anywhere is ridiculous. <br>
<br>
To list Soullance and not Jhelad is also fairly sad, as they were both great players and key to any victory we ever had. Not to mention the relentless and at times thoughtless Juzzam, I believe he deserves honorable mention here.<br>
<br>
No one mentioned Soullance's brother and one of VM's original enchanters Eleet. Dhouja and Eleet... they were a great team, and I never felt safer on any dungeon crawling expedition than I did when I had those two clowns with me. Callawyn of course was also a player of great skill and I would never say otherwise nor could I leave him out of any topic involving enchanters. Prizm was also an enchantress of great skill, and deserves mentioning here.<br>
<br>
Kogg was the best in show during his prime, though he got lazy and slacked off there towards the end /cough. Who could blame a shaman though, as their thankless work was so very repetitive and mindnumbing. I for one truly appreciated every moment and every buff our shaman gave out. Buud gets the &quot;Are you even here Buud?&quot; award, and Bakuba, when he played, was another shaman of great skill.<br>
<br>
Between Tanja, Malla, Teeth, and Chik...well...we had the best bards on server, easily. Truly great players all of them.<br>
<br>
Eanen deserves mentioning here due to the fact that I could send him a tell saying &quot;ok now...mess with Bordamere some&quot; and he would, and the next thing I would see is *Bordamere tells the guild, &quot;Eanen has some serious @#%$ problems.&quot;* As far as comic relief and an overall morale booster, Eanen makes the top of the list.<br>
<br>
Vandor/Ggan were a couple of characters for sure, both stubborn and cocky, both great players and both wanting to be the best. So very @#%$ happy that I don't have to spend 3 hours in &quot;the hole&quot; these days, as that was just ridiculous...but aptly named.<br>
<br>
Yoza/Kold/Wwaan, great pull team, great communication, and though I am certain I was such a pain in the ass at times that they just wanted to /q (and probably did a few times), I truly appreciate  all that each of these folks did, great people, great friends.<br>
<br>
Scarcius...the original &quot;rogue&quot; from my time in Seventh Circle...my friend, the first epic of any class on the server, truly a workhorse of a player. Talisen, though the incescant whining about that @#%$ ring almost drove me insane a few times (not that it was a long drive) Of course one can't not mention names like Hits, Xaba, and Prudance when one mentions great players...Xaba being the only one that could really beat me in a duel as far as I can remember...Damn you Xaba...and you Talisen with that damn bow...gah.<br>
<br>
Woow, Tache, Arkinia...ahhh druids. Druids are solo artists, and &quot;utility&quot; players. They port they buff they heal and at times (Hoshkar) they nuke like @#%$ mad. None were better at this that I can think of than the afformentioned crew.<br>
<br>
Clerics are about the most important class there is, and sitting at the top of that list would have to be Biffins. Biffins was much more than a cleric, he helped me run the show for a long time, and I really never thanked him for doing so..Thank you Biffins. Bordamere, although he slacked off towards the end there and hardly played, would also be one of the best clerics I ever got to work with. I too would have to mention Yalla here, as she was very dedicated, very talented, very aware at all times, and a great player.<br>
<br>
the list continues...<br>
<br>
Warriors is a tough one for me. As far as best in show...well its a tough call. The BEST warrior would have to be reltentless, wanting to tank every mob, wanting to control and drive that mob where we needed it, at all times aware of the battle at hand, of their role, and the roles of the others around him/her. The names that hit me first are names like..Storaz..Helratos..Taldadar..Otzlee and of course Poper (when he wanted to, which wasn't always..not to knock the man, he will always be remembered as a great guy and a great player). The list of warriors could go on and on. Helratos gets the award for the most heroic display (in real life this is) of any man/woman I have ever heard of in my life. Some of you know what I am talkin about , some dont....if you want to know about it, don't ask him because he probably won't tell you. Otzlee gets an award for just being overall strange..but a great guy, great friend, great player.<br>
<br>
@#%$, the list continues...<br>
<br>
Damacles and Tuldar, you guys were the unseen backbone of the guild, thankless due to the fact that you died in 5 seconds in every @#%$ fight we ever had, underappreciated, but truly talented players, great guys, wonderful teammates...<br>
<br>
So the list could go on but I will end it here, my apologies to folks I didn't list...Why is this list so long you ask? Simple..because I never got the opportunity to thank the people that made the game fun for me, because I simply dropped off the face of the earth and was gone. Before I am done here though, I want to thank a couple more folks. <br>
<br>
Darkoor, you helped me so very much near my end, when I was at the end of my rope, you made the groups, you took over when I needed a break. I know we didn't end up on the best of terms, but thank you for all you did.<br>
<br>
Ellise, one of my closest friends on Quellious...we also didn't end up on the best of terms, but you also helped me so very much, and thank you as well.<br>
<br>
I know this list is all VM people and that this server had and still has many more great players. One thing about me though is I hardly paid any mind to any of them, when I was leading VM that was all I knew or cared about...which is why quite a few people despised me I'm sure. So I mean to take nothing away from those folks, Droz was a great player, and a great rival. Dunze was a powerful Ally, and a great friend. <br>
<br>
Anyone else in VM that I didn't mention, consider yourself mentioned, except Mohogany, who I gave so many chances...so many...boggles the mind that guy.<br>
<br>
I miss all of you and wish you the best, this is my &quot;best in show&quot;. (and an hour of my friday-workday gone by...hoorah...)<br>

I learned TONS from these individuals and myself have come a long ways since Crush &amp; Swill or Lords of the Undead. To hear the names of the ppl the people I held the most respect to pre 50 makes me remember and also take in the account of that classes abilities that I as a SK never thought about. <br>
<br>
Occy paying respect to Jubilex or Nine or Kelper tell me alot about these players. I had almost forgot about Keplar it had been so long and 9 also. Was a great mind jogger for me.<br>
<br>
I did not even think for a sec about the LONG month of PoF and have kiliana pullin and Wolfing for/with me where I first met the uber dr00d. I sorry I forgot to write ya down, I just was goin back to pre-Kunark pre 50s yet we were there together.<br>
<br>
Callawyn was a AWESOME enchanter fer a ranja ) and yes sideburns was a totally great person even if he was a paly.<br>
I guess I do not have the memory I wish I could to remember all the great ones of past and VM family members who have moved on. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=2740">Grimblades Reaver ~Vis Maior~</a>

Now that has said alot about pasts, so many good and bad things happened.<br>
<br>
sometimes its not where you go, but how you got there and with who.<br>
<br>
Everyday a Legend is born, and dies. We all have a way of moving on or making a exit. good or bad.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, The Axe has to be placed deep in the ground, and the memories let in.<br>
<br>
Occy's Post shows alot of that. and those days were some of the best. my love for vis and things came from that. Me and C talked alot about this game and guild.<br>
<br>
It ended on a very bad Note, and alot of hurt feelings. but there is and was alot of good to.<br>

<br>
There are always certain people that stand out thru all of these times, though I am not really sure its because of how they played. Most people that stand out in my memory do so because of friendships, people going out of their way for others, and some for just always being there. Occy, you were one of those people. I wish things didn't end for us as they did.<br>

We will all leave EQ someday, and the only things we are able to take with us will be our memories and our friendships. I hope to take with me many wonderful of both.<br>

Ya i guess i miss the &quot;old days&quot; in some ways, but the way people have changed here since I came back to play everquest is nothing I never imagined...and I dont mean that in a good way..<br>
<br>
My happiest eq moment is still when we destroyed Hoshkar, if I try explain that to someone today who wasnt there they will say :<br>
<br>
&quot;Whats ya mean , Hoshkar only got 32k hp, thats not hard&quot;<br>
<br>
Padawan, you have no idea how hard he was.<br>

Ggan and Vandor were fairly large influences on me personally, mainly ggan.. cause he joined my guild one time at level 52 (was a joke but still) and he gave me some advice on dark forge. ive been stalking him ever since O_o <br>
<br>
Vandor.. yea well.. vandor ... uh.. well he was a human -_- *shudder*<br>
<br>
currently, bakal is my mentor/homeyz so gotta talk about him too... i remember back in the day with occy. he didnt talk to me much, but when he did it was so cool~ =p<br>
<br>
and Milko.. she was in vis for awhile wasnt she? im sure she was... milko is my best friend ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ she told me what QQ meant. i felt so stupid.. lol. (QQ is cry eyez) (oh! *smack forehead*)<br>

<br>
Solely only to type /who all vis (and now /who all explicit) and say hey to old friends. <br>
<br>
Was just talking to Dhouja for a half-hour last night. Webin the night before. Nida the night before that, and Tache and Deam the night before that.<br>
<br>
My point? It doesnt get any better, than keeping in touch with the great people I met during my time in Vis. <br>
<br>
Being in Vis was something that got in your blood, and mine it definitely did. <br>
<br>
I definitely wore the tag &lt;Vis Maior&gt; with great pride. Which so maybe you understand me a bit better Dark, is why I was so upset when I lost my tag due to returning to rl, and no longer having the time to raid. It was like taking away earned medals from a soldier, and then giving him a dishonorable discharge. <br>
<br>
greatful however for everything always,<br>

Were it not for a couple of familiar names on the roster Id think it was another guild alltogether. Sheesh, did Verant screw up more then usual and run half their players off or something?<br>
<br>
Anyway since the other old codgers are blabbing on about their memories, I might as well do the same, most of these have probably been mentioned, but the few I'm sure I'll always recall  as the best of their time for one reason or another..<br>
<br>
Talisen and Scar,  two guys who played rogues, back when the class was joke, but stuck with it, despite being constantly ridiculed by ignorant people (namely myself) on how much they infact, sucked. Then came RoK...<br>
<br>
Jubi for becoming completely apepoo about dueling, after swearing up and down he didnt care for pvp...(and I still say shadowstep or whatever the spell was called, shouldnt be allowed in gfay).<br>
<br>
Clarisaiaiaisssiaassaia , for giving up being arguably one of the best played, and most useful classes on the server for....an erudite....paladin...<br>
<br>
Septernal for being too skilled to be a something as lousy as a necro.<br>
<br>
Otzlee for being the first person to ever cause me to have to ask someone else to translate just what in the hell they just asked me.. (all kidding aside, needless to say a great player, funny too, once I could understand L33t, atleast.)<br>
<br>
Kepler for being too damn quiet, and of course &quot;badplan&quot;.<br>
<br>
The 800 people at the &quot;badplan&quot; nag raid.<br>
<br>
Fzoule for leting me call him fuzz for 2 years.<br>
<br>
Droz, Biffins, Greco, and Sebin for that damned 24/7 - month long hate raid. Actually that sucked come to think of it, since no one knew if umbral armor dropped in fear or hate. bah.<br>
<br>
The one dr00d at the above raid, who spent most of their time casting that wonderful wolf spell on all 80 of us.<br>
<br>
The stupid !%$@ GM who wouldnt tell me if umbral armor dropped in hate, despite my constant petitions... (see above)<br>
<br>
Rhad and Thkeron, for sticking around to 9am to help get me out after my 17 hour portal-watchin FD-athon. In what I can only assume is still the worst Fear raid in any server's history.<br>
<br>
Ezeke (I believe) for coming up with the plan for the above fear raid (&quot;Everyone just run in....and try to die {near the wall}!&quot;)<br>
<br>
Ninveh, Yoza, Storaz,Tanja, Spalter and Damacles for being euro, and coming to raids in the middle of the night, when quite afew of us  Americans (and the lesser Canadians, of course) were too lazy to bother showing up at 6pm.<br>
<br>
Bubba~ for being a decent guy, for a Canadian, and never really bitching despite dying to every mob fought in that elfy-wood plane, whatever its called.<br>
<br>
Soullance for being more uber then me~ (bastard!)<br>
<br>
Callawyn for for doing 1-60 faster then humanly possible, and making the rest of us look, lazy, which we were, but still..<br>
<br>
Tanja for being Tanja (usually followed by every agro mob with-in three zones, and then some).<br>
<br>
Bord and Jhelad...for well being the only people I can remember who didnt ever become pissed off about something the entire time I knew them (despite my best efforts). <br>
Any guy playing a human, thats willing to dance around as a lowbie in Cazic in a Bronze helm without shame, is automatically uber to say the least. As is any cleric that I can argue with about some godawful b-movie during the middle of some raid battle, and not really worry about dying.<br>
<br>
Ggan for being as good a rival as anyone could ever hope for, ....actually maybe alittle too good come to think of it.(bastard!)<br>
<br>
Koggrog for all the buffing crap he had to go through in VP and elsewhere, and coming back for more each weekend.<br>
<br>
Occy for being at the same time, the grumpiest bastard, and over all one of the greatest friends you could ever hope to come across in an online game, despite the fact he lives in florida and probably votes republican.<br>
<br>
All of MA for hoggin guk, and driving me to vow in a fit of jealousy, to create a guild so strong they'd  be the envy of everyone else on the server, destroy any player driven raid system, abuse Verant's spawn rules and continue to dominate the server for years on end and be led by the vilest bastard this side of Mississippi ,who also happen to be the spawn of foulest pits of hell its..self...er..wait.. Scratch that.<br>
<br>
And pretty much anyone who endured the 72 hour VP buff'fest weekends, but not the ones that enjoyed it, they were after all, clinically insane.<br>
<br>
Not sure what Mohogani or whatever he was called, did to piss everyone off (other then sucking at dueling) since I dont think I was all that active by then, but I do remember a fear raid or two where he was the only warrior...<br>
<br>
And finally myself, for being as longwinded as ever.<br>
<br>
By the way, anyone know what the hell that is at the old vismaior.com site?<br>

oh and btw, not sure how current Vis would feel about posting the link, but Vandor if you're not aware, and do want to make contact with some of your old friends, you can reach many old Vis, including Zita, Malla, Tanja, Soul, Dhouja, and several others at explicitguild.com.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/uturkee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Turkee </A> at: 8/31/02 2:41:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#414f6e><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub103.ezboard.com/ubiffins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Biffins</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#FFFFCC>(8/31/02 10:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub103.ezboard.com/feqquelliousvismaiorfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Bah Vandor, u got first full planar on server I think, and it took you like a month. I still remember that it took me like 6 months to get my Ethereal Mist BP, and someone logged me on to loot it out of pity, I think it was Sebin - thanks dude. But I must say you stuck around up there regardless ... and I still remember we had enchanters scouting with skel illusion - those were weird times up there. And dam Scarcius would walk with sneak/hide, back when it was extremely slow paced, and just explore the zone and hail Innoruuk and be completely useless (like Snoggy was) - but he was always a good guy.<br>
<br>
Occy - appreciate the nice words - and although you took alot of flack (thats probably an extreme understatement) Vis wouldn't be where it is at today without that &quot;drive&quot; that you had to just own everything, and some of us needed that extra push so we could get that gold at the end of the mine. <br>
<br>
Honorable mention to everyone I forgot that Occy listed - thats what happens when ur writing it up in 2 minutes inbetween chapters, tried keeping it short and sweet unlike some of my novel posts of old. Can't forget Sebin, Droz, Greco, Kijah, Kepler, Tolsys, Kindayin, Zeena, Terren, etc of old Wraith who helped me out a ton when I was like 35+ to get 50 and made those days pre-RoK fun. Nothing beats watchin Terren *attempt* to tank Maestro in hate back when Yak was the best warrior wep and Greco couldn't taunt for his life against Terren's Rat whip / Flux axe.<br>
<br>
Anyhow - hope all you old-timers are doin well, we had some good times, but it seems like 80% are on to bigger and better things. <br>
