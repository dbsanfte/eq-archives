<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">I figured since its such a nice day
here today I would throw together the first guild news of Spring!&nbsp;</font><font

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">~Woodmuffin has returned!
&#133;&#133;&#133;*hears nothing but silence*&#133;&#133;..Welcome back Wood!&nbsp;</font><font
FACE="Helv" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">~Everyone has leveled pretty much
into the 20s, and many of our members are going to even be 40 soon.&nbsp; We have several
new members, friends of Grumoor who are in their mid teens but I&#146;m sure will soon be
right along with everyone.&nbsp; One is a Enchanter!&nbsp; Woohoo.&nbsp;</font><font
FACE="Helv" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Helv" size="4">~Remember when Fatalflury hits 29 we
are all having a &quot;Pot Luck&quot; Morayne is bringing Potato Salad, Gorlail is
bringing lots of booze, Denna is bringing Gnome chips (Cant eat just one!) and Fatal is
bringing herself.&nbsp; Main course will be Human 29th lvl cleric in a a........</font><font

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">&nbsp;~Goguk and myself have joined
Wood in being high enough level for the planes, although I haven&#146;t gone yet and I
don&#146;t think Goguk has either we are ready.&nbsp; Sadly Goguks stuff is in Hate and
mine in Fear but there is stuff for us in the other plane as well.&nbsp; I believe Kwani
is high enough for the planes as well?&nbsp; Now we just need to get Maligno and Kaotic up
in level a ways.</font><font FACE="Helv" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">&nbsp;~Several people have asked me
about becoming officers.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is pretty much everyone in the guild
would make a good to great officer.&nbsp; However that isn&#146;t possible, everyone cant
be a Officer.&nbsp; It isn&#146;t a fault or a problem or sign that you arnt as important
as others if you have asked to become a officer and I said no.&nbsp; It is due to the fact
stated above : Right now we have enough officers.&nbsp; In the future as we grow new
positions will open up and I do remember people who ask about this.&nbsp; The fact that
people like the guild enough to try and gain a position that they can do more for the
guild is a great thing.</font><font FACE="Helv" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">~This is a list of founding members.
&nbsp; This is not meant to mean that they are all officers or better then the rest BUT I
was thinking and I think it is important to recognize those that have been here since the
beginning and continue to be with us.</font><font FACE="Helv" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">~In the coming months several games
are coming out.&nbsp; The market is going to explode with MMORPG&#146;s just like it did
with 3d shooters after Doom and RTS&#146;s after C &amp; C and Warcraft 2.&nbsp; The EQ
expansion is also coming out.&nbsp; Verant has also said they are going to put up more new
servers and split more off from the largest ones.&nbsp; This means that lots of people are
going to slow or stop playing EQ, many others are going to start playing EQ much like what
we saw around X-Mas *Shudders* and the server will have some leave and more will be up.
&nbsp; I have NO CLUE if this means more or less people on Xegony, I know the expansion
will have new zones and will help with overcrowding in high level dungeons and that alone
is nice.&nbsp; The Hole is also going to go up soon I hear , a 45-60 zone.&nbsp; FYI I do
not plan on leaving the server, I don&#146;t plan on moving the guild.</font><font

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">The last split 2 groups of people
left, people who hated the bad people on the server (Destined etc.) and the bad people
(Destined etc.) I have no desire to leave Id rather stay where the economy is something I
know, and where I&#146;ll keep my friends but still have the benefit of less people on the
server.</font><font FACE="Helv" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">~Over crowding is driving me mad
though (not like Madrogran) and so I think we should kinda think about what we could all
do to have fun on the weekends when the only thing we can camp or kill is Large and Giant
rats.</font><font FACE="Helv" size="4"></p>

<p></font><font color="#C0C0C0" FACE="Helv" size="4">One idea myself and the other
officers have discussed is on weekend mornings maybe all playing on one of the PVP Team
servers for a few hours together.&nbsp; Wed all be same level and untwinked, and able to
play in a new enviorment that we don&#146;t really know.&nbsp; This of course is not in
any way meant to be or promote a move to a another server.&nbsp; Just seems since the PVP
servers are so empty most the time that it might be something fun , give people a chance
to play a new char, and everyone start equal while all of us playing together.</font><font

<p>Please post on how you feel about this idea, or post others that you might have and
have a great day!=)</font></p>
