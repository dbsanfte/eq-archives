    <td width="35%" height="33">Our philosophy is made up of three basic guiding principles:
    1. All members will treat all other players, be they members of the Guild or not, with due
    courtesy and respect. 2. All matters will be conducted with an air of friendship, fair
    play and loyalty to all Guild members. 3. There will be no activity in a game which would
    be regarded by the majority of the Guild to be dishonest behaviour or to go against the
    true spirit of the game. By following these principles our members are a positive
    influence in EverQuest. It is our belief that behaving in this manner makes the game more
    enjoyable, not only for others but ourselves as well.</td>

    sword. we are those who are to restore the power that was taken from our ancestors by the
    greater gods. Our ourpose in Norrath is to conquer all races and lands for our God. When
    the Ogres unite and become strong again, like that of our forefathers in the Elder Age,
    the Warlord humself shall return and lead us to victory, and out of the cursed remains of
    our ancestors will rise once again the Ogre Empire. This is our Charter interpreted by

    <td width="35%" height="426">The stormravens were founded a generation ago by a few who
    were left without a home or lands of their own. Some were survivors of a town razed by
    troll attacks, others were outcasts from their human kingdoms and branded as
    &quot;&quot;criminals&quot;&quot;. While still even others were innocent of their crimes
    and were outcast just the same as if they were guilty of a terrible crime. These few
    survivors without home and country formed an alliance bound in the belief that their own
    kingdoms and leaders could never rule the land as it should be. Instead they would act as
    eternal watchers holding a ever vigilant struggle to keep all the kingdoms of norrath in
    check. The founders are now long dead and behind them they left a new force in the world
    of norrath, known as the stormravens.... <font color="#FF0000"><em>Official</em></font></td>

    <td width="35%" height="320"><font color="#00FF00">We recognize that in times of war
    everyone has a specific role to play. Those who would oppose The Assembly of Norrath do
    not recognize the folly of their ways. Through bigotry and hatred, the peoples of Norrath
    are splitting themselves up and fighting each other. It is this action that will lead to
    their ultimate demise. Those of The Assembly of Norrath have recognized this flaw. What
    good is a fighter without a cleric? Who but a necromancer could help you find your lost
    body? Would you not take advantage of a Trolls strength, or an Elven archer, just because
    they are different races? What good is an army comprised solely of fighters when warring
    against fighters and magi? Would you join an army of only human fighters, or would you put
    your bigotry aside, and join the army of Humans, Elves, Erudites, Trolls etc.? Using this
    logic, we intend to unite the peoples of Norrath, using each persons individual strength
    in order to improve the whole. It is in this way that those who oppose us will fall and
    The Assembly will reign supreme! </font></td>
