<p><font color="#00FF00">&nbsp; The Guildmaster does not need to submit his or her guild,
other members can, however the guildmaster is the sole prize receiver of the prizes won.
However, the prize recipient is allowed to do whatever he or she wants to with the prize
after it has been received in the proper owner's discretion.&nbsp; </font></p>

To qualify to compete for the &quot;</font><font color="#FF0000"><strong>EverQuestGuilds/
Guild of The Millennium</strong></font><font color="#00FF00">&quot;&nbsp; contest, all you
have to do is have your guild submitted to EverquestGuilds (located under submit a
guild).&nbsp; In any event, a guild is chosen every week to be the EverQuestGuilds
&quot;Featured Guild of The Week.&quot;&nbsp; Currently, the guild is chosen solely by
yours truly(24K).&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font color="#00FF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all of the &quot;EverQuestGuilds/
Featured Guild of The Week&quot; are selected, a small poll will be offered for players to
vote on their favorite guilds from the selected few.&nbsp; How many weeks are from here to
Sept. 15 I've not a clue, you do the math.&nbsp; In </font>actuality<font color="#00FF00">,
this will be a </font><font color="#FF0000">player's choice award</font><font
color="#00FF00"> hosted by EverQuestGuilds.&nbsp; I feel this time frame is reasonable
considering we need to settle in and let other players form their guilds, and for people
who have not yet joined the World of Norrath.&nbsp; I will verify the voting numbers, and
on October 15, I will announce the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners. &nbsp; Not only will
they receive the free months of play time, they will get a special banner to place on
their homepage indicating that they have won the </font></p>

due to our EverConflict to be as fair as we can be, we have decided to also reward those
hardworking webmaster/webdesigners of these awesome looking pages.&nbsp; If you are the
Guild leader and Webdesigner, good for you ;) But if Webdesigners are not the leaders,
here is some Justification.&nbsp; A website will be chosen by December 15, 1999, to be
selected as <font color="#FF0000">EverQuestGuilds Best-Web-Design Award 1999. </font><font
color="#00FF00">The sole winner, currently selected by be me (24K), will receive </font><font
color="#FF0000">1 year prepaid of EverQuest.</font><font color="#00FF00">&nbsp; All Guilds
submitted will be considered for this prize. I will rate on image, functionality, and
sheer &quot;wow that was an awesome site&quot; shock that I get sometimes when I am
looking at guild sites.&nbsp; If you won the previous GoTM awards, you ARE still eligible
for this contest. So start submitting those guilds, and making them look pretty, for the
EverQuestGuilds image award.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><small><font color="#00FF00">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I claim the right to change contest at
any time, however, I would give at least two weeks notice to any changes made prior to the
change to be implemented.&nbsp; The prizes awarded to the winners should not be subject to
change, barring the Verant/Sony or whoever decided the monthly pricing does not raise the
price per month to play.&nbsp; Otherwise I would personally guarantee the prize to be
awarded to their respective award winners (1st place 1 year of EverQuest paid-2nd place 6
months of EverQuest paid-3rd place 3 months of EverQuest paid).&nbsp; Time frame and other
issues with deadlines are subject to change, due to data collecting and lack of
forecasting on how many guilds will be submitted. (I might be hard pressed for time). Once
again, we are not in any way affiliated with the official EverQuest site and all
statements about the game are opinions from the EverQuestGuilds staff. I am very sorry for
using that dreaded Millennium word over and over, but hey, give a guy a break ;)</font></small></p>
