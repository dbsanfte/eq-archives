    our advancement. We work with the ethic of teamwork, and that good can be found in even
    the most evil of people. This is why we don't have an alignment requirement. +PvP is
    allowed for those who wish. We are accepting applications for guild members, applicants
    are required to group with current members and be sponsored by at least one member. This
    will be verified with the sponser. Help us become the best! <em><font color="#FF0000">Official</font></em></td>
