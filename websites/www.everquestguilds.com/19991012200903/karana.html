    have bound together under a pact of trust to journey Norrath in search of fortune and
    glory. We have heard many fabulous tales of danger and riches, and each promise of
    adventure burns like a fire in our souls. To realize these dreams, we must depend on
    others, and trust in others. Thus, the Order of the Emerald Axe was founded. What was
    initially a chance meeting of old friends on a lonely road, has become a close-knit group
    of brethren bound to defend each other. Though our members come from different creeds and
    beliefs, we are of the same mind. There are those among us that seek to help the
    oppressed, and there are those that seek to exploit them. Our viewpoints and personal
    beliefs are each our own, but being guild members, we ally ourselves to each other at all
    costs. Our pledge is to honor each other's values and uphold the trust of the union. We
    hold regular meetings to determine our courses of action, based on current events. We do
    not accept applications for membership, but rather invite those that we trust. <font color="#FF0000"><em>Official</em></font></td>
