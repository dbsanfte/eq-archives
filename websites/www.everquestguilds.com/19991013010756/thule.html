    of Innoruuk, destroy all they hold dear and lay waste to the moral structure that the
    followers of Tunare cling to so desperately. Honor? Innoruuk asks if Brell Serilis showed
    such qualities when omitting our great lord from his first compact with the gods of
    Norrath? Since all of Norrath obviously labors under this false conception that their gods
    possess honor and dignity, we are obviously called upon by our master to spit upon their
    belief and trample it underfoot as Innoruuk shall trample all of the false gods under his
    foot when his day shines upon Norrath! To this end he calls upon us to gather power and
    knowledge, preparing for his time, so that we may ride by his side spreading the new rule
    of hate throughout the land. We shall accept those who show themselves to be of vile and
    despicable nature, when I say show, I do not mean by outward appearance, for even the
    holiest priest can be the most hateful inquisitor. When I say show, I mean by action, by
    intent, by the cold glint of hatred in the inquisitor's eye as he puts another blasphemer
    to the torch. <font color="#FF0000"><em>Official</em></font></td>
