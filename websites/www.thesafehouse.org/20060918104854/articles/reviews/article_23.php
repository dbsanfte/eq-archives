This is my second review of\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and now that I\'ve had ample time to rob,\nmurder, and smash my way through the game, here\'s what I have. I\'ll go\nover the new features and elements like I did in my <a href="../../../kb.php?mode=article&amp;k=37" target="_blank" class="postlink">first</a>\nreview, how they play out in the game, and my impressions after 50+\nhours of play(or approximately 22 pots of coffee). This is a long game.\nI like to dawdle and complete everything I can when I play games like\nthese, and in my 55 hours, I\'ve just broken 60% "completeness", or\ntotal owned properties, completed missions, secrets ect...so "sit yo\nass down and shut up foo". <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">WORLD</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI was pretty blown away when I first got a sense of the scale of the\nmap. It\'s as massive as it is varied, with hills, deserts, mountains,\nforests, rivers, and a never ending variety of city and town\nlandscapes. The world is a square. To drive from the south east corner\nof the map, to the north west corner by car would take about 9 to 10\nminutes, going max speed with no wrecks. Suffice to say, that rarely\nhappens.\n<br>The cities are especially well done, true to Rockstar\'s reputation\nwith the GTA worlds. The slum where you start, Ganton, that hugs the freeway,\nfeels like a slum, and it is vastly different compared to the clean\nstreets and tall buildings of San Fiero. Las Venturas really looks and\nfeels like Vegas. The little towns and villages that surround the major\ncities really feel and seem like tiny back-water towns. Combined with\nthe variety of voices recorded, and the variety of vehicles, San\nAndreas really creates a sense of place and believeability as you play,\nno matter where you are. This is especially true when you are staring\noff the edge of the 2000 ft high mountain, checking out the landscape\nbelow. The use of the z-axis to really define and create unique\nareas(not to mention stellar jumps) is a big plus in San Andreas,\nsomething Vice City sorely lacked. It also has something else Vice City\nlacked. Real detail. Through either collisionable objects, or textures\nlike grass, San Andreas really fills in the visual and enviromental\ngaps left by Vice City. The weather is better and visually more\nrealistic, the cities all have a belieavable amount of fences, parking\nmeters, light polls, crates, boxes, junk cars, barrels of flaming\ntrash.....Rockstar really pushed to simply put more on the screen in\nSan Andreas, and it\'s a richer, full world than anything they\'ve\npreviously done. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">STORY</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI found the story to be more compelling in San Andreas than in any\nother GTA game. It\'s not that it\'s especially new, or changed in some\nway, it\'s just a new approach to creating the virtual gangster that is\nGTA\'s trademark. Briefly, you\'re Carl Johnson. CJ grew up in Los Santos\non Grove Street, with his moms, two brothers and his friends. As CJ and\nCo. grew up, they started to get into gang activity. At some point,\nbecause of some calamity(which the story is purposefully vague on), CJ\nleaves San Andreas for Liberty City. A few years later, someone kills\nCarl\'s mom. He returns to San Andreas, only to be picked up the\nnotorious gang specialist, Officer Ten Penny; who promptly frames him\nfor the death of a cop, forcing CJ to work for him. This is where the\nstory begins. <br>\n\n<br>\nIt\'s got the usual GTA mainstay plots. Murder. Theft. Destruction.\nRevenge. Greed. Betrayal. Ambition. But they are all woven into Carl\'s\nstory, and the story of Grove Street, which makes it a little more\nendearing than some guy, from Liberty City, coming to dominate a whole\ntown. The story still suffers from the need for it to fit the kind of\nmissions you are doing, but less so than Vice City. The major plot\npoints are intresting(and do effect gameplay sometimes), and I can\nhonestly say, I care about the story in San Andreas. You play a guy who\ngets used, conned, abused, and decieved by everyone. You\'re the true\nunder dog in this game in terms of the story, which makes it more\nsatisfying when you bust off 200 rounds into someone who really\ndeserves it. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">RPG ASPECTS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nAs a whole, these turned out more or less as I thought they would be.\nTrue to GTA\'s nature, much of the game isn\'t quantifiable with\nnumbers.You never know the exact speed you were travelling, how much\ndamage your guns really do, ect.. So the RPG aspects in San Andreas are\nvery muted, behind the scenes, so that you are not consciously managing\nthe information and numbers like you are in a classic RPG. In San\nAndreas, they\'ve even changed your health and armor into bars instead\nof values. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">GUN SKILLS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nHaving the quality of your gun play increase as you use the weapon, is\npretty cool in practice, til you max out the weapon skill, which\ndoesn\'t take very long. Once you max out the majority of your weapons(I\ndid fairly early in the game), skill with a gun becomes less and less\nof a noticeable feature, and more like a handicap(like when you get a\nbrand new gun). Some weapons, like all meele weapons, rifles, rocket\nlaunchers, mini guns, don\'t have associated skills for them, which also\nmakes this feature seem even less "rpg-ish". But it still manages to be\nfun, and different when playing a GTA game. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">PHYSICAL TRAITS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThese more or less go like the weapon skills, except that they function\nin the slightly longer term. The increase in stamina(how long you can\nsprint) takes a long time to build up, but once physical skills are\nmaxed...you can pretty much forget about them. Muscle is the exception.\nFor example, after about 20 minutes of real time screwing around the\ngym, I took CJ from a skinny black dude to a BRICK power house. If you\nbuild up muscle to the max, and then stop eating, eventually you will\nlose muscle as your body eats itself to stay alive. If you stay active,\nrunning, biking, at least occasionally, your body will burn the fat you\nacquire from eating. Eating and feeding CJ turned out to be less of a\npain than I was afraid of. Only about every 30 mins or 40 mins of game\nplay do you need to really go eat some fat, and the rate of muscle\ndeteroation is pretty slow. Basically, it\'s a non-issue, for those\nworrying about the "maintenance" aspect of GTA: SA.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">ACTION TRAITS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Running and gaining stamina, learning to swin faster, holding your\nbreath longer, cycling better and faster, riding a motor cycle better,\ndriving better, all these "actionable" traits take a good amount of\ntime to increase to the maximum. Once maxed these skills do not\ndeteriorate. Depending on what you spend a majority of your time doing\nin GTA:SA, you\'ll find that your dominant activity is the first to max\nout(and you can go from cycling to driving to swimming in SA very\nquickly...) I think as you progress through the game, "newer" skills\nlike piloting skil, or skill with the M4 Assault Rifle, level quicker.\n<br>\n\n<br>My only real complaint about the whole system is, as a veteran\nRPGer, most of the best stats, skills and such can be acquired very\nquickly, probably too quickly. For example, I was of "hitman" skill in\nthe pistol, the maximum skill and capable of dual-wielding pistols\nabout 30 hours before the game even let me do that. But aside from\nincreasing a little too quickly and becoming trivial, watching your\nskills grow and get noticeably better is gratifying, again because it\'s\nsomething new to the experience of playing GTA.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">SWIMMING</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>I don\'t do a whole lot of this in general right now, but what I\nhave done is well planned and thought out. It\'s still a shocker to play\nwith friends, and have everyone groan when you hit the water, before\nyou all realize you can swim! The controls from diving and swimming are\nvery "realistic" feeling, as are the accompanying underwater\ngraphics(more on this later). <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CLIMBING</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nIt\'s not really climbing per se. More like, grabbing the edge of stuff\nand hauling your self up. Now don\'t get me wrong, this is a cool\nfeature, and a must in GTA:SA. In San Andreas, there are tons of\nchainlink fences, low walls, high walls, and other sorted things that\nget in your way when running from police. In Vice City, those kinds of\nenviroments were taboo because if you couldn\'t hop over it, or drive\nover it with a car, it was a solid barrier, which lead to some bland\nand unimaginative scenery to walk/drive through. Not so in San Andreas.\nWith the ability to climb and negotiate terrain and objects, Rockstar\nreally tried to include everything they could to fill in the world and\nmake it as close to the real thing as possible(so to speak). <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CARJACKING</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nIt turns out to be nothing new from Vice City, other than the fact CJ\nwill punch someone in the face, or boot them in the head, before\nripping them out of their vehicle. There is no struggle or fight for\nthe vehicle...until the victim gets up to kick your ass, anyways.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">VEHICLES</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>This is where I start praising GTA in earnest. The amount of\nvehicles is absolutely MIND BOGGLING. 55 hours into the game and I am\nSTILL finding new models and makes of cars. New kinds of vehcles I\nnever thought of driving. Street sweepers, fork lifts, cement trucks,\nmeter maid compacts, go karts, RC cars...and on. And within the actual\nscope of "cars", there are tons, and tons, and tons of cars. Alone in\nthe "sport car class", I count in the range of about 15-17 vehicles. In\nthe economy class cars, probably at least 15. Then you have the\n"speciality class". Anything from low riders, vintage cars, 4x4 monster\ntrucks, hearses, tow trucks, SUVs...probably about 20 altogether there.\n6 different kinds of motorcycle that I know of so far. And that\'s just\nstuff you DRIVE. I have counted so far about 8 different kinds of boats\nand or ships, and at least 6 or 7 different models of planes, from\ncessnas, to private jets, to full size 747s, an old style P4 fighter\nplane, bi-planes, water landing planes.....3 different types of\nhelicopters that I know of so far. <br>\n\n<br>\nI wanna give special mention to the BMX bike. Between the physics\nbehind vehicles that is new in SA(more in a sec) and the fact you can\ndo the equivalent of a 10 foot bunny hop while standing still at max\nbike skill, makes this hands down the funnest way to travel on the\nground IMO. You tap the gas buttonl to get CJ pedaling super fast, crouch\ndown for a huge bunny hop....and it\'s an instant stunt, no matter what. Or shall I\nsay, instant entertainment. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">VEHICLE SPECIFIC PHYSICS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThe other fork of the prong that makes the numerous vehicles in San\nAndreas such a joy. Each car, boat, bike, air craft,\ndrives uniquely. It has it\'s own acceleration, it\'s own top speed, it\'s\nown handling and cornering capacities...and they are all different,\neach car drives a little different.. You come to find your favorite\nsports car based on how you like your sports car, you find the econo\nclass car that is either fastest or toughest...The bicycle especially\nbenefits from unique physics. It handles like one, corners like one,\nimpacts like one. The go karts corner like you expect a go-kart to. A\nreal perk to San Andreas in terms of the car is that, unlike other GTA\ngames, the vast majority of cars go pretty decently fast. Even the\necono class crap cars can achieve a satisfyingly dizzying top speed.\nAnd the flying....the physics give the flying in San Andreas(especially\nthe jumbo 747) a real boost. Flying in this game is exceptionally fun,\nbecause the planes fly, bank, land(and explode) just like they should\ncompared to 2000 pounds of weight on a frame with 4 tires. The flying\nand driving takes some getting used to, I\'ll admit. Vehicles are more\nresponsive(like planes), and less responsive(large vehicles), than in\nother GTA games. But you quickly catch on, and becoming skilled at\ndriving in San Andreas leaves you feeling like you actually learned\nsomething. This is one of the high points of this game for me.\n<br>\n\n<br>As a corrolary, speed is a much bigger component of GTA San Andreas\nthan in previous GTA titles. Cars top out much faster, and the average\nvehicle goes much much faster than in previous titles. Certain vehicles\nare of course slow, Semis, Baggage Carts, Golf Carts, but if it\'s got 4\nwheels and a 4 cycle combustion engine, chances are it\'s going to go\n"fast" at some point. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">VEHICLE CONTINUITY</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThis is one of those aspects of the game that people weren\'t sure about\nwhen they heard of it. Cars lasting in GTA? WASHING cars? Well, it\'s\ntrue. You can wash your car. And supposedly, your car gets dirty too.\nBut San Andreas plays no different than other GTA games. You\'re lucky\nif you can avoid getting a scratch for 2 minutes, even if you drive\nnice(slowly). What is cool about the idea of keeping your car nice\nis...there is ALOT of damage you can do to your car in San Andreas,\nvisually. The front bumper takes a blow, and the left half of it\ndangles down, and wobbles as you drive. The windows on your car\nindividually fracture and break. The panels dent fall off, and cars\ngenerally get more noticeably defaced than they did in other GTA games.\nAll that being said, I have yet to really notice a "dirty car" in San\nAndreas. Sure, if you get real close to the paint of a car you\'ve been\ndriving and repairing constantly, the mip mapping makes it looks dull\nand sorta dusty. But the dirt isnt\' really noticeable at 100+ miles an\nhour anyways, so I don\'t see it much. Dirt and rust is purely a visual\nfeature. If you\'ve got a beaten up junker, and it starts to rust dont\nworry, it\'s not going to drive slower. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">NITROUS OXIDE</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI\'ll admit it. I\'m a speed junky, both on the real life road and in\nvideo games. So I was tickled pink to hear of nitrous oxide coming to\nmy favorite racing and crashing game. The bag I got was a mixed\nblessing. First off, nitrous does make you go fast, way fast. San\nAndreas uses the blurring method, ala Need for Speed Underground, to\nsimulate real speed. When you hit a certain speed, your peripheral\nvision gets blurry and colors and textures and lights start to smear a\nlittle, and the whole camera view shakes a little bit. Nitrous in GTA\nSan Andres takes you to that kind of speed instantly, in that white\nknuckle, held breath, omfg I\'m glad this is a video game sorta way.\nSpeed in general in GTA San Andreas has a much more visceral feel than\nbefore. Which is a good thing, for me anyways. But it\'s got some issues\ntoo. Primarily, you can\'t turn it off!!! Nitrous is purchased in tank\nsizes of 2x, 5x, and 10x. Once you hit the NOS....it just goes, and\ngoes and goes until it\'s empty. Even if you crash into something, and\ncome to a total stop, the NOS just keeps burning...so turning around\nand reversing becomes a little tricky. So I don\'t use Nitrous that much\nin general play, not that you would ever need to accomplish the racing\nor driving missions. It\'s just another tool in San Andreas to have fun.\nIf uncontrollable speed that ends in a giant fireball is your idea of\nfun. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CUSTOMIZABILITY</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nIf there is one area in San Andreas I\'ll gripe about because my\nexpectations exceeded the product, it\'s the customization factors. My\ndisclaimer is this: I complain about these aspects still mindful of the\nfact it\'s something you didnt\' get to do in other GTA games, and to\nhave it in San Andreas is a plus, and a step in the right direction. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CLOTHES</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThere is a decent amount of clothing in San Andreas, although less\nimaginative clothing than I originally thought. There are 6 clothing\nstores in San Andreas, each selling a successively higher profile line\nof clothing. The stores, to my knowledge, don\'t even get anything new\nin, so once you\'ve gone in and bought what you want, you never really\nhave a reason to return. Nor should you when a lot of the clothing is\njust recolored and more expensive versions of the same clothing you\nalready have(Binco carries a green hat, Zip carries the same hat,\nexcept black...and 120 dollars more). Still, there is a decent variety\nof over all clothing types in game, such that there really is no excuse\nfor you to have nothing to wear(unless you swing the natural way, which\nis entirely possible in game...and potentially hazardous). Over all, I\nwas pleased with the choices of clothing, if not in the over all volume\nand presentation of them.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">HAIRCUTS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>There are about 15 hair cuts you can get in game. But there are\nreally only 10 styles. Close\nshaved, close shaved 2, afro, high afro, wedge, corn rows, mowhawk,\nmowhawk 2, bald and one other. Most of these haircuts can come in 3\ncolors. Black,\nblond-ish, and hot pink. They are all available from the beginning of\nthe game, and to my knowledge, you never get more. I found the\nselection some what limited, but it\'s still a nice way to customize\nyour own personal ganster.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">TATOOS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Tatoos are in the same boat as the hair cuts. You seem to get tats\nbased on certain achievements, like if you max out machine pistol\nskill, you can get a Tec-9 tatooed on your breast. But there are\nrelatively few tatoos throughout the first half of the game, and all\ntatoo stores, like the barbers, sell the same proucts. Again, I felt\nthe selection was and is pretty limited, but again, better than\nnothing. Seeing as you have to go shirtless to enjoy most of the tats,\nit\'s wasn\'t that big of an issue with me.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CUSTOMIZING VEHCILES</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>In what seems to be a symptom of trying to do too much at once,\nthere are lots of things you can do to your car...just not very many\noptions within those things. For example, when you want to put a new\nfront bumper on your import racer, you get 2 choices, same with skirts\nand rear bumper..and exhaust..Rims you do get a selection, 10 or so,\nbut when it comes to rims, that isnt\' very many to choose from, and the\ngraphics in that area aren\'t particularly flattering. Hydraulics, and\nthe stereo upgrade, are one time deals with is just a yes/no choice. To\nme, aside from slapping the nitrous tank down on a car you haven\'t had\nit on before, vehicle customization in San Andreas is one of those\nthings you do "because you can". It doesn\'t have any real practical\npurpose other than to use up your cash. But it\'s still kinda nice to\nput hydraulics on a 90,000 dollar sports car and go make trouble, none\nthe less. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">MISSIONS</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThere are a few new mission "types" in San Andreas. In addition to\nParamedic missions, Vigilante Mission, and Taxi Cab missions, there is\nnow pimping, where you pick girls up, drop them off with a john, and\noccasionally persuade some cheap bastard to pay up. Another new one is\nBurglary, one of the cooler "free" missions, but one of the hardest to\nmake money at. You find a specific type of truck, wait til 10 at night,\nthen activate the mission. Residential houses will become buildings you\ncan enter. Once inside, you have to walk slowly, often in the dark, and\ntake things like tvs, stereos, appliances, out of the house and back to\nthe truck. If you bump into stuff, go through doors too fast, or run, a\ntimer counts down til the cops show up, and often the resident runs out\nof their bedroom with a gun. You have until sun up(about 9 mins if you\nstarted the mission right at 10), at which point you go unload the\npilfered goods at a garage and get payed. <br>\n\n<br>\nThere are missions from other GTA games too, like the ever fun "go\nsteal me some imported vehicles", one of my favorites. The RC vehicles\nmissions are there too, plus a bunch of races ranging from dirt bikes\nin the country, to a dirt ring, to street bikes in the city, import\nsports car races, dune buggy races, mud bogging and 4-wheeling\ncompetitions....and on. You can also, oddly enough, date in San\nAndreas. You pick your girlfriend up in the typical mission style, and\nyou take her to a bar or a club or the local Cluckin\' Bell. Some girls\nwant to do kinky stuff, like go gang banging on rival gangs in bad\nneighborhoods, or go hold up gas stations and banks. Some just want to\nyou to dress up in a leather gimp costume and get the double-dong\ndildo (you only wish I was making this up). As you take the girlfriend\nout on more dates, you get more progress with her, at which point I\nguess you have sex. Since none of the girls in game so far like to\ndrive 100 miles and hour down the street and ramp off of stuff, I\nunderstandably haven\'t found out what happens when you "fill the\nprogress bar". If you don\'t pay attention to your girl, you lose\nprogress, and no booty if forth coming. But a ton of reptitive and\nannoying calls on your cell phone sure are. <br>\n\n<br>\nAnother neat little kind of mission that is new in San Andreas is the\ngang warfare. In the early stages of San Andreas and again in the middle, you get to wage turf wars with the rival\ngangs in Los Santos. You fight for a designated block(s) of the city,\nwhere waves of gangsters will come at you with ever increasing numbers\nand fire power. Win, and your gang populates the captured area, in\naddition to a steady income based on the number of your territories.\nIt\'s a pretty cool feature, I think, and something I didn\'t expect or\nreally read about in other reviews. <br>\n\n<br>\nThat leaves the story missions. Some of these have a bit more depth\nthan Vice City mssions, and are multi-part. If you\'re not familiar with\nGTA missions, they at first seem hard, but after once or twice running\nthrough it, you complete the mission. Not much has changed here. There\nis the occasional mission that will leave you wanting to rip your hair\nout(some of the flying missions especially), but on average they are\nfairly easy, and GTA is a fairly forgiving game when it comes to\nfailing and re-attempting objectives. It\'s hard enough in parts I feel\nchallenged, and easy enough in others I don\'t get overly frustrated. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">THE PEOPLE AND THE AI</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThe PEOPLE in San Andreas turned out to be a little less responsive\nthan I was hoping from my first report. More appropriately, the\nresponded a bit more simply. They react to your clothes, your hair, and\nyour car by saying "Nice shoes!" or "Nice Car!", or "That hair cut\nlooks like ass!". But they don\'t really treat you different. The NPC\npopulation in San Andreas does what it has always done in GTA games.\nWalk past you oblivious to your prescene, or start shooting at you, or\nrun away screaming in terror. To the developers credit though, it was\nkinda funny to have members of the enemy gang walk up to me and start a\nconversation before opening fire on me. Never made that mistake again.\nI also did not notice much different treatment when I was wearing gang\ncolors or not. Cops still came after me when I offended the law without\ncolors, and gang members still open fire on my car the second they see\nme. On a positive note, the visual and auditory detection by NPCs is\nbetter. You can actually crouch behind a wall and avoid enemy\ndetection. There is some form of hiding in shadows, but I have as yet\nto really have it be useful in play. It is possible to walk up behind\nhostiles without them noticing, although it doesn\'t change in\ndifficulty with the type of terrain you move on, like walking on\nleaves.\n<br>\n\n<br>The FUZZ also changed somewhat, but not as drastically as I\nhoped(and feared). Johnny Law isn\'t much smarter than he was in GTA\nVice City. He will still run out into the open when you\'ve got a sawed\noff shotgun pointed at him. But he\'s not a total moron this time\naround. He will, from time to time, take cover behind stuff, to further\nannoy you. He does shoot from his car, and his motor cycle, which makes\nhim somewhat more threatening than he was in other games...but not by\nmuch. Just another incentive to drive faster I guess. However the\ncoordination and execution of the police seems to have gotten better.\nToday I encountered my first road block. In GTA Vice City, a road block\nwas 3 cop cars liberally spaced across the road, 4 cops, and a guy with\ntire spikes. Today I encountered a solid wall of SUVs end to end, with\nbarricades and between 10 and 15 cops waiting for me. Needless to say,\nthe guy strapped to the front of my hood was a little worried when I\nrefused to back down. Cops will also more aggressively pin you in a\nvehicle, or wedge you into a wall than you might be used to. Instead of\none helicopter every 5 minutes when you have 4 or 5 stars, it\'s more\nlike 2 helicopters, every 30 seconds. Overall though, I\'d say the cops\nare easier in San Andreas, mainly because you can save your game and\nget rid of stars....so with the 30 some odd save points spread across\nthe map, getting rid of stars is a relatively trivial matter. But woe\nto the felon that gets caught out in open with 5 stars, and no vehicles\navailable to him. <br>\n\n<br>\nThe GANGS are another part of my small discontent with San Andreas. Oh\nthey do exactly what they said they would do...get in your car, shoot\nat people, and follow you around. Up to 8 of them by the way. Probably\nsounded better on paper than it is in practice though. The problem\narises from the fact that CJ can run a hell of a lot faster than his\ngang members, meaning having gang members on foot means you won\'t be\nrunning. No biggie, right? I\'ll just lead them to the point\nand....wrong. In San Andreas, there are tons of people that don\'t like\nyou. Normally, you drive right past these people without noticing them.\nYou gang members don\'t miss them though. As you run around, your gang\nis constantly car jacking rival gang members, fighting them on the\nstreet, and getting themselves killed. It\'s much like herding turtles,\nturtles armed with AKs and gold teeth. No biggie right? Just need them\nfor drivebys, right? Wrong again homes. I drove a circle around a cop\nfor about 30 seconds, with a car full of homies laying down a constant\nstream of fire...after the cop nearly pulled me from the driver seat\ntwice, I learned that gunners in your car don\'t accomplish squat. All\nin all, while fun, gang members are virtually worthless to game play,\nonly slow you down, and don\'t even do what you need them to. Oh well.\nAt least I can lead a mob. To it\'s death if necessary. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">COMBAT</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nHand to hand also turned out to be one of those features that was more\nhype that it was substance. Hand to hand attacks consist of 3 kinds.\nLos Santos Brawling Style, San Fierro Kung Fu Style, and Las Venturas\nDirty Boxing Style. Basically, they are all the same, they just look\ndifferent. With each style, you have a running attack, a triangle\nbutton attack, and a stomping attack. You can "combo" this triangle\nbutton attack in with your normal meele fist attack(I quote that\nbecause calling it comboing is being generous) to basically beat the\ncrap out of anyone you need to, guns and back up aside. But there is no\nreally difference beyond that. The only real unqiue "move" i\'ve found\nis with the dirty boxing style, when you will lock up their head and\nneck and knee them in the face. As with many features in San Andreas,\nin any other game they would be called laughable attempts at\ncontent...but because they are new to GTA, Rockstar gets away with\nhaving them be less than complicated. <br>\n\n<br>\nThe 1st person targeting actually works however. It\'s more of a quasi\nover the shoulder 3rd person, but you walk and strafe with the left\nanalog stick, and aim with the right. It isn\'t nessecarily easy to play\nthe game like this, and I\'d probably call you hardcore if you did(or\ncall you a liar). But it\'s nice to be able to switch to free aim when\nyou need to, as some of those pesky bastards will use cover to their\nadvantage, or when you need to shoot a car and don\'t have 10 minutes to\nline yourself up directly in front of it. However, GTA does still have\nsome issues with the camera and targeting, more related to how CJ moves\nand turns. If someone is blasting you in the back, you have to turn\naround and face them before you can lock on. When you don\'t know where\nyou are being shot from, or worse, your camera is bumping into\nsomething, this can become a pain, and get you killed. Thankfully, if\nyou know where your target is, and don\'t go all spastic on the\ncontrols, it\'s not too difficult to manage. <br>\n\n<br>\nStealth attacks are about as simple as many of the other aspects of San\nAndreas. While there are a multitude of hand to hand weapons, very few\nif any but the knife seem to be capable of a stealth kill. And when\nusing a gun, a stealth kill basically means, getting close enough to a\nlocked on target so that the gun points straight at their head, sneaky\nor not. Still(and I know I\'m starting to sound like a broken record here)\ncompared to other GTA games where instant suprise kills were pretty\nmuch impossible, it\'s a nice feature to have, simple as it is.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">2-PLAYER</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>This is something people time and again have said was a good idea\nfor Rockstar to do for GTA. 2 people on one screen, on one console.\nWell, you can do it in San Andreas, and I think it pretty much bites.\nIt\'s essentially a mission with no win condition. All buildings and\nmissions close up, and 2 players share one screen, where if one player\nis at the edge of the screen, the player on the opposite edge can\'t go\nany further. When a player enters the car as the driver, the second one\ngets in as gunner and leans out the window with a targeting reticle\nthat is free aiming. The problem is, the second player can move the\ncamera by swiveling around, which is the kiss of death for the driver.\nSo the 2nd player has to keep their reticle on a very narrow section of\nthe screen, and that, on top of someone actually driving the car, makes\nshooting from the vehicle near impossible, if not a total waste of time\nand ammo. So you rampage around the city until the camera, or the cops\nget you, which ever comes first. Nice of Rockstar to try, but it\'s not\npheasible, and even among my manic GTA friends, none of us find it very\nfun to play for very long. GTA Online one day maybe...\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">MUSIC</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>The sound track for the game really takes me back to highschool. I\nstill catch myself singing along with a lot of the songs that come on\nthe radio. The soundtrack is an ecletic mix with a decent chunk devoted\nto rap and hip hop. But there is a still a classic rock station, an\nalternative station, a reggae station, a house-techno station, plus the\nwacky and always colorful news and talk radio. I don\'t know if I could\nsay the sound track realy captures the early 90s, but it definetly puts\nyou in mind of it. Props to Rockstar for their track selection. I am\neven managing to enjoy the House Techno Station...and I normally can\'t\nstand House music. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">EXPLICIT CONTENT</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI\'ll make no excuses, San Andreas is by far fouler and more crude with\nthe language than any other GTA game. The story revolves around\nghetto gang bangers, homies, drug dealers and pimps, and the vernacular is right\non. It is laced with all your favorite 4 letter words, about every\nother sentence. But that\'s just the tip of the ice berg. Sex takes a\nsupporting role in the game. Not only can you pick up hookers, you can\npimp them too. Sex shops are abound in game, as well as colorful items\nlike an all leather gimp suit complete with mask, and a 3 foot long\ndouble dong dildo that you can use as a meele weapon. There are about 5\nstrip clubs in game, with private lap dances. From trampy looking\nprostitutes lining the streets, to beach floozys in string tops, sex is\ntucked into just about every corner of San Andreas. Luckily for the\ncensor\'s refined sensibilities, there is no visually explicit\ncontent...but people will say the damndest things when you listen to\nthem, and the women sure do seem to talk alot during sex...is that\ntalking or moaning...?\n<br>\n<br>\n(<span style="font-weight:bold">Update</span>: Boy is my face red.\nThe Hot Coffee mini game was earned Rockstar the wrath of your friend,\nand mine, the ESRB. In retrospect, I shouldn\'t have been suprised by\nthe discovery, although I was. It was a very short step for Rockstar to\nactually make getting it on it\'s own mini-game. Congrats to Rockstar\nfor getting their name in the paper. And screw you for getting Hilary\nClinton involved in all this! 9-24-05)<br>\n\n<br>That\'s not the end though. If you\'ve played any Rockstar games\nbefore, you know that there is a particular brand of humor they use.\nLaced in the voice and audio tracks are blatantly\nracist, stererotypical, and insensitive remarks, often made by\nstereotypical pundits like the ultra conservative\nright-wing-baptist-gun freak-preacher, or the\nhippy-tree-hugging-conspiracy-theorist, or the\nwhiny-left-wing-liberal-sissy, or the\nditzy-blonde-sex-doll-stripper-girl, or the\nrighteous-minivan-driving-psycho-breast-beating-mother-of-four. Neither\nside, or any side for that matter, are spared the barbs of Rockstar\'s\n"wit". Exactly what position the developers take on all these\npresentations, and if the things said in game reflect their true\nfeelings in some way, is anyone\'s guess. But suffice to say, if you\nhave easily offended sensibilties, no tolerance for vulgar language,\nsexual references, mockery of religion and values, objectification of\nwomen, drug use, and overall general bombast, avoid this game like the\nplague. I have a feeling at some point in the near future, someone is\ngoing to be holding this game up as yet another example of video games\nharming children and society. Didnt\' work the first, or the second\ntime. Probably won\'t work this time either. Or maybe it will. Thanks\nDubya. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">THE NITTY GRITTY</span></span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">GRAPHICS:</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI\'m not sure how Rockstar squeezed this much out of their engine for\nVice City, but San Andreas is a leap past Vice City in overall quality.\nRockstar lived up to it\'s promise to deliver 20-30% more polygons on\nthe screen at one time. The level of detail in their textures has\nimproved markedly(although is still pretty rough compared to a lot of\ngames), such that those terracotta houses and red brick walls look\nreally good. The weather effects are also much more prevalent in San\nAndreas. The famous San Francisco fog rolls in with a vengenace,\nobliterating your visibility. Rain storms look like a layer of static\non the screen, til you notice the individual ran drops. Cloud banks are\nthick and fluffy as your fly your airplane up to 30,000 feet. And the\nsun flares and coronas are so life like they are painful to look at,\nlitterally. The underwater effect uses the same kind of "overlay" as\nthe rain and the heat waves in the desert. Everything underwater is\naqua-green, and the screen undulates to simulate water. The effect is\nreally well done.\n<br>\n\n<br>Unfortunately, all this graphic goodness comes at a price. Say you\nare down town. It\'s raining. You crash into 2 cars, killing a cop in\nthe process. 2 more cop cars crash into the pile, and stuff starts\nexploding. Between the rain, the\nconstantly moving objects, the debris, and the extra building and\nobject textures, some slow down does occur. It\'s not bad, but it\'s\nnoticeable when you are in a SUPER busy scene, or dealing with moderate\nactivity in weather conditions. Thankfully, that is not all the time,\nnor most of the time(unless you create the situation). Most of the time\nthe game runs smoothly, and crisply. Aside from the purposeful and\nartificial blurring the game does at high speed to simulate velocity,\nSan Andreas does not suffer from the "texture smearing" that GTA3 and\nVice City were famous for, where when moving the whole camera rapidly,\ntraffic lights, edges, and colors would blur out and come back into\nfocus when you straightened the vehicle out, to preserve frame rate.\nThat has been virtually eliminated in San Andreas. But that doesn\'t\nmean there aren\'t short cuts. The game has a very bad habit of not\nloading some textures and visible objects while you are in motion.\nSometimes wall textures on buildings load half way, then phase in as\nthe game catches up. Or you discover an invisible light pole or tree by\ncrashing into it (usually in a plane), and then it appears. Obnoxious,\nbut not a game breaker. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">SOUND:</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Lots of classic GTA sounds here, from the muscle cars reving up, to\nthe weapons fire, to some of the jingles from the radio, down to old\ncharacters from GTA making cameos. This game is full of celebrity voice\nacting, like Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Penn(as Officer Ten Penny and\nhis angry white partner), James Wood, Ice T, and others. The "chatter" that\nyou hear people say is sometimes blase\', sometimes shocking as hell.\nTalk radio is enough to make your hair stand on end, no matter what\nnationality, gender, political group or race you ascribe to. I\'ve\nalways had a soft spot for the audio in GTA games, as it\'s some of the\nonly audio in games I really take the time to listen to, just to hear\nwhat unbelievable thing will come out someone\'s mouth next.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">THEME:</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Classic GTA, with a fresh injection of an actual story and\ncharacter personality. I think I like CJ the best out of all the GTA\ncharacters, because he\'s the most real, and the least cardboard. Tommy\nVercetti in Vice City was a good start, but the characters and their\npersonalities are really fleshed out in San Andreas. The voice acting\nis good(for the most part), and the world is just like every GTA&nbsp;\ngame, like our world on crack. I dig it. Can you?\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">GAMEPLAY:</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>If you have a hard time with free form games, GTA probably isn\'t\nthe game for you. But if you like those type of games, or are at least\nwilling to try, San Andreas offers tons of missions, both story driven\nand self initiated, (like doing pimping, missions to get property to\nturn over money, vigilante missions, ect). As a veteran GTA player, I\nwas daunted by the sheer volume of stuff to do and try when I first\nstarted the game. I can only imagine what someone who has never had the\nexperience of Rockstar\'s virtual city(world) would feel. The missions,\non average, are not overly difficult. GTA games never really punish you\nthat bad for failing, so when you fail a mission it\'s just try, try\nagain, and don\'t forget to save. Nothing new there. Whether you\'re the\n"do all the missions" person, or the "I like to explore" person, or the\n"I like to stab crack whores and steal their hard earned $11 dollars"\nperson, there is litterally hours and hours of stuff to do in any\ndirection. Not much else I can say without devolving into a drooling\nfanboi. Love the driving mechanics, love the mission types and stories\nbehind them, love the vast variety of things to see, do, drive, and\ndestroy...\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">SO NOW WHAT THE HELL DO I THINK?</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>GTA games are really all about the gameplay. The graphics are\nalways a notch below the peak, the controls are always rough and\nloose(although the driving in San Andreas is argueably a real skill),\nand the real meat of the game is a series of player missions, backed up\nby a story, with some easter egg hunts as "extras". To some gamers, GTA\nwas always a sub standard game. And I don\'t nessecarily fault them.\nGrand Theft Auto games are a very arcade-ish, free form play games,\nthat emphasize quantity over pure quality. Why do I go on about all\nthis? Because if you don\'t find the fun in the gameplay style of GTA\ngames, there\'s no reason for you to play it. So this next opinion is\ncoming from the bias that I really enjoy the play of GTA games.\n<br>\n\n<br>This game deserves to be considered for game of the year, bar\nnothing. It\'s sheer size and scope, combined with the detail Rockstar\nput into the game to recreate a little micro-cosm of California, makes\nGTA: San Andreas stand out as a real work of time and love in a day and\nage of crappy titles and low expectations. As a GTA fan, this is more\nthan I could have anticipated, as much as I followed up on it\'s\ndevelopment. I\'ve played GTA: Vice City since it came out, and up until\nthe week before San Andreas, was playing it still. And San Andreas is\n2x the game Vice City is.\n<br>\n\n<br>I can\'t remember the last time I bought a console game and put\nupwards of 50 hours in on it the first week I had it. I think I need a\njob...Suffice to say, I love this game, and it\'s going to have a firm\nspot in my list of games even after I complete it, probably for a wihle\nto come. Essentially, this game is GTA v3.0+. If you can dig that, then\nget strapped, hop in your hoopdie, and let\'s go bang on some bitches. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">RATINGS:OUT OF 10</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nGraphics-<span style="font-weight:bold">8.5</span>\n<br>\nGTA games will probably never get full marks from me in graphics, but\nthe graphics are a big enough improvement over the old, and impressive\nto boot, that it earns good marks from me.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nSound-<span style="font-weight:bold">9.0</span>\n<br>The audio is funny, offensive, interesting, and in the case of the\nmusic selection, stylish and varied. Rockstar keeps up with\nexpecations. Gets even better marks from me for all the classic sound\neffects I know from GTA.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nTheme-<span style="font-weight:bold">9.0</span>\n<br>Again, because it\'s an improvement on what they\'ve already done,\nand I\'m still enjoying it this long into the game, it gets good marks\nfrom me. The world of GTA is a familiar and entertaining one for me,\nand like wine, the world of GTA has gotten finer, and sharper, with\ntime. <br>\n\n<br>\nGameplay-<span style="font-weight:bold">9.0</span>\n<br>\nIt\'s rare I ever give a game full marks for it\'s gameplay, because when\nyou go out to create something, and do something half way, I\'ll usually\nnotice and dock some points. GTA isn\'t much different, except that it\'s\nholes are in very small parts of the game. Mainly the lack of real\nquanitity and variety in customization options is where San Andreas\nfalls short for me...but that\'s a pretty minor issue.. AI can be a\nlittle wacky too, again, nothing I count too heavily against a GTA\ngame. Most likely the team ran out of time and energy to do more. Which\nis ok, because everything else is a total win with me. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">RAGEBRINGERS-4.5 out of 5</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nJust go out and play it already.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThanks for reading.<br>\n<br>\nJustin "Nenjin" Wheeler<br>\nSafehouse Staff Writer<br>\n</span>';

<br>

<br>

<br>
It's been a long, blurry eyed trip through Rockstar's new playground,
and my tank isn't even half empty yet. This is my second review of
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and now that I've had ample time to rob,
murder, and smash my way through the game, here's what I have. I'll go
over the new features and elements like I did in my <a href="../../../kb.php?mode=article&amp;k=37" target="_blank" class="postlink">first</a>
review, how they play out in the game, and my impressions after 50+
hours of play(or approximately 22 pots of coffee). This is a long game.
I like to dawdle and complete everything I can when I play games like
these, and in my 55 hours, I've just broken 60% "completeness", or
total owned properties, completed missions, secrets ect...so "sit yo
ass down and shut up foo". <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">WORLD</span></span>
<br>

<br>
I was pretty blown away when I first got a sense of the scale of the
map. It's as massive as it is varied, with hills, deserts, mountains,
forests, rivers, and a never ending variety of city and town
landscapes. The world is a square. To drive from the south east corner
of the map, to the north west corner by car would take about 9 to 10
minutes, going max speed with no wrecks. Suffice to say, that rarely
happens.
<br>The cities are especially well done, true to Rockstar's reputation
with the GTA worlds. The slum where you start, Ganton, that hugs the freeway,
feels like a slum, and it is vastly different compared to the clean
streets and tall buildings of San Fiero. Las Venturas really looks and
feels like Vegas. The little towns and villages that surround the major
cities really feel and seem like tiny back-water towns. Combined with
the variety of voices recorded, and the variety of vehicles, San
Andreas really creates a sense of place and believeability as you play,
no matter where you are. This is especially true when you are staring
off the edge of the 2000 ft high mountain, checking out the landscape
below. The use of the z-axis to really define and create unique
areas(not to mention stellar jumps) is a big plus in San Andreas,
something Vice City sorely lacked. It also has something else Vice City
lacked. Real detail. Through either collisionable objects, or textures
like grass, San Andreas really fills in the visual and enviromental
gaps left by Vice City. The weather is better and visually more
realistic, the cities all have a belieavable amount of fences, parking
meters, light polls, crates, boxes, junk cars, barrels of flaming
trash.....Rockstar really pushed to simply put more on the screen in
San Andreas, and it's a richer, full world than anything they've
previously done. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">STORY</span></span>
<br>

<br>
I found the story to be more compelling in San Andreas than in any
other GTA game. It's not that it's especially new, or changed in some
way, it's just a new approach to creating the virtual gangster that is
GTA's trademark. Briefly, you're Carl Johnson. CJ grew up in Los Santos
on Grove Street, with his moms, two brothers and his friends. As CJ and
Co. grew up, they started to get into gang activity. At some point,
because of some calamity(which the story is purposefully vague on), CJ
leaves San Andreas for Liberty City. A few years later, someone kills
Carl's mom. He returns to San Andreas, only to be picked up the
notorious gang specialist, Officer Ten Penny; who promptly frames him
for the death of a cop, forcing CJ to work for him. This is where the
story begins. <br>

<br>
It's got the usual GTA mainstay plots. Murder. Theft. Destruction.
Revenge. Greed. Betrayal. Ambition. But they are all woven into Carl's
story, and the story of Grove Street, which makes it a little more
endearing than some guy, from Liberty City, coming to dominate a whole
town. The story still suffers from the need for it to fit the kind of
missions you are doing, but less so than Vice City. The major plot
points are intresting(and do effect gameplay sometimes), and I can
honestly say, I care about the story in San Andreas. You play a guy who
gets used, conned, abused, and decieved by everyone. You're the true
under dog in this game in terms of the story, which makes it more
satisfying when you bust off 200 rounds into someone who really
deserves it. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">RPG ASPECTS</span></span>
<br>

<br>
As a whole, these turned out more or less as I thought they would be.
True to GTA's nature, much of the game isn't quantifiable with
numbers.You never know the exact speed you were travelling, how much
damage your guns really do, ect.. So the RPG aspects in San Andreas are
very muted, behind the scenes, so that you are not consciously managing
the information and numbers like you are in a classic RPG. In San
Andreas, they've even changed your health and armor into bars instead
of values. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">GUN SKILLS</span></span>
<br>

<br>
Having the quality of your gun play increase as you use the weapon, is
pretty cool in practice, til you max out the weapon skill, which
doesn't take very long. Once you max out the majority of your weapons(I
did fairly early in the game), skill with a gun becomes less and less
of a noticeable feature, and more like a handicap(like when you get a
brand new gun). Some weapons, like all meele weapons, rifles, rocket
launchers, mini guns, don't have associated skills for them, which also
makes this feature seem even less "rpg-ish". But it still manages to be
fun, and different when playing a GTA game. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">PHYSICAL TRAITS</span></span>
<br>

<br>
These more or less go like the weapon skills, except that they function
in the slightly longer term. The increase in stamina(how long you can
sprint) takes a long time to build up, but once physical skills are
maxed...you can pretty much forget about them. Muscle is the exception.
For example, after about 20 minutes of real time screwing around the
gym, I took CJ from a skinny black dude to a BRICK power house. If you
build up muscle to the max, and then stop eating, eventually you will
lose muscle as your body eats itself to stay alive. If you stay active,
running, biking, at least occasionally, your body will burn the fat you
acquire from eating. Eating and feeding CJ turned out to be less of a
pain than I was afraid of. Only about every 30 mins or 40 mins of game
play do you need to really go eat some fat, and the rate of muscle
deteroation is pretty slow. Basically, it's a non-issue, for those
worrying about the "maintenance" aspect of GTA: SA.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">ACTION TRAITS</span></span>
<br>

<br>Running and gaining stamina, learning to swin faster, holding your
breath longer, cycling better and faster, riding a motor cycle better,
driving better, all these "actionable" traits take a good amount of
time to increase to the maximum. Once maxed these skills do not
deteriorate. Depending on what you spend a majority of your time doing
in GTA:SA, you'll find that your dominant activity is the first to max
out(and you can go from cycling to driving to swimming in SA very
quickly...) I think as you progress through the game, "newer" skills
like piloting skil, or skill with the M4 Assault Rifle, level quicker.
<br>

<br>My only real complaint about the whole system is, as a veteran
RPGer, most of the best stats, skills and such can be acquired very
quickly, probably too quickly. For example, I was of "hitman" skill in
the pistol, the maximum skill and capable of dual-wielding pistols
about 30 hours before the game even let me do that. But aside from
increasing a little too quickly and becoming trivial, watching your
skills grow and get noticeably better is gratifying, again because it's
something new to the experience of playing GTA.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">SWIMMING</span></span>
<br>

<br>I don't do a whole lot of this in general right now, but what I
have done is well planned and thought out. It's still a shocker to play
with friends, and have everyone groan when you hit the water, before
you all realize you can swim! The controls from diving and swimming are
very "realistic" feeling, as are the accompanying underwater
graphics(more on this later). <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CLIMBING</span></span>
<br>

<br>
It's not really climbing per se. More like, grabbing the edge of stuff
and hauling your self up. Now don't get me wrong, this is a cool
feature, and a must in GTA:SA. In San Andreas, there are tons of
chainlink fences, low walls, high walls, and other sorted things that
get in your way when running from police. In Vice City, those kinds of
enviroments were taboo because if you couldn't hop over it, or drive
over it with a car, it was a solid barrier, which lead to some bland
and unimaginative scenery to walk/drive through. Not so in San Andreas.
With the ability to climb and negotiate terrain and objects, Rockstar
really tried to include everything they could to fill in the world and
make it as close to the real thing as possible(so to speak). <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CARJACKING</span></span>
<br>

<br>
It turns out to be nothing new from Vice City, other than the fact CJ
will punch someone in the face, or boot them in the head, before
ripping them out of their vehicle. There is no struggle or fight for
the vehicle...until the victim gets up to kick your ass, anyways.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">VEHICLES</span></span>
<br>

<br>This is where I start praising GTA in earnest. The amount of
vehicles is absolutely MIND BOGGLING. 55 hours into the game and I am
STILL finding new models and makes of cars. New kinds of vehcles I
never thought of driving. Street sweepers, fork lifts, cement trucks,
meter maid compacts, go karts, RC cars...and on. And within the actual
scope of "cars", there are tons, and tons, and tons of cars. Alone in
the "sport car class", I count in the range of about 15-17 vehicles. In
the economy class cars, probably at least 15. Then you have the
"speciality class". Anything from low riders, vintage cars, 4x4 monster
trucks, hearses, tow trucks, SUVs...probably about 20 altogether there.
6 different kinds of motorcycle that I know of so far. And that's just
stuff you DRIVE. I have counted so far about 8 different kinds of boats
and or ships, and at least 6 or 7 different models of planes, from
cessnas, to private jets, to full size 747s, an old style P4 fighter
plane, bi-planes, water landing planes.....3 different types of
helicopters that I know of so far. <br>

<br>
I wanna give special mention to the BMX bike. Between the physics
behind vehicles that is new in SA(more in a sec) and the fact you can
do the equivalent of a 10 foot bunny hop while standing still at max
bike skill, makes this hands down the funnest way to travel on the
ground IMO. You tap the gas buttonl to get CJ pedaling super fast, crouch
down for a huge bunny hop....and it's an instant stunt, no matter what. Or shall I
say, instant entertainment. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">VEHICLE SPECIFIC PHYSICS</span></span>
<br>

<br>
The other fork of the prong that makes the numerous vehicles in San
Andreas such a joy. Each car, boat, bike, air craft,
drives uniquely. It has it's own acceleration, it's own top speed, it's
own handling and cornering capacities...and they are all different,
each car drives a little different.. You come to find your favorite
sports car based on how you like your sports car, you find the econo
class car that is either fastest or toughest...The bicycle especially
benefits from unique physics. It handles like one, corners like one,
impacts like one. The go karts corner like you expect a go-kart to. A
real perk to San Andreas in terms of the car is that, unlike other GTA
games, the vast majority of cars go pretty decently fast. Even the
econo class crap cars can achieve a satisfyingly dizzying top speed.
And the flying....the physics give the flying in San Andreas(especially
the jumbo 747) a real boost. Flying in this game is exceptionally fun,
because the planes fly, bank, land(and explode) just like they should
compared to 2000 pounds of weight on a frame with 4 tires. The flying
and driving takes some getting used to, I'll admit. Vehicles are more
responsive(like planes), and less responsive(large vehicles), than in
other GTA games. But you quickly catch on, and becoming skilled at
driving in San Andreas leaves you feeling like you actually learned
something. This is one of the high points of this game for me.
<br>

<br>As a corrolary, speed is a much bigger component of GTA San Andreas
than in previous GTA titles. Cars top out much faster, and the average
vehicle goes much much faster than in previous titles. Certain vehicles
are of course slow, Semis, Baggage Carts, Golf Carts, but if it's got 4
wheels and a 4 cycle combustion engine, chances are it's going to go
"fast" at some point. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">VEHICLE CONTINUITY</span></span>
<br>

<br>
This is one of those aspects of the game that people weren't sure about
when they heard of it. Cars lasting in GTA? WASHING cars? Well, it's
true. You can wash your car. And supposedly, your car gets dirty too.
But San Andreas plays no different than other GTA games. You're lucky
if you can avoid getting a scratch for 2 minutes, even if you drive
nice(slowly). What is cool about the idea of keeping your car nice
is...there is ALOT of damage you can do to your car in San Andreas,
visually. The front bumper takes a blow, and the left half of it
dangles down, and wobbles as you drive. The windows on your car
individually fracture and break. The panels dent fall off, and cars
generally get more noticeably defaced than they did in other GTA games.
All that being said, I have yet to really notice a "dirty car" in San
Andreas. Sure, if you get real close to the paint of a car you've been
driving and repairing constantly, the mip mapping makes it looks dull
and sorta dusty. But the dirt isnt' really noticeable at 100+ miles an
hour anyways, so I don't see it much. Dirt and rust is purely a visual
feature. If you've got a beaten up junker, and it starts to rust dont
worry, it's not going to drive slower. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">NITROUS OXIDE</span></span>
<br>

<br>
I'll admit it. I'm a speed junky, both on the real life road and in
video games. So I was tickled pink to hear of nitrous oxide coming to
my favorite racing and crashing game. The bag I got was a mixed
blessing. First off, nitrous does make you go fast, way fast. San
Andreas uses the blurring method, ala Need for Speed Underground, to
simulate real speed. When you hit a certain speed, your peripheral
vision gets blurry and colors and textures and lights start to smear a
little, and the whole camera view shakes a little bit. Nitrous in GTA
San Andres takes you to that kind of speed instantly, in that white
knuckle, held breath, omfg I'm glad this is a video game sorta way.
Speed in general in GTA San Andreas has a much more visceral feel than
before. Which is a good thing, for me anyways. But it's got some issues
too. Primarily, you can't turn it off!!! Nitrous is purchased in tank
sizes of 2x, 5x, and 10x. Once you hit the NOS....it just goes, and
goes and goes until it's empty. Even if you crash into something, and
come to a total stop, the NOS just keeps burning...so turning around
and reversing becomes a little tricky. So I don't use Nitrous that much
in general play, not that you would ever need to accomplish the racing
or driving missions. It's just another tool in San Andreas to have fun.
If uncontrollable speed that ends in a giant fireball is your idea of
fun. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CUSTOMIZABILITY</span></span>
<br>

<br>
If there is one area in San Andreas I'll gripe about because my
expectations exceeded the product, it's the customization factors. My
disclaimer is this: I complain about these aspects still mindful of the
fact it's something you didnt' get to do in other GTA games, and to
have it in San Andreas is a plus, and a step in the right direction. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CLOTHES</span></span>
<br>

<br>
There is a decent amount of clothing in San Andreas, although less
imaginative clothing than I originally thought. There are 6 clothing
stores in San Andreas, each selling a successively higher profile line
of clothing. The stores, to my knowledge, don't even get anything new
in, so once you've gone in and bought what you want, you never really
have a reason to return. Nor should you when a lot of the clothing is
just recolored and more expensive versions of the same clothing you
already have(Binco carries a green hat, Zip carries the same hat,
except black...and 120 dollars more). Still, there is a decent variety
of over all clothing types in game, such that there really is no excuse
for you to have nothing to wear(unless you swing the natural way, which
is entirely possible in game...and potentially hazardous). Over all, I
was pleased with the choices of clothing, if not in the over all volume
and presentation of them.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">HAIRCUTS</span></span>
<br>

<br>There are about 15 hair cuts you can get in game. But there are
really only 10 styles. Close
shaved, close shaved 2, afro, high afro, wedge, corn rows, mowhawk,
mowhawk 2, bald and one other. Most of these haircuts can come in 3
colors. Black,
blond-ish, and hot pink. They are all available from the beginning of
the game, and to my knowledge, you never get more. I found the
selection some what limited, but it's still a nice way to customize
your own personal ganster.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">TATOOS</span></span>
<br>

<br>Tatoos are in the same boat as the hair cuts. You seem to get tats
based on certain achievements, like if you max out machine pistol
skill, you can get a Tec-9 tatooed on your breast. But there are
relatively few tatoos throughout the first half of the game, and all
tatoo stores, like the barbers, sell the same proucts. Again, I felt
the selection was and is pretty limited, but again, better than
nothing. Seeing as you have to go shirtless to enjoy most of the tats,
it's wasn't that big of an issue with me.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">CUSTOMIZING VEHCILES</span></span>
<br>

<br>In what seems to be a symptom of trying to do too much at once,
there are lots of things you can do to your car...just not very many
options within those things. For example, when you want to put a new
front bumper on your import racer, you get 2 choices, same with skirts
and rear bumper..and exhaust..Rims you do get a selection, 10 or so,
but when it comes to rims, that isnt' very many to choose from, and the
graphics in that area aren't particularly flattering. Hydraulics, and
the stereo upgrade, are one time deals with is just a yes/no choice. To
me, aside from slapping the nitrous tank down on a car you haven't had
it on before, vehicle customization in San Andreas is one of those
things you do "because you can". It doesn't have any real practical
purpose other than to use up your cash. But it's still kinda nice to
put hydraulics on a 90,000 dollar sports car and go make trouble, none
the less. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">MISSIONS</span></span>
<br>

<br>
There are a few new mission "types" in San Andreas. In addition to
Paramedic missions, Vigilante Mission, and Taxi Cab missions, there is
now pimping, where you pick girls up, drop them off with a john, and
occasionally persuade some cheap bastard to pay up. Another new one is
Burglary, one of the cooler "free" missions, but one of the hardest to
make money at. You find a specific type of truck, wait til 10 at night,
then activate the mission. Residential houses will become buildings you
can enter. Once inside, you have to walk slowly, often in the dark, and
take things like tvs, stereos, appliances, out of the house and back to
the truck. If you bump into stuff, go through doors too fast, or run, a
timer counts down til the cops show up, and often the resident runs out
of their bedroom with a gun. You have until sun up(about 9 mins if you
started the mission right at 10), at which point you go unload the
pilfered goods at a garage and get payed. <br>

<br>
There are missions from other GTA games too, like the ever fun "go
steal me some imported vehicles", one of my favorites. The RC vehicles
missions are there too, plus a bunch of races ranging from dirt bikes
in the country, to a dirt ring, to street bikes in the city, import
sports car races, dune buggy races, mud bogging and 4-wheeling
competitions....and on. You can also, oddly enough, date in San
Andreas. You pick your girlfriend up in the typical mission style, and
you take her to a bar or a club or the local Cluckin' Bell. Some girls
want to do kinky stuff, like go gang banging on rival gangs in bad
neighborhoods, or go hold up gas stations and banks. Some just want to
you to dress up in a leather gimp costume and get the double-dong
dildo (you only wish I was making this up). As you take the girlfriend
out on more dates, you get more progress with her, at which point I
guess you have sex. Since none of the girls in game so far like to
drive 100 miles and hour down the street and ramp off of stuff, I
understandably haven't found out what happens when you "fill the
progress bar". If you don't pay attention to your girl, you lose
progress, and no booty if forth coming. But a ton of reptitive and
annoying calls on your cell phone sure are. <br>

<br>
Another neat little kind of mission that is new in San Andreas is the
gang warfare. In the early stages of San Andreas and again in the middle, you get to wage turf wars with the rival
gangs in Los Santos. You fight for a designated block(s) of the city,
where waves of gangsters will come at you with ever increasing numbers
and fire power. Win, and your gang populates the captured area, in
addition to a steady income based on the number of your territories.
It's a pretty cool feature, I think, and something I didn't expect or
really read about in other reviews. <br>

<br>
That leaves the story missions. Some of these have a bit more depth
than Vice City mssions, and are multi-part. If you're not familiar with
GTA missions, they at first seem hard, but after once or twice running
through it, you complete the mission. Not much has changed here. There
is the occasional mission that will leave you wanting to rip your hair
out(some of the flying missions especially), but on average they are
fairly easy, and GTA is a fairly forgiving game when it comes to
failing and re-attempting objectives. It's hard enough in parts I feel
challenged, and easy enough in others I don't get overly frustrated. <br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">THE PEOPLE AND THE AI</span></span>
<br>

<br>
The PEOPLE in San Andreas turned out to be a little less responsive
than I was hoping from my first report. More appropriately, the
responded a bit more simply. They react to your clothes, your hair, and
your car by saying "Nice shoes!" or "Nice Car!", or "That hair cut
looks like ass!". But they don't really treat you different. The NPC
population in San Andreas does what it has always done in GTA games.
Walk past you oblivious to your prescene, or start shooting at you, or
run away screaming in terror. To the developers credit though, it was
kinda funny to have members of the enemy gang walk up to me and start a
conversation before opening fire on me. Never made that mistake again.
I also did not notice much different treatment when I was wearing gang
colors or not. Cops still came after me when I offended the law without
colors, and gang members still open fire on my car the second they see
me. On a positive note, the visual and auditory detection by NPCs is
better. You can actually crouch behind a wall and avoid enemy
detection. There is some form of hiding in shadows, but I have as yet
to really have it be useful in play. It is possible to walk up behind
hostiles without them noticing, although it doesn't change in
difficulty with the type of terrain you move on, like walking on
leaves.
<br>

<br>The FUZZ also changed somewhat, but not as drastically as I
hoped(and feared). Johnny Law isn't much smarter than he was in GTA
Vice City. He will still run out into the open when you've got a sawed
off shotgun pointed at him. But he's not a total moron this time
around. He will, from time to time, take cover behind stuff, to further
annoy you. He does shoot from his car, and his motor cycle, which makes
him somewhat more threatening than he was in other games...but not by
much. Just another incentive to drive faster I guess. However the
coordination and execution of the police seems to have gotten better.
Today I encountered my first road block. In GTA Vice City, a road block
was 3 cop cars liberally spaced across the road, 4 cops, and a guy with
tire spikes. Today I encountered a solid wall of SUVs end to end, with
barricades and between 10 and 15 cops waiting for me. Needless to say,
the guy strapped to the front of my hood was a little worried when I
refused to back down. Cops will also more aggressively pin you in a
vehicle, or wedge you into a wall than you might be used to. Instead of
one helicopter every 5 minutes when you have 4 or 5 stars, it's more
like 2 helicopters, every 30 seconds. Overall though, I'd say the cops
are easier in San Andreas, mainly because you can save your game and
get rid of stars....so with the 30 some odd save points spread across
the map, getting rid of stars is a relatively trivial matter. But woe
to the felon that gets caught out in open with 5 stars, and no vehicles
available to him. <br>

<br>
The GANGS are another part of my small discontent with San Andreas. Oh
they do exactly what they said they would do...get in your car, shoot
at people, and follow you around. Up to 8 of them by the way. Probably
sounded better on paper than it is in practice though. The problem
arises from the fact that CJ can run a hell of a lot faster than his
gang members, meaning having gang members on foot means you won't be
running. No biggie, right? I'll just lead them to the point
and....wrong. In San Andreas, there are tons of people that don't like
you. Normally, you drive right past these people without noticing them.
You gang members don't miss them though. As you run around, your gang
is constantly car jacking rival gang members, fighting them on the
street, and getting themselves killed. It's much like herding turtles,
turtles armed with AKs and gold teeth. No biggie right? Just need them
for drivebys, right? Wrong again homes. I drove a circle around a cop
for about 30 seconds, with a car full of homies laying down a constant
stream of fire...after the cop nearly pulled me from the driver seat
twice, I learned that gunners in your car don't accomplish squat. All
in all, while fun, gang members are virtually worthless to game play,
only slow you down, and don't even do what you need them to. Oh well.
At least I can lead a mob. To it's death if necessary. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">COMBAT</span></span>
<br>

<br>
Hand to hand also turned out to be one of those features that was more
hype that it was substance. Hand to hand attacks consist of 3 kinds.
Los Santos Brawling Style, San Fierro Kung Fu Style, and Las Venturas
Dirty Boxing Style. Basically, they are all the same, they just look
different. With each style, you have a running attack, a triangle
button attack, and a stomping attack. You can "combo" this triangle
button attack in with your normal meele fist attack(I quote that
because calling it comboing is being generous) to basically beat the
crap out of anyone you need to, guns and back up aside. But there is no
really difference beyond that. The only real unqiue "move" i've found
is with the dirty boxing style, when you will lock up their head and
neck and knee them in the face. As with many features in San Andreas,
in any other game they would be called laughable attempts at
content...but because they are new to GTA, Rockstar gets away with
having them be less than complicated. <br>

<br>
The 1st person targeting actually works however. It's more of a quasi
over the shoulder 3rd person, but you walk and strafe with the left
analog stick, and aim with the right. It isn't nessecarily easy to play
the game like this, and I'd probably call you hardcore if you did(or
call you a liar). But it's nice to be able to switch to free aim when
you need to, as some of those pesky bastards will use cover to their
advantage, or when you need to shoot a car and don't have 10 minutes to
line yourself up directly in front of it. However, GTA does still have
some issues with the camera and targeting, more related to how CJ moves
and turns. If someone is blasting you in the back, you have to turn
around and face them before you can lock on. When you don't know where
you are being shot from, or worse, your camera is bumping into
something, this can become a pain, and get you killed. Thankfully, if
you know where your target is, and don't go all spastic on the
controls, it's not too difficult to manage. <br>

<br>
Stealth attacks are about as simple as many of the other aspects of San
Andreas. While there are a multitude of hand to hand weapons, very few
if any but the knife seem to be capable of a stealth kill. And when
using a gun, a stealth kill basically means, getting close enough to a
locked on target so that the gun points straight at their head, sneaky
or not. Still(and I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record here)
compared to other GTA games where instant suprise kills were pretty
much impossible, it's a nice feature to have, simple as it is.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">2-PLAYER</span></span>
<br>

<br>This is something people time and again have said was a good idea
for Rockstar to do for GTA. 2 people on one screen, on one console.
Well, you can do it in San Andreas, and I think it pretty much bites.
It's essentially a mission with no win condition. All buildings and
missions close up, and 2 players share one screen, where if one player
is at the edge of the screen, the player on the opposite edge can't go
any further. When a player enters the car as the driver, the second one
gets in as gunner and leans out the window with a targeting reticle
that is free aiming. The problem is, the second player can move the
camera by swiveling around, which is the kiss of death for the driver.
So the 2nd player has to keep their reticle on a very narrow section of
the screen, and that, on top of someone actually driving the car, makes
shooting from the vehicle near impossible, if not a total waste of time
and ammo. So you rampage around the city until the camera, or the cops
get you, which ever comes first. Nice of Rockstar to try, but it's not
pheasible, and even among my manic GTA friends, none of us find it very
fun to play for very long. GTA Online one day maybe...
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">MUSIC</span></span>
<br>

<br>The sound track for the game really takes me back to highschool. I
still catch myself singing along with a lot of the songs that come on
the radio. The soundtrack is an ecletic mix with a decent chunk devoted
to rap and hip hop. But there is a still a classic rock station, an
alternative station, a reggae station, a house-techno station, plus the
wacky and always colorful news and talk radio. I don't know if I could
say the sound track realy captures the early 90s, but it definetly puts
you in mind of it. Props to Rockstar for their track selection. I am
even managing to enjoy the House Techno Station...and I normally can't
stand House music. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="text-decoration:underline">EXPLICIT CONTENT</span></span>
<br>

<br>
I'll make no excuses, San Andreas is by far fouler and more crude with
the language than any other GTA game. The story revolves around
ghetto gang bangers, homies, drug dealers and pimps, and the vernacular is right
on. It is laced with all your favorite 4 letter words, about every
other sentence. But that's just the tip of the ice berg. Sex takes a
supporting role in the game. Not only can you pick up hookers, you can
pimp them too. Sex shops are abound in game, as well as colorful items
like an all leather gimp suit complete with mask, and a 3 foot long
double dong dildo that you can use as a meele weapon. There are about 5
strip clubs in game, with private lap dances. From trampy looking
prostitutes lining the streets, to beach floozys in string tops, sex is
tucked into just about every corner of San Andreas. Luckily for the
censor's refined sensibilities, there is no visually explicit
content...but people will say the damndest things when you listen to
them, and the women sure do seem to talk alot during sex...is that
talking or moaning...?
<br>
<br>
(<span style="font-weight:bold">Update</span>: Boy is my face red.
The Hot Coffee mini game was earned Rockstar the wrath of your friend,
and mine, the ESRB. In retrospect, I shouldn't have been suprised by
the discovery, although I was. It was a very short step for Rockstar to
actually make getting it on it's own mini-game. Congrats to Rockstar
for getting their name in the paper. And screw you for getting Hilary
Clinton involved in all this! 9-24-05)<br>

<br>That's not the end though. If you've played any Rockstar games
before, you know that there is a particular brand of humor they use.
Laced in the voice and audio tracks are blatantly
racist, stererotypical, and insensitive remarks, often made by
stereotypical pundits like the ultra conservative
right-wing-baptist-gun freak-preacher, or the
hippy-tree-hugging-conspiracy-theorist, or the
whiny-left-wing-liberal-sissy, or the
ditzy-blonde-sex-doll-stripper-girl, or the
righteous-minivan-driving-psycho-breast-beating-mother-of-four. Neither
side, or any side for that matter, are spared the barbs of Rockstar's
"wit". Exactly what position the developers take on all these
presentations, and if the things said in game reflect their true
feelings in some way, is anyone's guess. But suffice to say, if you
have easily offended sensibilties, no tolerance for vulgar language,
sexual references, mockery of religion and values, objectification of
women, drug use, and overall general bombast, avoid this game like the
plague. I have a feeling at some point in the near future, someone is
going to be holding this game up as yet another example of video games
harming children and society. Didnt' work the first, or the second
time. Probably won't work this time either. Or maybe it will. Thanks

<span style="font-weight:bold">GRAPHICS:</span>
<br>

<br>
I'm not sure how Rockstar squeezed this much out of their engine for
Vice City, but San Andreas is a leap past Vice City in overall quality.
Rockstar lived up to it's promise to deliver 20-30% more polygons on
the screen at one time. The level of detail in their textures has
improved markedly(although is still pretty rough compared to a lot of
games), such that those terracotta houses and red brick walls look
really good. The weather effects are also much more prevalent in San
Andreas. The famous San Francisco fog rolls in with a vengenace,
obliterating your visibility. Rain storms look like a layer of static
on the screen, til you notice the individual ran drops. Cloud banks are
thick and fluffy as your fly your airplane up to 30,000 feet. And the
sun flares and coronas are so life like they are painful to look at,
litterally. The underwater effect uses the same kind of "overlay" as
the rain and the heat waves in the desert. Everything underwater is
aqua-green, and the screen undulates to simulate water. The effect is
really well done.
<br>

<br>Unfortunately, all this graphic goodness comes at a price. Say you
are down town. It's raining. You crash into 2 cars, killing a cop in
the process. 2 more cop cars crash into the pile, and stuff starts
exploding. Between the rain, the
constantly moving objects, the debris, and the extra building and
object textures, some slow down does occur. It's not bad, but it's
noticeable when you are in a SUPER busy scene, or dealing with moderate
activity in weather conditions. Thankfully, that is not all the time,
nor most of the time(unless you create the situation). Most of the time
the game runs smoothly, and crisply. Aside from the purposeful and
artificial blurring the game does at high speed to simulate velocity,
San Andreas does not suffer from the "texture smearing" that GTA3 and
Vice City were famous for, where when moving the whole camera rapidly,
traffic lights, edges, and colors would blur out and come back into
focus when you straightened the vehicle out, to preserve frame rate.
That has been virtually eliminated in San Andreas. But that doesn't
mean there aren't short cuts. The game has a very bad habit of not
loading some textures and visible objects while you are in motion.
Sometimes wall textures on buildings load half way, then phase in as
the game catches up. Or you discover an invisible light pole or tree by
crashing into it (usually in a plane), and then it appears. Obnoxious,
but not a game breaker. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">SOUND:</span>
<br>

<br>Lots of classic GTA sounds here, from the muscle cars reving up, to
the weapons fire, to some of the jingles from the radio, down to old
characters from GTA making cameos. This game is full of celebrity voice
acting, like Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Penn(as Officer Ten Penny and
his angry white partner), James Wood, Ice T, and others. The "chatter" that
you hear people say is sometimes blase', sometimes shocking as hell.
Talk radio is enough to make your hair stand on end, no matter what
nationality, gender, political group or race you ascribe to. I've
always had a soft spot for the audio in GTA games, as it's some of the
only audio in games I really take the time to listen to, just to hear
what unbelievable thing will come out someone's mouth next.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">THEME:</span>
<br>

<br>Classic GTA, with a fresh injection of an actual story and
character personality. I think I like CJ the best out of all the GTA
characters, because he's the most real, and the least cardboard. Tommy
Vercetti in Vice City was a good start, but the characters and their
personalities are really fleshed out in San Andreas. The voice acting
is good(for the most part), and the world is just like every GTA&nbsp;
game, like our world on crack. I dig it. Can you?
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">GAMEPLAY:</span>
<br>

<br>If you have a hard time with free form games, GTA probably isn't
the game for you. But if you like those type of games, or are at least
willing to try, San Andreas offers tons of missions, both story driven
and self initiated, (like doing pimping, missions to get property to
turn over money, vigilante missions, ect). As a veteran GTA player, I
was daunted by the sheer volume of stuff to do and try when I first
started the game. I can only imagine what someone who has never had the
experience of Rockstar's virtual city(world) would feel. The missions,
on average, are not overly difficult. GTA games never really punish you
that bad for failing, so when you fail a mission it's just try, try
again, and don't forget to save. Nothing new there. Whether you're the
"do all the missions" person, or the "I like to explore" person, or the
"I like to stab crack whores and steal their hard earned $11 dollars"
person, there is litterally hours and hours of stuff to do in any
direction. Not much else I can say without devolving into a drooling
fanboi. Love the driving mechanics, love the mission types and stories
behind them, love the vast variety of things to see, do, drive, and
destroy...
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">SO NOW WHAT THE HELL DO I THINK?</span>
<br>

<br>GTA games are really all about the gameplay. The graphics are
always a notch below the peak, the controls are always rough and
loose(although the driving in San Andreas is argueably a real skill),
and the real meat of the game is a series of player missions, backed up
by a story, with some easter egg hunts as "extras". To some gamers, GTA
was always a sub standard game. And I don't nessecarily fault them.
Grand Theft Auto games are a very arcade-ish, free form play games,
that emphasize quantity over pure quality. Why do I go on about all
this? Because if you don't find the fun in the gameplay style of GTA
games, there's no reason for you to play it. So this next opinion is
coming from the bias that I really enjoy the play of GTA games.
<br>

<br>This game deserves to be considered for game of the year, bar
nothing. It's sheer size and scope, combined with the detail Rockstar
put into the game to recreate a little micro-cosm of California, makes
GTA: San Andreas stand out as a real work of time and love in a day and
age of crappy titles and low expectations. As a GTA fan, this is more
than I could have anticipated, as much as I followed up on it's
development. I've played GTA: Vice City since it came out, and up until
the week before San Andreas, was playing it still. And San Andreas is
2x the game Vice City is.
<br>

<br>I can't remember the last time I bought a console game and put
upwards of 50 hours in on it the first week I had it. I think I need a
job...Suffice to say, I love this game, and it's going to have a firm
spot in my list of games even after I complete it, probably for a wihle
to come. Essentially, this game is GTA v3.0+. If you can dig that, then
get strapped, hop in your hoopdie, and let's go bang on some bitches. <br>

<br>The audio is funny, offensive, interesting, and in the case of the
music selection, stylish and varied. Rockstar keeps up with
expecations. Gets even better marks from me for all the classic sound
effects I know from GTA.
<br>

<br>
Theme-<span style="font-weight:bold">9.0</span>
<br>Again, because it's an improvement on what they've already done,
and I'm still enjoying it this long into the game, it gets good marks
from me. The world of GTA is a familiar and entertaining one for me,
and like wine, the world of GTA has gotten finer, and sharper, with
time. <br>

<br>
Gameplay-<span style="font-weight:bold">9.0</span>
<br>
It's rare I ever give a game full marks for it's gameplay, because when
you go out to create something, and do something half way, I'll usually
notice and dock some points. GTA isn't much different, except that it's
holes are in very small parts of the game. Mainly the lack of real
quanitity and variety in customization options is where San Andreas
falls short for me...but that's a pretty minor issue.. AI can be a
little wacky too, again, nothing I count too heavily against a GTA
game. Most likely the team ran out of time and energy to do more. Which
is ok, because everything else is a total win with me. <br>

<br>
Just go out and play it already.
