Set in the fantasy city of\nParagon, players can transform a simple Avatar into an awesome super\nhero. Created by <a href="http://www.crypticstudios.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Cryptic Studios</a>, the game has breathed fresh life into a genre dominated by aging heavyweights with a game that just blows your socks off!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nWith a tip of the hat to <a href="../../../profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15396" target="_blank" class="postlink">Mease the Mad</a>,\nI sought out our resident rogue who just happend to be an Artist at\nCryptic Studios. I am proud to bring you another Safehouse exclusive\ninterview with Christopher Chamberlain of Cryptic Studios!\n<br>\n\n<br>\n</span>\n\n<table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1" width="90%">\n\n\n<tbody><tr> 	  <td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>\n\n	</tr>\n\n	<tr>\n\n	  <td class="quote">Q: So....hows it going? Do you wear tights and and a mask at work?\n<br>\n\n<br>Yes! I also go by the name of the Stupendous Irony. My super power\nis that I cackle with glee as I leap off of our rooftops, and plummet\nto the ground.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: So when your not covered in Spandex what do you at Cryptic Studios?\n<br>\n\n<br>In short, anything that moves other than the player, I\'ve built it.\nVillains, NPC\'s etc. We have a very small team, and were much much\nsmaller up until recently, so many of us had to cover a lot of ground.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Do you play the game often? What class? You gonna join the SH Supergroup Reedemed?\n<br>\n\n<br>Yes, I play quite a bit! I prefer Scrappers and Defenders as they\nare more my playstyle. I would have liked to, but unfortunately we\ncannot give out our in game names. Although mine isn\'t exactly hard to\nfigure out. Wink\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Artist eh? How long have you been drawing?\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI think my earliest portrait was with Gerber Mashed Bean Paste on the table. So it\'s been awhile, probably some 25 years.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Whats the first piece you remember drawing?\n<br>\n\n<br>The first thing I drew that I was really excited about, was my\nrogue character from D&amp;D. I thought she turned out so well, and I\nlook back now and she sort of resembles Sponge Bob Squarepants.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Have we seen your work in other games or material?\n<br>\n\n<br>Probably not, I worked for Atari/Midway for 2 years before Cryptic.\nBoth games were cancelled only a year into development, which is why I\neventually left for Cryptic, which was a bit scary considering we were\nall just this little start up company, trying to do something so huge.\n<br>\nI\'ve had other things here and there, animation festivals, our manual, etc.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Did you start working in the computer games industry or something else?\n<br>\n\n<br>Inititally, my dream was to be a comic book artist. I remember when\nI was about 16 and Jim Lee announced that they were looking for some\nartists to draw a new comic called Gen-13. All you had to do was send\nin your art. Unfortunatly I lost out to some nobody hack named\nCampbell. (Sarcasm there, the guy is probably my favorite comic artist,\nand is much better than I am.)\n<br>Bartending paid the bills for the next few years, then around \'96\nI found a school that had 3D art/animation. What a cool job it would be\nto make video games! I played them 24/7 as it was, it was almost a no\nbrainer. I couldn\'t believe it hadn\'t dawned on me sooner. However even\nafter school it still took me 1 1/2 years to find a job. It\'s a tough\nindustry to get into, but once you do, it\'s great.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Any isnpirations from old classics games?\n<br>\n\n<br>Oh of course! Bard\'s Tale 3, the Thief of Fate is still my favorite\nRPG to date. But most of the inspiration for villains comes from a huge\nvariety of sources. Anywhere from City of Lost Children to Big Trouble\nin Little China to Brom artwork.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: What engine is the game built on?\n<br>\n\n<br>\nAn in house engine that our lead programmer/engineer guy Bruce created. He makes it look so easy!\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Do you do level design, character design, mob design? If so what specific models, zones or structures did you work on?\n<br>\n\n<br>As mentioned before, I do most of the things that move in the game.\nBut about 90% of my time is spent of villains. Probably my favorites\nare TV headman from the Lost, the Devoured from Devouring Earth and the\nShockers from the Freakshow.\n<br>It usually takes about 1 week per villain. This is from start to\nfinish which includes modeling, UV mapping, textures, skinning it to\nthe skeleton, LODs, and then actually making sure it\'s all in there.\n<br>A funny sidenote is that the villain who gets the most complaints\nabout his look is the Hamidon. The funny thing is he took close to 6\nweeks to create!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Did you work on the graphics for the powers? I love how combat is a visual orgy of fun.\n<br>\n\n<br>Most of the FX are done by our great artist here Doug, he has done\nsome amazing things with the FX system. I really only do FX for\nvillains which finish out their costume. (Auras, glowing eyes, etc.)\nHowever they did let me create the entire FX set for the upcoming\nCarnival of Shadows, which was a lot of fun. It\'s a nice change doing\nFX from doing villains all day.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: The surviving 8 have some really nice costumes, did you work on them as well?\n<br>\n\n<br>Yeah, we wanted to give each of the Surviving 8 a unique costume\npiece that made them stand out from any of the players could choose\nfrom. To be honest, I was bugging my boss to let my character equip\nBack Alley Brawlers gloves... I love those things!\n<br>\n\n<br>Q: My favorite gangs so far are the Freakshow and the Lost, they\nlook like something between Mad Max and Heavy Metal, where do you get\nthe ideas for them?\n<br>\n\n<br>A lot of the ideas come from my art director Matt Harvey. He has\nthis HUGE plethora of material for ideas and himself is a big fan of\nmany different genres. However he lets me design many villains as well.\nThe Lost were one of these sets, and I went around asking everyone in\nthe company, "If you were a homeless warrior, what would you use for\narmour?" Thats where most of the odd things like the Stop sign\nbreastplate came from. I had created even goofier things, but they\nstarted to look almost comical, so we reigned it in a bit. The fishbowl\nhelmet (equipped with a goldfish!) was cut unfortunately. Smile\n<br>I really like the idea behind the Freakshow, they are one of my\nfavorite villain groups. Much of their inspiration came from, like you\nmentioned, Mad Max and the like. They are fun, because for me, maniacal\nvillains are the coolest.\n<br>If some of the villain faces look similar, its because I use my\nface for a ton of reference. It\'s hard to find people to pose with a\nJack Nicholson \'Shining\' gleam in their eye. So I do it myself!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ; You know CoH is pretty damn impressive, is there anything that you wanted to include but couldn\'t?\n<br>\n\n<br>Oh man! This game is currently only about 10% of what we all would\nlike it to be. Having been a huge MMO/MUD player myself, I wanted to\ninclude so many other cool ideas. The problem has really just been\ntime. It\'s taken me alone over 3 years just to create all of the\nvillains, and there are just tons more I would like to do. The options\nare endless.\n<br>I think a year from now, this game will be huge in terms of\ngameplay elements. With all of the stuff we have planned for the next\nyear, by the time City of Villains is implemented, this should be a\nvery very diverse game.\n<br>We are all huge gamers, and like everyone else, we seriously want\nALL of the things that people mention. We don\'t cut things from the\ngame to save money, or because it\'s too hard. It really is just all\ntime. We have this HUGE list of stuff we want to add, then we\nprioritize it down to what can get us the most bang for the buck. Once\nall of the main things we want to get in are in, then we can start\nfocusing on the littler things. Which is what many of you will be\nseeing within in the next few months.\n<br>\n\n<br>Q: What can we expect as far as player models? Will we ever be able\nto change our costumes? If so to what extent? Will it be something\nseparate from the power respec?\n<br>\n\n<br>As many people are seeing, we are currently expanding the costume\nchanging abilities. Currently you can change out particular parts at\nany time, and thats just the beginning of what we would like to do.\n<br>\nThere are some really really cool things designed for player costumes coming up.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Capes?\n<br>\n\n<br>Shhh... &gt;whispers&lt; but the capes look friggen awesome! Like\nnothing I\'ve ever seen in an MMO before, you will be impressed.\n<br>\n\n<br>Q: There is alot of attention to detail. The stop signs have\nscratches and graffiti, the streetights have moths around them it seems\nalot has gone in into making Paragon City feel real. Other games have\ntried this and failed, how do you make it so seameless?\n<br>\n\n<br>I think this has a lot to do with Matt Harvy\'s vision. He knows\nwhat needs to be there and where to draw the line. Many things we cant\nadd just because of technical reasons (street signs would take up an\namazing amount of texture space.), however he makes up for it in other\nareas so that the city really does seem to have its own life.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Wil the trend of freee content upgrades continue or can we expect a content expansion before CoV?\n<br>\n\n<br>\nAs far as I know, everything will be free. The first pay expansion will be City of Villains, and thats a ways off.\n<br>\nOur next free expansion is really insane. There is so much we are adding in that patch, I can\'t believe it\'s all getting done.\n<br>\n\n<br>Q; Any tips for tweaking the system for smoother gameplay? Whats up\nwith the graphic slider? I still dont see any real effect from messing\nwith the sliders. How does the particle thing work?\n<br>\n\n<br>Man I wish I could help. Remember though, I\'m an artist, I use the\nleft side of my brain. Or is it my right? Either way I dont use the\nsmart half. Smile\n<br>To be honest though, I\'m fairly sure the graphic slider pulls in\nthe LOD\'s. LOD means level of detail. Everything in the game is created\nin 3 levels. For example, that Hellion you beat on up close probably\nhas around 1400 polygons. When he is about 50 feet away, the geometry\nis switched to around 900 polygons. And at about 200 feet he is\nswitched to about 200 polygons. The slider should reel that in and out\nto make things easier on different graphics cards.\n<br>\nNot entirely sure how the particle thing works, since thats not my area. I would assume it works on the same principle though.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ&amp;A Lighting Round\n<br>\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Pancakes or Vanilla Pancakes?\n<br>\nBunnies with pancakes on their heads!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQC or Marvel?\n<br>\nMarvel if I can include Batman.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Gnomes or Hobbits?\n<br>\nGnomes of course!\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: CD you currently listen to?\n<br>\nSomeone just turned me on to a band called Luxt. I\'ve been listening to all 3 of their CD\'s for about a week now.\n<br>\nOne of the best bands I\'ve heard in years.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Love is....\n<br>\nVideo games! My wife comes in at a close second.\n<br>\nIf my wife is reading this, then it was nice knowing you all.\n<br>\n\n<br>\nQ: Coffee or Tea?\n<br>\nWhat kind of question is this?

is the hottest new MMORPG on the block. Set in the fantasy city of
Paragon, players can transform a simple Avatar into an awesome super
hero. Created by <a href="http://www.crypticstudios.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Cryptic Studios</a>, the game has breathed fresh life into a genre dominated by aging heavyweights with a game that just blows your socks off!
<br>

<br>
With a tip of the hat to <a href="../../../profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=15396" target="_blank" class="postlink">Mease the Mad</a>,
I sought out our resident rogue who just happend to be an Artist at
Cryptic Studios. I am proud to bring you another Safehouse exclusive
interview with Christopher Chamberlain of Cryptic Studios!

	<tr>

	  <td class="quote">Q: So....hows it going? Do you wear tights and and a mask at work?
<br>

<br>Yes! I also go by the name of the Stupendous Irony. My super power
is that I cackle with glee as I leap off of our rooftops, and plummet
to the ground.
<br>

<br>
Q: So when your not covered in Spandex what do you at Cryptic Studios?
<br>

<br>In short, anything that moves other than the player, I've built it.
Villains, NPC's etc. We have a very small team, and were much much
smaller up until recently, so many of us had to cover a lot of ground.
<br>

<br>
Q: Do you play the game often? What class? You gonna join the SH Supergroup Reedemed?
<br>

<br>Yes, I play quite a bit! I prefer Scrappers and Defenders as they
are more my playstyle. I would have liked to, but unfortunately we
cannot give out our in game names. Although mine isn't exactly hard to
figure out. Wink
<br>

<br>
Q: Artist eh? How long have you been drawing?
<br>

<br>
I think my earliest portrait was with Gerber Mashed Bean Paste on the table. So it's been awhile, probably some 25 years.
<br>

<br>
Q: Whats the first piece you remember drawing?
<br>

<br>The first thing I drew that I was really excited about, was my
rogue character from D&amp;D. I thought she turned out so well, and I
look back now and she sort of resembles Sponge Bob Squarepants.
<br>

<br>
Q: Have we seen your work in other games or material?
<br>

<br>Probably not, I worked for Atari/Midway for 2 years before Cryptic.
Both games were cancelled only a year into development, which is why I
eventually left for Cryptic, which was a bit scary considering we were
all just this little start up company, trying to do something so huge.
<br>
I've had other things here and there, animation festivals, our manual, etc.
<br>

<br>
Q: Did you start working in the computer games industry or something else?
<br>

<br>Inititally, my dream was to be a comic book artist. I remember when
I was about 16 and Jim Lee announced that they were looking for some
artists to draw a new comic called Gen-13. All you had to do was send
in your art. Unfortunatly I lost out to some nobody hack named
Campbell. (Sarcasm there, the guy is probably my favorite comic artist,
and is much better than I am.)
<br>Bartending paid the bills for the next few years, then around '96
I found a school that had 3D art/animation. What a cool job it would be
to make video games! I played them 24/7 as it was, it was almost a no
brainer. I couldn't believe it hadn't dawned on me sooner. However even
after school it still took me 1 1/2 years to find a job. It's a tough
industry to get into, but once you do, it's great.
<br>

<br>
Q: Any isnpirations from old classics games?
<br>

<br>Oh of course! Bard's Tale 3, the Thief of Fate is still my favorite
RPG to date. But most of the inspiration for villains comes from a huge
variety of sources. Anywhere from City of Lost Children to Big Trouble
in Little China to Brom artwork.
<br>

<br>
Q: What engine is the game built on?
<br>

<br>
An in house engine that our lead programmer/engineer guy Bruce created. He makes it look so easy!
<br>

<br>

<br>
Q: Do you do level design, character design, mob design? If so what specific models, zones or structures did you work on?
<br>

<br>As mentioned before, I do most of the things that move in the game.
But about 90% of my time is spent of villains. Probably my favorites
are TV headman from the Lost, the Devoured from Devouring Earth and the
Shockers from the Freakshow.
<br>It usually takes about 1 week per villain. This is from start to
finish which includes modeling, UV mapping, textures, skinning it to
the skeleton, LODs, and then actually making sure it's all in there.
<br>A funny sidenote is that the villain who gets the most complaints
about his look is the Hamidon. The funny thing is he took close to 6
weeks to create!
<br>

<br>
Q: Did you work on the graphics for the powers? I love how combat is a visual orgy of fun.
<br>

<br>Most of the FX are done by our great artist here Doug, he has done
some amazing things with the FX system. I really only do FX for
villains which finish out their costume. (Auras, glowing eyes, etc.)
However they did let me create the entire FX set for the upcoming
Carnival of Shadows, which was a lot of fun. It's a nice change doing
FX from doing villains all day.
<br>

<br>
Q: The surviving 8 have some really nice costumes, did you work on them as well?
<br>

<br>Yeah, we wanted to give each of the Surviving 8 a unique costume
piece that made them stand out from any of the players could choose
from. To be honest, I was bugging my boss to let my character equip
Back Alley Brawlers gloves... I love those things!
<br>

<br>Q: My favorite gangs so far are the Freakshow and the Lost, they
look like something between Mad Max and Heavy Metal, where do you get
the ideas for them?
<br>

<br>A lot of the ideas come from my art director Matt Harvey. He has
this HUGE plethora of material for ideas and himself is a big fan of
many different genres. However he lets me design many villains as well.
The Lost were one of these sets, and I went around asking everyone in
the company, "If you were a homeless warrior, what would you use for
armour?" Thats where most of the odd things like the Stop sign
breastplate came from. I had created even goofier things, but they
started to look almost comical, so we reigned it in a bit. The fishbowl
helmet (equipped with a goldfish!) was cut unfortunately. Smile

<br>

<br>As many people are seeing, we are currently expanding the costume

<br>
There are some really really cool things designed for player costumes coming up.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>Shhh... &gt;whispers&lt; but the capes look friggen awesome! Like
nothing I've ever seen in an MMO before, you will be impressed.

scratches and graffiti, the streetights have moths around them it seems

<br>

<br>

<br>
Bunnies with pancakes on their heads!
<br>

<br>
QC or Marvel?
<br>
Marvel if I can include Batman.
<br>

<br>
Q: Gnomes or Hobbits?
<br>
Gnomes of course!
<br>

<br>
Q: CD you currently listen to?
<br>
Someone just turned me on to a band called Luxt. I've been listening to all 3 of their CD's for about a week now.
<br>
One of the best bands I've heard in years.
<br>

<br>
Q: Love is....

<br>

<br>
Q: PC or Console?
<br>
PC, even though they frustrate the hell outta me.
<br>

<br>
Q: I-tunes or Kazaa?
<br>
I use something called Music Match. Nice little program, and has TONS of stuff and all the music I need.
<br>

<br>
Q: Pen &amp; Paper or MMORPG?
<br>MMO's. I dig the versatility of P&amp;P, but I am too much into the
visuals these days. I need to see my big bad sword o' doom! And it
better have flaming kittens on it!
<br>

<br>
Q:Anything I missed or something on your mind?
<br>
Having been my first interview, thanks for all the great questions! I almost feel like J.Lo!
