<description> <![CDATA[DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS ONLINE: Stormreach; delivers some of the most exciting game play experiences available in online gaming today. Turbine has received tremendous positive feedback on the launch of DDO. Feedback from new players has included the request for more solo-play content as an option to the already fun and challenging group-focused content throughout the game. Turbine has listened to this feedback and is pleased to announce the upcoming availability of solo-friendly content. An all new solo setting is being introduced to help new DDO players navigate through the early game content, allowing them the time and space to learn about their characters, try strategies and face monsters for the first time on their own. Players will now have the option to play at their own pace as a solo-player in the Harbor.<br> ]]></description>

<description> <![CDATA[Summer 2006 is coming in three weeks, and it's time for the list! Contrary to the last Spring 2006 season, this one is significantly smaller - with only 29 series, half of last season.<br><br>Listed within is all the names, the date they air, and links to the official websites, and summaries. You can find what you are interested in to download right as they come out, otherwise I will be reviewing series and you can check those out too in order to get some idea of what you think you'll like that you have missed.<br><br>Despite the significantly smaller size, there's a great variety of shows to be had.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration:underline">Honey &amp; Clover</span> for the fans of the first season, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Tsuyokisu</span> for the eroge adaptation fans, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Chokotto Sister</span> for the moe~ crowd, <span style="text-decoration:underline">NHK ni Youkoso</span> for the hardcore fans, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Coyote Ragtime Show</span> for the shounen fans, <span style="text-decoration:underline">Binbo Shimai Monogatari</span> for the slife-of-life fans.<br><br>A nice selection, and hopefully a good amount would turn out to be wonderful!<br> ]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[AMD launches Socket AM2 ]]></title>
<link >http://www.thesafehouse.org/news/tech/news_275.php</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2006 08:36:00 EST</pubDate>
<description> <![CDATA[Today AMD launched their new unified desktop socket format, Socket AM2.
Socket AM2 is set to replace AMD's socket 939 which will be EOLed (end
of life) at the end of this year, and will support both AMD's high end
Athlon 64 X2 and FX processors as well as their low end Sempron
processors. Socket 754 is set to remain in AMD's lineup throughout the
end of 2007 as a way to mantain an inexpensive single channel DDR based
platform.<br><br>Socket AM2 marks AMD's change from DDR memory to DDR2 memory, as well
as the move of their Sempron value lineup from single channel to a dual
channel memory format.<br><br>Here are several reviews from around the web:<br><br><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2762">AnandTech</a><br><a href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/cpu/display/amd-socket-am2.html">X-Bit Labs</a><br><a href="http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTA2NSwxLCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA==">HardOCP</a><br><a href="http://www.hothardware.com/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=822&amp;cid=1">Hot Hardware</a><br><a href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,1966062,00.asp">ExtremeTech</a><br><a href="http://www.firingsquad.com/hardware/amd_athlon_64_fx_62_5000/">FiringSquad</a><br> ]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[E3: SOE Out of the Box ]]></title>
<link >http://www.thesafehouse.org/news/news_274.php</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2006 12:26:00 EST</pubDate>
<description> <![CDATA[



<p class="MsoNormal">For the past few years Sony Online Entertainment has
basically had the same sort of display at E3. A large rectangular black box,
one side with windows giving you a tease of the demos and goodies inside, while
other sides showing game signage and videos but lacking proper demo boxes. This
year they finally broke that model and had several public demo stations outside area
as well.<br><br>No wonder, you might say, because SOE is now a co-publisher
for former rival, Sigil Games Online’s upcoming gem, <span style="font-weight:bold">Vanguard: Saga of Heroes</span>.
Add them to <span style="font-weight:bold">Gods and Heroes</span> plus the ongoing SOE titles of <span style="font-weight:bold">EverQuest</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">EverQuest
II</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Star Wars Galaxies</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Planetside</span>, etc and the Black Box is just about
bursting.</p> ]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Quick Note - WoW New  Alliance Race: Draenei ]]></title>
<link >http://www.thesafehouse.org/news/news_270.php</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2006 12:09:00 EST</pubDate>
<description> <![CDATA[<p>Blizzard finally showed off the new Alliance race named the Draenei.&nbsp;They are&nbsp;satyr-like creatures with&nbsp;hooves but have a reptilian looking tail.</p>
<p>Not much detail was given about this new race as everything is "not set yet". Classes are not announced though the demo allowed you to choose a warrior or paladin to play. There was also a hunter trainer I spotted in the starting city of Ammen Vale.</p>
<p>High resolution pictures will be coming tonight as well as official screenshots.</p>
<p>If you must have something to ponder, here's a very blurry camera picture of one log in screen model:</p>
<p><font size=2>     <table border=0 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=0 width=640 align=center>
      <tr><td><img src="http://www.thesafehouse.org/news/uploads/draeneiphonepic_001.jpg" height="480" width="640" border=0></td></tr>
     </table>
   </font></p>
<p>Here's one of the model at the booth display:</p>
<p>&nbsp;     <table border=0 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=0 width=640 align=right>
      <tr><td><img src="http://www.thesafehouse.org/news/uploads/144154312_3a1a71bbcc_o.jpg" height="480" width="640" border=0></td></tr>
