These sets include the Devout, Prophecy, Elements, Arcanist\'s and Wildheart sets. Future patches will update more dungeon and raid sets. <br></div>\n<li>\n<div align=left>Quests that are not completable while in a raid group are no longer allowed if the instance is owned by a raid group, regardless of whether you are currently in that raid group or not. </div></li></ul>\n<p align=left><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Major Changes </span><br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Diremaul </span><br><br>Diremaul, a new dungeon for players level 56-60, is now open and ready for business. Diremaul is populated by a fierce tribe of ogres and is located in the western region of Feralas. Diremaul will be limited groups of no more than five players each. Click here to read more. <br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">New Outdoor Raid Bosses </span><br><br>Two new outdoor raid bosses have been introduced to Azeroth. Azuregos, a monstrous blue dragon, has landed in Azshara, while Lord Kazzak the demon can be found in the Tainted Scar of the Blasted Lands. <br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Meeting Stones </span><br><br>Meeting Stones are located outside of each dungeon to help players find a group to adventure with in the dungeon. The meeting stone will try to find you a viable five-person group by looking for a tank, a healer, and so on. As time passes and you are unable to find a group, the meeting stone will become less picky about who it groups you with. <br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Dungeon Player Caps </span><br><br>All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches. <br><br>With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps: <br><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div align=left>Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members <br></div>\n<li>\n<div align=left>Blackrock Spire - 15 members <br></div>\n<li>\n<div align=left>Diremaul - 5 members </div></li></ul>\n<p align=left><br>All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of thischange.

The difficulty of the locks in the area correspond to the level of the zone, so if your lockpicking skill is around 100, you would go to Durnholde Keep in Hillsbrad.

<ul>
<li>
<div align=left>Players who have completed the Molten Core discovery quest can now port directly to the zone, bypassing Blackrock Depths. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Divine Favor - Fixed a bug that prevented the effect from being removed, allowing all Flash of Light and Holy Light spells to crit for the full duration. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Bind on Pickup items that are of a quality below the default group loot threshold (white/gray) will no longer require confirmation before looting. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Various Bind on Pickup items that were previously of common quality (white) have been changed to green (ie: Corruptor's Scourgestone). <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Several of the dungeon and raid armor sets have been updated with their non-placeholder textures. These sets include the Devout, Prophecy, Elements, Arcanist's and Wildheart sets. Future patches will update more dungeon and raid sets. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Quests that are not completable while in a raid group are no longer allowed if the instance is owned by a raid group, regardless of whether you are currently in that raid group or not. </div></li></ul>
<p align=left><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">Major Changes </span><br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Diremaul </span><br><br>Diremaul, a new dungeon for players level 56-60, is now open and ready for business. Diremaul is populated by a fierce tribe of ogres and is located in the western region of Feralas. Diremaul will be limited groups of no more than five players each. Click here to read more. <br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">New Outdoor Raid Bosses </span><br><br>Two new outdoor raid bosses have been introduced to Azeroth. Azuregos, a monstrous blue dragon, has landed in Azshara, while Lord Kazzak the demon can be found in the Tainted Scar of the Blasted Lands. <br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Meeting Stones </span><br><br>Meeting Stones are located outside of each dungeon to help players find a group to adventure with in the dungeon. The meeting stone will try to find you a viable five-person group by looking for a tank, a healer, and so on. As time passes and you are unable to find a group, the meeting stone will become less picky about who it groups you with. <br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">Dungeon Player Caps </span><br><br>All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches. <br><br>With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps: <br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align=left>Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Blackrock Spire - 15 members <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Diremaul - 5 members </div></li></ul>
<p align=left><br>All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of thischange. In addition, will have their loot improved significatnly forthe next content patch. <br><br><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">General Changes</span> <br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">General </span><br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align=left>Previously, in many cases, a Block, Parry, or Dodge was translated into a "Miss," thus causing confusion over actual miss rates. We've made the following changes in an attempt to be more clear as to what is actually happening in combat: <br></div>
<ul>
<li>
<div align=left>Block: All creatures will now report a Block on attacks from the front, reducing damage caused instead of converting the attack into a "Miss." Creatures will no longer be able to Block attacks from behind. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Dodge: Every time a creature Dodges, it will report a Dodge. We will no longer translate a creature's Dodge of a rear attack to a "Miss." <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Parry: All creatures will now report a Parry on attacks from the front instead of translating them into a "Miss." Creatures will no longer be able to Parry attacks from behind. </div></li></ul>
<div align=left><br>&nbsp;</div>

<li>
<div align=left>You can no longer accept a warlock summoning while you are in combat. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Increased stun resistance will now also help resist some non-melee based stun spells from creatures. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Mounts now are Horde or Alliance restricted in the tooltip. We do not intend to allow Horde players to ride Alliance vendor-purchased mounts and vice versa. </div></li></ul>
<p align=left><br><br><span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">PvP </span><br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div align=left>Numbers and punctuation will not be passed through chat communication to members of the opposing faction. <br></div>
<li>
<div align=left>Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks. <br></div>

<li>
<div align=left>Improved Blizzard - Chill duration reduced to 1.5 seconds (4.5 seconds w/ Permafrost) and refreshes with each damage tick rather than at the beginning of the spell. In addition, a target that resists the damage will also resist the chill effect. <br></div>

<ul>
<li>

<li>
<div align=left>A number of areas in the world now have footlockers in them. These areas are in place for rogues to visit to increase their lockpicking skills. The contents of these footlockers are only token amounts of treasure, but they should allow for a more interesting experience while increasing lockpicking skill. The difficulty of the locks in the area correspond to the level of the zone, so if your lockpicking skill is around 100, you would go to Durnholde Keep in Hillsbrad. But if your skill is 250, you might head to Tyr's Hand in Eastern Plaguelands. <br></div>
