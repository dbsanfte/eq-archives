  var PageContent= '<font color=#ffa500><strong>Rogue\'s Guide to Runnyeye</strong> </font><br><i><b>Submitted by Akak</b> <br>Edited by Zato</i> <br><br><b>General Description</b> <br>Clan Runnyeye is a mid-level dungeon located in Central Antonica populated by the Runnyeye Goblins. There are several valuable items which can be obtained here as well as plenty of experience for rogues in the 20\'s. Famed items such as the Grotesque Mask, the Blackened Iron Bastard Sword (BIBS), and the Blackened Iron Crown, can all be looted from inside Runnyeye. Additionally, you\'ll find the popular blackened iron armor (which looks like black chain) on many goblins around level 24 or so. Strangely, however, Runnyeye is not a crowded dungeon. Typically, fewer than 20 people can be found there during peak hours and it is not uncommon to find it totally empty during off hours. Goblins that can be fought here include low level Goblins, Guards, Wizards, and Shaman; tougher Dazed Goblin Miners, Guards and Shaman; and the significantly tougher Goblin Elite Guards. Three named goblins, the Dazed Knight, the Warlord, and the King are what you\'re here for. Just to keep things interesting, there are several Evil Eyes as well as a named Evil Eye (Borxx) wandering the dungeon. Deep inside Runnyeye you will even find a useable bank! <br><br><b>Location and directions</b> <br>Runnyeye is located between the Misty Thicket and Gorge of King Xorbb. There is an entrance on each side. From Misty Thicket, head to the center of the west wall and look for a hole in the wall near a goblin camp. From the Gorge of Kings Xorbb, stay on the southern wall and follow it east to a marked entrance. <br><br><b>Binding, buying, selling, and banking</b> <br>Runnyeye could be the most convenient dungeon in Norrath for good races to adventure in. Rivervale, located just one zone to the east of Misty Thicket, is a short run away and offers a good location to bind, bank, and sell loot. There is a rogue\'s guild there for training; ample pottery supplies; a pottery wheel and kiln; and anything else your thieving heart could desire. Misty Thicket is also heavily populated with monsters which drops skins (black wolves and bears) and easy poison components (wasp and spider sacs). This makes it even harder for me to understand why Runnyeye is so unpopulated. <br><br><b>Groups</b> <br>Like any dungeon over level 15, almost every class needs a strong group to survive. Runnyeye, however, is probably the most group-intensive zone for anyone under level 30. It is the only dungeon where I have found it impossible to solo. I\'ve tried dozens of tactics and have not found a way to pull a lone monster. The goblins are always found in groups of 3-15 and cannot be pulled individually. Rangers and druids can wiggle their fingers all day trying to cast harmonize and it\'s not going to help. Additionally, Runnyeye has the worst trains I\'ve found in Norrath. The trains here are worse than anything I\'ve seen in Blackburrow, Permafrost, Cazic, Crushbone, Befallen, or Unrest. I have witnessed a 15 goblin train in the King\'s room that, after being pulled to the zone, had at least 20 goblins. <br><br><b>Fighting</b> <br>Runnyeye has 3 main areas for rogues in their 20\'s to fight. Those areas are known as the Knight\'s room, the Warlord\'s room, and the King\'s room. Additionally, some fighting inevitably occurs at the Gorge Zone. <br><br><b>The Gorge Zone</b> <br>Most areas of Runnyeye are accessed from the Gorge zone. The other zone, the Misty Zone is very close but the main Runnyeye areas are all on the west side of the dungeon so this zone sees the most activity. To get to the gorge zone from the Misty Zone, simply hug the right wall. The whole trip might take you 15 seconds. The Gorge zone is normally populated by low level goblins which will not attack anyone over level 12 or so unless you sit down. Remember to hide before you sit and be ready to clear the area for your casters to meditate if necessary. This is also where all the nasty trains will end up. If you must rest at the zone for an extended period, I suggest you move west to the large pool so the trains won\'t bother you. However, if you are alone and get lucky, you may be able to pull a straggler off a train to solo near the zone. One time, I found the Goblin Warlord wandering around up here alone after a train cleared the dungeon. It\'s not common, but it happens. The only really dangerous thing about the zone area is the fact that on the other side of the zone, the Gorge side, players are typically fighting minotaurs and muddites. Getting caught with a train on each side can be deadly. <br><br><b>The Knight\'s room</b> <br>This is probably the most heavily camped room in Runnyeye. The Goblin Knight, a rare spawn, always drops the incredible Blackened Iron Bastard Sword (20 damage, 47 delay, 2HSlash). This weapon is not useable by rogues but is a staple for the non-dual wielding melee classes like Shadow Knights and Paladins. Even rangers and warriors, who excel at dual wielding, like to have a BIBS in their pack. It sells on the Povar server for over 500pp. <br>The Knight\'s room is fairly easy to find. From the Gorge zone, descend into the dungeon and down a long ramp until you get to a 4-way intersection with a door straight ahead. Take a right and then your next left. You will see a group of green crystals to your left and a bridge over a small pool on your right. Continue straight into a circular room. This room contains a wheelbarrow and a pile of purple crystals. This is where the knight spawns. It is also one of the tougher areas in Runnyeye to hold because of the huge number of goblins that spawn in and around the room. In the room itself, 5 Dazed Goblin Guards or Shaman will spawn. The Knight, when he spawns, will replace one of these five. Behind the purple crystals is a false wall leading to a small circular room which spawns two Dazed Guards. Behind the green crystals is a similar room which spawns two Dazed Goblin Miners. Just past the Knight\'s room is an area that spawns 3-5 Dazed Guards or Shaman. Finally, a Dazed Shaman will often spawn near the bridge. It is easy to see how failure to control this area properly could easily result in a 15+ goblins raining on your parade. <br>The key to controlling this room is to control the Shaman. A Dazed Shaman will heal, buff, and even cast Spirit of the Wolf (yes, indoors), on Dazed Guards. Any time a Shaman joins the fight, the entire party should focus all efforts on defeating him as quickly as possible. Another key is to ensure you keep the secret rooms clear. Here is where a rogue excels! By sneak/hiding into the secret room, you can alert your party as to anything in there without causing the goblins to attack. If you forget about the secret rooms, the goblins inside will go aggressive as soon as a battle outside starts. This can easily turn a 6-on-3 battle into a 6-on-7 battle. <br>The Knight himself is a rare spawn who appears in the middle of the group of 5 in the room. Sometimes he appears twice in an hour, sometimes he doesn\'t show for 6 hours. There are plenty of rumors about how to improve his spawn time but I don\'t believe any of them. I\'ve heard that he won\'t spawn when someone is sitting in the room but then had him spawn right on top of me! I\'ve heard he only spawns after an Evil Eye is killed but have seen him appear twice in a row in an otherwise empty dungeon. The bottom line is that it\'s random. The Knight always drops the BIBS. <br><br><b>The Warlord</b> <br>The Warlord room is probably the easiest room to control. From the 4-way intersection mentioned above, take a left and head down a winding tunnel. It will open up into a square room containing 3 Goblin Guards. These are relatively low level (high-teens) goblins who will still be aggressive to players in the low 20\'s. Most can be easily killed, however, one is usually a caster and can blast a few bubbles of health with a single spell. He also can see through sneak/hide, so be careful when passing through. On the opposite wall is a door which leads to another square room containing two more doors. The right door leads to a tiny square room with a box in one corner. This is the Warlord\'s room. The Goblin Warlord is a common spawn (20 minutes exactly) and is usually accompanied by 2 or 3 Elite Goblin Guards. He is around level 25 and the guards are around level 24. The Warlord drops several nice items at random. His prize loot is the Blackened Iron Crown (AC5, +5 str, +5 all saves). He often drops the BI Medallion (+3 int, +3 wis). This item often sells for 30pp but is also good for non-casters to wear when practicing trade skills. The warlord also sometimes drops blackened iron armor. This armor is lower in AC and higher in weight than banded but is often desired because of its black color. Some pieces are more valuable than others. The BI Girdle is AC6 and + 5 stamina. The most desired piece of BI armor, the boots, are heavy and only AC6, but are magic and allow Rangers and Warriors to kick magic creatures. Finally, the Warlord will usually be carrying some sort of fine steel weapon. The Goblin Elite Guards sometimes drop a piece of BI armor also and maybe a bronze weapon or two. <br>Controlling the room is pretty easy. First, clear the Goblin Guards from the first room. If the Warlord room is fully spawned, have your party try pulling the entire room to the zone and then killing the Warlord right before zoning. Repeat with each Elite until the room is empty. If you\'re good, you can space each spawn out so one appears every 5 minutes. At level 27, I soloed the room for an hour after the spawns were spaced this way. Again, remember to keep the guards in front of the room cleared out. If a dazed guard or the warlord gets out of the room when it tries to run, all guards outside will go aggressive. <br><br><b>The King\'s Room</b> <br>The King\'s room is a tough camp for a group in the 20\'s. The monsters here are no tougher than the rest in Runnyeye but there are much more of them. Ironically, the problem isn\'t really with the 5 Elite Guards that surround the King. The problem is with the wandering Goblin Guards and Workers that pass through. More on that later. The King\'s room is found near the Warlord\'s room. From the Gorge zone, head down the ramp to the 4-way intersection and go left. Continue to the room with 3 Goblin Guards and pass through the only door. You will be in a small room with exits to the right and left. To the right is the warlord\'s room as described above. To the left is another door. Go through that door and go right then left into a circular room with a smaller circular room in the center. Go around that room and through a door opposite the one you came in through. Proceed past 5 or 6 more guards and open another door that leads to a hallway heading to the left. The door at the end of that hallway opens the King\'s room. In the King\'s room spawns the Goblin King and 5 Elite Guards. The King is around level 28 and drops the BI crown, Grotesque Mask, and/or BI medallion. I\'ve had him drop both the crown and mask at the same time. Just past the King\'s room, through another door, is a large room which spawns 3 elite guards. This usually won\'t attack into the King\'s room, but you never know... <br>The worst thing about this room is the random, low-level goblin worker that spawns right in the middle of the room and walks out the door. This goblin will go aggressive on anyone under about level 30 and will quickly bring help. This room is where I\'ve seen the largest trains in Norrath. The worker will often bring the 3 elites from the back room, 7-10 guards from the entrance hallway, and a handful of other goblins in the area. Combine this with the regular spawn of the room and it can get nasty fast. Additionally, you are pretty deep in the dungeon at this point and it\'s a long run to the zone. <br>The next problem is the fact that Borxx, a 32nd level Evil Eye, spawns near the King. If you ever see a message saying "Borxx focuses her gaze on you," it\'s time to leave. At level 32, she con\'d white to me and took 4 bubbles of health with 2 spells. She also double attacks for about 70 each. <br><br><b>Soloing</b> <br>Soloing here, as I mentioned earlier, is nearly impossible under level 30 and slow over level 30. The Warlord room is probably the best bet for soloing and I use a simple tactic to gain control. First, assuming the room is fully spawned, go into stealth mode BEFORE you approach the door. Once sneaking, open the door and you should see the Warlord and two Elites. Sneak behind the Warlord and poison a dagger. Get ready to hit and run! Backstab the Warlord and hit autoattack. All hell will break loose and all 3 goblins will attack. Once your poison has gone off run for the zone. The 3 Goblin Guards outside the room won\'t attack if you\'re over level 30, so just run past. At the zone, finish off the Warlord, loot him, and zone. Bind wounds, rest up (beg a heal from a druid or cleric fighting Minos) and head back down. The two elites should be back in the room and can easily be soloed together. This tactic works well in the King\'s room as well, but it is much harder because of the higher number of goblins and the longer run to the zone. SoW helps here! <br><br><b>Thieving</b> <br>All the goblins can be pickpocketed but don\'t have a lot of coin. I\'ve gotten a plat off a goblin on several occasions but certainly not as often as in Cazic or Mistmoore. You will get the usual runes, pages, words, gems, booze, and other commonly pickable items. BI armor is listed as magical and cannot be pickpocketed. Sneaking around is a bit tougher here than in other dungeons as well. I assume that the heavy population of Goblin Shaman and Wizards is the reason why my sneak/hide fails so often here. I know Evil Eyes can see through invisibility, camo, and sneak/hide, but I have heard rumors that Borxx cannot. Unfortunately, I\'ve never been around her long enough to find out. <br><br><b>Summary</b> <br>Runnyeye is a great place for experience for a full group in the mid-20\'s. It\'s slow experience but good loot for a soloist in the low 30\'s. The lack of adventurers makes it a nice place to visit when you\'re short on time or partners. I am still amazed every time I pass through Runnyeye, solo the Warlord, and see only 10 people in the zone on a Saturday night. Poke a few gobs for me! <br><br>~Akak L\'Impaleur, Rogue of Povar';

There are several valuable items which can be obtained here as well as plenty of experience for rogues in the 20's. Famed items such as the Grotesque Mask, the Blackened Iron Bastard Sword (BIBS), and the Blackened Iron Crown, can all be looted from inside Runnyeye. Additionally, you'll find the popular blackened iron armor (which looks like black chain) on many goblins around level 24 or so. Strangely, however, Runnyeye is not a crowded dungeon. Typically, fewer than 20 people can be found there during peak hours and it is not uncommon to find it totally empty during off hours. Goblins that can be fought here include low level Goblins, Guards, Wizards, and Shaman; tougher Dazed Goblin Miners, Guards and Shaman; and the significantly tougher Goblin Elite Guards. Three named goblins, the Dazed Knight, the Warlord, and the King are what you're here for. Just to keep things interesting, there are several Evil Eyes as well as a named Evil Eye (Borxx) wandering the dungeon. Deep inside Runnyeye you will even find a useable bank! <br><br><b>Location and directions</b> <br>Runnyeye is located between the Misty Thicket and Gorge of King Xorbb. There is an entrance on each side. From Misty Thicket, head to the center of the west wall and look for a hole in the wall near a goblin camp. From the Gorge of Kings Xorbb, stay on the southern wall and follow it east to a marked entrance. <br><br><b>Binding, buying, selling, and banking</b> <br>Runnyeye could be the most convenient dungeon in Norrath for good races to adventure in. Rivervale, located just one zone to the east of Misty Thicket, is a short run away and offers a good location to bind, bank, and sell loot. There is a rogue's guild there for training; ample pottery supplies; a pottery wheel and kiln; and anything else your thieving heart could desire. Misty Thicket is also heavily populated with monsters which drops skins (black wolves and bears) and easy poison components (wasp and spider sacs). This makes it even harder for me to understand why Runnyeye is so unpopulated. <br><br><b>Groups</b> <br>Like any dungeon over level 15, almost every class needs a strong group to survive. Runnyeye, however, is probably the most group-intensive zone for anyone under level 30. It is the only dungeon where I have found it impossible to solo. I've tried dozens of tactics and have not found a way to pull a lone monster. The goblins are always found in groups of 3-15 and cannot be pulled individually. Rangers and druids can wiggle their fingers all day trying to cast harmonize and it's not going to help. Additionally, Runnyeye has the worst trains I've found in Norrath. The trains here are worse than anything I've seen in Blackburrow, Permafrost, Cazic, Crushbone, Befallen, or Unrest. I have witnessed a 15 goblin train in the King's room that, after being pulled to the zone, had at least 20 goblins. <br><br><b>Fighting</b> <br>Runnyeye has 3 main areas for rogues in their 20's to fight. Those areas are known as the Knight's room, the Warlord's room, and the King's room. Additionally, some fighting inevitably occurs at the Gorge Zone. <br><br><b>The Gorge Zone</b> <br>Most areas of Runnyeye are accessed from the Gorge zone. The other zone, the Misty Zone is very close but the main Runnyeye areas are all on the west side of the dungeon so this zone sees the most activity. To get to the gorge zone from the Misty Zone, simply hug the right wall. The whole trip might take you 15 seconds. The Gorge zone is normally populated by low level goblins which will not attack anyone over level 12 or so unless you sit down. Remember to hide before you sit and be ready to clear the area for your casters to meditate if necessary. This is also where all the nasty trains will end up. If you must rest at the zone for an extended period, I suggest you move west to the large pool so the trains won't bother you. However, if you are alone and get lucky, you may be able to pull a straggler off a train to solo near the zone. One time, I found the Goblin Warlord wandering around up here alone after a train cleared the dungeon. It's not common, but it happens. The only really dangerous thing about the zone area is the fact that on the other side of the zone, the Gorge side, players are typically fighting minotaurs and muddites. Getting caught with a train on each side can be deadly. <br><br><b>The Knight's room</b> <br>This is probably the most heavily camped room in Runnyeye. The Goblin Knight, a rare spawn, always drops the incredible Blackened Iron Bastard Sword (20 damage, 47 delay, 2HSlash). This weapon is not useable by rogues but is a staple for the non-dual wielding melee classes like Shadow Knights and Paladins. Even rangers and warriors, who excel at dual wielding, like to have a BIBS in their pack. It sells on the Povar server for over 500pp. <br>The Knight's room is fairly easy to find.
