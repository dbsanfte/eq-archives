     <p>After much anticipation, today City of Heroes/Villains' seventh issue (titled 'Destiny Manifest') went live.<br>
<br>
Destiny Manifest is a large free update which adds levels 41 to 50 for
City of Villains characters, as well as a whole slew of updates
including two new zones (a high end PvP zone named 'Recluse's Victory',
an alternate reality of Atlas Park where villains and heroes fight for
the fate of Paragon City, and Grandville, a high level City of Villains
zone).<br>
<br>
In addition, Issue 7 introduces new villain powersets (thugs for
masterinds,&nbsp; two electric based powersets for brutes, and two dark
energy based powersets for stalkers), Patron Powers for villains over
level 40, storage bins for bases, and support for Ageia PhysX cards (in
Mayhem Missions only).<br>
<br>

                        <p><strong>Combined (CoH and CoV)</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
                        <ol><li>Some
base configurations that were valid in Issue 6 are no longer allowed in
Issue 7. If your base is invalid, you will be able to delete or move
objects to make it fit the new rules.</li><li>Recluse's
Victory signature heroes and villains give debt when they defeat
characters. This has been acting to discourage characters under level
50 from fighting them. The debt will be removed in a future patch, and
the Temporal Point reward for defeating them will be increased.</li><li>There is a rare client crash that may occur if you minimize/restore the game.</li><li>Mastermind pets are not keeping names when defeated and re-summoned.</li><li>Gladiator arena matches end as soon as your pets spawn.</li><li>Mission "Destroy Chasers" from Black Scorpion cannot be completed</li><li>Ageia
PhysX Hardware support is currently still in Beta. Because of this
fact, players may experience less than optimal performance. We are
working very closely with Ageia to provide our players the best
experience possible.<br>
                          </li></ol>
                        <p><strong>New PvP Zone - Recluse's Victory</strong> </p>
                        <ul><li>A new high level PvP zone set in an alternate version of Atlas Park and open to players of Level 40+.</li></ul>
                        <ul><li>Alternative
'sally port' exits are available in both Hero and Villain bases, to
help alleviate front door camping. Each base has two doors near the
temporal portal on the ground floor - in the Hero base they appear as
manholes, in the Villain base they appear as sewer entrances. These are
connected to 5 doors inside the zone, which will be randomly chosen
each time a door is used. The outside doors are not guarded, so players
use them their own risk.</li></ul>
                  <p><strong>PvP Zones</strong></p>
                        <ul><li>In
PvP zones, if a character is revived at the Hospital, they will respawn
with 1 hit point and 1 endurance. This is to enforce a short delay on
all characters before they can get back into battle.</li></ul>
                  <p><strong>Powers - Players</strong></p>
                        <ul><li>Modified
PvE critter accuracy. Defense powers will now work equally well against
critters, regardless if they have higher accuracy. For instance, your
defense powers will work equally well against a Boss or any critter up
to 5 levels higher than you, as it does for an equal level minion.
Previously, a more accurate critter could circumvent much of your
defense, but this will no longer happen. </li><ul><li>This
change is designed to alleviate the disparity between Defense and
Damage resistance powers (for instance, a player with super reflexes
will now be more effective than before against a high level critters, a
boss or Arch villain).</li><li>This change has no effect on a player who does not have any Defense.</li><li>More
accurate critters may have a greater chance at the extreme low end of
the To Hit scale than previously due to this change. For instance, an
Archvillain's To Hit could previously be reduced (with enough Debuffs)
to 5%, but will now have a 7.5% minimum.</li><li>This change does not affect PvP.</li></ul><li>If
a character is at 100% health, they cannot be reduced to 0 HP by a
single application of damage. (For example, if an uninjured character
with 1000 Hit Points was hit by a Blazing Bolt for 1500 Damage, the
character would be dropped to 1 HP. As soon as the DoT portion of the
Blazing Bolt ticked (a second later), the character would drop to 0 and
be defeated. If the character was down even 1 Hit Point below maximum
when the Blazing Bolt hit them, they would immediately be dropped to 0
and be defeated.)</li><li>All powers which
have an Endurance Drain component will now drain a percentage of a PvE
target's Endurance, rather than a set number of Endurance Points. This
fixes the issues created when enemies' Endurance Pools were increased.</li><li>Origin
Specific powers will no longer be lost after level 10.&nbsp; Characters
who already lost these powers (or who never had these powers) will be
granted these powers. </li><li>All Temporary Powers will now show duration or charges in their info.</li><li>Powers
that put you into a self-contained state (Rest, Phase Shift, PFF,
Invisibility, etc) now display "Only Affecting Self" in the mez state
text below the buff bar.</li><li>All Melee powers are now exempt from Range Debuffs.</li><li>Removed Melee ATs' exemption from Hurricane's -Range debuff.</li><li>Many
Location based powers (Such as Rain of Fire and Blizzard) can now be
affected by the casters Buffs (for example, using Build Up will now
increase the damage of Blizzard).</li><li>Stealth
and Phase Shift Powers will suppress (for self buffs or toggles) or
cancel (for external buffs) when a player interacts with Interactive
Objects, such as Plaques or Mission Objective Objects. Suppression of
this type has a duration of 10 seconds.</li><li>The
Claws Power sets for both Scrappers and Stalkers have new animations
for the powers Swipe and Strike. The animation for Slash has been
replaced with the old Strike animation in order to better match the
activation, recharge and damage values.</li><li>Reduced End costs on Claws high level powers.</li><li>Reduced
the effectiveness of Super Reflexes AoE Defense powers (Stalker and
Scrapper). (In Issue #6, Super Reflexes was given a bonus to AoE
Defence in order to make it more effective against bosses and Arch
Villains, since they typically use AoE powers. With the new To Hit
calculations, this is no longer necessary.)</li><li>Several changes have been made to the Defender, Controller and Mastermind Trick Arrow sets:</li><ul><li>Added 0.1 Slow effect to Entangling Arrow.</li><li>Changed Flash Arrow to Auto Hit in PvE. In PvP, a to hit check is still required.</li><li>Glue Arrow recharge time cut by 50% to 60 seconds.</li><li>Glue Arrow now has a -Fly component.</li><li>Disruption Arrow recharge time cut by 50% to 60 seconds.</li></ul><li>Fixed an issue where Entangling arrow could be escaped, despite its -Fly component, by jumping/flying out of it.</li><li>Oil Slick Arrow should no longer have the odd failure to ignite condition.</li><li>The Oil Slick Target should be easier to hit now.</li><li>Fixed a bug with Oil Slick Arrow - it was erroneously showing a -SPD debuff on the caster.</li><li>Fixed
some issues with Poison Gas Arrow (Mastermind, Defender and
Controller). All versions will now choke the targets more often, will
play the proper visual f/x and will affect the proper area. The PvP
aspect of the Controller version has been fixed (it was not working
against players at all.)</li><li>Rain of Arrows, Fistful of Arrows and Ranged Shot animations shortened.</li><li>Reduced Activation/Interrupt Time on Ranged Shot</li><li>Corrected
End cost for Archery Snap Shot, Aimed Shot, Fistful of Arrows and
Blazing Arrow. The Snap Shot, Aimed Shot and Fistful of Arrows changes
apply to Mastermind Ninja Power Set as well.</li><li>Fiery Aura/Healing Flames activation time reduced.</li><li>Improved
the effectiveness of Kinetics/Increase Density. It should now be about
50% more effective at protecting from Knockback/Knockup and Repel.</li><li>Energy and Ranged Defense will now apply to Pool/Teleportation/Teleport Foe.</li><li>Negative Energy and Ranged Defense will now apply to Warshade/Starless Step.</li><li>Resistance
Inspirations (the Sturdy Line) now offer 100% resistance to Teleport.
This will not prevent a player from teleporting themselves, it only
applies to Teleport Foe, Wormhole and related powers.</li><li>Smashing Defense will now apply to Earth Control/Fossilize (Ranged Defense still applies).</li><li>Fire Sword Circle has had the delay after animation removed.</li><li>Greater Fire Sword has had the delay after animation removed.</li><li>Confuse has had the delay after animation removed.</li><li>Rebalanced Hurricane's PvE repel effect. Its effectiveness should be equal to what it was before the last change.</li><li>Pets should no longer attack Dampening Fields associated with Reinforced Doors.</li><li>Pets should no longer attack Whirlpools.</li><li>The Phase Flight temporary power has had its endurance cost increased to more match a similar power in the Peacebringers set.</li><li>The
Hyper Phase temporary power now has the same 30 second time-out that
the Phase Shift power has, correcting an oversight in the original
power design.</li><li>Modified sprint fx to only play while running. Not Flying. Not swimming. Not jumping. Just running on the ground.</li><li>Modified Gravity Control Hold, Immobilize and Slow visual f/x so they more accurately reflect the control f/x.</li><li>Fixed fx for Dark Regeneration power.</li><li>Fixed fx for Unyielding Stance power.</li><li>Fixed
a bug with Black Hole and Dimension Shift that was causing the
translucency effect to play even though the target was not affected by
the power.</li></ul>
                  <p><strong>Powers - PvP</strong></p>
                        <ul><li>All
player powers with 'Toggle Drop' effects have lower chances for those
effects to occur. The need for these effects is greatly reduced with
the advent of Enhancement Diversification. No player power has a 100%
chance of dropping toggles following this change.<br>
                              <br>
The following is a complete list of all powers which have DropToggles
associated with them and the percentage chance of it taking place. In
the case of powers which have a chance of dropping 2 toggles, the
chance for this to happen has been calculated and included in the list.<br>
    <br>
    <em>Note:
Blaster, Corruptor and Mastermind Trip Mines have drastically different
percentages. This is likely to be a bug, and may be changed.</em></li><ul><li>Inherent: Brawl: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Devices: Trip Mine: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Devices: Time Bomb: 19% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Electrical Manipulation: Charged Brawl: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Electrical Manipulation: Havok Punch: 22% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Energy Manipulation: Bone Smasher: 22% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Energy Manipulation: Energy Punch: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Fire Manipulation: Fire Sword: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Fire Manipulation: Fire Sword Circle: 22% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Ice Manipulation: Frozen Fists: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Blaster: Ice Manipulation: Ice Sword: 22% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Defender Force Field: Force Bolt: 8% and 2% for 1 Toggle; 0.16% chance of 2 Toggles</li><li>Controller Force Field: Force Bolt: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Mastermind Force Field: Force Bolt: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Defender Force Field: Repulsion Bomb: 27% and 5% for 1 Toggle; 1.35% chance of 2 Toggles</li><li>Controller Force Field: Repulsion Bomb: 19% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Mastermind Force Field: Repulsion Bomb:19% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Defender Force Field: Repulsion Field: 5% and 2% chance for 1 Toggle per 1/2 second; 0.1% chance for 2 Toggles per 1/2 second</li><li>Controller Force Field: Repulsion Field: 3% for 1 Toggle per 1/2 second</li><li>Mastermind Force Field: Repulsion Field: 3% for 1 Toggle per 1/2 second</li><li>Defender: Kinetics: Repel: 5% and 2% chance for 1 Toggle per 1/2 second; 0.1% chance for 2 Toggles per 1/2 second</li><li>Controller: Kinetics: Repel: 3% for 1 Toggle per 1/2 second</li><li>Corruptor: Kinetics: Repel: 3% for 1 Toggle per 1/2 second</li><li>Peacebringer: White Dwarf Strike: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Defender Storm Summoning: Lightning Storm: 20% and 4% for 1 Toggle; 0.8% chance of 2 Toggles</li><li>Controller Storm Summoning: Lightning Storm: 17% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Defender Storm Summoning: Thunder Clap: 12% and 2% for 1 Toggle; 0.4% chance of 2 Toggles</li><li>Controller Storm Summoning: Thunder Clap: 8% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Warshade: Black Dwarf Strike: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Stalker: Assassin's Claw: 22% and 4% for 1 Toggle; 0.88% chance for 2 Toggles</li><li>Stalker: Assassin's Strike: 22% and 4% for 1 Toggle; 0.88% chance for 2 Toggles</li><li>Stalker: Assassin's Blow: 22% and 4% for 1 Toggle; 0.88% chance for 2 Toggles</li><li>Stalker: Assassin's Blade: 22% and 4% for 1 Toggle; 0.88% chance for 2 Toggles</li><li>Stalker: Assassin's Impaler: 22% and 4% for 1 Toggle; 0.88% chance for 2 Toggles</li><li>Stalker: Assassin's Eclipse: 22% and 4% for 1 Toggle; 0.88% chance for 2 Toggles</li><li>Dominator: Bone Smasher: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Total Focus: 64% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Incinerate: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Blaze: 64% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Ice Sword: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Greater Ice Sword: 64% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Mind Probe: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Psychic Shockwave: 64% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Skewer: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Dominator: Ripper: 64% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Mastermind: Assault Bot Smash: 5% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Corruptor: Traps: Time Bomb: 19% for 1 Toggle</li><li>Corruptor: Traps: Trip Mine: 75% and 37% for 1 Toggle; 27.75% chance for 2 Toggles</li><li>Mastermind: Traps: Trip Mine: 75% and 37% for 1 Toggle; 27.75% chance for 2 Toggles</li></ul><li>Defense
(Ranged, or AoE, as appropriate) will now apply to all Taunt powers in
Player versus Player combat. This replaces the previous 50% chance for
Taunt powers to affect a target in PvP.</li><li>Increased accuracy of Pool/Presence/Challenge in PvP.</li><li>Tanker,
Scrapper and Brute Taunt powers will now accept Accuracy Enhancements.
Note that these enhancements will have no effect in PvE, as the powers
automatically hit PvE targets. The change is made strictly for PvP
purposes.</li><li>Origin Specific powers
with Status Effects have had the magnitude of the effect lowered in
PvP. These powers will no longer be strong enough to affect other
players by themselves, although they will continue to add their
strength for stacking purposes.</li><li>Removed
legacy Target and Self holds from some Buff powers. This means that
when you use Twilight Grasp, Howling Twilight, Transference or
Transfusion, you will not set up a condition on yourself that allows
Containment to have its damage modifier apply.</li><li>Fixed the continuing visual f/x for Entangling Arrow in PvP - the f/x would never show up on a player target.</li></ul>
                  <p><strong>Powers - Critters</strong></p>
                        <ul><li>Arch
Villains/Heroes and Giant Monsters have been significantly boosted.
They should now require more people in order for them to be defeated,
especially at higher levels.</li><li>AVs/Heroes
and Giant Monsters now ignore threat level damage multipliers for
different Archetypes. They are still affected by Taunt as before.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could potentially have a critter create a pet that was much higher level than it.</li><li>Fixed bug that made Police Drones sometimes paralyze targets rather than defeating them.</li><li>Freakshow Noise Tanks had incorrect level ranges assigned. They now exist in the 40-45 range.</li></ul>
                  <p><strong>Powers - Bases</strong></p>
                        <ul><li>Arcane Elite Turrets will now accept the same number of Auxiliary items as Tech Elite Turrets.</li><li>Base Field Defenses will now affect all enemies within the field. In other words, Field powers are Auto Hit.</li><li>Added the ability to attack Phase Shifted targets to certain base items.</li><li>Base Defenses and Traps no longer give debt to a defeated player.</li></ul>
                  <p><strong>Bases</strong> </p>

display your Super Group's logo, including banners, stands, floor
plates and more.</li></ul>

decorative base items that previously counted as blocking doors and

new "recommended low-end" or "performance" option on the Graphics

                        <ul><li>Several
new options have been added to the display of Buff/Debuff icons in the
Status Window (beneath the HP/END/XP bars), the Group Window and the
Pet Window. The options for the different windows can be accessed
either by right-clicking on an icon in the appropriate window, or from
the 'General' tab of the in-game Options:</li><ul><li>Hide Auto Powers: The icons for 'automatic' powers (those that are always on) can be set to be displayed as usual or hidden.</li><li>Disable Blinking: Set whether the icons for powers that are near the end of their duration should start blinking or not.</li><li>Icon
