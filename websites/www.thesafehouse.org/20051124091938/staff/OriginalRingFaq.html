The Ring FAQ<BR>
Revision 1999.06.16<BR>
by Remmi, Founder of The Safehouse
<P>WARNING: This information is subject to change in a moment's notice as the Ring<BR>
takes shape!</P>
<P> Q: Who/what is the Ring?</P>
<P> A: We are an unofficial ultra-secretive inter-server rogue association. </P>
<P> We are NOT an official EQ guild. Our members do NOT have guild tags and we are<BR>
NOT registered/sanctioned in any way by EQ GM's. We operate &quot;under the table&quot;<BR>
so to speak and that's just the way we like it. Our membership is to remain<BR>
anonymous but we will have some type of &quot;in-game&quot; identification so members<BR>
can recognize Ring brothers and sisters if they know what to look for.</P>
<P> Q: What is the Ring's main goal?</P>
<P> A: In a nutshell, our main focus is to provide a far-reaching, self-sufficient<BR>
inter-server support network for our members, by our members. IOW, our primary<BR>
goal is to HELP one another have successful roguely careers! Here's a list of<BR>
some specific things we might provide/offer:</P>
<P> a) Financial backing (loans, newbie charities, underwriting major item<BR>
purchases, etc.) - each server may maintain a coffer of coinage donated<BR>
by established members. There will be NO DUES FEES collected so the<BR>
source of this money is based purely on member donations. However, each<BR>
server should have 'treasurer' characters ('mules') in order to keep the<BR>
money (as well as items) separate from our main PC's bank vaults. We might<BR>
want to have a 'treasurer' in each city and town so every member, regardless<BR>
of race and proximity, will have relatively easy access to this person.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps we set up a 'banking' schedule where these treasurers will be<BR>
available for an hour or two every now and then, otherwise we'll just have<BR>
to arrange meetings between the donors/recipients to make sure money and<BR>
items get transferred to and fro the parties involved. Or maybe we can<BR>
decide on a very &quot;out of the way&quot; spots to be our &quot;drop zones&quot; where we<BR>
simply drop stuff on the ground that can be picked up by treasurers at a<BR>
later date. And maybe a &quot;pick up&quot; zone for recipients... So basically<BR>
&quot;drops&quot; can be made anytime and the treasurer would be responsible for<BR>
checking the drop zone daily lest some passerby snags our stuff! However,<BR>
arrangements will definitely need to be made between a recipient and<BR>
treasurer because the treasurer ain't gonna just drop stuff on a whim!<BR>
We can use just keep a box somewhere for these transfers. Comments? <BR>
Ideas?</P>
<P> b) Manpower (and womanpower! *grin*) - For undertaking quests, retrieving<BR>
sought items, hunting trips, dungeon crawls, etc.. Essentially just<BR>
being there to provide another able body when someone needs a companion<BR>
or two to group with, or just someone to provide a shoulder to weep on.<BR>
&quot;Whhhhhaaaaaaaaa...rogues suck. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa...why do I bother!?&quot;</P>
<P> c) Training - We hang out with newbies once in a while to help them get<BR>
started, show em around, etc.. Perhaps we have a rotating schedule of<BR>
trainers who spend a couple hours a week helping a newbie. maybe being<BR>
a trainer is part of some type of *internship* that's part of &quot;paying<BR>
one's dues&quot; for full *partnership* in the Ring... ;-) </P>
<P> d) Area guides - Maybe a tie-in with training whereas someone plays *tour<BR>
guide* for a night for scheduled touring. For instance, I know<BR>
butcherblock like the back of my parrying pick and can show the<BR>
hotspots to members visting from Freeport.</P>
<P> e) Equipment loaning - We have a stash of surplus equipment (donated when<BR>
the veterans get better stuff) stored in *mule* characters' bank vaults<BR>
(see item A above about 'treasurer' characters). We loan the stuff out<BR>
(it can be tracked in GuildBoss *grin*) until no longer needed by the<BR>
recipient and it gets handed down to someone else or put back into the<BR>
vault. </P>
<P> Someone had the idea of providing newbie &quot;starter kits&quot;. This is a good<BR>
idea but we don't want to get too fancy--some cloth armor, a rusty<BR>
scimitar or spear, a bag, etc.. Just the very bare necessities--we want<BR>
them to *earn* the really good stuff. We might also think about getting<BR>
this stuff back when they reach level 5 so we can give it to newer newbies.</P>
<P> f) Regulated marketplace - for selling goods to members. Fair prices--no<BR>
baloney (just SPAM) *grin*. Perhaps some type of money laundering or<BR>
fencing racket where members can &quot;unload&quot; unwanted goods for a decent<BR>
price (better than NPC vendor pricing, that is!). Then the fence member<BR>
can sell to players (non members) or other members or whatever. Good<BR>
method to keep LORE ITEMS in circulation and from being destroyed with<BR>
the newest policy of not being able to have duplicate LORE ITEMS on a<BR>
single PC.</P>
<P> g) Wholesale crafting - using our Trade/craft skills to help members, like<BR>
smithing some nice banded armor for 2 plat over cost or somesuch.</P>
<P> Q: Is there any sort of government (blech!!) or ranking scheme?<BR>
A: We will set up some kind of *hierarchy* for each server so things stay<BR>
organized and tidy (once again, it can be done in GuildBoss). On top<BR>
is the server Director, beneath this are Masters, Agents, Interns,<BR>
whatever. We can set up specific jobs/duties like Treasurer, Scribe,<BR>
Roster Admin, etc. and give Titles/Ranks and give people some basic<BR>
responsibilities. Note that some jobs may require &quot;mule&quot; characters<BR>
so if you volunteer you'll need an open character slot on the server. </P>
<P> Bottomline, however, is that we remain &quot;loosely&quot; organized and NOT<BR>
get into &quot;heavy-handed&quot; legislation, politics, or governing. On the<BR>
contrary! We are, first and foremost, freelancing volunteers, providing<BR>
a bit of our time and energy to helping one another when possible.</P>
<P> But then again, a little bit of organization will make us a far more <BR>
efficient entity and better able to serve one another in the long haul<BR>
(get it? &quot;haul&quot;? we're thieves? okay, sorry, that was a pathetic pun).<BR>
<BR>
Q: Does the Ring have a website?<BR>
A: Working on it. Currently our home is the Root Cellar forum at the<BR>
Safehouse (all-rogue message board) which you can get to via this URL:</P>
<P> http://www.guildboss.com/safehouse</P>
<P> Note that access to the Root Cellar requires a password that all Ring<BR>
members are given upon completion of the registration process (see below).</P>
<P> Q: How do I sign up for the Ring?<BR>
A: Follow these instructions:</P>
<P> 1. The first thing you must do is create an EzBoard account, either<BR>
Local or Global. I suggest you create a global account so that<BR>
you can access other EzBoard message boards, otherwise with a local<BR>
account you'll only have access to the Safehouse. </P>
<P> To being creating an account you must click the &quot;Reserve Name&quot; link<BR>
(upper right hand area). </P>
<P> 2. Then you'll have the option of creating a Local or Global account--<BR>
choose Global. </P>
<P> 3. Next, all you need to do is come up with a login name (this is the<BR>
name on your POSTS so maybe use your EQ character's name!). You also<BR>
need to provide your email address. </P>
<P> 4. After you click the Register button, the EzBoard system will send you<BR>
a 'temporary' login password--do not confuse this password with the<BR>
Root Cellar password!! They are completely different. This 'login'<BR>
password is used to gain access to the entire board and your User<BR>
Profile. In fact, as soon as you get this temporary password you<BR>
should login to EzBoard and click the Edit Profile link and &quot;change&quot;<BR>
your password! </P>
<P> Okay, so now you're a registered user of the EzBoard message system<BR>
and you're halfway there to Ring membership! </P>
<P> 5. Next, you need to go and register for Ring membership by filling out<BR>
the registration form at: <BR>
<BR>
http://home.earthlink.net/~paulsoares/safehouse/ring_reg.html </P>
<P> 6. When I receive your registration I'll send you the password for Root<BR>
Cellar--remember, this password has *nothing* to do with your EzBoard<BR>
login! Once you're logged in to EzBoard you simply click the Root Cellar<BR>
forum link and enter the Ring password (that I send you!) and viola!<BR>
You're in! In fact, once you gain access to the Root Cellar you will not<BR>
be asked for the password again until I change it. </P>
<P><BR>
IMPORTANT: When filling out the registration form please use your actual<BR>
in-game character name in the Character Name field!</P>
<P> Q: How do I update my Ring membership profile?<BR>
A: Use the registration form at:</P>
<P> http://home.earthlink.net/~paulsoares/safehouse/ring_reg.html </P>
<P> Q: Who do I contact if I have any further questions/ideas?<BR>
A: If you're not in The Ring then send all feedback to:<BR>
paul@guildboss.com. But if you're a member then go to the<BR>
Root Cellar and discuss your topics there.</P>
