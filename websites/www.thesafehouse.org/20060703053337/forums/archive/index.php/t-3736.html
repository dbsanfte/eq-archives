<br />
Anyone that can shed some light into the whole process?<br />
<br />
-The questing for the key? (I have heard is a hard, long and boring process)<br />
-The bane weapons? (Where are the drops for making them)<br />
and finally...<br />
-Strategy for the encounter?<br />
<br />
Some of the comments mentioned nowadays are that this encounter is not as hard as it used to be, especially with the addition of AAs and levels.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advanced for your feedback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EZ_Sedrek</div><div class="date">08-26-03, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Key.. look up Arx key quest.  In particular, you might look up the sigil earing of veracity quest since it's part of it.<br />
<br />
Encounter, we only have 2 people beating on him, while the rest nuke / use arrow damage, and melee keep the ground warm while sitting on their duff.  (i.e. don't spend too much time working your guild towards seru bane).  Of course there are more than one way to do this encounter as any other out there.<br />
<br />
P.s. For gods sake, leave the door closed and stay OFF the walls when you are inside Seru's main room.<br />
<br />
Also, the pillars block AE, so proper positioning of seru will keep your healers nice and comfy.<br />

********************************************<br />
BANE WEAPONS:<br />
<br />
Quicksilver Temper is brewed and trivial at 228. The Yttrium Steel Sheet has a high smithing trivial (around 250). Both of these items are droppable. The final combines' trivial levels are in the mid to upper 100s. The final weapons are no drop, so you have to produce them yourself. <br />
<br />
Quicksilver Temper is made by combining Shissar Blood (dropped off Shissars), Fungoid Sap (from Ancient Shriekers in the Deep), ShikNar Ichor (from the Shik'Nars in Fungus Grove) and Meteor Dust (random drop in The Grey). <br />
<br />
The Yttrium Steel Sheet is made by combining two Small Bricks of Yttrium Ore and the Quicksilver Temper. <br />
<br />
The final combine produces the weapon of your choice: Use a Pommel Mold for the weapon you want, a Hilt Mold, the Quicksilver Temper and the Yttrium Steel Sheet and you will get your weapon.<br />
<br />
Reward(s):<br />
Yttrium Dagger<br />
*        Yttrium Falchion<br />
*        Yttrium Long Sword<br />

**************************************************  *<br />
Key Quest:<br />
Kill the following 4 NPC’s, loot a head, turn in the heads to a NPC in Katta, give you an Arx Key. One key is a 10 dose group port to LIS’s room. Each NPC banishes to the jail room. Simple way to kill each, send in the pets, and anyone else nukes/dot’s. Pets are immune to being banished. So long as the pet’s are high on the agro list, no one gets banished. Alternate method, bring a mage, have them coth every time someone is banished.<br />

Katta Castelium:<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'Hello there, Moro. Pleasure to meet you, I am Governor Tilbok Furrunner. I am tasked with the gathering and security of information for the Concilium Universus, the ruling council of our fine city. ' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what chambers?' <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'According to these reports Seru resides in a building called the Arx Seru. It is the large complex in the center of the four Praesertum Consillium. We must take [action] now. Do not underestimate the power of Sanctus Seru for what they do they feel is right. ' <br />
<br />
Your faction standing with Validus Custodus got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better. <br />
Your faction standing with Nathyn Illuminious got worse. <br />
Your faction standing with Coterie of the Eternal Night got worse. <br />
Your faction standing with Seru got worse. <br />
Your faction standing with Hand of Seru got worse. <br />
Your faction standing with Eye of Seru got worse. <br />
Your faction standing with Hand Legionnaries got worse. <br />
You gain party experience!! <br />
<br />
You say, 'what kind of action' <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'You must go see Lcea. She was Tsaph Katta's closest advisor. This matter has escalated greatly and must be placed in her hands. Ask her about the [Arx Key] she will no doubt ask in your service retrieving it. I salute your service to the city and wish you well. ' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what arx key' <br />
<br />
Lcea Katta says 'The Arx Key, yes. I have read the compiled reports that have been brought to us and it seems to gain access to Arx Seru you need four shards, one from each Praesertum leader. When the time is ready each leader inserts their shard into the door of Arx Seru at the same time, and they are transported within the building. We need you to retrieve the four shards. When you have done so seek out Elnerick Augustleaf, and tell him that you serve Katta. His powers over the arcane are great and I believe he can form the shards into a single master key. Once you have received the Arx Key, place the seal given to you by Elnerick and your Runed earring in this jewel box and give it to me. I eagerly await your return. ' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Elnerick Augustleaf' <br />
<br />
Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Greetings Moro. I am Magistrate Elnerick Augustleaf of Katta Castellum and the Loyalist Empire. If it is arcane knowledge that you seek you have come to an excellent place to study. Not only do we have wondrous magical resources available at the Magus Conlegium but the teachings of Tsaph Katta are well known to all of our citizens and aid in preparing the mind for the freedom of thought and mental and emotional discipline needed to become a great wizard. ' <br />
<br />
You say, 'i serve katta' <br />
<br />
Elnerick Augustleaf says 'Ah, I was told you would come. I hope that you have retrieved the shards from each Praesertum Leader? Please show them to me. ' <br />
<br />
Hand the 4 shards to Elnernik for arx key(10 charges of group gate into the arx) and a seal. <br />
<br />
Place the seal and your Runed Earring of Veracity into the jewelbox that Lcea gives you and give the jewelbox back to Lcea for the 4th earring and and the lead-in for the quest for the Sigil Earring of Veracity.<br />
Reward(s):<br />

Second earring just involves giving something to a filing cabinet I think.<br />
Third earring is report farming in each of the houses.<br />
Fourth earring is killing the generals of each house and getting their head, basically the fight is like a dain fight (fight, banish, run back, etc.), have melees bind before the general chamber, then have a wizard sit at the jail spot, give the melees a TL box then engage, all but shoulder I think are slowable.<br />
Fifth earring is getting Seru's head.<br />
<br />
You get Seru Arx key along with the 4th earring, unlimited charges now I think, <br />
<br />
Seru bane requires master smithing, it's like 175 or something needed to make the sheets and 125+ to get the seru bane weapon made.  Everyone that needs Seru bane needs to master smithing.  Look up the components for Seru bane at Allakhazam or something.<br />
<br />
Strategy from when I killed him long ago before mod rod nerf (I'm assuming it's still the same fight, but shorter now with no more mod rods) was to position casters diagonally from pin pillar (block AE, stay out of LoS, similar to HP blocking AE) and then have warrior fight Seru in the pillar with someone timing the AE.  Melees fight Seru from behind, AE called, strafe left to block AE, then come back in to fight, similar to Cursed fight.  Casters just nuke whenever AE goes off.  Seru is disease slowable and his DPS isn't too bad, flurries occasionally, has like 1.2 million HP or something.  Shouldn't be too hard, just don't move too close to doors or you'll aggro guards.  Seru fight is like Cursed fight with a mob that fights like Tunare (a lot less flurries though).</div></div><hr />

Fighting the key droppers: Simply put, sick a pet(s) on them. Pets are immune to the banish proc. So long as the pets are high on the aggro list, everyone else can just nuke and dot.<br />

<br />
The trivial for the temper is far lower than 228. Over a year ago, I posted that I had made some tempers, and that they were trivial to me when my skill was at 228. Some people misread that post to believe that the trivial is 228. The trivial is far lower lower: I made about 80 of the tempers and failed none of them at 228, I had many more failures making royal temper for my cultural. Probably between 135 and 162 like other tempers. www.eqtraders.com reports it being under 180.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Highly false. As the only 250 smith/brewer in my guild, I was tasked with doing all the precombines for seru bane weapons. And we made a lot of them...30+. At *BEST* the success rate with max skill on yttrium sheets is 50%. The trivial for them is probably in the area of 300.<br />
<br />
Requirement for melees to get the ingrediants for the bane weapon, because of how difficult it was to get Fungoid Sap in quantity, and the fail rate on the sheets, was 150 smithing (or fletching for rangers...I don't know what the bow trivial is like, all our rangers were 220+ fletchers and had no problem with it). At 150 +loaned geerlok, none of the melees failed to make their weapon.</div></div><hr />

It's unlimited charges, so you only need one key to port your entire raid in.. That might be true, but 2-3 keys would be better as there are roamers near the port in. Of course, 1 group would probably be able to handle them now, depending on how many added during the fight and how quickly the 1 key holder could port up a 2nd group. Still think it's easier to have multiple keys and port up together though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And another: You can pull three of the Praesertum to the jailcell and thereby (in effect) nullifying their banish. The 4th one (Vantorus) doesn't seem to want to leave his guildhouse though.<br />

Cleric CH line was positioned behind the pillar right next to where they were fighting, sitting with me(necro) in grp and the bard that takes wrack the whole time.. with wrack going and having seduction of saryn on, my clerics never went even below 70 mana..Make sure to bring alot of wizards and damage dealers... set it up so your nukers/archers are kinda of kitty cornered away across the room out of AE range.. LONG FIGHT ...<br />
<br />
oh and yes, only need 1 person with key to port groups up. just be safe on pulls and dont pull multiples.. seru is an awesome looking Raid Encounter MOB<br />
