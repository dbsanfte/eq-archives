     <p>Once upon a time,
in 1970 to be exact, Comic Con begain with 300 attendees in the
basement of the US Grant Hotel in downtown San Diego and centered on...
comics.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to 2006 and we're seeing the biggest presence of movie, tv and
game studios ever. This year's Comic Con was a Geek Fest for the 21st century.<br><br>According to the official information provided by Comic Con, over 104,000 people (including exhibitors and professionals) attended last year. I'm betting they broke that this year and this is despite the record heat.<br><br>And sorry, yes, I have to mention the heat. It was hot. It was very hot. It was humid. It was very hot and humid. I could almost title my San Diego trip, "I came, I saw, I melted". At least the convention folks did right by us and turned up the airconditioning.<br><br>For a few moments Comic Con 2006's unofficial theme for me was "tease". I was going to cover <span style="font-weight:bold">Kevin Smith's</span> panel appearance but he ran late and we (as in the 6000 strong audience waiting for him in Hall H) were given the choice of waiting it out and watching a 20 minute segment of "Beer Fest" or leaving and seeing if they would reschedule for 6pm. This happened day 2 of Comic Con for me, I had already done some Exhibit floor reconnaissance, I loved the airconditioning in Hall H, so I opted to stay. It seemed almost everyone was willing to stay.<br><br>The 20 minute "<span style="font-weight:bold">Beer Fest</span>" segment played, with the Warner Bros. overlay and bottom credit on it the whole time. It was pretty amusing I have to admit. It definitely had some laugh out loud moments. I don't know if it'll be a case of&nbsp; "that was all the good bits in the movie" though.<br><br>After that we watched a live feed from another panel going on upstairs which included <span style="font-weight:bold">Ray Bradbury</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Ray Harry Hausen</span>. Ray Bradbury (huge props, he's still one of my favorite Sci Fi authors) is OLD. It was a rather jarring switch to go from beer guzzling and scantily clad ladies to Sci Fi reminiscing. There's some social commentary in there somewhere I'm sure. By the way, "Farenheit 451" is going to be made into a movie.<br><br>Kevin Smith had still not arrived at this point. Rosario Dawson (Clerks 2, Sin City, Rent) jumped up to the mic. She did a heck of a job killing time, she even sang a song acapella when put on the spot. The finale of the time slot was her calling Kevin Smith, getting hung up on, then calling again and then him talking to us via speakerphone saying, "Why the fuck are you all sitting there instead of going to see Clerks 2!?!". He then went into chat mode and told us how he had been told he'd try to hold a Q&amp;A session at 6pm.<br><br>So that was that.<br><br>But at least I had arrived early to Hall H and seen... <span style="font-weight:bold">Quentin Tarantino</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold">Robert Rodriquez</span>, Rose McGowan, Rosario Dawson and other actresses promoting "Grindhouse" - which I saw part of the trailer for. That looks hilarious. Totally over the top slasher/gore/violence/parody movie from what I saw. Rose McGowan becomes an amputee during all this and ends up with a machine gun leg. I have no idea what the whole plot is since I missed the beginning chunk of the trailer but I have a feeling if I had seen it all I still wouldn't know. Tarantino's big announcement at the panel was that Kurt Russell was going to be starring.<br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Robotech</span><br><br>I went to a panel on this last year. They said "Robotech: Shadow Chronicles" would be out on DVD by this time. They lied. This year they actually have a signed agreement and... Funimation is going to distribute. This means DVD, but also theatrical release! The deal was literally signed a day before the panel but they did a re-enactment signing for us. The panel included three voice actors for Shadow Chronicles, one of whom, Dan Woren, had voiced Roy Foker for the original Robotech and will be playing a general in this upcoming movie. When asked about his hopes for the film, he said, "I hope to play a character who stays alive."<br><br style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-weight:bold">NeverWinter Nights 2<br><br></span>Obsidian Entertainment was on hand for a panel. Feargus Urquhark, CEO, Chris Avellon, Owner/dialogue writer, Josh Sawyer, Lead Designer, and a programmer named Adam comprised the panel.<br><br>The intro speech given by Feargus emphasized that they had told themselves, "Don't turn it into something that it is not". So NeverWinter Nights 2 will be: a single player game, a multiplayer game and a game making machine. They've almost completely rewritten the engine.<br><br>Changes include diety selection and a tutorial hopefully designed to not feel like a tutorial via a Harvest Festival theme.&nbsp; You can now play from an over the shoulder camera view as well as the isometric view. Class wise, they've added the Warlock, which the lead designer described as a "trimmed down Sorcerer" but with a "rapid fire" ability.<br><br>As far as the presentation went, the cut scene they showed us was pretty nice, though it didn't use the game engine. Later they showed another one which did and used some of the over the shoulder camera view. Apparently you will be able to make similar scenes. The customization options for characters was nearly on par with MMORPG choices in terms of skin color choices and number of heads and hairstyles. There were no slider options for width of face etc. though. The game playing interface included a new quick spell interface, a pop up on screen which lets you choose spells quickly.<br><br>Taking a quick poll of the group I was with, one guy said he was unimpressed but another said he was more interested after seeing the panel than prior to seeing it and would probably buy the game.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">SOE Block Party<br><br></span>We arrived at the SOE Block Party on Saturday and immediately felt the heat radiating off of the black top. First order of business was to get a wrist band (to get free beer) and a goodie bag (t-shirts, Matrix Online game, music download codes, EQ2 book and map, blinking necklace thing). Food came next, our choice, hamburgers or hotdogs. They had shade tents set up and games, including Vanguard, were being demoed. You could also sign up to take a tour of the SOE offices (which are split between 3 buildings which surrounded the parking area we were in). Right when I arrived I saw Smedley get dunked (I missed getting a picture of it though). Brad McQuaid was there and admitted he had spent too much money at Comic Con. It was slightly odd to see folks from Sigil and from SOE together both promoting games. I'm not sure how much promoting they got done. It was just so hot and the music made it really hard to hold a conversation. The tour inside the offices was airconditioned so folks who opted for that got a bit of a break at least. Over all I think it was a good effort but having it during the hottest Comic Con ever was just bad luck.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Exhibit Hall<br><br></span>A huge element of Comic Con is about meeting people and watching people. If you followed the forum thread for Comic Con, we failed to meet up with all Safehousers who attended but ironically we did find Tabbran and Pep... while we were exiting the convention center on Sunday. I personally attended Friday, Saturday and Sunday of Comic Con and hung out with a different mix of folks each day.<br><br>Booth wise, DC and Marvel as well as big web comic folks like Penny Arcade were there of course, but I also picked out some of my own
favorites like <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com/archive.php">Diesel Sweeties</a> and <a href="http://www.tmcm.com/comics/webcomics/002_reality">Too Much Coffee Man</a> (he's not doing
the TMCM strip anymore though, boo!). There was a lot to see and I seemed to find new things in the hall each day. For example, I noticed Mythic's (or rather Mythic EA now) Warhammer Online booth only on Sunday. Sanya (Tweety) was there and called me over. They were demoing Warhammer Online but I was told they were not showing much as they had showed us at the E3 cocktail party. Still for a game in alpha, it was a bold move to let folks play it at Comic Con. Sadly, it was confirmed for me though -- no stealth in the game. So my interest in it now is more PvP focused since no proper rogue class will be included.<br><br>Can't talk about Comic Con without mentioning the costumes. More (Nymm's girl) and I had an unofficial spotting quest to see if there were more folks dressed as pirates or ninjas at Comic Con. The pirate tally was higher, but we reasoned that since ninjas are so stealthy, we could have been surrounded and not known it. I did capture a few on camera though. Storm troopers abounded, elves, demons and anime characters did as well. Not so many Sailor Moons as I've seen in the past though. Zato pointed out a Link being chastised for not having pointy ears (the rest of his costume was great). There were a bunch of knights as well including The Black Knight, complete with bloody arm. The best costume I saw was the character Lone Wolf and Cub (he had cub with him too) it was freaky how 2D he looked.<br><br><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/mugshots/comiccon2006/IMG_2831"><img alt="" src="http://www.thesafehouse.org/mugshots/albums/comiccon2006/IMG_2831.thumb.jpg" align="" border="0"></a><br><br><br>Speaking of freaky and ninjas (ok I mentioned ninjas a while ago but bear with me) while I was out with some Sigil Games folks we spotted a guy wearing a Vanguard shirt and the Sigil folks set me on&nbsp; a mission to take a picture of the back of his shirt with them in the picture. My camera is not a quick snap shot one so we pretty much stalked this poor fellow. He had to have caught on at the end I'm sure.<br><br>And now we have come to the end as well. See the full set of my pictures, including some really really good animal costume pictures (ok fine, I went to the San Diego Zoo) in the <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org/mugshots/comiccon2006?page=1">Safehouse Mugshot section</a>. Can't wait till next year.<br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold"></span><br><br><br><br> <span style="font-weight:bold"></span><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold"></span><br><br><br><br>
