The newest\ninstallment in the GTA series is due to release in just a few days, and\nthere is a lot to talk about...\n<br>\n\n<br>Briefly, Grand Theft Auto started as a 2d, top down shoot em up\ngame, where you ran around and stole cars, plowed into innocent\nbystanders, tangled with police, and generally broke every law you\ncould.. After Grand Theft Auto 2 gained niche popularity and success\nwith the addition of gang warfare and some new mechanics, Rockstar\nbroke off into the realm of 3d gaming, and created a 3 dimensional 3rd\nperson action/driving game, that was noted for it\'s free form style of\nplay, and it\'s emphasis on a virtual world. After Grand Theft Auto 3\nproved to be a massive commericial success, Rockstar built upon the\nconcept and success of GTA3, adding new features, new themes, and new\nmechanics to the already existing framework of GTA3. It was an even\nbigger success. Rockstar has again decided to push their abilities to\nthe limit, and to capitalize on what has worked in the past, in their\nwork on GTA: San Andreas.\n<br>\n\n<br>This is one of 2 articles I\'ll be writing for GTA:SA. In this\narticle I\'ll be covering what\'s different about GTA:SA from previous\ntitles, and what Rockstar has added on, or improved on. And holy crap,\nhave they added on to it... In my next article, I\'ll give my\nimpressions on the game after cracking out on it for hours with\nfriends.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">What\'s the same?</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Everything really. The classic framework of GTA3 and up is still\nthere. A 3rd person(capable of 1st person) 3-d graphic city, replete\nwith people, police, gangs, traffic(oh the traffic), radio stations in\nthe car, and on. The game is still very free form in play, with\nmissions providing scripted content. You\'ll still be able to buy\nproperty, store cars, collect guns, ect...There is nothing from the\nother GTA titles that isn\'t in San Andreas.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">So what\'s different already!!!</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nWell...everything really. For readability sake, I\'ll break it down into the most major points.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">WORLD</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>San Andreas, unlike GTA3 and GTA: Vice City, isn\'t just one city,\nor two cities. It\'s a whole state. There are 3 major cities, and a\nmultitude of smaller communities. The cities are connected by major\ninterstate roads, and the townships by smaller, more local dirt\nroads(anyone wanna go for a country cruise? mwhahaha). There are corn\nfields, oceans, and just about every locale from GTA:VC, plus a few\nmore. Each country community is different, with it\'s own style, norms,\nand behaviors. The different cultural groups within the cities are\ndistinct and unique from each other(many landscapes and areas in San\nAndreas are almost identical copies of San Francisco). China Town being\ndistinct from the Haight-Ashbury look alike section(named Hashbury).\nJust how much bigger is San Andreas than Vice City? The estimate is 5\nto 6 times larger. Reports are that it takes 15+ minutes to cross the\nentire state. I\'m not sure huge is an appropriate description. !@#$\nhuge sounds better. GTA:SA will make more use of the z-axis than any\nother GTA to date, with a mountain in game standing well over a half\nmile(relative) in height, complete with steep windy roads perfect for\nreckless driving.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">STORY</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>In the other 2 3d Grand Theft Auto titles, you played white guys.\nBoth mafioso looking fellas from New York. In GTA:SA, you play CJ, a\nbrother from the city of Los Santos, who escaped gang violence and a\ndeteoriorating life. He returns when he hears his mother is dying, his\nfamily iis collapsing, and everything is going to poop. On his way back\nto Los Santos, CJ is framed by 2 corrupt policemen, and so the game\nbegins. Little bit different than starting out as a thug with orders to\nset up a crime ring, eh?\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">RPG ASPECTS</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>In other GTA games, you just collected stuff.

But don\'t worry, you\ncan work off those pounds! There are gyms all over San Andreas where\nyou can work out, and buff CJ up, making him physically tougher.

Rockstar is\nclaiming there are different "builds" you can put together, so maybe\nyou are a skinny gun fighting thug, or a big hulking martial arts\nmaster, or a giant kingpin kinda guy. Up to you and how you play, so\nthey claim.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">INTERACTING WITH THE ENVIROMENT</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Swimming... </span>I\'ve waited 2\nwhole GTA titles for a gangster that could freakin swim. Rockstar has\nfinally heard my and other\'s pleas. CJ can swim in San Andreas, and not\njust simple floating on the surface and paddling along.There are\nmultiple kinds of strokes and manuevers to help you get around in the\nwater, provided you have the stamina and the skill. But wait, Rockstar\ncared so much about swimming, they allowed CJ to dive underneath the\nsurface, and swim among the fishes! Your lung capacity is a function of\nyour overall fitness level. By all accounts, Rockstar has paid just as\nmuch attention to what lies above the water in San Andreas, as what\nlies below, so expect there to be reasons to go for a swim.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Climbing</span> is another feature\nnew to the Grand Theft Auto line up. To what extent it goes to, I don\'t\nreally know.

Expect the super expensive hot\nrods to handle the way they should.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Vehicle continuity</span> is\nsomething most GTA players don\'t really consider. In my experience,\nvehicles in GTA are meant to be driven at top speed, everywhere, til\nthey blow up. They are best used as battering rams, all the time. In SA\nhowever, vehicles don\'t just get damaged. They get dirty if you drive\nit through the neighbor\'s lawn, or through the park. If you don\'t take\ndirty cars to the car wash, they rust. If they rust, they break easier.\nBullet holes remain in the body til you get it fixed. Vehicles in San\nAndres can be disposable, or maintained, depending on your preferance.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Nitrous Oxide</span> also makes it\nway into GTA for the first time. GTA has never really been that "fast"\nof a game, compared to say, Need For Speed.\n<br>But reports are that San Andreas achieves that "blinding" level of\nspeed, which makes me all weak in the knees just thinking about it. Not\nall cars have NOS of course, but you can put have it installed at one\nof the Auto Shops around town if it qualifies... Did I say you can put\nstuff on cars? Hrm...\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">CUSTOMIZABILITY</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>In the other GTA games, the amount of customization you were\nallowed was what gun you carried, and in Vice City, a meager selection\nof outfits.\n<br>\nIn San Andreas, Rockstar is ready to blow your mind with what you can do to yourself.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Clothing</span> gets so much more\nattention in San Andreas. We\'re not talking "a track suit", "a cop\nuniform", "a leisure suit". We\'re talkin basketball jerseys, multiple\nbasketball jerseys. We\'re talking wife beaters, t-shirts, pimp suits,\ngang colors, jeans, basketball shoes, sports equipment, and ON. And of\ncourse you can buy yourself some BLING. Not only are there different\ntypes of clothing, but different BRANDS of clothing. Multiple\naccessories to go along with your threads...I\'ve no doubt only\nscratched the surface with what I\'ve mentioned here.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Haircuts</span> range from bald, to afros, to corn rows, and other unique styles.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Tattoos</span> are also included, from gang mottos and logos, old englishscript, to straight up biker tattoos.\n<br>\n\n<br>You might be asking by this point...why all the focus on buying\nyourself stuff and playing dress up, other than the obvious? Because it\nall has a real impact on the game. More on that in a sec, one last\nthing I wanna talk about.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Customizing Vehicles</span> is\nanother one of those things GTA players have wanted to do forever. And\nit is our day. There are multiple mechanics around town that specialize\nin pimping out your ride. Each speciializes in doing a certain kind of\ncar, like making a phat low-rider, a sic import racer, or a dope SUV\nwith 21"s. I\'m not sure if all the work you can do is cosmetic or not,\nbut you can put NOS on the thing! Who cares about about engine work,\nstrap that thing up and lets DRIVE! HAHAHA!!!!... Sorry. Anyways, you\ncan paint it up, add graphics, rims, spoilers, bumpers, do custom paint\ncombinations, and on. I guess this means I\'ll have to mind my\ndriving...nah screw it, granny 60 points, 12\' oclock!\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">THE PEOPLE AND THE AI</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">People</span> in GTA games usually\nreact to what you DO, not who you ARE. Which was fine for the most\npart. But Rockstar wanted to take it a step further, to get NPCs to\nreact to the way you dress, your hair cut, your car, you\'re tatoos,\nyou\'re weight, your prowess...and they did. All the clothing and\ncustomization choices, the physical choices you make, affect how people\nreact to you. They might call you fat, or cower in fear of what you\ncould do to them. They may buddy up to you, or try to put a cap in your\nass. Gang colors will set off certain gangs, and police will much more\nreadily identify and harass you with notable gang colors on. It\'s\nfunny, GTA seems to be doing something Fable and Bluebox tried for 4\nyears to pull off. But the NPC AI also got a face lift in another area,\ndetection. Previously, enemies knew you were there because the script\nsaid so. You\'ve got 5 stars, every cop knows where you are...you\'re on\na mission and all these banditos know exactly where you\'re coming\nfrom....In San Andreas, NPC AI will rely on sound and visual checks to\nfind and detect the player...this allows for a few new ways to play GTA\nthat weren\'t possible in earlier builds.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">The Fuzz</span> in GTA games, or the\nbad guy AI, has always been brutal, predictable, and easily avoided and\nundermined. Even when they got tire spikes, helicopters dropping swat\nteams,, tanks, the FBI and the army, the AI was never really smart or\nchallenging. It was more lethal in an uncoordinated and over the top\nway. Rockstar has made some changes to the AI, so that now cops will do\nthings like shoot at you from their vehicle, whenever they can. People\nwill duck behind cover to fight instead of just standing there blasting\nyou. The Helicopters won\'t give up the chase just because an alley\nlooks like a tight squeeze for it to fit through. Motorcycle riders\nwill have figured out they can shoot from the vehicle too.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">The gangs</span> are another part of\nthe GTA player wish-list that finally got noticed. "Gangs" before San\nAndreas consisted of guys who stood around your buildings, wouldn\'t get\nmad if you killed them, packed heat, and had some pretty terrible AI.\nThat was pretty much it. In San Andreas, you will be able to to recruit\nmembers to your gang, and choose a select number(reports say 3) to join\nyou. They will follow you around, react to threats, and while your\ndriving around, do drivebys while you man the wheel! What are homies\nfor!\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Hand-to-hand</span> combat has been\nspruced up from the Vice City Version as well. There are multiple\ncombat "stances" CJ can take, which will allow him attack moves. These\nmoves can be comboed together to create other attacks. These\ncombinations must be learned from different dojos in the city, where\nyou will choose what attacks you wish to learn...and you\'ll get to\npractice them beating the crap out of your sensei in sparing matches.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">The targeting system</span> has also\nundergone a few changes. When using the R1 button to auto target, CJ\nwill first target hostile NPCs. If there are none, he will target the\nnearest NPC. If there are no npcs period around, R1 takes you\nautomatically to 1st person perspective aiming. In this mode, the game\ncan be played like a 1st person shooter, with the left stick moving you\nforward, left, right and back, while the right stick controls your\nlook. Should be intresting to see how this game plays as a FPS. The\ngame can still be played exactly the way you are used to in other GTA\ngames.\n<br>ALL weapons can autolock on to targets in SA, unlike previous\ntitles. And yes, you can shoot more than one gun out the window of your\ncar. Which guns exactly I\'m not sure.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Stealth attacks</span> are also a new\nadditon. Rockstar is the same company that produced the brutal,\nvicious, and graphic game Manhunt, which focused on stealthing up to\nyour enemies and attacking them from behind for instant kills. San\nAndreas uses a limited version of this where CJ can stand in shadows,\nor duck behind objects to avoid NPC\'s attentions. After slowly sneaking\nup on NPCs(because they can hear!) when CJ is close enough, he\'ll shift\nhis weapon to a new position, and you can silently dispatch your enemy.\nIf you sneak up on an opponent with a silenced weapon, your shot will\nbe a killing one.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">GRAPHICS</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThe engine for GTA, while tried\nand true, has constantly evolved with each new title. San Andreas is no\ndifferent, and it is pushing what the engine(and my tired ass PS2) is\ncapable of. The console versions of GTA 3 and VC made generous use of\nvertex and edge blurring to save the frame rate during busy periods.\nAnd GTA for the consoles wasn\'t even that high a resolution to begin\nwith. Rockstar has cranked up San Andreas in virtually all areas. Real\ntime shadows, real time reflections, around 25% more polygons on the\nscreen at one time, and an increased draw distance allowing for more\nspectacular views, of which San Andreas will have many. Coming from\nsomeone who has played GTA for a while, I\'m intrested to know how my\nplaystation will deal with this, as I can regularly crash it playing a\nfew hours of GTA VC without dying.\n<span style="font-style:italic"><br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">And what do I think?</span>\n<br>\n\n<br></span>I\'ll be honest, I can see why some people thought Vice City, and\nmost GTA games, were not that great of games. I really enjoyed watching\nGTA games more than I did playing them. It\'s always been that\nsimplistic, physics driven entertainment that comes from being a racing\ngame(loosely defined as a racing game, more like a crashing game). The\nAI was always pretty sloppy, the controls rough to say the least, there\nwasn\'t A LOT of stuff to do besides the missions and some easter egg\nhunts, and the graphics were "so so". Many of us forgave these short\ncomings because the games were huge for their time, the driving was\nfun, and you got to kill stuff in a way no developer ever had the guts\nto try before...putting as many innocent bystanders in the way as\npossible.\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\nAnyways. GTA has always had it\'s good points, and it\'s weak points.\nBut in this build Rockstar improved on everything, the good and the\nsub-standard, in this latest title. Nothing was taken away, as so often\nhappens with newer builds of the same game. The rough bed rock of the\nGTA property has finally been sculpted, after years of reworking and\nimproving the same idea, into a robust, detailed game. The game has\nenough "superficial depth" to keep people playing it....probably til\nthe next GTA comes out Smile. Suffice to say, I\'m pretty damn excited\nabout this one. GTA has been a fall back game for me and my friends\nsince it came out. It looks like San Andreas could be with us for quite\na few years, with all that\'s been added.\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\nIt\'s always good to keep an open, but cautious attitude about games\ntoday. Having said that, Rockstar has never put out a product I didn\'t\nenjoy. The reports about San Andreas are coming in, and the way the\ngame has changed, yet stayed the same, is blowing my mind. It\'s\ngoodness, backed by super double goodness. I\'m pumped for this game. As\nI\'m sure every censor in the country is.\n<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\nA little verse, to get people into the spirit of GTA...\n<span style="font-style:italic"><br>\n\n<br>Die mutha f******,\n<br>\nDie mutha f******,\n<br>\nSteel <span style="font-size:9px">steal</span> foo!</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThanks for reading.<br>\n<br>\nJustin "Nenjin" Wheeler<br>\nSafehouse Staff Writer<br>\n</span>';

<br>
Developer: Rockstar Games
<br>
Genre: 3rd Person Action
<br>
Release: October 26th 2004
<br>
Platforms: PS2, Xbox, PC(2005) 
<br>

<br>
I'm fairly sure there isn't one person with a tv or computer in America
that hasn't heard about Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto by now. The newest
installment in the GTA series is due to release in just a few days, and
there is a lot to talk about...
<br>

<br>Briefly, Grand Theft Auto started as a 2d, top down shoot em up
game, where you ran around and stole cars, plowed into innocent
bystanders, tangled with police, and generally broke every law you
could.. After Grand Theft Auto 2 gained niche popularity and success
with the addition of gang warfare and some new mechanics, Rockstar
broke off into the realm of 3d gaming, and created a 3 dimensional 3rd
person action/driving game, that was noted for it's free form style of
play, and it's emphasis on a virtual world. After Grand Theft Auto 3
proved to be a massive commericial success, Rockstar built upon the
concept and success of GTA3, adding new features, new themes, and new
mechanics to the already existing framework of GTA3. It was an even
bigger success. Rockstar has again decided to push their abilities to
the limit, and to capitalize on what has worked in the past, in their
work on GTA: San Andreas.
<br>

<br>This is one of 2 articles I'll be writing for GTA:SA. In this
article I'll be covering what's different about GTA:SA from previous
titles, and what Rockstar has added on, or improved on. And holy crap,
have they added on to it... In my next article, I'll give my
impressions on the game after cracking out on it for hours with
friends.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">What's the same?</span>
<br>

<br>Everything really. The classic framework of GTA3 and up is still
there. A 3rd person(capable of 1st person) 3-d graphic city, replete
with people, police, gangs, traffic(oh the traffic), radio stations in
the car, and on. The game is still very free form in play, with
missions providing scripted content. You'll still be able to buy
property, store cars, collect guns, ect...There is nothing from the
other GTA titles that isn't in San Andreas.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">So what's different already!!!</span>
<br>

<br>
Well...everything really. For readability sake, I'll break it down into the most major points.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">WORLD</span>
<br>

<br>San Andreas, unlike GTA3 and GTA: Vice City, isn't just one city,
or two cities. It's a whole state. There are 3 major cities, and a
multitude of smaller communities. The cities are connected by major
interstate roads, and the townships by smaller, more local dirt
roads(anyone wanna go for a country cruise? mwhahaha). There are corn
fields, oceans, and just about every locale from GTA:VC, plus a few
more. Each country community is different, with it's own style, norms,
and behaviors. The different cultural groups within the cities are
distinct and unique from each other(many landscapes and areas in San
Andreas are almost identical copies of San Francisco). China Town being
distinct from the Haight-Ashbury look alike section(named Hashbury).
Just how much bigger is San Andreas than Vice City? The estimate is 5
to 6 times larger. Reports are that it takes 15+ minutes to cross the
entire state. I'm not sure huge is an appropriate description. !@#$
huge sounds better. GTA:SA will make more use of the z-axis than any
other GTA to date, with a mountain in game standing well over a half
mile(relative) in height, complete with steep windy roads perfect for
reckless driving.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">STORY</span>
<br>

<br>In the other 2 3d Grand Theft Auto titles, you played white guys.
Both mafioso looking fellas from New York. In GTA:SA, you play CJ, a
brother from the city of Los Santos, who escaped gang violence and a
deteoriorating life. He returns when he hears his mother is dying, his
family iis collapsing, and everything is going to poop. On his way back
to Los Santos, CJ is framed by 2 corrupt policemen, and so the game
begins. Little bit different than starting out as a thug with orders to
set up a crime ring, eh?
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">RPG ASPECTS</span>
<br>

<br>In other GTA games, you just collected stuff. You bought weapons,
bought property, stored vehicles there, bought a new track suit. But
you never really grew as a character, as an identity. Rockstar has
brought many decidely RPG-ish mechanics to GTA: SA. A whole freaking
crap load, to be exact.
<br>

<br>

<br>In GTA:SA, the main character CJ will have a myriad of traits to
"work on", that impact gameplay in a significant way. All of these
skills work on use based system, where the more you use it, the better
it gets.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Gun play</span> is broken up into
weapon types, that you have a rating in. The more you use the weapon
type, the better you get. Weapons have 6 aspects that you can improve
in. Reload time, accuracy, rate of fire, weapon techniques and dual
weapon use. Weapon techniques are weapon specific traits that appear as
you learn the weapon, like moving and firing, or faster strafing. Dual
Weapon use is a skill that CJ may eventually learn.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Physical Traits</span> are important
too. First off, CJ will have to eat in San Andreas. If he doesn't, he
will lose weight, grow skinny, be weaker in combat, have less
stamina....even his CLOTHING will fit different. The reverse is true.
You can eat junkfood non stop and become portly, slowing your reaction
time, making you pause to catch your breath, as well as making you a
bigger target for gun fire! Each piece of food in game has an actual
caloric value, so that steak will make you gain weight quickly in large
amounts, where as fish and chicken won't so much. But don't worry, you
can work off those pounds! There are gyms all over San Andreas where
you can work out, and buff CJ up, making him physically tougher. He'll
do more damage with his fists, run faster for longer periods of time,
and take more damage.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Action traits</span> also require
work to improve. Running, while burning calories, trains your max level
of stamina. Your ability to swim,(yes SWIMMING, more on this later)
gets better the more you do it. Just about everything you can "do" in
San Andreas is tied to an invisible skill that is getting better the
more you do it.
<br>

<br>From what I've read, it's not just as simple as "don't be fat,
dont't starve, buff up". Skinny guys run faster, react quicker, but are
fragile, and have llittle stamina. Larger guys can take more abuse,
have more stamina, but are slower to react and in movement. Rockstar is
claiming there are different "builds" you can put together, so maybe
you are a skinny gun fighting thug, or a big hulking martial arts
master, or a giant kingpin kinda guy. Up to you and how you play, so
they claim.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">INTERACTING WITH THE ENVIROMENT</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Swimming... </span>I've waited 2
whole GTA titles for a gangster that could freakin swim. Rockstar has
finally heard my and other's pleas. CJ can swim in San Andreas, and not
just simple floating on the surface and paddling along.There are
multiple kinds of strokes and manuevers to help you get around in the
water, provided you have the stamina and the skill. But wait, Rockstar
cared so much about swimming, they allowed CJ to dive underneath the
surface, and swim among the fishes! Your lung capacity is a function of
your overall fitness level. By all accounts, Rockstar has paid just as
much attention to what lies above the water in San Andreas, as what
lies below, so expect there to be reasons to go for a swim.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Climbing</span> is another feature
new to the Grand Theft Auto line up. To what extent it goes to, I don't
really know. The information I've read describes climbing over shipping
crates to sneak up on people(more on that later hahaha), so we at least
know it plays some part in the game.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Carjacking</span> gets a facelift too
in SA, where many of the victims will struggle and fight you, requiring
you to "convince" them your need is greater.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">VEHICLES</span>
<br>

<br>
While the list of known "types" of cars isn't that huge, San Andreas brings new kinds of vehicles to the game.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Bicycles..</span>.BMX bikes to be
exact. The are operated by using 2 buttons to run the pettles. CJ gains
proficiency in riding a bike, as it is a skill, and will enjoy
increased handling, better fall recovery, and more responsive controls
the more he rides it. He can preform specialized stunts and insane
stunts on the BMXs as well.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">New vehicles</span> include things
like 4 wheelers, 4x4 trucks, Semi-Tractor Trailers, Fuel Tanker
Trucks(FULL OF FUEL), Trolleys, Combines, and a few others. But what
makes all these new vehicles so cool is...
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Vehicle Specific Physics.</span> Much
work has gone into recreating the actual physics for each vehicle as it
relates to the terrain, handling, hang time(hehe), and collisions. 4
cylinders aren't good for getting up 55 degree inclines, massive heavy
suspension trucks don't go all that fast on the highway. The vehicle
physics of San Andreas reflects that. 4 wheelers have a lower center of
gravity, and handles differently than an Isuzu, and the engine reflects
that. So expect that Semi to jack knife like a semi. Expect that
hatchback econo car to corner like one. Expect the super expensive hot
rods to handle the way they should.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Vehicle continuity</span> is
something most GTA players don't really consider. In my experience,
vehicles in GTA are meant to be driven at top speed, everywhere, til
they blow up. They are best used as battering rams, all the time. In SA
however, vehicles don't just get damaged. They get dirty if you drive
it through the neighbor's lawn, or through the park. If you don't take
dirty cars to the car wash, they rust. If they rust, they break easier.
Bullet holes remain in the body til you get it fixed. Vehicles in San
Andres can be disposable, or maintained, depending on your preferance.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Nitrous Oxide</span> also makes it
way into GTA for the first time. GTA has never really been that "fast"
of a game, compared to say, Need For Speed.
<br>But reports are that San Andreas achieves that "blinding" level of
speed, which makes me all weak in the knees just thinking about it. Not
all cars have NOS of course, but you can put have it installed at one
of the Auto Shops around town if it qualifies... Did I say you can put
stuff on cars? Hrm...
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">CUSTOMIZABILITY</span>
<br>

<br>In the other GTA games, the amount of customization you were
allowed was what gun you carried, and in Vice City, a meager selection
of outfits.
<br>
In San Andreas, Rockstar is ready to blow your mind with what you can do to yourself.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Clothing</span> gets so much more
attention in San Andreas. We're not talking "a track suit", "a cop
uniform", "a leisure suit". We're talkin basketball jerseys, multiple
basketball jerseys. We're talking wife beaters, t-shirts, pimp suits,
gang colors, jeans, basketball shoes, sports equipment, and ON. And of
course you can buy yourself some BLING. Not only are there different
types of clothing, but different BRANDS of clothing. Multiple
accessories to go along with your threads...I've no doubt only
scratched the surface with what I've mentioned here.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Haircuts</span> range from bald, to afros, to corn rows, and other unique styles.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Tattoos</span> are also included, from gang mottos and logos, old englishscript, to straight up biker tattoos.
<br>

<br>You might be asking by this point...why all the focus on buying
yourself stuff and playing dress up, other than the obvious? Because it
all has a real impact on the game. More on that in a sec, one last
thing I wanna talk about.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Customizing Vehicles</span> is
another one of those things GTA players have wanted to do forever. And
it is our day. There are multiple mechanics around town that specialize
in pimping out your ride. Each speciializes in doing a certain kind of
car, like making a phat low-rider, a sic import racer, or a dope SUV
with 21"s. I'm not sure if all the work you can do is cosmetic or not,
but you can put NOS on the thing! Who cares about about engine work,
strap that thing up and lets DRIVE! HAHAHA!!!!... Sorry. Anyways, you
can paint it up, add graphics, rims, spoilers, bumpers, do custom paint
combinations, and on. I guess this means I'll have to mind my
driving...nah screw it, granny 60 points, 12' oclock!
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">THE PEOPLE AND THE AI</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">People</span> in GTA games usually
react to what you DO, not who you ARE. Which was fine for the most
part. But Rockstar wanted to take it a step further, to get NPCs to
react to the way you dress, your hair cut, your car, you're tatoos,
you're weight, your prowess...and they did. All the clothing and
customization choices, the physical choices you make, affect how people
react to you. They might call you fat, or cower in fear of what you
could do to them. They may buddy up to you, or try to put a cap in your
ass. Gang colors will set off certain gangs, and police will much more
readily identify and harass you with notable gang colors on. It's
funny, GTA seems to be doing something Fable and Bluebox tried for 4
years to pull off. But the NPC AI also got a face lift in another area,
detection. Previously, enemies knew you were there because the script
said so. You've got 5 stars, every cop knows where you are...you're on
a mission and all these banditos know exactly where you're coming
from....In San Andreas, NPC AI will rely on sound and visual checks to
find and detect the player...this allows for a few new ways to play GTA
that weren't possible in earlier builds.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">The Fuzz</span> in GTA games, or the
bad guy AI, has always been brutal, predictable, and easily avoided and
undermined. Even when they got tire spikes, helicopters dropping swat
teams,, tanks, the FBI and the army, the AI was never really smart or
challenging. It was more lethal in an uncoordinated and over the top
way. Rockstar has made some changes to the AI, so that now cops will do
things like shoot at you from their vehicle, whenever they can. People
will duck behind cover to fight instead of just standing there blasting
you. The Helicopters won't give up the chase just because an alley
looks like a tight squeeze for it to fit through. Motorcycle riders
will have figured out they can shoot from the vehicle too.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">The gangs</span> are another part of
the GTA player wish-list that finally got noticed. "Gangs" before San
Andreas consisted of guys who stood around your buildings, wouldn't get
mad if you killed them, packed heat, and had some pretty terrible AI.
That was pretty much it. In San Andreas, you will be able to to recruit
members to your gang, and choose a select number(reports say 3) to join
you. They will follow you around, react to threats, and while your
driving around, do drivebys while you man the wheel! What are homies
for!
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Hand-to-hand</span> combat has been
spruced up from the Vice City Version as well. There are multiple
combat "stances" CJ can take, which will allow him attack moves. These
moves can be comboed together to create other attacks. These
combinations must be learned from different dojos in the city, where
you will choose what attacks you wish to learn...and you'll get to
practice them beating the crap out of your sensei in sparing matches.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">The targeting system</span> has also
undergone a few changes. When using the R1 button to auto target, CJ
will first target hostile NPCs. If there are none, he will target the
nearest NPC. If there are no npcs period around, R1 takes you
automatically to 1st person perspective aiming. In this mode, the game
can be played like a 1st person shooter, with the left stick moving you
forward, left, right and back, while the right stick controls your
look. Should be intresting to see how this game plays as a FPS. The
game can still be played exactly the way you are used to in other GTA
games.
<br>ALL weapons can autolock on to targets in SA, unlike previous
titles. And yes, you can shoot more than one gun out the window of your
car. Which guns exactly I'm not sure.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Stealth attacks</span> are also a new
additon. Rockstar is the same company that produced the brutal,
vicious, and graphic game Manhunt, which focused on stealthing up to
your enemies and attacking them from behind for instant kills. San
Andreas uses a limited version of this where CJ can stand in shadows,
or duck behind objects to avoid NPC's attentions. After slowly sneaking
up on NPCs(because they can hear!) when CJ is close enough, he'll shift
his weapon to a new position, and you can silently dispatch your enemy.
If you sneak up on an opponent with a silenced weapon, your shot will
be a killing one.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">GRAPHICS</span>
<br>

<br>
The engine for GTA, while tried
and true, has constantly evolved with each new title. San Andreas is no
different, and it is pushing what the engine(and my tired ass PS2) is
capable of. The console versions of GTA 3 and VC made generous use of
vertex and edge blurring to save the frame rate during busy periods.
And GTA for the consoles wasn't even that high a resolution to begin
with. Rockstar has cranked up San Andreas in virtually all areas. Real
time shadows, real time reflections, around 25% more polygons on the
screen at one time, and an increased draw distance allowing for more
spectacular views, of which San Andreas will have many. Coming from
someone who has played GTA for a while, I'm intrested to know how my
playstation will deal with this, as I can regularly crash it playing a
few hours of GTA VC without dying.
<span style="font-style:italic"><br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">And what do I think?</span>
<br>

<br></span>I'll be honest, I can see why some people thought Vice City, and
most GTA games, were not that great of games. I really enjoyed watching
GTA games more than I did playing them. It's always been that
simplistic, physics driven entertainment that comes from being a racing
game(loosely defined as a racing game, more like a crashing game). The
AI was always pretty sloppy, the controls rough to say the least, there
wasn't A LOT of stuff to do besides the missions and some easter egg
hunts, and the graphics were "so so". Many of us forgave these short
comings because the games were huge for their time, the driving was
fun, and you got to kill stuff in a way no developer ever had the guts
to try before...putting as many innocent bystanders in the way as
possible.
<br>


<br>
Anyways. GTA has always had it's good points, and it's weak points.
But in this build Rockstar improved on everything, the good and the
sub-standard, in this latest title. Nothing was taken away, as so often
happens with newer builds of the same game. The rough bed rock of the
GTA property has finally been sculpted, after years of reworking and
improving the same idea, into a robust, detailed game. The game has
enough "superficial depth" to keep people playing it....probably til
the next GTA comes out Smile. Suffice to say, I'm pretty damn excited
about this one. GTA has been a fall back game for me and my friends
since it came out. It looks like San Andreas could be with us for quite
a few years, with all that's been added.
<br>


<br>
It's always good to keep an open, but cautious attitude about games
today. Having said that, Rockstar has never put out a product I didn't
enjoy. The reports about San Andreas are coming in, and the way the
game has changed, yet stayed the same, is blowing my mind. It's
goodness, backed by super double goodness. I'm pumped for this game. As
I'm sure every censor in the country is.
<br>


<br>

A little verse, to get people into the spirit of GTA...
