Halo proved\nto be a smash hit with most Xbox gamers everywhere, and the masses\neagerly awaited the second installment of Bungie\'s universe on the\nbrink of oblivion. After nearly 2 years of waiting, Bungie didn\'t want\nto disappoint, nor did they...totally. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">So what\'s different about Halo 2 from the original?</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nMostly gameplay mechanics. The classic format of Halo gameplay is still\nthe same. Large levels, tons of enemies. More on that in a bit. The\nmajority of differences are additions to the familiar combat style of\nHalo, new weapons, and vehicles. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">GUNS</span>\n<br>\nAll the weapons except for 2 make a return in Halo 2, plus quite a few\nnew ones. Essentially, Bungie balanced the weapon sets by race, so that\nnow the Covenant and the USMC all have comprable weapons. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Particle Beam Rifle-</span>\n<br>\nThe Covenant equivalent of the Sniper Rifle. Works on plasma\ntechnology, where more than 2 or 3 rapid shots cause the weapon to over\nheat. 5x and 10x zoom, with minimum recoil. A very nice weapon.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Carbine-</span>\n<br>\nA single shot, decent ROF weapon with a 2x zoom. The basic equivalent of the USMC Battle Rifle\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Fuel Rod Gun-</span>\n<br>Different from the one that appeared in Halo for the PC, the Fuel\nRod Cannon fires a large mortar-type radioactive burst. It has a high\nrate of fire, and works on plasma technology, overheating if fired too\nmuch. The rounds it fires are far less explosive than they were in\noriginal Halo. It serves as the Covenant equivalent to the rocket\nlauncher. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Brute Plasma Rifle-</span>\n<br>\nAn exact duplicate of the Elite Plasma Rifle, except that it\'s red. To\ndate I can\'t really tell if it\'s "better" than the Elite Plasma Rifle\nor not.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Brute Shot-</span>\n<br>A single shot grenade launcher, which while having very little\nsplash damage, deals a large amount of focused damage to whatever it\ndirectly impacts. Ricochetes off of walls. Unfortunately, the small 12\nround max ammo capacity makes this weapon only very effective in the\nhands of the enemy AI. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Energy Sword-</span>\n<br>\nBy far my most favorite new weapon. It is a meele weapon, which will\ncut down most enemies in one to two hits. What makes the Sword so\nspectacular is, when you are within a certain distance of your\nopponent(approxiamately 10 to 15 feet), and your targeting reticle is\nresting over your enemy, your next attack will cause you to leap them,\ndelivering a powerful killing blow. This makes the energy sword ideal\nfor leaping/diving attacks, as you can cover the ground between you and\nyour opponent in a flash, cutting them down before they can fire on\nyou. The energy sword is truely a pleasure to wield. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Battle Rifle</span>\n<br>\nThe half succesor to the standard Assault Rifle from Halo 1, the Battle\nRifle fires a 3 shot burst(and only a 3 shot burst) with incredible\naccuracy and very respectable damage. Supports a 2x scope for precision\naiming and limited sniping. This is one of the standard marine issue\nweapons.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Submachine Gun</span>\n<br>The other half succesor the Assault Rifle(which is not included in\nHalo 2), the SMG is fully automatic, emptying it\'s 60 round clip in\njust a few seconds. Good for spraying an opponent with ridiculous\namounts of fire. Can be dual wielded. Unfortunately, the SMG has an\natrocious amount of recoil; when you are wielding two at the same time,\nyour aim will shoot straight towards the ceiling when firing full auto.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Magnum</span>\n<br>The succesor to the Sniper Pistol(which also doesn\'t not make an\nappearance in Halo 2). I rarely use this weapon. It has an extremely\nhigh ROF, as fast as you can pull the trigger, decent accuracy, good\ndamage. but, the 12 round clip is severly limiting, and the pistol has\nno zoom feature. A weapon of last resort in my opinion. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">VEHICLES</span>\n<br>\nA few new pilotable vehicles make an appearance in Halo 2, including a\nnew variant type Warthog. More importantly, all vehicles have had\nupdated controls and physics which are slightly different from the\norignal Halo.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Physics-</span>\n<br>All Covenant vehicles now have a boost feature. Using the left\ntrigger, Covenant vcehicles will give an extra burst of speed. Some\nvehicles this is a momentary burst of thrust, like the Wraith Tank and\nthe Spectre. Others like the Ghost and Banshee can maintain this thrust\nas a constant cruising speed. Warthogs handle differently now as well.\nPreviously, you could fishtail the warthog simply by turning sharply\nwhile accelrating. Now, the left trigger works as an emergency brake,\nwhich will cause the Warthog to fishtail on command.\n<br>\n\n<br> All vehicles now have "health", and can be destroyed. However,\nvehicles can take an insane amount of damage from small arms fire, and\na healthy amount of damage from large ordinances. One of the best parts\nabout the new vehicle damage is the way your vehicles visually reflect\nthe damage. When you are shooting at a Banshee and hit it\'s wing, the\nwing is actually blown off. When your Warthog gets hit with a missle,\nfires break out all over the vehicle. When your Ghost takes a direct\nfront impact, the front armor plating gets blasted off. And every\nvehicles goes "boom" when it dies, leaving a charred husk behind. I\nfound this new aspect of vehicles to be a welcomed addition to Halo,\ncompared to the previous lack of visual damage, and the indestructable\nplayer vehicles like tanks and Warthogs. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Wraith Tank-</span>\n<br>\nPlayers can now pilot the Wraith Tanks. They fire&nbsp; large, explosive\nplasma mortars, which has a (in my opinion ridiculously) high rate of\nfire. It supports one pilot and no passengers, and makes use of a\nsingle, 4 second delay burst of speed. I don\'t think I need to tell you\nexperienced Halo players how much destruction you can cause with this\nbad boy.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Spectre Transport-</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>A wholly new vehicle to Halo, this vehicle supports one pilot, one\ngunner manning the Plasma Turret on back(basically a plasma machine\ngun), and 2 passengers on the wing. Has the same thruster make up as\nthe Wraith Tank. While not of much use in the single player/coop\ncampaign, this is a great vehicle for multiplayer. Between the Plasma\nCannon, and your two wing passengers, this thing can decimate an\nunprepared enemy.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Banshee-</span>\n<br>While not wholly new to Halo, it has been(again in my opinon)\nsignificantly revamped from Halo 1. It is now both playable in the\ncampaign, and in multiplayer maps. The big changes to the Banshee are\nin handling. First off, the Banshee has a constant thrust available on\nthe left trigger, so you can cruise at high speed indefinetly.\nSecondly, by using the A Button in conjuction with the left thumbstick,\nthe Banshee will preform aerial tricks like loop-dee-loops, and\nsideways barrel rolls. But I think the biggest changes comes in how you\nmanuever the Banshee in regular flight. Previously in Halo, the Banshee\ncould be made to hover virtually motionless by holding back on the left\nthumbstick. This made it ideal for hovering over people or vehicles and\nannihilating them with impunity. This isn\'t really possible anymore.\nWhen operating the Banshee, it will hover, just by simply not touching\nthe thumb sticks. But the Banshee will slowly lose altitude while you\ndo this, meaning you cannot hang in the air anymore, and must\nconstantly reposition yourself for attack. Holding back on the left\nthumbstick will(much to my irratation) cause the Banshee to rapidly\nlose altitude. Lastly, the Banshee no longer cuts the tight turns it\nused to. Anyone that has played Multi-player on Halo PC with Banshees\nwill tell you, Banshee combat wasn\'t that much fun. Previously, because\nBanshees could fly in a tight spiral, dog fights consisted of 2 players\nflying circles around each other and hitting virtually nothing. Now,\nthe Banshee turns in a much wider arc, so it\'s much harder to fly\naround and around and around each other. Dog fights now have much more\nto do with evasive manuevers, using the A Button, or strafing the\nBanshee. Lastly, while the Banshee still has the Fuel Rod Gun attached\nto it, it is no longer usable in multi-player, only in the Campaign\nmode. All in all, I was pleased with the changes made to the Banshee.\nThey are even more fun to fly than they were in Halo 1.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Gauss Rifle Warthog-</span>\n<br>While the vehicle is just a standard Warthog, there is nothing\nstandard about the weapon. The Gauss Rifle is, argueably, one of the\nbest weapons in the game. It has a 100% effective range, meaning it\ndoes as much damage at max range as it does at point blank. It fires an\ninstantaenous electro-magnetically propelled bullet, which explodes on\nimpact. The Gauss Rifle makes short work of infantry and armor alike,\nkilling most people in two shots, and most vehicles in 3 to 4. The\ndecent single shot ROF and instant delivery of the ordinance makes this\na powerful, powerful weapon in the hands of a skilled gunner. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">AI</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI can defintely say the AI is more challegning in Halo 2 than before.\nProbably because the enemy has more options that it used to.\nPreviously, enemies usually funneled towards your position in a big\npack, making them easy targets for grenades. They wouldn\'t back each\nother up, fighting like individuals, and didn\'t position themselves to\nany advantage. Most of that is different now. Enemies on all AI\nsettings have the tendency to spread out and flank your position, so\nwhile you are playing with one elite, 2 more are coming up behind you.\nEnemies love cover, and they all use it constantly. Most of all, they\nknow how to focus their fire. Pop your head up at the wrong time, and\nthe combined fire power of your enemies will leave you dead,&nbsp; wondering what\njust happened. The flood especially benefited from this upgraded AI.\nTypically the flood appear from vents, grates, and any dark hole out\nthere. So it\'s common to expect the flood to try to surround you based\non how they spawn. Now, the flood purposefully move around your positon\nto get you from behind, which on heroic means one hit, one kill from\ntheir meele. Now that the flood come armed with energy swords,\nshields(yes, shields) as well as all the weapons you can use, they are\nprobably one of the more challenging parts of the game. Thankfully, the\nShotguns and Energy Swords are not far away, and they make short work\nof the flood. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">GAME MECHANICS</span>\n<br>\nBungie has added here and there to the mechanics of Halo, not only to\nprovide a new "cool factor" to the game, but also to increase your\ntactical options in game.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Dual Wielding-</span>\n<br>Touted as one of the "big" features of Halo 2, it\'s pretty self\nexplanatory, at least on paper. While you can still only really carry 2\ndifferent weapons, if one of those weapons is one handed, you can dual\nwield a "third" weapon. I quoted it because it really doesn\'t count\ntowards your total supply of weapons. You can wield that third weapon\nup until the point you meele something or switch weapons. While dual\nwielding does allow you to either double your fire power, or use two\ndifferent kinds of weapons at the same time, it does have significant\ndraw backs. Firstly, you can\'t throw grenades while dual wielding. It\nmay not seem big at first, but most veteran players know that grenades\nare the life blood of good Halo games. Secondly, your reload times(if\nyou need to reload your particular weapon) are doubled when you dual\nwield, which can be a serious problem when someone has a gun pointed at\nyou. And lastly, when firing both weapons at the same time, weapon\nrecoil increases. While you don\'t notice it with most weapons, it\'s\npainfully obvious with dual SMGs.\n<br>\n\n<br>At first, dualwielding seems a little confusing as you get used to\nusing the Y Button to switch weapons AND dual wield them. But once you\npick it up, you\'ll come to love this feature, as you run in two guns\nblazing, throw one down, lob a grenade right at your opponents, scoop\nup your other gun and keep blazing away. I was pleased with how smartly\nbalanced dual wielding is against using a single weapon. Both have\ntheir advantages and disadvantages, and the victor is still usually the\none with more skill. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Vehicle Pirating(Yar)-</span>\n<br>\nAnother one of those features that I couldn\'t have been happier about.\nPreviously, you had to outright kill someone in Halo to get their\nvehicle, or in the case of Ghosts and Warthogs, they had to roll it.\nNow, when you are a next to a vehicle that is moving at other than full\nspeed, you will be prompted to hold the x button. The screen will pan\naway to show you your character, as you climb over the front, back, or\nside of the vehicle and smack your opponent from the seat. In the case\nof the Wraith and Scorpion tanks, you will see your character climb\nonto the hatch of the vehicle. Then you\'ll be prompted to mash the\nmeele button, which causes your character to beat away at the hatch(and\neventually at the juicy, exposed cranium of your opponent). Once the\nhatch is gone, you can either keep smashing, or you can chuck a grenade\ndown the hatch, killing the driver and(if you want) disabling the\nvehicle very quickly. Just so you know, the AI opponents can do the\nsame to you, ripping you from your vehicle if you don\'t keep moving. I\nthink this is a great feature. It really adds to the whole "sensation"\nof the fight, and it\'s a great tactical option. Now, you can snipe your\nopponent from his vehicle, blow the whole thing to kingdom-come, or\nclimb over the front up close and personal, all gung ho style. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Player Life and Shields-</span>\n<br>\nShields remain the same as they did in Halo 1. However, players no\nlonger have a "life". Once your shields are depleted, you can take a\nfew hits, but not many, before you die. Once your shields are back up,\nyou can take the same "amount" of damage again when your shields are\ndown again. This really forces you to take cover when your shields are\ndown, as you don\'t really know how close you are to death. The days of\ncharging a group of enemies and laying waste to all of them with a\nsliver of life left are over. Once your shields are gone, if you aren\'t\nin cover, you are pretty much already dead. I\'m not sure how I feel\nabout this quite yet. On one hand, I like how it encourages people to\nnot run out there guns blazing, and use a little cover and some\ntactics. On the other hand, I like knowing how close I really am to\ndeath. Still on the fence about this feature. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Player Respawning(co-op)-</span>\n<br>\nThe co-op respawning rules have changed for the better in Halo 2.\nPreviously, if an enemy broke wind within 5 miles of your position, the\ngame would not allow your dead partner to respawn. The restrictions on\nrespawning are much less stringent now(well, sorta, more on this\nlater). No more backtracking through 1/2 the level trying to get your\nfriend back. The criteria for respawn are these. 1) No one can be\nactively firing on you. If you are crouching behind a wall, and someone\nis shooting the front of it, no respawn. 2) Your shields must be\ncharged. If you\'re sitting in a corner trying to get your team mate to\nrespawn, and your shields are damaged, your partner will respawn the\nmoment your shield\'s hit full. As a general rule, the closer an enemy\nblip is on your radar, the less chance there is your player will\nrespawn. This is not set in stone however. Multiple times playing one\nof us would die, and the other would retreat hoping for respawn,\nthinking we were screwed, only to leave the other standing in a room\nfull of enemies taking fire. If you can manage to find a quiet place\nfor at least 5 to 6 seconds, you can usually get the other player to\nrespawn. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Active Camoflague-</span>\n<br>\nWhen playing as the covenant, your flashlight button turns on "active\ncamoflague", which gives you Predator like invisibility. It lasts for\nabout 8 seconds, until you are damaged or you attack. It then has a 15\nsecond cool down. This little bonus is GREAT for the campaign play.\nWhen combined with the power sword, you can litterally kill a whole\nroom full of enemies before they even know what hit them. It\'s just the\nlittle edge that make the Covenant cool, without being ridiculously\nover powered. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Difficulty Settings-</span>\n<br>\nHalo 2 still makes use of the familiar Easy, Standard, Heroic,\nLegendary difficulties. My friend and I started the game on normal, and\nrestarted a few levels later on Heroic seeking a greater challenge. We\nwere not disappointed. A little history first. In Halo, Legendary was\nwhere the AI got sneaky, flanked you, was dead accurate with it\'s\ngrenades, and had higher than normal shield capacity, and life. Well,\nthat\'s heroic in Halo 2. While not impossible, it requires you to be on\nyour game. Your enemies are as ruthless as they are tough. Covenant\nSnipers will pin you behind cover, and due to the extra damage they\nrecieve(or the weaker shields you have), one direct hit from them will\nusually kill you. The little bastard grunts are a real nightmare on\nheroic, because while you are busy dealing with the elites and all the\ndifficult enemies, there is a grunt, somewhere, lining up a plasma\ngrenade directly on you. Most of the time you won\'t even see it til\nit\'s too late. It\'s not uncommon to poke your head around a corner, or\na box, and see three grunts launching plasma grenades straight at you\nwith unnerving accuracy. And this is just heroic.\n<br>\n\n<br>Legendary is truely for the hardcore in Halo 2. In Halo 1, you\ncould slowly win legendary as a war of attrition on co-op, having one\nplayer die while the other holds back, killing an enemy or two at a\ntime. No more. Now when one of you dies in legendary co-op, it\'s back\nto the check point.\n<br>I can\'t describe how hard the AI is in Legendary, it surpasses\nreasonable descriptions. It throws grenades at near impossible\ntrajectories, elites take entire clips of ammo just to drain their\nshields, and there are more enemies than in Heroic. The AI is so\nastute, it will shoot you throw a mere spec of gap in cover, pinning\nyou down under a barrage of laser fire. Sound easy? It would be, if it\nweren\'t also for the fact that your shields are also reduced in\neffectiveness, where 4, count them 4, individual plasma rifle round\nwill elimnate them completely. My friend and I, with litterally\nhundreds of hours played in Halo, couldn\'t even get past the first\nlevel after 45 minutes of trying. It was just simply impossible to stay\nalive. Truely, utterly hardcore. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Multi-player-</span>\n<br>\nI haven\'t played much multiplayer as of right now, I was more focused\non beating the campaign. I have previewed all the maps though, and I\ncan tell you they are twice as complex as your standard Halo\nmultiplayer level. There are a few of them that are HUGE, big enough to\ncomfortably house 16 players. Your Multiplayer profile is highly\ncustomizable, with multiple color settings for your Master Chief or\nCovenant Elite, and banners which you can arrange and color how you\nwant. I haven\'t played any of the game types yet either except slayer,\nbut they seem to be the standard run of types from Halo 1, like\nPhantom, Juggernaut, Oddball, CTF, Assault, and on. Anyways, just based\non the Campaign, I can tell you Multiplayer is going to rock just as\nhard, if not harder, than Halo 1. (Update: And is does. Even though I\nno longer play on Xbox live, Multi-player Halo is awesome. Even more so\nnow that they\'ve fixed a lot of the incredibly devious cheat bugs.)<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">THE NITTY GRITTY</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Gameplay-</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI thoroughly enjoyed Halo 2\'s gameplay. It is essentially Halo v2.0.\nThis is both a good, and a bad thing. Halo 1\'s big problem was that\nlevels, while big, were extremely repetitive, almost insultingly so.\nSure, there were litterally hundreds of enemies to kill, but levels all\nblended into a haze of tunnles, rooms, bridges, with the occasional\nhandcrafted scene here and there. It\'s obvious that Bungie was aware of\nthis. The levels are in Halo 2 are less monotonous(notice I said less,\ninstead of not). Here\'s how it works. You enter a room, a valley,\nwhatever. You fight multiple "waves" of enemies, where there is usually\nthe first wave standing around, then the second, third, and other waves\nwill run in from other passage ways, from behind you, above you, ect..\nRinse, repeat this recipe about 10 or 15 times and you have a level. To\nBungie\'s credit, this time around they took to the time to actually\ndesign their enviroments instead of stamp them from a mold, so the\nmonotony is less apparent than it was in Halo by a long shot. But,\nafter a few levels, you start to pick up on the pattern, and the "sneak\nattacks" stop having so much impact, and you just settle down to\nkill the next wave. The levels aren\'t all exactly like this though.\nBungie added some thematic and epic elements to some of the levels,\nlike chasing down the massive Covenant Scarab Walker and boarding it,\nor cutting the heretic covenant\'s station lose and riding it as it\nplummets down through the sky at 1000 miles per hour(damn that was a\ncool level). Add in some Banshee flying sporadically throughout the levels,\nand there is definetly more to pay attention to in Halo 2 than in Halo\n1. The underlying design still pretty much remains the same though.\n<br>\n\n<br>Being able to play both the Covenant and the USMC turned out to be\npretty cool. Differences in abilties, and what kind of weapons you used\nthroughout the level helped keep the gameplay moving along. Every level\nyou alternate between playing the Master Chief, and seeing his story,\nand playing the failed Covenant General of the original Halo, seeing\nhis story. While the missions of the two don\'t really weave together,\nthe stories eventually do(if poorly...).\n<br>\n\n<br>Another key difference in Halo 2 as compared to Halo 1 is the use\nof weapons. In Halo, playing only as the Master Chief, you tened to use\nmost of the Covenant weapons only as fall back weapons. Marines\nobviously had the advantage in the weapon department, so the Covenant\ngot the advantage in the vehicle department. In Halo 2, you will find\nyourself using just about every weapon in the game at some point. Not\nonly because you will need different weapons for different opponents\nand situations, but because it is nigh impossible to keep finding ammo\nfor the same weapon in a level. The only 2 weapons you will ever be\nguarenteed to find all the time are the plasma pistol and the plasma\nrifle. The max ammo capacity of ALL weapons has been toned down from\nHalo 1, and many weapons you find are 1/2 empty already. All this\nresults in "rummaging" after most fights looking for your ideal weapon,\nor at least a new one. It\'s not uncommon to find yourself near empty in\nthe middle of a fight, and grabbing ANYTHING off the floor to finish\noff your opponent. This isn\'t to say you will have a problem finding a\ngun. There are always weapons laying around. It\'s more a matter of WHAT\nweapons are lying around. That being said, if you really hate\neverything but your Battle Rifle and your SMG, you can always(in a\nnon-legendary co-op game), kill each other to build up your supply of\nammo. Not that it will do you much good, as a full SMG is going to last\nyou about 1 minute into the first fire fight. On the plus side, the\ngame almost always spawns you with grenades, so you don\'t have to go\ninto fights completely out gunned. <br>\n\n<br>\nThere are also boss fights in Halo 2(yea?). Unfortunately, these aren\'t\nvery cool in my opinion. Without spoiling too much of the story, I\'ll\njust say the last boss doesn\'t seem like a final boss in the slightest.\nHe\'s not all that powerful when you get down to it, and basically just\nneeds to be shot about 1000 times. He doesn\'t shoot anything, doesn\'t\ndo a good job of chasing you, and his leaping meele attack is laughably\neasy to avoid. Once you defeat him and find out the game(for now) is\nover, you definetly feel like you didn\'t get your money\'s worth out of\nthe climatic final fight. The boss prior to the final one is more\nchallenging(and much more satisfying to kill), but resembles a "really\nhard normal guy" more than he does a full fledged mega boss. <br>\n\n<br>\nAll told, I think it took me and my friend about 12 to 13 hours to beat\nit on Heroic, with many a reloaded game. All in all(story aside), I\nloved playing the game. It\'s Halo goodness all over again at it\'s core,\nwith well planned and well executed newer features as a bonus. About\nthe only thing the game play fell flat for me was in SOME of the level\ndesigns, like "The Library v2.0", which were reminiscent of the same\nmontonous killing and lack of real effort in level design that people\nassociated with the first Halo.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Theme-</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Ok. It\'s that section of the review again where I start\ncomplaining. Thankfully, it\'s only about the story this time. I\'ll be\nfrank, I play Halo for the gameplay, not the story. The story has\nalways been, to me, a generic ass sci-fi story(that does a great job of\nripping off Warhammer 40K and getting away with it), with some smarmy\ncomments thrown in to keep it funny, and a faceless badass to please\nyour sense of machismo. In Halo 1, there was a consistent(if somewhat\nbland and overly dramatic) storyline that drove the game play. You knew\nwhy you were in the level you were in, why you were doing what you were\ndoing, and who the major players were. The story was, more or less, solid.\n<br>\n\n<br>God I wish that were the case with Halo 2. The first cutscene is\nnice. It artistically constrasts the USMC celebrating their hero\'s </span><span class="postbody">(Master Chief)</span><span class="postbody">\nvicotry over Halo, with the Covenant branding their\nfailed general with the mark of shame for losing Halo. And from there,\nthe story goes down hill. To their credit, Bungie did a good thing\nletting you see what "the enemy" is like. They humanized the Covenant\nwith articulated voice actors, explain their purpose to seeking Halo,\nand introduces you to "The Prophets" who are the driving force behind\nthe Covenant. But then things get all screwy. The story constantly\njumps around from what the Master Chief is doing, to what the Covenant\nGeneral is doing. While the Covenant are attacking earth(Halo 2 pretty\nmuch starts an hour after Halo 1 ended), they are also engaged in a\nbloody civil war within their own ranks, between those that follow the\nProphets, and those that know Halo will destroy everyone near it.....on\ntop of the invasion of the Flood. On top of that, there is the struggle\nto get the Index(key to activating Halo), and the battles involved in\nthat. This all rolls together into a murky, quickly sketched,\nunexplained snarl of a story, where major plot points come and go in\nthe blink of an eye, and you\'re often left going "ok so....what am I\ndoing again?". <br>\n\n<br>\nBut that\'s not my biggest gripe. No, my biggest gripe are the FMV\ncutscenes. First I want to say, yes, they are pretty. Master Chief sure\ndoes look all shiny. But that\'s it. Technicially, the quality of the\nFMVs is very inconsistent, where a big, specular lighted Master Chief\nwill be standing next to a hardly textured lump of something. And my\nreal, true gripe.....the FMV cutscenes are pure fluff. Things like,\nMaster Chief riding a bomb out of a spaceship ala Dr. Strangelove, then\nmiraculously leaping off the bomb back to his own ship. They are show\ncases for the art and skill of Bungie\'s movie people, cut in with just\nenough smart ass dialouge from the seargant to keep your attention. I\nlike a pretty cutscene sure. But I don\'t like people flaunting their\nFMVs when I barely have a handle on the story they presented. If as\nmuch time had gone into the story as the freaking FMVs, Halo would have\npissed off far less people. Or maybe not. While I won\'t spoil the\nending for you, think Matrix: Reloaded, and how much that ending pissed\nyou off. The ending for Halo 2 will make you want to climb up on a MS\nexecutive\'s desk, punch them in the face, and stuff a plasma grenade\ndown their gullet. Suffice to say, Bungie and MS are planning to hump\nthe Halo intellectual property for all it\'s worth, if the ending of the\ngame is an indicator. I can almost smell the Halo 3 hype from here. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Sound-</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nMixed marks from me in this area. Halo 1 stuck out in my mind because\nit included a bunch of really big thematic pieces that were pretty\ngood, using stuff from Gregorian Choir chant, to synthesized music, to\ngood \'ole electric guitar. The music in Halo 2 is even broader. You\nstill have the big swelling, heroic theme piece, slightly altered. You\nstill have the electric guitar(although it breaks off into solos here\nand there and sounds kind funky). You get some hard driving techno\nbeats that will make your sub woofers thump(if you have \'em). You even\nhave more than a few soft emotional pieces on piano. Were Bungie to\noffer a Halo 2 sound track, I\'d call it an ecletic mix at best. Even\nthough the scores are bigger, more dramatic, more swelling than in Halo\n1, I found I liked them less. Probably because Bungie tries to beat you\nover the head with them. The tracks pick up at key points in game play,\nusually when fights break out, and the volume on them is cranked UP. So\nthat you go from light ambient sounds, so a sudden pounding bass\nrythym, or that damn guitar going crazy on the whammy bar. There are\nsome good pieces at work in the game, but to be honest, some of them\nare presented like shit. <br>\n\n<br>\nThere are few familiar sounds from Halo 1. Most of the Covenant speech\nis now in English(spoken by very articulate and proper sounding voice actors),\nas opposed to alien babble. About 1/2 of the weapon sounds are\ndifferent now, in tune with about 1/2 of them being new weapons\naltogether. There are still the familiar ambient elements like the\nMarines belly aching or talking trash, the Covenant mocking you, but in\nmy opinion there is far less of this than there was in the first game,\nand it is far less amusing. Maybe I haven\'t played enough to pick all\nthe voices out, but the Grunts definetly make less noise in Halo 2, and\nthey were my favorite part of the first. Most of smart assing and\n"hoo-rah" stuff comes from the USMC Seargant, who is at least fairly\nfunny. I dunno, I miss the underlying humor of the original Halo. It\nlooks like they are trying to take the theme and the world a little\nmore seriously this time around. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">Graphics-</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI\'m not 100% sure how to describe Halo 2\'s graphics. They are very\ndefinetly still Halo. It\'s hard for me to say if the overall quality of\nthe graphics has improved form Halo 1, but here is what I do notice\nabout them. They\'ve made some real changes to the fauna in game. It is\nfairly sparse, and never comes above waist level. You will be hard\npressed to find an enviroment like the swamps from the 343 Guilty Spark\nlevel, or anything close to it. But there are tons and tons and tons\nmore particles on the screen than you ever got in Halo 1. Between a\nDrop Ship firing 4 Quad Plasma Cannons, 2 Snipers, 3 Grunts with\nNeedlers, and a few Elites with Plasma Rifles, the screen is litterally\na riot of colors and light in combat. The dynamic lighting is pretty good,\nnothing spectacularly realistic like Doom 3, but enough to get the job\ndone. <br>\n\n<br>\nSomething has also been done to the player perspective. Again it\'s one\nof those things I can\'t really put my finger on, but the scale and\nproportion of things on the screen have changed. Some think it better\nreflects the size and scale of things in comparison to the size of the\nMaster Chief, but I disagree. The screen, to this day, feels cramped,\nlike I\'m not getting enough of my peripherial vision in. <br>\n\n<br>\nThere are lots more moveable objects in Halo 2 as well. Barrels you can\nknock over or blow up, pieces of the terrain that you can destroy, all\nthat leave chunky remains all over the place. Combined with bodies\nlaying around, I was fairly impressed at the amount of extra "stuff"\nthe game was able to leave on the screen for long periods of time.\nUsually games phase out debris and corpses quickly to preserve frame\nrates, but they last a considerable amount of time in Halo 2. <br>\n\n<br>\nThe graphics in Halo 2 are constructed from Halo, with improvements.\nThey aren\'t as pixelated in some instances, and things like the water,\nthe sky, reflections and specular lighting are a big improvement. The\ncomplexitiy and depth of enviroment textures is also an improvement. I\nstill can\'t help feeling there is something less in the engine of Halo\n2 than in Halo. I think it really has to do with fauna. Load up Beaver\nCreek map on Halo 2, then load up Battle Creek on Halo 1, and I think\nyou\'ll see what I\'m talking about. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">So what do I think?</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nI think that overall, it\'s a solid game. If you liked Halo, you\'re\ngoing to like Halo 2. If you didn\'t like Halo, chances are, you still won\'t\nlike Halo 2. It\'s not the greatest thing since sliced bread, that\'s for\nsure, but it measured up to about 80% of the hype. The fact the\ncampaign is pretty short is probably what robs Halo 2 of being an\nabsolute smash hit(and the fact *I* could write a more coherent story,\ndrunk and/or otherwise). <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">BY THE NUMBERS:(Out of 10)</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">Theme: 4/10</span>\n<br>\nBetween the overblown FMVs, the bouncy and incomplete story arcs, the\nsurprise plot twists and characters, and the obnoxious lack of an\nending used as a marketing ploy, I was really soured on Halo 2\'s theme.\nNot that I was a big fan before, but I can definetly tell you I\'m not\nwaiting for Halo 3 because I need to know what happens to Master Chief.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">Sound: 7/10</span>\n<br>Some pretty good tracks, a few pretty weak tracks, and a couple\nattempts to be artsy in a game devoted to wasting stuff. Not much drove\nme wild, or insane here, except the volume at which the music decides\nto play during the gameplay.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">Gameplay: 9/10</span>\n<br>I had a great time playing through Halo 2. Soaking up the new\nmechanics, weapons, and vehicles was pure bliss. Halo 2 retains the\nsame white knuckle, seat of your pants combat that you loved from the\nfirst one. Points off for having some of the same pitfalls in design as\nHalo 1, and some very uninspired boss fights. <br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">Graphics: 8.5/10</span>\n<br>\nThe graphics increase was enough to please. Nothing changed drastically\nenough to upset what you normally expect from Halo. Frame rates remain\nconstant and high throughout. Some inconsistency and texture popping\noccasionally spoil an otherwise solid presentation.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">RAGEBRINGERS(Out of 5): 3.5 Daggers </span>\n<br>\n\n<br>\nGood enough to buy. \n<br>\n\n<br>\nThanks for reading. \n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic">"We are picking up on a Covenant\ntransmission.

<br>
Developer: Bungie
<br>
Publisher: Microsoft
<br>
Genre: FPS
<br>
Release: Nov 2004
<br>
Platforms: Xbox, PC(2005)</span>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
For many console gamers out there, the original Halo brought us into a
genre of games that was typically dominated by PC gamers. Halo proved
to be a smash hit with most Xbox gamers everywhere, and the masses
eagerly awaited the second installment of Bungie's universe on the
brink of oblivion. After nearly 2 years of waiting, Bungie didn't want
to disappoint, nor did they...totally. <br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">So what's different about Halo 2 from the original?</span>
<br>

<br>
Mostly gameplay mechanics. The classic format of Halo gameplay is still
the same. Large levels, tons of enemies. More on that in a bit. The
majority of differences are additions to the familiar combat style of
Halo, new weapons, and vehicles. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">GUNS</span>
<br>
All the weapons except for 2 make a return in Halo 2, plus quite a few
new ones. Essentially, Bungie balanced the weapon sets by race, so that
now the Covenant and the USMC all have comprable weapons. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Particle Beam Rifle-</span>
<br>
The Covenant equivalent of the Sniper Rifle. Works on plasma
technology, where more than 2 or 3 rapid shots cause the weapon to over
heat. 5x and 10x zoom, with minimum recoil. A very nice weapon.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Carbine-</span>
<br>
A single shot, decent ROF weapon with a 2x zoom. The basic equivalent of the USMC Battle Rifle
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Fuel Rod Gun-</span>
<br>Different from the one that appeared in Halo for the PC, the Fuel
Rod Cannon fires a large mortar-type radioactive burst. It has a high
rate of fire, and works on plasma technology, overheating if fired too
much. The rounds it fires are far less explosive than they were in
original Halo. It serves as the Covenant equivalent to the rocket
launcher. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Brute Plasma Rifle-</span>
<br>
An exact duplicate of the Elite Plasma Rifle, except that it's red. To
date I can't really tell if it's "better" than the Elite Plasma Rifle
or not.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Brute Shot-</span>
<br>A single shot grenade launcher, which while having very little
splash damage, deals a large amount of focused damage to whatever it
directly impacts. Ricochetes off of walls. Unfortunately, the small 12
round max ammo capacity makes this weapon only very effective in the
hands of the enemy AI. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Energy Sword-</span>
<br>
By far my most favorite new weapon. It is a meele weapon, which will
cut down most enemies in one to two hits. What makes the Sword so
spectacular is, when you are within a certain distance of your
opponent(approxiamately 10 to 15 feet), and your targeting reticle is
resting over your enemy, your next attack will cause you to leap them,
delivering a powerful killing blow. This makes the energy sword ideal
for leaping/diving attacks, as you can cover the ground between you and
your opponent in a flash, cutting them down before they can fire on
you. The energy sword is truely a pleasure to wield. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Battle Rifle</span>
<br>
The half succesor to the standard Assault Rifle from Halo 1, the Battle
Rifle fires a 3 shot burst(and only a 3 shot burst) with incredible
accuracy and very respectable damage. Supports a 2x scope for precision
aiming and limited sniping. This is one of the standard marine issue
weapons.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Submachine Gun</span>
<br>The other half succesor the Assault Rifle(which is not included in
Halo 2), the SMG is fully automatic, emptying it's 60 round clip in
just a few seconds. Good for spraying an opponent with ridiculous
amounts of fire. Can be dual wielded. Unfortunately, the SMG has an
atrocious amount of recoil; when you are wielding two at the same time,
your aim will shoot straight towards the ceiling when firing full auto.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Magnum</span>
<br>The succesor to the Sniper Pistol(which also doesn't not make an
appearance in Halo 2). I rarely use this weapon. It has an extremely
high ROF, as fast as you can pull the trigger, decent accuracy, good
damage. but, the 12 round clip is severly limiting, and the pistol has
no zoom feature. A weapon of last resort in my opinion. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">VEHICLES</span>
<br>
A few new pilotable vehicles make an appearance in Halo 2, including a
new variant type Warthog. More importantly, all vehicles have had
updated controls and physics which are slightly different from the
orignal Halo.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Physics-</span>
<br>All Covenant vehicles now have a boost feature. Using the left
trigger, Covenant vcehicles will give an extra burst of speed. Some
vehicles this is a momentary burst of thrust, like the Wraith Tank and
the Spectre. Others like the Ghost and Banshee can maintain this thrust
as a constant cruising speed. Warthogs handle differently now as well.
Previously, you could fishtail the warthog simply by turning sharply
while accelrating. Now, the left trigger works as an emergency brake,
which will cause the Warthog to fishtail on command.
<br>

<br> All vehicles now have "health", and can be destroyed. However,
vehicles can take an insane amount of damage from small arms fire, and
a healthy amount of damage from large ordinances. One of the best parts
about the new vehicle damage is the way your vehicles visually reflect
the damage. When you are shooting at a Banshee and hit it's wing, the
wing is actually blown off. When your Warthog gets hit with a missle,
fires break out all over the vehicle. When your Ghost takes a direct
front impact, the front armor plating gets blasted off. And every
vehicles goes "boom" when it dies, leaving a charred husk behind. I
found this new aspect of vehicles to be a welcomed addition to Halo,
compared to the previous lack of visual damage, and the indestructable
player vehicles like tanks and Warthogs. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Wraith Tank-</span>
<br>
Players can now pilot the Wraith Tanks. They fire&nbsp; large, explosive
plasma mortars, which has a (in my opinion ridiculously) high rate of
fire. It supports one pilot and no passengers, and makes use of a
single, 4 second delay burst of speed. I don't think I need to tell you
experienced Halo players how much destruction you can cause with this
bad boy.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Spectre Transport-</span>
<br>

<br>A wholly new vehicle to Halo, this vehicle supports one pilot, one
gunner manning the Plasma Turret on back(basically a plasma machine
gun), and 2 passengers on the wing. Has the same thruster make up as
the Wraith Tank. While not of much use in the single player/coop
campaign, this is a great vehicle for multiplayer. Between the Plasma
Cannon, and your two wing passengers, this thing can decimate an
unprepared enemy.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Covenant Banshee-</span>
<br>While not wholly new to Halo, it has been(again in my opinon)
significantly revamped from Halo 1. It is now both playable in the
campaign, and in multiplayer maps. The big changes to the Banshee are
in handling. First off, the Banshee has a constant thrust available on
the left trigger, so you can cruise at high speed indefinetly.
Secondly, by using the A Button in conjuction with the left thumbstick,
the Banshee will preform aerial tricks like loop-dee-loops, and
sideways barrel rolls. But I think the biggest changes comes in how you
manuever the Banshee in regular flight. Previously in Halo, the Banshee
could be made to hover virtually motionless by holding back on the left
thumbstick. This made it ideal for hovering over people or vehicles and
annihilating them with impunity. This isn't really possible anymore.
When operating the Banshee, it will hover, just by simply not touching
the thumb sticks. But the Banshee will slowly lose altitude while you
do this, meaning you cannot hang in the air anymore, and must
constantly reposition yourself for attack. Holding back on the left
thumbstick will(much to my irratation) cause the Banshee to rapidly
lose altitude. Lastly, the Banshee no longer cuts the tight turns it
used to. Anyone that has played Multi-player on Halo PC with Banshees
will tell you, Banshee combat wasn't that much fun. Previously, because
Banshees could fly in a tight spiral, dog fights consisted of 2 players
flying circles around each other and hitting virtually nothing. Now,
the Banshee turns in a much wider arc, so it's much harder to fly
around and around and around each other. Dog fights now have much more
to do with evasive manuevers, using the A Button, or strafing the
Banshee. Lastly, while the Banshee still has the Fuel Rod Gun attached
to it, it is no longer usable in multi-player, only in the Campaign
mode. All in all, I was pleased with the changes made to the Banshee.
They are even more fun to fly than they were in Halo 1.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">USMC Gauss Rifle Warthog-</span>
<br>While the vehicle is just a standard Warthog, there is nothing
standard about the weapon. The Gauss Rifle is, argueably, one of the
best weapons in the game. It has a 100% effective range, meaning it
does as much damage at max range as it does at point blank. It fires an
instantaenous electro-magnetically propelled bullet, which explodes on
impact. The Gauss Rifle makes short work of infantry and armor alike,
killing most people in two shots, and most vehicles in 3 to 4. The
decent single shot ROF and instant delivery of the ordinance makes this
a powerful, powerful weapon in the hands of a skilled gunner. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">AI</span>
<br>

<br>
I can defintely say the AI is more challegning in Halo 2 than before.
Probably because the enemy has more options that it used to.
Previously, enemies usually funneled towards your position in a big
pack, making them easy targets for grenades. They wouldn't back each
other up, fighting like individuals, and didn't position themselves to
any advantage. Most of that is different now. Enemies on all AI
settings have the tendency to spread out and flank your position, so
while you are playing with one elite, 2 more are coming up behind you.
Enemies love cover, and they all use it constantly. Most of all, they
know how to focus their fire. Pop your head up at the wrong time, and
the combined fire power of your enemies will leave you dead,&nbsp; wondering what
just happened. The flood especially benefited from this upgraded AI.
Typically the flood appear from vents, grates, and any dark hole out
there. So it's common to expect the flood to try to surround you based
on how they spawn. Now, the flood purposefully move around your positon
to get you from behind, which on heroic means one hit, one kill from
their meele. Now that the flood come armed with energy swords,
shields(yes, shields) as well as all the weapons you can use, they are
probably one of the more challenging parts of the game. Thankfully, the
Shotguns and Energy Swords are not far away, and they make short work
of the flood. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">GAME MECHANICS</span>
<br>
Bungie has added here and there to the mechanics of Halo, not only to
provide a new "cool factor" to the game, but also to increase your
tactical options in game.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Dual Wielding-</span>
<br>Touted as one of the "big" features of Halo 2, it's pretty self
explanatory, at least on paper. While you can still only really carry 2
different weapons, if one of those weapons is one handed, you can dual
wield a "third" weapon. I quoted it because it really doesn't count
towards your total supply of weapons. You can wield that third weapon
up until the point you meele something or switch weapons. While dual
wielding does allow you to either double your fire power, or use two
different kinds of weapons at the same time, it does have significant
draw backs. Firstly, you can't throw grenades while dual wielding. It
may not seem big at first, but most veteran players know that grenades
are the life blood of good Halo games. Secondly, your reload times(if
you need to reload your particular weapon) are doubled when you dual
wield, which can be a serious problem when someone has a gun pointed at
you. And lastly, when firing both weapons at the same time, weapon
recoil increases. While you don't notice it with most weapons, it's
painfully obvious with dual SMGs.
<br>

<br>At first, dualwielding seems a little confusing as you get used to
using the Y Button to switch weapons AND dual wield them. But once you
pick it up, you'll come to love this feature, as you run in two guns
blazing, throw one down, lob a grenade right at your opponents, scoop
up your other gun and keep blazing away. I was pleased with how smartly
balanced dual wielding is against using a single weapon. Both have
their advantages and disadvantages, and the victor is still usually the
one with more skill. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Vehicle Pirating(Yar)-</span>
<br>
Another one of those features that I couldn't have been happier about.
Previously, you had to outright kill someone in Halo to get their
vehicle, or in the case of Ghosts and Warthogs, they had to roll it.
Now, when you are a next to a vehicle that is moving at other than full
speed, you will be prompted to hold the x button. The screen will pan
away to show you your character, as you climb over the front, back, or
side of the vehicle and smack your opponent from the seat. In the case
of the Wraith and Scorpion tanks, you will see your character climb
onto the hatch of the vehicle. Then you'll be prompted to mash the
meele button, which causes your character to beat away at the hatch(and
eventually at the juicy, exposed cranium of your opponent). Once the
hatch is gone, you can either keep smashing, or you can chuck a grenade
down the hatch, killing the driver and(if you want) disabling the
vehicle very quickly. Just so you know, the AI opponents can do the
same to you, ripping you from your vehicle if you don't keep moving. I
think this is a great feature. It really adds to the whole "sensation"
of the fight, and it's a great tactical option. Now, you can snipe your
opponent from his vehicle, blow the whole thing to kingdom-come, or
climb over the front up close and personal, all gung ho style. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Player Life and Shields-</span>
<br>
Shields remain the same as they did in Halo 1. However, players no
longer have a "life". Once your shields are depleted, you can take a
few hits, but not many, before you die. Once your shields are back up,
you can take the same "amount" of damage again when your shields are
down again. This really forces you to take cover when your shields are
down, as you don't really know how close you are to death. The days of
charging a group of enemies and laying waste to all of them with a
sliver of life left are over. Once your shields are gone, if you aren't
in cover, you are pretty much already dead. I'm not sure how I feel
about this quite yet. On one hand, I like how it encourages people to
not run out there guns blazing, and use a little cover and some
tactics. On the other hand, I like knowing how close I really am to
death. Still on the fence about this feature. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Player Respawning(co-op)-</span>
<br>
The co-op respawning rules have changed for the better in Halo 2.
Previously, if an enemy broke wind within 5 miles of your position, the
game would not allow your dead partner to respawn. The restrictions on
respawning are much less stringent now(well, sorta, more on this
later). No more backtracking through 1/2 the level trying to get your
friend back. The criteria for respawn are these. 1) No one can be
actively firing on you. If you are crouching behind a wall, and someone
is shooting the front of it, no respawn. 2) Your shields must be
charged. If you're sitting in a corner trying to get your team mate to
respawn, and your shields are damaged, your partner will respawn the
moment your shield's hit full. As a general rule, the closer an enemy
blip is on your radar, the less chance there is your player will
respawn. This is not set in stone however. Multiple times playing one
of us would die, and the other would retreat hoping for respawn,
thinking we were screwed, only to leave the other standing in a room
full of enemies taking fire. If you can manage to find a quiet place
for at least 5 to 6 seconds, you can usually get the other player to
respawn. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Active Camoflague-</span>
<br>
When playing as the covenant, your flashlight button turns on "active
camoflague", which gives you Predator like invisibility. It lasts for
about 8 seconds, until you are damaged or you attack. It then has a 15
second cool down. This little bonus is GREAT for the campaign play.
When combined with the power sword, you can litterally kill a whole
room full of enemies before they even know what hit them. It's just the
little edge that make the Covenant cool, without being ridiculously
over powered. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Difficulty Settings-</span>
<br>
Halo 2 still makes use of the familiar Easy, Standard, Heroic,
Legendary difficulties. My friend and I started the game on normal, and
restarted a few levels later on Heroic seeking a greater challenge. We
were not disappointed. A little history first. In Halo, Legendary was
where the AI got sneaky, flanked you, was dead accurate with it's
grenades, and had higher than normal shield capacity, and life. Well,
that's heroic in Halo 2. While not impossible, it requires you to be on
your game. Your enemies are as ruthless as they are tough. Covenant
Snipers will pin you behind cover, and due to the extra damage they
recieve(or the weaker shields you have), one direct hit from them will
usually kill you. The little bastard grunts are a real nightmare on
heroic, because while you are busy dealing with the elites and all the
difficult enemies, there is a grunt, somewhere, lining up a plasma
grenade directly on you. Most of the time you won't even see it til
it's too late. It's not uncommon to poke your head around a corner, or
a box, and see three grunts launching plasma grenades straight at you
with unnerving accuracy. And this is just heroic.
<br>

<br>Legendary is truely for the hardcore in Halo 2. In Halo 1, you
could slowly win legendary as a war of attrition on co-op, having one
player die while the other holds back, killing an enemy or two at a
time. No more. Now when one of you dies in legendary co-op, it's back
to the check point.
<br>I can't describe how hard the AI is in Legendary, it surpasses
reasonable descriptions. It throws grenades at near impossible
trajectories, elites take entire clips of ammo just to drain their
shields, and there are more enemies than in Heroic. The AI is so
astute, it will shoot you throw a mere spec of gap in cover, pinning
you down under a barrage of laser fire. Sound easy? It would be, if it
weren't also for the fact that your shields are also reduced in
effectiveness, where 4, count them 4, individual plasma rifle round
will elimnate them completely. My friend and I, with litterally
hundreds of hours played in Halo, couldn't even get past the first
level after 45 minutes of trying. It was just simply impossible to stay
alive. Truely, utterly hardcore. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Multi-player-</span>
<br>
I haven't played much multiplayer as of right now, I was more focused
on beating the campaign. I have previewed all the maps though, and I
can tell you they are twice as complex as your standard Halo
multiplayer level. There are a few of them that are HUGE, big enough to
comfortably house 16 players. Your Multiplayer profile is highly
customizable, with multiple color settings for your Master Chief or
Covenant Elite, and banners which you can arrange and color how you
want. I haven't played any of the game types yet either except slayer,
but they seem to be the standard run of types from Halo 1, like
Phantom, Juggernaut, Oddball, CTF, Assault, and on. Anyways, just based
on the Campaign, I can tell you Multiplayer is going to rock just as
hard, if not harder, than Halo 1. (Update: And is does. Even though I
no longer play on Xbox live, Multi-player Halo is awesome. Even more so
now that they've fixed a lot of the incredibly devious cheat bugs.)<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">THE NITTY GRITTY</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Gameplay-</span>
<br>

<br>
I thoroughly enjoyed Halo 2's gameplay. It is essentially Halo v2.0.
This is both a good, and a bad thing. Halo 1's big problem was that
levels, while big, were extremely repetitive, almost insultingly so.
Sure, there were litterally hundreds of enemies to kill, but levels all
blended into a haze of tunnles, rooms, bridges, with the occasional
handcrafted scene here and there. It's obvious that Bungie was aware of
this. The levels are in Halo 2 are less monotonous(notice I said less,
instead of not). Here's how it works. You enter a room, a valley,
whatever. You fight multiple "waves" of enemies, where there is usually
the first wave standing around, then the second, third, and other waves
will run in from other passage ways, from behind you, above you, ect..
Rinse, repeat this recipe about 10 or 15 times and you have a level. To
Bungie's credit, this time around they took to the time to actually
design their enviroments instead of stamp them from a mold, so the
monotony is less apparent than it was in Halo by a long shot. But,
after a few levels, you start to pick up on the pattern, and the "sneak
attacks" stop having so much impact, and you just settle down to
kill the next wave. The levels aren't all exactly like this though.
Bungie added some thematic and epic elements to some of the levels,
like chasing down the massive Covenant Scarab Walker and boarding it,
or cutting the heretic covenant's station lose and riding it as it
plummets down through the sky at 1000 miles per hour(damn that was a
cool level). Add in some Banshee flying sporadically throughout the levels,
and there is definetly more to pay attention to in Halo 2 than in Halo
1. The underlying design still pretty much remains the same though.
<br>

<br>Being able to play both the Covenant and the USMC turned out to be
pretty cool. Differences in abilties, and what kind of weapons you used
throughout the level helped keep the gameplay moving along. Every level
you alternate between playing the Master Chief, and seeing his story,
and playing the failed Covenant General of the original Halo, seeing
his story. While the missions of the two don't really weave together,
the stories eventually do(if poorly...).
<br>

<br>Another key difference in Halo 2 as compared to Halo 1 is the use
of weapons. In Halo, playing only as the Master Chief, you tened to use
most of the Covenant weapons only as fall back weapons. Marines
obviously had the advantage in the weapon department, so the Covenant
got the advantage in the vehicle department. In Halo 2, you will find
yourself using just about every weapon in the game at some point. Not
only because you will need different weapons for different opponents
and situations, but because it is nigh impossible to keep finding ammo
for the same weapon in a level. The only 2 weapons you will ever be
guarenteed to find all the time are the plasma pistol and the plasma
rifle. The max ammo capacity of ALL weapons has been toned down from
Halo 1, and many weapons you find are 1/2 empty already. All this
results in "rummaging" after most fights looking for your ideal weapon,
or at least a new one. It's not uncommon to find yourself near empty in
the middle of a fight, and grabbing ANYTHING off the floor to finish
off your opponent. This isn't to say you will have a problem finding a
gun. There are always weapons laying around. It's more a matter of WHAT
weapons are lying around. That being said, if you really hate
everything but your Battle Rifle and your SMG, you can always(in a
non-legendary co-op game), kill each other to build up your supply of
ammo. Not that it will do you much good, as a full SMG is going to last
you about 1 minute into the first fire fight. On the plus side, the
game almost always spawns you with grenades, so you don't have to go
into fights completely out gunned. <br>

<br>
There are also boss fights in Halo 2(yea?). Unfortunately, these aren't
very cool in my opinion. Without spoiling too much of the story, I'll
just say the last boss doesn't seem like a final boss in the slightest.
He's not all that powerful when you get down to it, and basically just
needs to be shot about 1000 times. He doesn't shoot anything, doesn't
do a good job of chasing you, and his leaping meele attack is laughably
easy to avoid. Once you defeat him and find out the game(for now) is
over, you definetly feel like you didn't get your money's worth out of
the climatic final fight. The boss prior to the final one is more
challenging(and much more satisfying to kill), but resembles a "really
hard normal guy" more than he does a full fledged mega boss. <br>

<br>
All told, I think it took me and my friend about 12 to 13 hours to beat
it on Heroic, with many a reloaded game. All in all(story aside), I
loved playing the game. It's Halo goodness all over again at it's core,
with well planned and well executed newer features as a bonus. About
the only thing the game play fell flat for me was in SOME of the level
designs, like "The Library v2.0", which were reminiscent of the same
montonous killing and lack of real effort in level design that people
associated with the first Halo.

<br>

<br>Ok. It's that section of the review again where I start
complaining. Thankfully, it's only about the story this time. I'll be
frank, I play Halo for the gameplay, not the story. The story has
always been, to me, a generic ass sci-fi story(that does a great job of
ripping off Warhammer 40K and getting away with it), with some smarmy
comments thrown in to keep it funny, and a faceless badass to please
your sense of machismo. In Halo 1, there was a consistent(if somewhat
bland and overly dramatic) storyline that drove the game play. You knew
why you were in the level you were in, why you were doing what you were
doing, and who the major players were. The story was, more or less, solid.
<br>

<br>God I wish that were the case with Halo 2. The first cutscene is
nice. It artistically constrasts the USMC celebrating their hero's </span><span class="postbody">(Master Chief)</span><span class="postbody">
vicotry over Halo, with the Covenant branding their
failed general with the mark of shame for losing Halo. And from there,
the story goes down hill. To their credit, Bungie did a good thing
letting you see what "the enemy" is like. They humanized the Covenant
with articulated voice actors, explain their purpose to seeking Halo,
and introduces you to "The Prophets" who are the driving force behind
the Covenant. But then things get all screwy. The story constantly
jumps around from what the Master Chief is doing, to what the Covenant
General is doing. While the Covenant are attacking earth(Halo 2 pretty
much starts an hour after Halo 1 ended), they are also engaged in a
bloody civil war within their own ranks, between those that follow the
Prophets, and those that know Halo will destroy everyone near it.....on
top of the invasion of the Flood. On top of that, there is the struggle
to get the Index(key to activating Halo), and the battles involved in
that. This all rolls together into a murky, quickly sketched,
unexplained snarl of a story, where major plot points come and go in
the blink of an eye, and you're often left going "ok so....what am I
doing again?". <br>

<br>
But that's not my biggest gripe. No, my biggest gripe are the FMV
cutscenes. First I want to say, yes, they are pretty. Master Chief sure
does look all shiny. But that's it. Technicially, the quality of the
FMVs is very inconsistent, where a big, specular lighted Master Chief
will be standing next to a hardly textured lump of something. And my
real, true gripe.....the FMV cutscenes are pure fluff. Things like,
Master Chief riding a bomb out of a spaceship ala Dr. Strangelove, then
miraculously leaping off the bomb back to his own ship. They are show
cases for the art and skill of Bungie's movie people, cut in with just
enough smart ass dialouge from the seargant to keep your attention. I
like a pretty cutscene sure. But I don't like people flaunting their
FMVs when I barely have a handle on the story they presented. If as
much time had gone into the story as the freaking FMVs, Halo would have
pissed off far less people. Or maybe not. While I won't spoil the
ending for you, think Matrix: Reloaded, and how much that ending pissed
you off. The ending for Halo 2 will make you want to climb up on a MS
executive's desk, punch them in the face, and stuff a plasma grenade
down their gullet. Suffice to say, Bungie and MS are planning to hump
the Halo intellectual property for all it's worth, if the ending of the
game is an indicator. I can almost smell the Halo 3 hype from here. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Sound-</span>
<br>

<br>
Mixed marks from me in this area. Halo 1 stuck out in my mind because
it included a bunch of really big thematic pieces that were pretty
good, using stuff from Gregorian Choir chant, to synthesized music, to
good 'ole electric guitar. The music in Halo 2 is even broader. You
still have the big swelling, heroic theme piece, slightly altered. You
still have the electric guitar(although it breaks off into solos here
and there and sounds kind funky). You get some hard driving techno
beats that will make your sub woofers thump(if you have 'em). You even
have more than a few soft emotional pieces on piano. Were Bungie to
offer a Halo 2 sound track, I'd call it an ecletic mix at best. Even
though the scores are bigger, more dramatic, more swelling than in Halo
1, I found I liked them less. Probably because Bungie tries to beat you
over the head with them. The tracks pick up at key points in game play,
usually when fights break out, and the volume on them is cranked UP. So
that you go from light ambient sounds, so a sudden pounding bass
rythym, or that damn guitar going crazy on the whammy bar. There are
some good pieces at work in the game, but to be honest, some of them
are presented like shit. <br>

<br>
There are few familiar sounds from Halo 1. Most of the Covenant speech
is now in English(spoken by very articulate and proper sounding voice actors),
as opposed to alien babble. About 1/2 of the weapon sounds are
different now, in tune with about 1/2 of them being new weapons
altogether. There are still the familiar ambient elements like the
Marines belly aching or talking trash, the Covenant mocking you, but in
my opinion there is far less of this than there was in the first game,
and it is far less amusing. Maybe I haven't played enough to pick all
the voices out, but the Grunts definetly make less noise in Halo 2, and
they were my favorite part of the first. Most of smart assing and
"hoo-rah" stuff comes from the USMC Seargant, who is at least fairly
funny. I dunno, I miss the underlying humor of the original Halo. It
looks like they are trying to take the theme and the world a little
more seriously this time around. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">Graphics-</span>
<br>

<br>
I'm not 100% sure how to describe Halo 2's graphics. They are very
definetly still Halo. It's hard for me to say if the overall quality of
the graphics has improved form Halo 1, but here is what I do notice
about them. They've made some real changes to the fauna in game. It is
fairly sparse, and never comes above waist level. You will be hard
pressed to find an enviroment like the swamps from the 343 Guilty Spark
level, or anything close to it. But there are tons and tons and tons
more particles on the screen than you ever got in Halo 1. Between a
Drop Ship firing 4 Quad Plasma Cannons, 2 Snipers, 3 Grunts with
Needlers, and a few Elites with Plasma Rifles, the screen is litterally
a riot of colors and light in combat. The dynamic lighting is pretty good,
nothing spectacularly realistic like Doom 3, but enough to get the job
done. <br>

<br>
Something has also been done to the player perspective. Again it's one
of those things I can't really put my finger on, but the scale and
proportion of things on the screen have changed. Some think it better
reflects the size and scale of things in comparison to the size of the
Master Chief, but I disagree. The screen, to this day, feels cramped,
like I'm not getting enough of my peripherial vision in. <br>

<br>
There are lots more moveable objects in Halo 2 as well. Barrels you can
knock over or blow up, pieces of the terrain that you can destroy, all
that leave chunky remains all over the place. Combined with bodies
laying around, I was fairly impressed at the amount of extra "stuff"
the game was able to leave on the screen for long periods of time.
Usually games phase out debris and corpses quickly to preserve frame
rates, but they last a considerable amount of time in Halo 2. <br>

<br>
The graphics in Halo 2 are constructed from Halo, with improvements.
They aren't as pixelated in some instances, and things like the water,
the sky, reflections and specular lighting are a big improvement. The
complexitiy and depth of enviroment textures is also an improvement. I
still can't help feeling there is something less in the engine of Halo
2 than in Halo. I think it really has to do with fauna. Load up Beaver
Creek map on Halo 2, then load up Battle Creek on Halo 1, and I think
you'll see what I'm talking about. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic">So what do I think?</span>
<br>

<br>

<br>
I think that overall, it's a solid game. If you liked Halo, you're
going to like Halo 2. If you didn't like Halo, chances are, you still won't
like Halo 2. It's not the greatest thing since sliced bread, that's for
sure, but it measured up to about 80% of the hype. The fact the
campaign is pretty short is probably what robs Halo 2 of being an
absolute smash hit(and the fact *I* could write a more coherent story,
drunk and/or otherwise). <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">BY THE NUMBERS:(Out of 10)</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Theme: 4/10</span>
<br>
Between the overblown FMVs, the bouncy and incomplete story arcs, the
surprise plot twists and characters, and the obnoxious lack of an
ending used as a marketing ploy, I was really soured on Halo 2's theme.
Not that I was a big fan before, but I can definetly tell you I'm not
waiting for Halo 3 because I need to know what happens to Master Chief.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Sound: 7/10</span>
<br>Some pretty good tracks, a few pretty weak tracks, and a couple
attempts to be artsy in a game devoted to wasting stuff. Not much drove
me wild, or insane here, except the volume at which the music decides
to play during the gameplay.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Gameplay: 9/10</span>
<br>I had a great time playing through Halo 2. Soaking up the new
mechanics, weapons, and vehicles was pure bliss. Halo 2 retains the
same white knuckle, seat of your pants combat that you loved from the
first one. Points off for having some of the same pitfalls in design as
Halo 1, and some very uninspired boss fights. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Graphics: 8.5/10</span>
<br>
The graphics increase was enough to please. Nothing changed drastically
enough to upset what you normally expect from Halo. Frame rates remain
constant and high throughout. Some inconsistency and texture popping
occasionally spoil an otherwise solid presentation.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Good enough to buy.
