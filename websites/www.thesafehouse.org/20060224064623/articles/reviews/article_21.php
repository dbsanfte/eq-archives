  var PageContent= '<span class="postbody"><br>These days, it\'s hard to know what a game is\nreally all about till you sink your teeth into it. Hype has become a\nnorm amongst promoters and game designers, and it rarely lives up\ncompletely to it\'s promise.\n<br>\n\n<br>Fable is one of those games that, as much as you admire the polish\nand the richness of various aspects of the game, you can\'t help but\nfeel boxed in by the short comings in development. None the less, Fable\nis a fun little game to romp through, providing more than a few solid\nhours of entertainment.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">The Breakdown.\n</span><br><br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">Graphics: 8.5\n</span><br>\n\n<br>If it\'s one area Fable really shines, it\'s the artwork. The\nbackgrounds and fore grounds are lovingly designed and full of color.\nThe level of detail in some areas is just jaw dropping, forcing you to\nstop and take in all the graphic goodness. The colors and effects are\nbright and beautiful. Its not often I rave about graphics like this,\nbut Fable truly had me impressed. While there is a touch of slowdown as\nyour are attacked by multiple enemies, it\'s barely noticeable. The only\nreason I don\'t give it full marks is because in order to get all these\nbeautiful textures in, smudging and blurring is used to it\'s extreme to\nmake it all work. For me, it didn\'t ruin a thing. For some, it\'s caused\nnausea and headaches. Go figure eh?\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">Sound: 7.5</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Another design aspect where Fable really put the shine on. The\nvoice acting is rich and funny(if a wee bit corny). The musical scores\nare enchanting. The environmental and ambient sounds are right where\nthey need to be. Combat sounds are about the only place where I think\nFable didn\'t deliver in totality, something that I didn\'t miss much on\ntop of all the rest of the great sound. That and the re-use of voices\nand scores does eventually cause it to lose appeal.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">Theme: 6.5\n<br>\n\n<br></span>What can you say about Fable? It\'s the quintessential hero\nstory,\nbroken down into it\'s little bits. Vengeance. Betrayal. Suffering.\nGlory. Heroics. The great part about Fable is that it makes it own mark\nwith Albion, it\'s own story and theme without feeling too generic.\nSadly, the story shuffles along a little hurriedly towards the middle\nof the game, where most stories usually get really meaty. But as far as\nthe\nworld of Albion is concerned, it\'s solid, believable, and enjoyable.\n<span style="font-weight:bold"><br>\n\n<br>Gameplay: 5.0</span>\n<br>\n\n<br>Sometimes, I feel like a broken record when I review games these\ndays. I rave about all these thematic and aesthetic qualities, and then\nI bitch about gameplay. I guess Fable is not different in that respect.\n<br>\n\n<br>First of all, the hype: "Fable is all about consequences for your\nactions, truly making the hero you want to be. Every action and\ndecision in the world has an impact, as you grow from boyhood to man\nhood. And Albion is a vast realm with tons of places to explore and\nhoards of treasure to unearth".\n<br>\n\n<br>Now let\'s talk reality. The alignment system they created IS\nunique, and fun, but it\'s does not reflect your every action with any\nreal integrity. Bandits make you good, townsfolk and merchants make you\nevil. Alignment in Fable is a neat little idea tacked on the more or\nless linear flow of the game, with some slight impact on the way things\nhappen. Without just straight out spoiling it for anyone who hasn\'t\nplayed, let me suffice to say that whether you choose good or evil, it\nreally makes no difference until you start slaughtering towns folks.\nSure you look evil, sure people cringe or run at the sight of you, but\nreal impact on the world? Nope. Additionally, the promise of watching\nyour hero child grow into a man, and eventually get old, is crudely\nbroken up over "chapters" of the game, and when you are kicked out of\nthe tutorial as a 20 something year old, you look like you are 60\nwithin a few hours of gameplay.\n<br>\n\n<br>Which brings me to another gripe. The other half of this virtual\nsandbox(as people have dubbed it) that is Fable consists of social\ninteraction with NPCs. Wooing women, getting married, buying and\nrenting houses. Mounting your trophies in those houses, and on. But\nit\'s very underdeveloped, like a bad clone of the sims in micro. People\nwill love you one minute, hate you after you beat the crap out of them,\nthen love you again if you woo and present enough gifts. While it does\nsomewhat fill out the world of Albion beyond the linear gameplay, it\ndoesn\'t deliver the dynamic choices that the hype professed.\n<br>\n\n<br>Fable does get a few marks from me for having "stuff" to do.\nTournaments, puzzle doors guarding lame loot(oh lord how lame it is),\nmini games, crap to dig up out of the ground or fish out of the water,\nand sub quests. But like a lot of other things in Fable, they are\nhalf-assed in their implementation and scope.\n<br>\n\n<br>Now(hehe, I\'ve had lots of time to stew about my dislikes for\nFable), the layout. The entire game is zoned based, with no z-axis\ninteraction. Worse yet, while the boarders and backgrounds are deep and\nintriguing, they serve to deceive you. The zones are really very tiny,\nand there is nothing to do. Fences mark off the edges of the zone, or a\nline of trees, and thats it. And since they packed so many graphics\ninto such small areas, you end up doing a lot of LOADING....run 15\nseconds through zone......LOADING.....run 15 seconds through zone......\n<br>\n\n<br>Finally, my last true gripe about Fable. It\'s a simple, simple\ngame, that when you break it down, is much like 3-d zelda with\nalignment changes and wifery. Any veteran RPG gamer will be left\nstarving for mechanics and equipment selection. When it comes to\nweapons and armor, all there is is a few different weapon types, like\n8, and 4 grades of material. That\'s all she wrote.

<noscript><div id="nojs" class="nojs"><span class="postbody"><br>These days, it's hard to know what a game is
really all about till you sink your teeth into it. Hype has become a
norm amongst promoters and game designers, and it rarely lives up
completely to it's promise.
<br>

<br>Fable is one of those games that, as much as you admire the polish
and the richness of various aspects of the game, you can't help but
feel boxed in by the short comings in development. None the less, Fable
is a fun little game to romp through, providing more than a few solid
hours of entertainment.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold">The Breakdown.
</span><br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Graphics: 8.5
</span><br>

<br>If it's one area Fable really shines, it's the artwork. The
backgrounds and fore grounds are lovingly designed and full of color.
The level of detail in some areas is just jaw dropping, forcing you to
stop and take in all the graphic goodness. The colors and effects are
bright and beautiful. Its not often I rave about graphics like this,
but Fable truly had me impressed. While there is a touch of slowdown as
your are attacked by multiple enemies, it's barely noticeable. The only
reason I don't give it full marks is because in order to get all these
beautiful textures in, smudging and blurring is used to it's extreme to
make it all work. For me, it didn't ruin a thing. For some, it's caused
nausea and headaches. Go figure eh?
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Sound: 7.5</span>
<br>

<br>Another design aspect where Fable really put the shine on. The
voice acting is rich and funny(if a wee bit corny). The musical scores
are enchanting. The environmental and ambient sounds are right where
they need to be. Combat sounds are about the only place where I think
Fable didn't deliver in totality, something that I didn't miss much on
top of all the rest of the great sound. That and the re-use of voices
and scores does eventually cause it to lose appeal.
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Theme: 6.5
<br>

<br></span>What can you say about Fable? It's the quintessential hero
story,
broken down into it's little bits. Vengeance. Betrayal. Suffering.
Glory. Heroics. The great part about Fable is that it makes it own mark
with Albion, it's own story and theme without feeling too generic.
Sadly, the story shuffles along a little hurriedly towards the middle
of the game, where most stories usually get really meaty. But as far as
the
world of Albion is concerned, it's solid, believable, and enjoyable.
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br>

<br>Gameplay: 5.0</span>
<br>

<br>Sometimes, I feel like a broken record when I review games these
days. I rave about all these thematic and aesthetic qualities, and then
I bitch about gameplay. I guess Fable is not different in that respect.
<br>

<br>First of all, the hype: "Fable is all about consequences for your
actions, truly making the hero you want to be. Every action and
decision in the world has an impact, as you grow from boyhood to man
hood. And Albion is a vast realm with tons of places to explore and
hoards of treasure to unearth".
<br>

<br>Now let's talk reality. The alignment system they created IS
unique, and fun, but it's does not reflect your every action with any
real integrity. Bandits make you good, townsfolk and merchants make you
evil. Alignment in Fable is a neat little idea tacked on the more or
less linear flow of the game, with some slight impact on the way things
happen. Without just straight out spoiling it for anyone who hasn't
played, let me suffice to say that whether you choose good or evil, it
really makes no difference until you start slaughtering towns folks.
Sure you look evil, sure people cringe or run at the sight of you, but
real impact on the world? Nope. Additionally, the promise of watching
your hero child grow into a man, and eventually get old, is crudely
broken up over "chapters" of the game, and when you are kicked out of
the tutorial as a 20 something year old, you look like you are 60
within a few hours of gameplay.
<br>

<br>Which brings me to another gripe. The other half of this virtual
sandbox(as people have dubbed it) that is Fable consists of social
interaction with NPCs. Wooing women, getting married, buying and
renting houses. Mounting your trophies in those houses, and on. But
it's very underdeveloped, like a bad clone of the sims in micro. People
will love you one minute, hate you after you beat the crap out of them,
then love you again if you woo and present enough gifts. While it does
somewhat fill out the world of Albion beyond the linear gameplay, it
doesn't deliver the dynamic choices that the hype professed.
<br>

<br>Fable does get a few marks from me for having "stuff" to do.
Tournaments, puzzle doors guarding lame loot(oh lord how lame it is),
mini games, crap to dig up out of the ground or fish out of the water,
and sub quests. But like a lot of other things in Fable, they are
half-assed in their implementation and scope.
<br>

<br>Now(hehe, I've had lots of time to stew about my dislikes for
Fable), the layout. The entire game is zoned based, with no z-axis
interaction. Worse yet, while the boarders and backgrounds are deep and
intriguing, they serve to deceive you. The zones are really very tiny,
and there is nothing to do. Fences mark off the edges of the zone, or a
line of trees, and thats it. And since they packed so many graphics
into such small areas, you end up doing a lot of LOADING....run 15
seconds through zone......LOADING.....run 15 seconds through zone......
<br>

<br>Finally, my last true gripe about Fable. It's a simple, simple
game, that when you break it down, is much like 3-d zelda with
alignment changes and wifery. Any veteran RPG gamer will be left
starving for mechanics and equipment selection. When it comes to
weapons and armor, all there is is a few different weapon types, like
8, and 4 grades of material. That's all she wrote. The character
building system is a much simplified version of what most are used to
in RGPs, where instead of leveling, you just acquire points to spend in
the activity you engage in.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Overall: Rating: 7/10</span>
<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; text-decoration:underline">Analysis:</span><br>
<br>This is a game that obviously suffered in development(about 4
years...for a freaking CONSOLE game). There are core parts of the game
that are totally underdeveloped, while some other parts, like alignment
and aging, have been overdeveloped. I wish this had been a PC venture
with more funding, and less hype. The product could have been so much
better.
<br>

<br>As it is, Fable is fun, but in the mindless older RPG fashion,
where you bullishy move through content looking for better stuff. Only
in Fable, you really never get it. The story is soso moving, but not
very creative. And for anyone that had read up on Fable before playing
it, Alignment is far less interactive than it was billed, and it is
clunky in it's implementation. The social interaction aspect also
sounds better on the back of the box than it is in game.
<br>

<br>This isn't to say I haven't been having fun. I have been, leading
maidens through the woods to sacrifice them to the Dark God, thinking
up acts of petty evil to commit, and stealing things. I didn't stop
once playing Fable last night, so I must have been enjoying myself. But
too many times I found myself missing stuff I considered a necessity in
games, like lots of weapons and spells. The lack of equipment variety
and scale makes this game feel like Devil May Cry, not an RPG.
<br>

<br>I think Fable for the uninitiated gamer would is a great
game....they will be really wowed. For RPG veterans though, Fable is
sadly just another RPG title that can be played and dismissed...too
many things not implemented enough, or just plain not at all, to truly
satisfy.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ragebringer: 3.5/5</span>
<br>

<br>Good marks for effort and fun factor, and because I think the
graphics and sound really make this game. Dismiss those and you can
knock those ratings down a few notches.
<br>

<br>
Bad marks for lack of ingenuity, depth, and too much stinking hype!
