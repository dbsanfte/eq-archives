However,\nwith Relic Entertainment, they might have finally hit on something that\nwill expose the larger gaming population to Warhammer. \n<br>\n\n<br>\n<a href="http://www.dawnofwargame.com/homepage.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dawn of War</a>\nis a real time strategy game, set in the dark future of the 41st\nmillenium, where mankind struggles to exist against boundless hordes of\nthe Eldar(space elves), orks(yes, space orks too), and the freakish\ndaemonic powers of Chaos. Makind fights back in the form of the Space\nMarines, the elite warriors of the Imperium of Man. <br>\n\n<br>\nDawn of War uses squad based combat, with squads consisting of anywhere\nfrom 2 to 12 units, instead of the individual unit focus of many RTS\ngames. But Dawn of War also sets itself apart from other RTSs by\nchanging the standard resource collection model of peons collecting\nresources. Dawn of War focuses on quick, aggressive gameplay, instead\nof laid back defensive play(ala WC3 and others). To facilitate this,\nmoney(requistition credits) is generated when you hold strategic\nlocations, or markers on the map. While you hold them, you get more\nrequistion points. Some strategic points are considered critical, and\nonce you control a majority of them on the map, you win the game in 8\nminutes, unless your enemy can take back control of the critical\npoints.(Multiplayer allows you to toggle the win conditions, you don\'t\nhave to play with the strategic victories....although I highly\nrecommend you play with them, as it enforces the most entertaining kind\nof game play, back and forth battles between squads). <br>\n\n<br>\nIn addition to the squad based gameplay, DoW also includes strong\nindividual units like characters, as well as tanks, artillery machines,\nwalker machines, transports, lander speeders, ect... although infantry\nusually make up the meat of your army. <br>\n\n<br>\nOk, the specifics. \n<br>\n\n<br><span style="font-weight:bold">\nAUDIO</span> \n<br>\n\n<br>\nWhile only playing multiplayer matches in the beta(you aren\'t given\nmuch else), I can say the sample of ambient music definely fits the\nWarhammer 40k theme of the game. It\'s dark, gothic, battle music that\ndoes a little to give some atmosphere to the game. Sounds are decent\nquality of my 5.1 sound system, although it isn\'t of much use for DoW.\nExplosions and artillery fire are abound in this game, and units have a\nnasty habit of dying in a gurgling scream or choked off cry. War is not\npretty to see, and it\'s not pretty to listen to in Dawn of War either.\nThere are some elements of humor to the unit dialouges(mostly the orcs,\nas they all speak in a cheeky cockney accent), but I can say, Warhammer\n40K players will appreciate that the units adhere to the feel of 40k in\ntheir responses. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br><span style="font-weight:bold">\nGAMEPLAY \n</span><br>\n\n<br>\nStrategy in DoW consists of counters. Every unit in your army consists\nof some type, Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Vehicle, Building, Demon,\nect... <br>\nThe strategy of DoW lies in how you equip certain squads to counter an\nenemy force. For example: If your enemy is the heavily armored space\nmarines(heavy infantry), you\'ll want weapons that are anti-heavy\ninfantry, like a Plasma Gun. If you\'re facing light infantry like the\nOrks, you\'ll want a heavy bolter(heavy machine gun). The clincher is\nthis. All this selection of weapons and such is done on the\nbattlefield, not when you build a squad. A newly produced squad\nconsists of a few members. Once in the field, that unit can add another\nsquad member, or equip existing squad members with new heavy weapons.\nHow big your squad is, and what weapons you can use, depend on the unit\ntype, and what race you play. <br>\n\n<br>\nThe races all differ from each other in basic, core features. Space\nMarines are the all around tough army, with great base level infantry\ntroops, and the most devatstating vehicles in the game. Marines are all\nabout well trained units and superior firepower. They are also one of\nthe slowest and most costly production races. <br>\n\n<br>\nOrks produce very quickly, and focus more on overwhelming numbers. Orks\nin general specialize in close combat, but have very weak morale as a\nrace and have somewhat inferior vehicles(compared to marines). They are\nalso hampered by a third resource requirement, known as the\nWAAAGGGHHH!, which is the ork version of pep and spirit. <br>\n\n<br>\nEldar are the most mobile army in the game, and produce units and\nbuildings second only to the orcs. They focus on light infantry and\nlightly armored vehicles, and specialist units. Eldar\'s primary\nstrength is ranged combat. Their superior technologies give them many,\nmany advantages over the other races, but playing Eldar also requires a\nlot of finesse. Their lack of heavy infantry and vehicles counter\nbalances their high mobility. <br>\n\n<br>\nChaos is the dark mirror image of the Space Marines. Chaos has many powerful\nunits, and is strong in both meele combat and ranged fire. Many chaos\nunits have unique abilties and advantages over other races, such as\nberzerk fury, demonic mutations, and more. Their weakness lies in the\nhigh cost of their units, and their lack of vehicle selection(Space\nMarine has 8 vehicles, chaos has 3). Chaos is another race that\nrequires a certain amount of skill and finesse to play effectively, but\nless so than the eldar. <br>\n\n<br>\nEach race plays it\'s own specific way, with it\'s own obvious strengths,\nand glaring weaknesses. This pretty much balances them all out. Each\nrace can stomp the others, if played properly. Of all the races, the\nbeta players seem to feel that Orks are the most underpowered, yet I\'ve\nseen the orks rampage over a skilled player. <br>\n\n<br>\nDoW goes a step further though in combat than most RTS\'s usually do.\nThe developers mourned the fact that in many games, units just stand\nthere and shoot you til you or they die, and that there is no way to\nstop an enemy from shooting really. Dawn of War utuilizes a close\ncombat system, where any unit can be toggled to fire ranged weapons,\ncharge into close combat, or do both depending on the situation. All\narmies come with close combat specialist units, designed to engage the\nenemy in hand to hand combat so they cannot use their heavy weapons.\nThis dual dynamic leads to some intresting choices on the battle field\nbetween what you want to field, and more importantly, how you utilize\nthem. <br>\n\n<br>\nDawn of War also includes areas of the map that count as "cover" for\nyour troops, reducing the damage they take from ranged weaponry. So\nrather than just standing out in the middle of the field to do battle,\nthe wise player seeks out advantages in the terrain to position\nthemselves in. <br>\n\n<br>\nIn true adherence to the spirit of Warhammer 40k, killing the enemy has\nnever been the best method of dealing with them. Breaking their spirit\nso they run in fear for their lives is the best way. And so Relic\nincluded it in DoW. A unit has morale, like hit points for life, that\ntakes it\'s own seperate damage aside from health. When a unit runs out\nof morale, they "break" and are less effetive in everything by a good\nmargin, except their run speed, which increases. They don\'t actually\nflee from the battle til you tell them too though, allowing you to keep\ncontrol. But most broken units are easy meat for the enemy, so it\nencourages you to pull your troops back. <br>\n\n<br>\nAll this culminates in a very intense combat experience. The addition\nof vehicles makes this tactical stew even spicier, as artillery pounds\nground troops, transports rush close combat troops into the fray\nundercover, and walker robots rip infantry apart with their bare\nhands(more on this later ). <br>\n\n<br>\nDawn of War promotes an aggressive style of play, where most people\nthat play very defensively end up losing. Moving your early troops out\nto secure resources on the map, and defend them, is the main strategy\nthat drives the game. Because you can win the game by holding more of\nthe map instead of just annihilating your enemy, games are often\nongoing, head to head confrontations for control of points of the map. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">GRAPHICS \n</span><br>\n\n<br>\nRelic Entertainment made it very clear, they like strategy games and\nRTS\'s, but they also wanted to do something more visual than other\ncompanies. With the choice of Squad vs. Squad combat, they knew their\napproach to how you see battle needed to be different. <br>\n\n<br>\nDawn of War takes a 3d perspectice to the battlefield. What\'s great is,\nthey allow you to rotate and control the camera just about how ever you\nwant. Want to zoom RIGHT in on a unit\'s face? No problem! Want to watch\nthe slaughter from ground level where your troops are fighting? Go for\nit! <br>\nIt\'s a great joy to see DoW in action at the up close and personal\nlevel. Thats because alot of focus in DoW goes towards the unit\nanimations, and the textures of the models. <br>\n\n<br>\nWith the addition of close combat fighting in dawn of war, as well as\nranged fire, Relic took a bold step and mapped each unit to behave as\nan individual within the squad. That means when your units are duking\nit out in hand to hand with the swords, they are animated to react to\neach other. When a unit kills another, it does one of many unique\nfinishing moves. So combat looks like real combat, instead of just 30\nidentical drones doing the same thing. Some of the most impressive\nanimations come from the leaders and walker vehicles. As a walker\nfinishes as infantry unit, they grind them in their hands in a\nspectacular spray of blood, casting aside their mangled corspe. The\nleader of the Space Marines will climb atop a demon\'s head and bash\nit\'s brains in while his force hammer. <br>\n\n<br>\nRelic also included some collision and motion physics to the game, so\nthat artillery sends units flying everywhere, even high up into the\nsky. Characters knock back a swarm of enemies with one swipe, launching\nthem all backwards. <br>\n\n<br>\nSo you might be asking at this point.....how the hell am I supposed to\nenjoy all this camera angling and unit squishing and such while playing\nthe game? Currently all that is available is the ability to pause the\ngame (while still issuing commands) so that you can capture a snap shot\nof the action. Fans (including myself) have clamored for a slow motion\ntoggle so you can watch the battle moving, but Relic has not introduced\nthis as of yet, probably for balance reasons. <br>\n<br>\n<span style="font-weight:bold">THEME \n</span><br>\n\n<br>\nAs a table top Warhammer player, Dawn of War hits a very, very sweet\nspot for me. The Warhammer universe is vast, with tons of extra detail,\nbackground, and flavor along with it (known to warhammer players as\n"fluff"). Anyone who likes(or loves!) Warhammer has to check this game\nout, as it is one of the best presentations of the Warhammer property\nin a video game. <br>\n\n<br>\nBut you don\'t have to be a warhammer fan to get into Dawn of War. In\ntranslation to an RTS, the units are all documented in a way that any\nRTS player will recognize. And if you can\'t get into the twisted,\nbloodsoaked, battle hardened warhammer universe, you don\'t have a pulse\n<br>\n\n<br>\nThe game enviroments run from runied cities full of blasted statuary\nand crumbling buildings, to grassy jungle like settings, and more, all\nskinned and textured to capture the feel of Warhammer.. Being in beta,\nwe were only exposed to about 1/3 of the maps, and no single player\nmaps, so what I actually know of level designs and appearances is\npretty limited. <br>\n\n<br>\nANALYSIS \n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nSound: The sound hits the right notes for the game Relic has produced,\ncapturing the dark moodiness of the Warhammer world, the deafening roar\nof combat, and the agonized screams of the dying. No complaints here. <br>\n\n<br>\nGameplay: Some in beta(there are always a few) claim that DoW is just\nanother RTS, and that nothing is different, and that strategies are\nnarrow. I have to say, I disagree almost completely. Strategy seems\nlimited at first, but as you grow into the game and get comfortable\nwith the aggressive play, new strategies present themselves every day. <br>\n\n<br>\nPersonally, I suck at competitive RTS gaming. And yet, I\'ve gotten\nfairly good at DoW(66% win ratio) and I play the game as it was\nintended, with lots of squads and some small back up from vehicles,\nwith diversity. So I know that not all the complaints are valid. If I\ncan win at an RTS game, anyone can do it with the right moves. I\'m very\nsatisfied with Dawn of War\'s game play. The battles are fun, and very\nactive, enough to keep the micro manager happy, while visual enough to\nkeep the relaxed highly entertained. <br>\n\n<br>\nGraphics: One of Dawn of War\'s strongest points. The models are well\ndone, and contain a lot of detail. Being able to swivel the camera\naround is just so cool, especially with all the massed combat. The gun\nfire, lasers, artillery, explosions, and all the close combat\nanimations, give Dawn of War battles a very visceral feel, more so that\nmost of the other RTS\'s I\'ve played. There is a real danger in Dawn of\nWar of watching too much of the game instead of playing it(against\npeople anyways). <br>\n\n<br>\nOne of the coolest features is the army painter, where you can color\nyour units, and attach custom badges and battle standards to them.\nTable top warhammer is as much a model painting hobby as it is a game,\nand so this is a feature that gets alot of us table top players\nexcited, being able to field our own special armies in a video game. <br>\n\n<br>Theme: Not much to say here that I haven\'t said already. The theme\nof\nWarhammer and much of it\'s fluff and story was the guiding light for\nDawn of War. Many if not most of their design decisions that took their\nlead from the table top game. The&nbsp; actual&nbsp; game mechanics do\nnot&nbsp; reflect the table top game, they are based off an RTS model,\nso if you are a hardcore fan of the <span style="font-weight:bold">table top game system</span>,\nDawn of War will disapoint you in that aspect. However if you love the\ntheme, look, and feel of 40k, then the Emperor demands you go out and\nbuy Dawn of War right now. <br>\n<br>\nRelic really did Warhammer justice with this latest production. \n<br>\n\n<br><span style="font-weight:bold">\nPREFORMANCE: \n</span><br>\n\n<br>\nHere\'s where my problems start to arise with Dawn of War. The game\ndemands alot of your system to put out all those units doing their own\nthings and all the lights and colors. Currently in the beta, overall\npreformance, even on top rigs, is an issue. By scaling down the\ntextures and resolution, lower end computers can still play Dawn of War\npretty well, but very very few people play the game and have it run\n"perfect". <br>\n\n<br>\nA lot of this is due in part to the insane amount of texturing Dawn of\nWar has. In addition to all the individual unit, building, and\nenviroment textures, when players start making custom paint jobs and\nbadges to use in game, the load times become monstrous. In order to\nachieve better preformance for everyone playing the multiplayer, custom\nbadges and banners had the resolution forced down, and all players are\nforced down a level of detail. <br>\n<br>\nWhile this has not solved all the preformance issues, it has helped. On\na AMD 2600+ Barton, GeforceFX5900XT, and 512 DDR ram, multiplayer runs\nfairly well for me, with some slight hitching and hang ups in mass\nbattles, mainly due to other people\'s lag. In the single player\ntutorial beta testers get, my preformance is not so hot, surprisingly.\nWith full details on, and all texture levels accounted for, by the time\nthere are many many units on the screen, the frames noticably suffer.\nThis is one of those things I hope gets ironed out in release, as\nthere\'s no better way to kill your game that having crappy preformance\nout of the box. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nFinal thoughts: \n<br>\n\n<br>\nNot very often do I get to review a game this much, while still in\nbeta(short as it may be now). While I\'ve only played one map against the\ncomp on single player, and played a bunch of the MP, there is stiill a\nwhole single player game, based around the Space Marines. Relic did\nonly one race because they wanted to deliver a strong story to go along\nwith the single player. If the rest of game is an indicator, the single\nplayer story will prove to be a dark, war torn slaughter fest, just\nlike the rest of 40k. <br>\n\n<br>\nIn case you haven\'t noticed, I\'m pretty taken with the game. That says\nalot for me when WC3 kept me entertained for all of 3 days, modding and\nall. I believe that Dawn of War is a solid, fun game, and it\'s only\nhitch right now is the lack of solid preformance. If Relic can get that\ntied up, they will deliver a game that I think will turn the heads of\npeople walking through the computer games section. <br>\n\n<br>\nRATINGS \n<br>\nout of a possible 10 \n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nSound: 7.5 \n<br>\n\n<br>\nGameplay: 8.5 \n<br>\n\n<br>\nGraphics: 8.0 \n<br>\n\n<br>\nTheme: 10! \n<br>\n\n<br>\nPreformance: 6 \n<br>\n(Sorry Relic. It gets a 6 only because it runs pretty good on my system.....most of the time) \n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nSCORE: 8/10 \n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\nPhew! Thanks for reading!

<br>

<br>
If you've ever played the Table top Warhammer games, you've no doubt
played many of their, ahem, less than successful attempts to bring the
intellectual property of Warhammer to the video game market. However,
with Relic Entertainment, they might have finally hit on something that
will expose the larger gaming population to Warhammer. 
<br>

<br>
<a href="http://www.dawnofwargame.com/homepage.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dawn of War</a>
is a real time strategy game, set in the dark future of the 41st
millenium, where mankind struggles to exist against boundless hordes of
the Eldar(space elves), orks(yes, space orks too), and the freakish
daemonic powers of Chaos. Makind fights back in the form of the Space
Marines, the elite warriors of the Imperium of Man. <br>

<br>
Dawn of War uses squad based combat, with squads consisting of anywhere
from 2 to 12 units, instead of the individual unit focus of many RTS
games. But Dawn of War also sets itself apart from other RTSs by
changing the standard resource collection model of peons collecting
resources. Dawn of War focuses on quick, aggressive gameplay, instead
of laid back defensive play(ala WC3 and others). To facilitate this,
money(requistition credits) is generated when you hold strategic
locations, or markers on the map. While you hold them, you get more
requistion points. Some strategic points are considered critical, and
once you control a majority of them on the map, you win the game in 8
minutes, unless your enemy can take back control of the critical
points.(Multiplayer allows you to toggle the win conditions, you don't
have to play with the strategic victories....although I highly
recommend you play with them, as it enforces the most entertaining kind
of game play, back and forth battles between squads). <br>

<br>
In addition to the squad based gameplay, DoW also includes strong
individual units like characters, as well as tanks, artillery machines,
walker machines, transports, lander speeders, ect... although infantry
usually make up the meat of your army. <br>

<br>
Ok, the specifics. 
<br>

<br><span style="font-weight:bold">
AUDIO</span> 
<br>

<br>
While only playing multiplayer matches in the beta(you aren't given
much else), I can say the sample of ambient music definely fits the
Warhammer 40k theme of the game. It's dark, gothic, battle music that
does a little to give some atmosphere to the game. Sounds are decent
quality of my 5.1 sound system, although it isn't of much use for DoW.
Explosions and artillery fire are abound in this game, and units have a
nasty habit of dying in a gurgling scream or choked off cry. War is not
pretty to see, and it's not pretty to listen to in Dawn of War either.
There are some elements of humor to the unit dialouges(mostly the orcs,
as they all speak in a cheeky cockney accent), but I can say, Warhammer
40K players will appreciate that the units adhere to the feel of 40k in
their responses. <br>

<br>

<br><span style="font-weight:bold">
GAMEPLAY 
</span><br>

<br>
Strategy in DoW consists of counters. Every unit in your army consists
of some type, Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Vehicle, Building, Demon,
ect... <br>
The strategy of DoW lies in how you equip certain squads to counter an
enemy force. For example: If your enemy is the heavily armored space
marines(heavy infantry), you'll want weapons that are anti-heavy
infantry, like a Plasma Gun. If you're facing light infantry like the
Orks, you'll want a heavy bolter(heavy machine gun). The clincher is
this. All this selection of weapons and such is done on the
battlefield, not when you build a squad. A newly produced squad
consists of a few members. Once in the field, that unit can add another
squad member, or equip existing squad members with new heavy weapons.
How big your squad is, and what weapons you can use, depend on the unit
type, and what race you play. <br>

<br>
The races all differ from each other in basic, core features. Space
Marines are the all around tough army, with great base level infantry
troops, and the most devatstating vehicles in the game. Marines are all
about well trained units and superior firepower. They are also one of
the slowest and most costly production races. <br>

<br>
Orks produce very quickly, and focus more on overwhelming numbers. Orks
in general specialize in close combat, but have very weak morale as a
race and have somewhat inferior vehicles(compared to marines). They are
also hampered by a third resource requirement, known as the
WAAAGGGHHH!, which is the ork version of pep and spirit. <br>

<br>
Eldar are the most mobile army in the game, and produce units and
buildings second only to the orcs. They focus on light infantry and
lightly armored vehicles, and specialist units. Eldar's primary
strength is ranged combat. Their superior technologies give them many,
many advantages over the other races, but playing Eldar also requires a
lot of finesse. Their lack of heavy infantry and vehicles counter
balances their high mobility. <br>

<br>
Chaos is the dark mirror image of the Space Marines. Chaos has many powerful
units, and is strong in both meele combat and ranged fire. Many chaos
units have unique abilties and advantages over other races, such as
berzerk fury, demonic mutations, and more. Their weakness lies in the
high cost of their units, and their lack of vehicle selection(Space
Marine has 8 vehicles, chaos has 3). Chaos is another race that
requires a certain amount of skill and finesse to play effectively, but
less so than the eldar. <br>

<br>
Each race plays it's own specific way, with it's own obvious strengths,
and glaring weaknesses. This pretty much balances them all out. Each
race can stomp the others, if played properly. Of all the races, the
beta players seem to feel that Orks are the most underpowered, yet I've
seen the orks rampage over a skilled player. <br>

<br>
DoW goes a step further though in combat than most RTS's usually do.
The developers mourned the fact that in many games, units just stand
there and shoot you til you or they die, and that there is no way to
stop an enemy from shooting really. Dawn of War utuilizes a close
combat system, where any unit can be toggled to fire ranged weapons,
charge into close combat, or do both depending on the situation. All
armies come with close combat specialist units, designed to engage the
enemy in hand to hand combat so they cannot use their heavy weapons.
This dual dynamic leads to some intresting choices on the battle field
between what you want to field, and more importantly, how you utilize
them. <br>

<br>
Dawn of War also includes areas of the map that count as "cover" for
your troops, reducing the damage they take from ranged weaponry. So
rather than just standing out in the middle of the field to do battle,
the wise player seeks out advantages in the terrain to position
themselves in. <br>

<br>
In true adherence to the spirit of Warhammer 40k, killing the enemy has
never been the best method of dealing with them. Breaking their spirit
so they run in fear for their lives is the best way. And so Relic
included it in DoW. A unit has morale, like hit points for life, that
takes it's own seperate damage aside from health. When a unit runs out
of morale, they "break" and are less effetive in everything by a good
margin, except their run speed, which increases. They don't actually
flee from the battle til you tell them too though, allowing you to keep
control. But most broken units are easy meat for the enemy, so it
encourages you to pull your troops back. <br>

<br>
All this culminates in a very intense combat experience. The addition
of vehicles makes this tactical stew even spicier, as artillery pounds
ground troops, transports rush close combat troops into the fray
undercover, and walker robots rip infantry apart with their bare
hands(more on this later ). <br>

<br>
Dawn of War promotes an aggressive style of play, where most people
that play very defensively end up losing. Moving your early troops out
to secure resources on the map, and defend them, is the main strategy
that drives the game. Because you can win the game by holding more of
the map instead of just annihilating your enemy, games are often
ongoing, head to head confrontations for control of points of the map. <br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">GRAPHICS 
</span><br>

<br>
Relic Entertainment made it very clear, they like strategy games and
RTS's, but they also wanted to do something more visual than other
companies. With the choice of Squad vs. Squad combat, they knew their
approach to how you see battle needed to be different. <br>

<br>
Dawn of War takes a 3d perspectice to the battlefield. What's great is,
they allow you to rotate and control the camera just about how ever you
want. Want to zoom RIGHT in on a unit's face? No problem! Want to watch
the slaughter from ground level where your troops are fighting? Go for
it! <br>
It's a great joy to see DoW in action at the up close and personal
level. Thats because alot of focus in DoW goes towards the unit
animations, and the textures of the models. <br>

<br>
With the addition of close combat fighting in dawn of war, as well as
ranged fire, Relic took a bold step and mapped each unit to behave as
an individual within the squad. That means when your units are duking
it out in hand to hand with the swords, they are animated to react to
each other. When a unit kills another, it does one of many unique
finishing moves. So combat looks like real combat, instead of just 30
identical drones doing the same thing. Some of the most impressive
animations come from the leaders and walker vehicles. As a walker
finishes as infantry unit, they grind them in their hands in a
spectacular spray of blood, casting aside their mangled corspe. The
leader of the Space Marines will climb atop a demon's head and bash
it's brains in while his force hammer. <br>

<br>
Relic also included some collision and motion physics to the game, so
that artillery sends units flying everywhere, even high up into the
sky. Characters knock back a swarm of enemies with one swipe, launching
them all backwards. <br>

<br>
So you might be asking at this point.....how the hell am I supposed to
enjoy all this camera angling and unit squishing and such while playing
the game? Currently all that is available is the ability to pause the
game (while still issuing commands) so that you can capture a snap shot
of the action. Fans (including myself) have clamored for a slow motion
toggle so you can watch the battle moving, but Relic has not introduced
this as of yet, probably for balance reasons. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">THEME 
</span><br>

<br>
As a table top Warhammer player, Dawn of War hits a very, very sweet
spot for me. The Warhammer universe is vast, with tons of extra detail,
background, and flavor along with it (known to warhammer players as
"fluff"). Anyone who likes(or loves!) Warhammer has to check this game
out, as it is one of the best presentations of the Warhammer property
in a video game. <br>

<br>
But you don't have to be a warhammer fan to get into Dawn of War. In
translation to an RTS, the units are all documented in a way that any
RTS player will recognize. And if you can't get into the twisted,
bloodsoaked, battle hardened warhammer universe, you don't have a pulse
<br>

<br>
The game enviroments run from runied cities full of blasted statuary
and crumbling buildings, to grassy jungle like settings, and more, all
skinned and textured to capture the feel of Warhammer.. Being in beta,
we were only exposed to about 1/3 of the maps, and no single player
maps, so what I actually know of level designs and appearances is
pretty limited. <br>

<br>
ANALYSIS 
<br>

<br>

<br>
Sound: The sound hits the right notes for the game Relic has produced,
capturing the dark moodiness of the Warhammer world, the deafening roar
of combat, and the agonized screams of the dying. No complaints here. <br>

<br>
Gameplay: Some in beta(there are always a few) claim that DoW is just
another RTS, and that nothing is different, and that strategies are
narrow. I have to say, I disagree almost completely. Strategy seems
limited at first, but as you grow into the game and get comfortable
with the aggressive play, new strategies present themselves every day. <br>

<br>
Personally, I suck at competitive RTS gaming. And yet, I've gotten
fairly good at DoW(66% win ratio) and I play the game as it was
intended, with lots of squads and some small back up from vehicles,
with diversity. So I know that not all the complaints are valid. If I
can win at an RTS game, anyone can do it with the right moves. I'm very
satisfied with Dawn of War's game play. The battles are fun, and very
active, enough to keep the micro manager happy, while visual enough to
keep the relaxed highly entertained. <br>

<br>
Graphics: One of Dawn of War's strongest points. The models are well
done, and contain a lot of detail. Being able to swivel the camera
around is just so cool, especially with all the massed combat. The gun
fire, lasers, artillery, explosions, and all the close combat
animations, give Dawn of War battles a very visceral feel, more so that
most of the other RTS's I've played. There is a real danger in Dawn of
War of watching too much of the game instead of playing it(against
people anyways). <br>

<br>
One of the coolest features is the army painter, where you can color
your units, and attach custom badges and battle standards to them.
Table top warhammer is as much a model painting hobby as it is a game,
and so this is a feature that gets alot of us table top players
excited, being able to field our own special armies in a video game. <br>

<br>Theme: Not much to say here that I haven't said already. The theme
of
Warhammer and much of it's fluff and story was the guiding light for
Dawn of War. Many if not most of their design decisions that took their
lead from the table top game. The&nbsp; actual&nbsp; game mechanics do
not&nbsp; reflect the table top game, they are based off an RTS model,
so if you are a hardcore fan of the <span style="font-weight:bold">table top game system</span>,
Dawn of War will disapoint you in that aspect. However if you love the
theme, look, and feel of 40k, then the Emperor demands you go out and
buy Dawn of War right now. <br>
<br>
Relic really did Warhammer justice with this latest production. 
<br>

<br><span style="font-weight:bold">
PREFORMANCE: 
</span><br>

<br>
Here's where my problems start to arise with Dawn of War. The game
demands alot of your system to put out all those units doing their own
things and all the lights and colors. Currently in the beta, overall
preformance, even on top rigs, is an issue. By scaling down the
textures and resolution, lower end computers can still play Dawn of War
pretty well, but very very few people play the game and have it run
"perfect". <br>

<br>
A lot of this is due in part to the insane amount of texturing Dawn of
War has. In addition to all the individual unit, building, and
enviroment textures, when players start making custom paint jobs and
badges to use in game, the load times become monstrous. In order to
achieve better preformance for everyone playing the multiplayer, custom
badges and banners had the resolution forced down, and all players are
forced down a level of detail. <br>
<br>
While this has not solved all the preformance issues, it has helped. On
a AMD 2600+ Barton, GeforceFX5900XT, and 512 DDR ram, multiplayer runs
fairly well for me, with some slight hitching and hang ups in mass
battles, mainly due to other people's lag. In the single player
tutorial beta testers get, my preformance is not so hot, surprisingly.
With full details on, and all texture levels accounted for, by the time
there are many many units on the screen, the frames noticably suffer.
This is one of those things I hope gets ironed out in release, as
there's no better way to kill your game that having crappy preformance
out of the box. <br>

<br>

Final thoughts: 
<br>

<br>
Not very often do I get to review a game this much, while still in
beta(short as it may be now). While I've only played one map against the
comp on single player, and played a bunch of the MP, there is stiill a
whole single player game, based around the Space Marines. Relic did
only one race because they wanted to deliver a strong story to go along
with the single player. If the rest of game is an indicator, the single
player story will prove to be a dark, war torn slaughter fest, just
like the rest of 40k. <br>

<br>
In case you haven't noticed, I'm pretty taken with the game. That says
alot for me when WC3 kept me entertained for all of 3 days, modding and
all. I believe that Dawn of War is a solid, fun game, and it's only
hitch right now is the lack of solid preformance. If Relic can get that
tied up, they will deliver a game that I think will turn the heads of
people walking through the computer games section. <br>
