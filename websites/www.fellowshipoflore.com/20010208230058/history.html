    is dusk and the party of hunters having successfully cleared out a nest of hellish orcs,
    finds safety and sets camp for the night. Seated round the fire, they chat of days long
    past as they mend the rips in their armor and clean their weapons as best they can. Meager
    rations are consumed to ease the pangs of hunger as the fire warms them.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>S</big></big></strong></font>wapping
    stories of hunting in the East Forest of Death and surviving the Killing Fields, the
    voices of Enomar, Ragnoc and EinRedOak rise above the others in excitement and
    laughter&#133;but slowly fade into silence as they one by one realize that was long ago in
    another world and they can never return. </font></p>

    young lad sits shivering&#133;slightly apart from the others...knees drawn tight to his
    chest, arms clasp around them, he rest his chin there staring into the dancing flames as
    he begins to be warmed by&nbsp; them. He had refused the offers of food and drink from the
    others and is now sorry, for the hollow feeling in the pit of his stomach has become an
    angry knot.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><big><big><strong>S</strong></big></big></font>eeing
    the lad&#146;s discomfort spread across his face Bartk, saying nothing, hands him a small
    strip of leathered meat and a roll. &quot;Come lad&#133;ya must eat somethin&#146; or
    yu&#146;ll faint away ta nothin&#146;. We didn&#146;t go ta all the trouble of savin&#146;
    ya from tha orcs ta have ya get sick on us now.&quot; With a gentle smile Bartk drapes his
    cloak around the boy, tousles his matted auburn hair and sitting on the ground, leans back against
    the trunk of a tree.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>A</big></big></strong></font>s
    he lights a long stemmed clay pipe, which he has produced from his pouch...his eyes close
    remembering his homeland and he wonders what this new world will bring.</font></p>

    is late now and Bartk has drawn first watch&#133;the fire is burning low and as he stares
    off into the night, he hears a faint sobbing. It is the young boy. Walking to the
    lad&#146;s huddled body, Bartk picks him up, gently carries him closer to the fire rubs
    his tiny limbs to warm them and smiles. &quot;What is it lad? What troubling ya? Ya
    scared?&quot; he questions. The boy nods. &quot;No need ta be&#133;we are all noble and
    honorable people. What&#146;s yer name lad?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;D</big></big></strong></font>on&#146;t

    lad shakes his head sadly.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;T</big></big></strong></font>hey
    must call ya somethin&#146;?&quot; Bartk looks surprised.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;B</big></big></strong></font>oy&#133;
    they just call...<em>called</em> me &#145;Boy&#146;, the lads sighs. We are&#133;<i>were</i>&#133;&quot;
    tears start to well in his eyes as his voice trails off. The pain of seeing his family
    killed just days before by orcs is still very fresh. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;T</big></big></strong></font>hen
    I shall call ya &#145;Dunkan&#146; after the Queen&#146;s lost grandson,&quot; Bartk
    smiles as he stokes the fire and adds another log. &quot;And yu young Dunkan need to get
    some rest.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;Q</big></big></strong></font>ueen?&quot;
    the lad&#146;s eyes widen, you know a real QUEEN? And where is the &quot;Forest of
    Death&#146;&#133;and what are the Killing Fields?&quot; Suddenly the boy&nbsp; becomes
    very animated...asking questions one on top of the other.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>S</big></big></strong></font>auvage
    stretches, walks up to the pair and rubs the sleep from his eyes. &quot;Hail
    brother,&quot; he greets Bartk, &quot;Your watch is over, &#145;tis my turn.&quot; Pulling
    a cup from his knapsack, he dips it into the pot liquid being warmed by the fire and
    begins to sip from it slowly.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;W</big></big></strong></font>ait!&quot;
    the young boy tugs on Bartk&#146;s arm. &quot;You can&#146;t leave now&#133;tell me of
    your queen and of the Forest of Death&#133;oh it sounds so scary...and the Killing
    Fields,&quot; he shudders as he thinks of such a place.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>B</big></big></strong></font>artk&#146;s
    eyes sparkle as they meet Sauvage&#146;s. &quot;Well brother &#145;twould seem we have a
    willing listener. I think we should tell him a tale or two.&quot; And with that he stares
    deeply into the fire and begins.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;I</big></big></strong></font>n
    another land surrounded by mist, there be a realm we call &#145;home&#146;. In tha heart
    of this realm is a great keep&#133;one that houses a guild made up of brothers and sisters
    of different races&#133;colors&#133;professions. This guild is lead by a wonderful woman
    who is tha soul and tha essence of tha guild she serves.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;T</big></big></strong></font>his
    mighty guild is known throughout tha land for tha kindness it bestows upon other citizens
    and for it&#146;s protection of tha citizens from harmful evil forces. But most of all it
    is known for tha code of honor it follows. That great guild is tha Lords of Retribution
    and it&#146;s leader is Queen Yasmin.&quot; Bartk smiles warmly at the thought of the land
    he has left behind.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;T</big></big></strong></font>here
    are many forests and glades there young one,&quot; Sauvage begins &quot;and many creatures
    to hunt&#133;ogres&#133;trolls&#133;daemons&#133;banshees&#133;evil things. There is a
    fierce giant creature named Fuloran that many have battled.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>T</big></big></strong></font>he
    lad&#146;s eyes widen and his mouth falls open as he pulls Bartk&#146;s cloak around him
    and scoots a little closer to the two story tellers. &quot;What&#133; what happened? How
    did you get here? Why are you here?&quot; he asks.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;T</big></big></strong></font>he
    lands began to fail&#133;there was not enough to support all the citizens,&quot; Sauvage
    replies sadly. &quot;There were evil citizens that tried to become the most wealthy
    by cheating the honest citizens, they were tearing at the very fabric of our
    world&#133;and many of us decided it was time to leave&#133;time to search for a new home.
    Queen Yasmin sent us forth with her blessings, calling us 'path finders' to look for new
    lands to settle. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;S</big></big></strong></font>o
    here we are young one&#133;in this land called Norrath,&quot; Sauvage gestures in the
    direction of the lands around him, a large smiles spreading across his face.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;A</big></big></strong></font>nd
    your Queen, Sauvage? What of your Queen?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;S</big></big></strong></font>he
    pledged to stay behind until all are out safely,&quot; Sauvage stares at the stars in the
    night sky above and offers a tiny prayer that she and those behind are safe.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;H</big></big></strong></font>ere
    we have chosen ta honor our heritage by establishin' a new guild in this land. One governed by
    tha same beliefs as our mother guild and the same ancient code of honor,&quot; Bartk turns
    to the lad and smiles. &quot;Here we are known as tha 'Fellowship of LoRE.' We constantly
    searchin' for our lost brothers and sisters&#133;as many left before us and many more have
    followed. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;S</big></big></strong></font>ome
    we have found&#133;they have either started their own fellowships or have joined others.
    Some are still lost to us&#133;but we shall find them. As we travel the lands of Norrath
    our guild grows, for there are many in this land that conduct their lives by tha same code
    of honor that dwells deep within tha heart of every LoREian,&quot; Bartk concludes with
    pride. </font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>S</big></big></strong></font>lowly
    Sauvage touches Bartk&#146;s shoulder and motions for him to look down. There, curled
    beneath the cloak of a noble man, the young lad is fast asleep, his head upon his ragged
    knapsack.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#400000"><font face="Freefrm721 BT"><strong><big><big>&quot;H</big></big></strong></font>e
