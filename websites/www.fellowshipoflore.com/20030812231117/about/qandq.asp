			<b>How Did I Get To Netster.com?</b>
			<br>
			You may have arrived at this site because you mistyped your desired Internet 
			address or domain name, or the web site you are seeking may not be operational. 
			Please make sure you typed the address or domain name correctly. 
			You may use the "Back" button on your browser to return to your previous page, 
			or you may use our search engine to find your intended destination.  
			<br><br>
			Through the use of automated methods, we routinely identify and acquire expired domain names. 
			Those domain names are directed to our main home page <a href="http://www.netster.com">www.netster.com</a>.  
			There you can search over three billion Web pages that our search engines examine to find what you are 
			looking for.  You may also have reached us through one of our affiliates or via a webmaster who has 
			placed a free search box or link on a site unrelated to Netster.com.  
			That link is offered at <a href="http://www.netster.com/addtosite/start.asp">http://www.netster.com/addtosite/start.asp</a>
			<br><br>
			<b>Privacy Policy</b>
			<br>
			Netster.com does not collect any data on its users, either for its own use or to sell to others.  
			To read more about our strict privacy policy – to which we adhere 100% of the time – 
			please go to <a href="http://www.netster.com/about/privacy.asp">http://www.netster.com/about/privacy.asp</a>
			<br><br>
			<b>I Think I Have Trademark Rights In A Netster.com Domain Name</b>
			<br>
			Netster.com acquires expired domain names through automated methods, not by targeting specific terms, 
			names, or marks.  It is our company policy to transfer a domain name to any person or company that, 
			in our reasonable opinion, has a legitimate claim to that domain name. We will gladly transfer a 
			domain name to you if you demonstrate to us that you have a legitimate claim to it, taking into 
			consideration federal trademark registrations, state trademark registrations and demonstrable 
			common law rights.  We do not sell domain names.  To inquire about one of our domain names, 
			please go to: <a href="http://www.netster.com/about/inquire.asp">http://www.netster.com/about/inquire.asp</a>
			<br><br>
			<b>I Don't Want To Receive Netster.com Pop-Up Windows</b>
			<br>
			Netster.com from time to time <b>WILL</b> serve pop-under / pop-up ads.  
			<b>You will never again see a pop-under from Netster.com if you decide to make Netster.com 
			your home page.</b>  However, most of the complaints we receive are from pop-under ads that 
			are being served by third parties. Users often forget that they have installed software on their 
			system that serve these ads regardless which website they are at.  Some users are completely 
			unaware that they agreed for “ad ware” to be placed on their system in exchange for free software.  
			We do <b><u>NOT</u></b> bundle any  “ad ware” with our free Netster&#8482; SmartBrowse Toolbar, <b>NOR</b> do we collect user data. 
			<br><br>
			In the course of picking up expired domain names, we occasionally acquire a domain that may have been 
			used previously by third parties in unethical or even illegal ways, unbeknownst to us.  An example 
			of this is where the former owner of the domain name caused "spy ware" and/or other unauthorized 
			computer code to be placed on your computer, which is now transmitting messages to us as the 
			new owners of the domain.  Please understand Netster.com did NOT place any such computer code 
			or spy ware on your system, <b>NOR do we collect</b> any data originating from any such code or spy ware.  
			<br><br>
			There are various programs, free as well as fee-based, you can use to remove unwanted
			software from your system.  You can find a variety of these by performing a search under 
			"spy ware removal" using the Netster.com search engine.  
			Our free Netster&#8482; SmartBrowse toolbar is another handy search tool with many great features: 
			it can be downloaded at: <a href="http://www.netster.com/smartbrowse/promo.asp">http://www.netster.com/smartbrowse/promo.asp</a>. 
			We are currently working to develop free spy ware removal programs as well as pop-under 
			blocker software that we hope will one day be incorporated and automatically updated 
			in the Netster&#8482; SmartBrowse toolbar.  
			<br><br>
			<b>I Think I've Been Spammed by Netster.com</b>	
			<br>
			In the course of picking up expired domain names, we occasionally acquire a domain that may have been 
			used previously by third parties as the "remove" or sometimes "from" address in Spam sent by people 
			unrelated to Netster.com.  We are very much opposed to spamming, and we do not and never have engaged 
			in this practice.  Some unethical spammers use fictitious links and/or redirecting characters in the 
			"from" and or "reply to" section of an offending e-mail to try to fool people into believing that 
			the origin of the e-mail is different than it really is.  We assure you we are not the source of 
			any Spam you might receive, even if Netster.com is shown as the address in the "remove," "from" 
			or "reply to" section of the e-mail.  We do not Spam, PERIOD!  To learn more about how Spam 
			can appear to come from a source other than the actual sender, please <a href="pcspam.asp">click here</a>.  
			Please help us combat any false appearance that Spam has originated from Netster.com.  If you have 
			received any such Spam,  please forward it to us at <a href="mailto: technical@netster.com">technical@netster.com</a>, 
			so we can try to track it down and end it. To learn more about how spammers obscure their identity, 
			please <A href="http://www.pc-help.org/obscure.htm" target="_blank">click here</a>.
			Please carefully research a Spam e-mail before making any accusations or attributing blame, 
			as accusing a reputable Internet company of sending Spam is akin to yelling fire in a crowded theatre.
