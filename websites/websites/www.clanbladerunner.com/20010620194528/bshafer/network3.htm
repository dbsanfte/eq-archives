<TD VALIGN=TOP>After you get your pc's connected the way you want, you
must configure your machine's software. Inside Windows 95, you must go
into the control panel, and double click on the "Add New Hardware" icon,
let windows search for the network card, and make sure the parameters are
set right. The best settings I have found, are --interupt 10, and I/O address
300. Most network cards that you buy now, are software configurable. That
means you use the manufacturer's software to set the parameters in the
network card's ROM. If windows 95 doesn't detect your card correctly, or
not at all, you can add it yourself, making sure you set the right parameters.
Don't reboot yet, you have to set the protocols.

<P>Double click on the "Network" icon. Click on "add", then choose "Client",
then choose "Client for Microsoft Networks". Click on "OK". Don't reboot
till we are done.&nbsp;

<P>Click on "add", then choose "protocol". Under "Manufacturer", click
on Microsoft. You will see 4 different protocols to choose from. Choose
"TCP/IP".&nbsp;

<P>Next, you need to choose the parameters of the TCP/IP software. If it
is an internal network, and you are not going out on the internet from
your home or small business, you can just make up consecutive ip addresses.
Like 123.123.123.1-10, each ending number being different for each machine.
The range of numbers between each "period" is 1-255.&nbsp;

<P>Click on the "advanced" tab, and check "set this as your default protocol".&nbsp;

<P>Click on "OK".

<P>Go back to the configurations tab, under "Network".&nbsp;

<P>Click on "Add" again, and choose "service". Click on "Microsoft", then
"File and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks". Click "OK".

<P>Now you should be done with the software. Do this for all of your machines,
when you are finished, reboot both of them. After they come back up, double
click on the "Network Neighborhood" icon, and see if you can see the other
pc's on the network.</TD>
