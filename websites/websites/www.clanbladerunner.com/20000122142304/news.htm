<br><a href="mailto:milamber@clanbladerunner.com">Milamber</a> was kind
enough to make a cool menu for us that you see to the left of the page.&nbsp;
We tried it as both tables and frames, and decided that it looked better
with the frames version of the page, so, the frames are back in now.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.clanbladerunner.com/rogathor/">Chessie page</a> has
been finished, and it really looks good.&nbsp; If you aren't on the main
members page, then please <a href="mailto:rogathor@clanbladerunner.com?subject=Members Page">EMAIL</a>
roggy, and send him your information.&nbsp; ICQ and IRC is not good enough
for this... You have to email him.&nbsp; I think Milamber and Rogathor
are gonna get together and make a full members page utilizing the Flash
plugin.&nbsp; If you don't have the newest version of netscape, you'll
have to download the plugin.&nbsp; It comes with the newest version already
installed though.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the updates section for the latest
news on the page.
<br>Thanks!

<br>Removed the frames and redid the page.&nbsp; <a href="feedback.htm">Let
me know</a> if you prefer the old version better. This page utilizes tables
instead of frames.&nbsp; Chesapeake page being created as we speak by <a href="mailto:rogathor@clanbladerunner.com?subject=Members Page">Rogathor</a>.&nbsp;
Please get with him as soon as possible and give him your information.&nbsp;
He will also be maintaining the members page for the entire clan.
<br>Thanks!

<br>The Catskills Members page has been moved to the server now, and will
be updated shortly.&nbsp; Most of the email and ftp accounts have been
set up, with the exception of a few stragglers that are difficult to get
in touch with.&nbsp; Muna and Yavin, I need your information before I can
finish setting up your accounts.&nbsp; Please get with me soon, or email
me at the email address below.
