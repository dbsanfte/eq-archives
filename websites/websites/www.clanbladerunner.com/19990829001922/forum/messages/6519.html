Hola!<p>You probably didn't miss me, but I've been in Florida for the past week and a half.  I just wanted to say that I will be in Fargo, ND for another week next month (I think I leave on the 13th).  If anybody lives close by and wants to make plans to meet me up there, LMK and hopefully we can work something out.  I will be there on business because the company who produces the accounting package I modify will be holding a technical conferance. I will also be there for 2 days of classes.  Except for my first day (I'll be staying in Morehead), my room should be the same as last time and I'll have a pull-out couch, fridge, microwave, and extra TV for anyone who wants to crash (just don't touch my toothpaste).  I'll be happy to buy dinner for anyone who wants to make the trip :) .<p>See ya,<br>GIP<br>aka Mitch
