<TD>When you are starting a network with ethernet (RJ-45), which is 8 wire
cable, much like the 4 wire telephone cord you use, you will need a hub
of some sort. You can get a hub at most second hand computer stores, or
parts store pretty cheap. Here in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area, we have a
thing called the "Saturday Sale". It is a place where you go on the first
Saturday of every month, starting at midnight on Friday. It has EVERYTHING
you will ever need for computers, as far as networking, parts for building
your own computer, and even whole pc's. Everything there is a hell of a
discount from most stores because they are"liquidating". I'm pretty sure
most big metropolitan area has an equal thing somewhere. Just check around
in any computer store, and they will tell you.

<P>While you are there, you can pick up ethernet cards pretty cheap also.
But I would recommend going to Computer City for the cards. Much more reliable
and probably pretty close to the same price. You will also need to buy
the cable. You can probably pick it up at Computer City, also. It MUST
be 8 wire. Don't spend your money on anything else. Make sure the wires
inside the cabling are color coded. It is very important!!

<P>If you have more than 5 pc's that you want to network, find a general
area somewhere within 300 or so feet from each pc. Ethernet can only transmit
aproximately 328 feet. I suggest staying under the 300 mark. Once you have
your place picked out, install the hub there. This will be your "network
closet". For each node you expand, you can always install another hub and
connect the two together. (more on that later).

<P>Install your network cards in the pc's. Don't worry about configuring
the machines yet, let's make sure they are connected, and that we have
link lights.&nbsp;

<P>Once you have the hubs installed, and you have the network cards in
the machines, you will have to run the cables. If you are spanning more
than one room, you will want to go up the wall, and over the ceiling tiles.
When you reach the network closet, cut the wire, but be sure to leave enough
excess to make a few "mistakes" in the wiring of the RJ-45 ends. :) Also,
mark the cables at both ends to let you know where they are going. If you
have alot of hubs, then mark the cable at the pc to let you know which
hub and which port you are connecting to (very important).&nbsp;

<P>When wiring the RJ-45 ends to the cable, you want to "flip" your eight
wires. You can use any color code that you want, just make sure that the
first all the way thru to the eighth wire is the same with every RJ-45
end that you use. When you put on the head, at one end of the wire, put
it on with the clip down, at the other end, put it on with the clip up.
so that 1 is 8, 2 is 7, 3 is 6, and 4 is 5 on the other end. That is what
we call "flipped".&nbsp;

<P>After you have your cables run, plug each one into the card in the pc,
and the other end into the hub at the network card. You should see some
kind of light on the hub to see if it can "see" the pc. If you don't see
the light (most cases green), then just redo your RJ-45 ends. That is probably
the culprit. You should also see a light or two on your network card. If
you see a light on only one device, it is probably communicating with the
other, but the other is not communicating with it. That means that your
transmit is working and not your recieve. Again, redo your RJ-45 end and
it will fix it.

<P>Continue this procedure for each device you have that you want networked.
If you have more than one hub, you can "daisy chain" the two. On the hub,
you should have some sort of "network feed" on one of the ports (probably
the last port) just plug the two together with a short cable wired the
same way, and they will talk to each other like the pc to the hub.</TD>
