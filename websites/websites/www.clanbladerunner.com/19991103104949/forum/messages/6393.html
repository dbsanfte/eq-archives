I've played EQ now for awhile, my mage was upto level 6 and I have a level 7 rogue.   But I'm not having fun in the game.  <p>Its too much like a 3D diablo.  I quit diablo in a few weeks because of the same reasons.  I DON'T like hack'n slash games.  And I was either bored or frustrated the whole time playing..  Maybe I would enjoy the game after level *whatever* but I don't want to invest the time in a game that I think is repetative and boring.  <p><br>I figured most of you guys would love this game.  I liked it when I first got it alot.  I knew the Non Macroers would love it, Muna, Gipnor, Yavin, etc.  I had them marked because most of them idolized Diablo as one of the best games.  For some reason thier rants always pissed me off.  Nothing against them I just try not to judge on peoples game methods.<p>But the person I REALY thought that would like EQ for a week or maybe two woulda been Senior Billy.  War, I realy thought you woulda tired of the game after popping third or maybe 5th level.  Ohh well I can't get them all right ;)<p>Ohh well, Enough Ranting.  I'll see ya all in IRC probably..  But I burned myself copy of HOMM3 and I'm realy enjoying the game.  And Of course I still play UO about 30 minutes a night just to mine, restock the vendor and help 2 newbie friends.<p>That reminds me, as a last thing, Billy could you remove the vendor from My BR island house in UO.  I want to give the house away but I can't because of the vendor (or at least they can't lock the door)<p><br>Catcha all later, Achillies
