  <p align="center"><b><font size="6">Darkforge Armor Quest</font></b></p>
  <p>When Rubicite was removed from the game, Verant decided to replace it with 
    class specific armor for each of the classes that could wear it. Darkforge 
    armor is the Shadowknight equivalent. It offers great armor class, and some 
    fair stat bonuses. There are two quest givers for this armor, and they are 
    both located in the Temple of Solusek Ro (located near the Solusek Dungeons 
    in Lavastorm) on the top floor on the north side. They are both in the same 
    room, and are both called &quot;Undead Knight&quot;. One Knight gives the 
    Boots, Gauntlets, and Greaves quest, and the other gives the Vambraces, Bracers, 
    Breastplate, and Helm quests. Each piece requires two pieces of decayed armor, 
    and some additional items.</p>
  <p>As the Undead Knight indicates, the Decaying armor pieces are won from Lizardman 
    Crusaders, who happen to spawn in the Cazic Thule zone off of Feerrott. They 
    are approximately level 35-37, and spawn at the TR2, Avatar, Archon, and Temple 
    spawn points. When I say temple, I mean the temple beyond the Pit, though 
    this is the location where they are most rare. The Decaying loot is No Drop 
    and Lore.</p>
  <p><i><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b></i></p>
  <p><i>When giving items to the Undead Knight, make sure they are NOT stacked. 
    For example, if you are completing the Darkforge Breastplate quest, you will 
    give the Knight the Decayed Breastplate, the Decayed Mail, and in each of 
    the slots in the Give window, put ONE Enchanted Platinum Bar. If you put 2 
    bars stacked in one slot, you will lose the items and be really pissed off.</i></p>

  <p>The armor pieces have the following requirements:</p>
  <p><b><a href="../armor/images/darkforge_helm.htm">Darkforge Helm</a></b> - 
    Decayed Helm, Decayed Visor, two Freeport Militia Helms</p>
  <p>Freeport Militia Helm - obtained by slaying Freeport Guards. The item will 
    appear in your inventory as a Damaged Militia Helm. They are not wearable. 
    The guards are hunted by players in their 40's, and if you cannot slay them, 
    you can probably get a PC to let you loot them as they are very commonly dropped. 
    Outside the gates to East Freeport is a good place to do this.</p>
  <p><b><a href="../armor/images/darkforge_breastplate.htm">Darkforge Breastplate</a> 
    </b>- Decayed Breastplate, Decayed Mail, two Enchanted Platinum Bars</p>
  <p>Enchanted Platinum Bars - obtained by purchasing a platinum bar and having 
    an Enchanter PC cast Enchant Platinum on it</p>
  <p><b><a href="../armor/images/darkforge_vambraces.htm">Darkforge Vambraces</a></b> 
    - Decayed Right Vambrace, Decayed Left Vambrace, Qeynos Kite Shield</p>
  <p>Qeynos Kite Shield - this shield is used by the Qeynos guards. If the guard 
    has one, you will see him using it. It is a shield with a yellow, red, and 
    green emblem on it.</p>
  <p><b><a href="../armor/images/darkforge_bracer.htm">Darkforge Bracers</a></b> 
    - Decayed Right Bracer, Decayed Left Bracer, Broken Minotaur Lord Horn</p>
  <p>Broken Minotaur Lord Horn - These can be obtained by slaying the Minotaur 
    Lords which frequent the Mintoaur Caves of the Necromancer Meldrath, in Steamfont. 
    They spawn at various locations in the dungeon, and are level 35.</p>
  <p><b><a href="../armor/images/darkforge_gauntlets.htm">Darkforge Gauntlets</a></b>

  <p>Melatite - This is an ore that can be found on various clockwork Gnomes in 
    the employ of the Solusek Mining Company. Currently, the mining company is 
    working in Solusek's Eye (Solusek A). The ore definitely drops on models MB 
    and MC, though rumor has it that it also drops on C class Clockworks that 
    guard the Gnomish stronghold.</p>
