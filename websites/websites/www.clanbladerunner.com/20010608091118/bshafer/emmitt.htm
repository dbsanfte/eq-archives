<P><B>Emmitt Smith is the starting running back for the Dallas Cowboys.
He was drafted in 1990 in the first round out of Florida State University
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">(stat from Kevin, at bottom)</FONT>. I've been watching
Emmitt since he started with the Cowboys. I Loved the way he ran the football.
There was nothing that was gonna stop him from getting to the end zone.
He was by far, the best running back in the NFL since Payton. He would
blast thru the line like a lightning bolt, and run like hell. He always
had a great persona on the field, as well. No matter what happened to him,
who tackled him, or what they said would make him lose his edge. Always
a great attitude towards all on the field. He was a great role model for
all. </B></P>

<P><B>Then one day, he was at the negotiating table with good 'ol Jerry
Jones. Mr. Jones decided that he was gonna do what it took to make sure
Emmitt would be with the Cowboys forever. And he did. He gave Emmitt the
largest contract ever made. I don't know the details, shit, I can't even
remember how much the contract was worth. All I know is that Emmitt is
now the biggest pussy in the NFL. I am sorry, but that is my opinion. He
runs like a girl, falls down every chance he gets, and I swear to god,
if he gets hurt one more time.... Anyway, you get my point. </B></P>

<P><B>It seems to me that ever since he has signed this new multi-freakin
super million dollar contract, he has fallen down on the job. He gets hurt
on damn near every stinkin play, and probably is thinking &quot;I wonder
who will make a big deal out of me now.&quot; while he is laying on the
astro turf. The only thing that is the same about the Emmitt of today,
compared to the Emmitt of yesteryear, is his attitude. I have to give credit
where credit is due. If you notice during the game, after every tackle,
he either pats the guy on the head, tells 'em &quot;good job&quot;, or
something. I like that. You don't see many of the pro's with an attitude
like that.</B></P>

<P><B>If you don't like my comments, go somewhere else. If you like to
comment on my opinions, drop me a line, and I will post 'em no matter what
they say. Like myself, everyone has a right to their opinion.</B></P>

<P>Better check your stat on that one. I believe Emmitt was a Gator.

<P>Kevin, </P>

<P>I don't know if you agree with my opinion, but I wish to thank you for
taking the time to go to my page. Next thing, I have been informed by several
of my colleages at work that I was wrong with that information. I had been
contemplating the Emmitt page for several weeks before I wrote it, and
tried whole heartedly to talk myself out of it. I sat patiently during
each game hoping for some kind of influence to change my mind, but it never
happened. I was so upset the day I wrote it, that I had not investigated
fully, or for that matter, at all. I do apologize for my laziness. Thank
you for your response. I will make the changes soon, and post your name
as a reference. </P>

<P>Billy,</P>

<P>No need to apologize. Nice to find another Emmitt (and hopefully Cowboy?)
fan out there. Page looks good so far, btw. There are plenty of stats on
him that can be found, also. I have a few, or you can just search on his
name.</P>

<P>trying to get inspired this season. Yea, their play has been lackluster
(on offense). I am hoping to get the real Cowboys back this Sat against
Minn.</P>

<P>Take care, and Happy Holidays!</P>

<P>When you put the pads on then you can by all means call anyone in the
National Football League a &quot;pussy.&quot; Until then, step off!!!!

<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>obviously, you dumb ass, you didn't read the whole thing, i said it
was my opinion, and i have a friggin right. so you step off..... and when
have i seen your name on MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, your email is lady5, so
you've never played a game in your life, your a chic. so kiss my ass.</P>

<P>:)</P>

<P>Billy Shafer 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>Mr. Shafer,</P>

<P>You are 100% correct, it is your opinion and you have the right to say
whatever you please. However, if you don't want anyone to respond to your
statements, then you should not invite them to. Ironically, you spend your
time insulting me (unprovoked I might add) and questioning my name on the
Monday Night Football roster, when I cannot recall ever seeing your name
either. Obviously my statements struck a nerve. Perhaps your desire and
inability to play football has filled your miserable life with bitterness
and the only way you can get through your day is by insulting others. </P>

<P>Finally, for future reference, I am a LADY, not a &quot;chic&quot; or
a &quot;dumb ass&quot;. And no, I have never played football. I guess that
is why I respect what players such as Emmitt Smith does on the football
field, especially since I know that I can't (and obviously you can't either
otherwise you wouldn't be spending all your time trashing one player and
insulting the opinions of others). Realizing that I cannot and never will
be able to play football and do what Emmitt does on the football field,
I have enough common sense not to criticize his preformance. And since
I am at least &quot;WOMAN&quot; enough to admit what I cannot do, even
I &quot;STEP OFF&quot;. Perhaps you should try being WOMAN enough to admit
that you cannot perform either because you obviously aren't MAN enough
to. And until I see your name on MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, I repeat, STEP
OFF!!!!!!!!!!!! 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>Mrs. Robinson,</P>

<P>I wish to apologize about insulting you the other night in the e-mail.
I was wrong and Im sorry. You were rather rude about my comments that again,
are my opinion. I am a die hard Cowboys fan, and I always will be. I would
love to see Emmitt at his fullest potential, but I don't believe he ever
will be again. And It's a total shame. He was such an excellent running
back. Try watching the difference between the way he runs now, this season
as a whole, compared to the way he ran a couple of years ago. There is
a very big difference, and I believe alot of it has to do with the huge
amount of money he is getting paid. And again, that is my OPINION. I am
not trying to provoke you in any way, just stating my thoughts. That is
what makes this country great, and I know you will agree with me on that.</P>

<P>Billy Shafer 
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>Mr. Shafer,</P>

<P>I have read both your messages and I accept your apology. I also apologize
for coming off too strong and like I acknowledged in my last message, you
are entitled to your opinion. Judging from your comments and the swiftness
in which you responded to my initial comment, I have dedeuced that we are
both passionate football fans and we both are quick to defend our position
on this great sport. And while I may not be a die hard Cowboy fan, I am
a big Emmitt Smith fan. I also will acknowledge that you are correct in
your assessment that he has lost his step, and I agree that it is too bad.</P>

<P>I don't have to check your web page to see if the messages were posted
because judging by the last messages you sent, I trust that you are an
honorable man. I was wrong to question your manhood and you have proven
that you are not only a man but a &quot;GENTLEMAN.&quot; Good luck on your
web page and hopefully Emmitt will continue to enjoy great success (I think
he needs rest more than anything because the Cowboys have played more games
than any other team in the NFL with the three Super Bowls in four years,
play off games, pro bowl games, etc.). </P>

<P>RedTide,</P>

<P>Thanks for the commments and the stats. I'm glad you don't agree with
me. If everyone agreed with me, Emmitt would not be in the NFL anymore.
I do Like watching him play, I love the Cowboys, and enjoy NFL football
tremendously. I think if Emmitt took a half a season, at least, including
the offtime, his performance would be 100% better.</P>

<P>Thanks again,</P>
