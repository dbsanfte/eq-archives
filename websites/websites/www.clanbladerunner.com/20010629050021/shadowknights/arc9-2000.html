Per user submission, I fixed the <a href="quests/wurmslayer_quest.htm">Wurmslayer quest</a> info.  I had a few people email me and let me know that I had the wrong info for "Tektite" listed.  My apologies for not listing the names of those who let me know... my email is at home. =(<br><br>Thanks for the help. =)<br><br><hr>

I've finally got around to adding the <a href="quests/sledge_mallet.htm">Worker's Sledgemallet quest</a> to the quests section.  This is a really nice hammer, and it's one of the reason's you don't want to ruin your faction with the outpost (Venril Sathir)<br><br><hr>

Well, the big move has happened...<br><br>Abashi has officially been promoted to assistant producer for the Scars of Velious expansion, and a new guy, "Absor", has replaced him.  Absor was the editor of "<a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com/">Everquest Express</a>", an online newspaper about EQ.  I hope he's wearing his flame retardant undies.<br><br>This <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/024394.html">post</a> was found on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi">General Discussion</a> board.<br><br>I dont usually give my thoughts on most matters, but can't help but do it this time...<br><br>I, for one, am glad he's gone..  He was making decisions on gameplay when he shouldn't have been.  His job was to take customer concerns to the live team/producers, and bring <b>THEIR</b> responses back to the players.  His opinions on gameplay were not warranted, nor asked for.<br><br>Anytime a <b>*PR*</b> guy is making decisions about game content or what is fixed and what is not, he's stepping out of his bounds.  My proof?  Here:<br><br>On the post <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/022892.html">Big bunch of bard ...issues</a>, he said:<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2" color="#FFFFF0">[Wrinn, Gordon] - Other casting classes don't go up to 250, but I'm not opposed to increasing the instrument caps to reduce failures. We'll put it in the next patch.</i></font></font><br><br>This was one of the many instances that I've found of him making gameplay decisions, and I'll bet he didn't consult anyone beforehand.  There's other instances in that thread as well, just read all the statements under Gordon's name.<br><br>Now granted, this was a "bone" thrown to the bards, but was the decision his? Did he say "Hmm.. I'll let them have this one, since I've told them no on every other issue".  Sure seems like it to me.  I for one am glad we have a new guy... I think Gordon took this job as a stepping stone, only we the players were the stone being stepped on. <br><br>Please post your thoughts in the comments section.<br><br><hr>

There's been nothing new lately in the world of the Shadow Knight, but our brethren over at <a href="http://www.eqforge.com/shadowknight/">The Knight Watch</a> have been discussing, quite thoroughly I might add, about our Epic Quest.  You can see the thread that is being updated regularly by Manr <a href="http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum456/HTML/000050.html">here</a>.  You can see the entire forum on the Epic Quest <a href="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&forum=Unholy+Avenger&number=456&DaysPrune=30&LastLogin=">here</a>.<br><br><hr>

Per request of one of our readers, I have updated the quest information on the <a href="quests/wurmslayer_quest.htm">Wurmslayer quest</a>, and the Image of the Wurmslayer.  It was long overdue, and I apologize.<br><br><hr>

A Shadow Knight posted <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/017817.html">this</a> on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi">gameplay forum</a> asking about hybrids and disciplines.  Here's Abashi's reply:<br><br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2" color="#FFFFF0">We've been looking into the idea of possible disciplines for hybrids, but for more of a flavor thing than a balance one. If the suggestion being made is that there is a balance issue that can be solved by discipline, I'd have to disagree. Based upon the series of tests that were just made, they are now all measuring up as they should.<br><br>-Gordon</font></i></font><br><br><hr>

I've been working on this script all day, and quite frankly, don't know for sure if everything is working correctly or not. If you can take a few minutes and post a comment and maybe register for me, I'd appreciate it...  If you run into a problem, or something doesn't look quite right, do me a favor and drop me an email.  Basically, I need you guys to do a little QA for me. =)  Thanks ahead of time. <br><br><hr>

I've had quite a few requests asking for the background image that I created for the site, without the text and banner on it.  I've zipped up the .bmp file and uploaded it for everyone who would like it.  You can find it <a href="skaltar.zip">here</a>.  Be forewarned, It's 556K zipped up, and 1.44 megs unzipped.  <br><br><hr>

I've gone through and added alot of weapons to the <a href="weapons/1HS.htm">One Hand Slashing</a>, and the <a href="weapons/2HS.htm">Two Hand Slashing</a> pages that I scorched off of other sites while the server changes were waiting to be made .  Everything marked as "new" has been added today on those two pages.  There will be quite a bit more coming in the near future. <br><br><hr>

Ok guys, It's been a long time coming, but the site is now operational, and content will now be added as it is sent in, or as I can pull it off the web.  As you can tell, we lost a few of the scripts, but I'll work on those as time permits.  Enjoy!<br><br><hr>
