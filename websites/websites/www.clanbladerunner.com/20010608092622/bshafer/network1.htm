<TD>I haven't found many pages out there on the web that helps the home
user to start a small network in their home or small business. I have created
a network between my two computers in my home and thought I could help
out a few people out there with starting a network between a couple of
computers, or a small handful in a business. I am still getting information,
so please bare with me while I create this page.&nbsp;

<P>I began my quest for the easiest way to network two computer systems
about 6 months ago. There are several ways to connect computers and everyone
has their own reasons why. It was a very difficult decision on which route
to take so I went with the most inexpensive and easiest route. The reason
I wanted to network my two computers, is because I can't stand saving files
to a floppy to back them up. Floppy drives are becoming a thing of the
past with the ever growing demand for network connectivity. Gaming is another
reason. I have a love for computer games that two or more actual people
can play, not just you against the computer. Modems are great for two people,
but what if I wanted to play more than just one other person?? I'd be screwed.
That is why my network was started.</P>

<P><B>1.</B> Try to decide ahead of time how many computers you will be
connecting. It helps to know the amount of nodes you will be needing in
the future, and how many you currently have. If you are creating a network
for a small business, keep in mind that your business will be growing,
and so will the need for your computer systems.&nbsp;

<P><B>2.</B> Next, you will need to decide how you want your computers
connected. The most common, fastest connections, and ease is with ethernet.
Most ethernet cards have an RJ-45 connection, as well as a thinwire coax.
For just a few nodes, It is cheaper, and easier, to use the coaxial thinwire.
I bought my two network cards at Computer City for about 70 dollars, and
100 feet of thinwire at Radio Shack for $25. That is all I spent on the
hardware. If you plan on using twisted pair wire, which is sort of like
phone wire, you will need a hub of some sort, to change the polarity. You
can get a decent hub with the RJ-45 connections roughly for about $100.
If you have more than five nodes, I recommend going with the hub and twisted
pair. The good thing about the thinwire, is that you don't need a hub to
reverse the polarity. all you need is a terminator at the end of the line.
A terminator is a connection that re-routes the data back to the line like
a loop.</TD>
