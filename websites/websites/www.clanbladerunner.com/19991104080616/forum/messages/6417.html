Excellent!  Ask around and find out about the driving distance.  3 hours is a long time, but I hear you can drive 90 mph out there and not get a speeding ticket (or is it 3 hours IF you drive 90mph).  I think the dates are like the 10th-14th of this month, and I will need to talk to my professor at school before I commit to the classes.<p>Dude, I'd love to meet you.  That bastard Blackstorm ;) avoided me for an ENTIRE football season last year.  He won't escape me that easily THIS season (you've been warned Storm).<p>Just find out what you can... I don't know what my transportation situation will be, so just assume you'd be doing all the driving (sorry).  If it sounds feasible then let me know and we'll swap phone numbers and plan ahead.<p>Hope to see ya!<br>GIP<br>gipnor@yahoo.com<p>p.s.  If we meet up, No bing drinking!!!  I went to my old roommates wedding this past weekend and got drunk for the first time in a LOOOOOOOONG while.  I have no tolorance now (had 6 STRONG Rum & Cokes), and was sick as hell the next day.  I had already planned to meet my grandparents (I was up in Virginia) the next morning for breakfast.... that was REAL fun.  UGGG.....
