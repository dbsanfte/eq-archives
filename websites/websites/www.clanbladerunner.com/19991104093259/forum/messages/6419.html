I'm going to be arriving in Fargo (according to the airline schedule.. heh heh) at 5:04 PM on May 8th... that's a Saturday.  I'll be staying at a Ramada w/ a sleeper sofa, so if you want to come up, crash, and leave later, you'd have somewhere to sleep.  My classes will begin on Monday and I'll depart at 6:00 on Friday.<p>Soooo... if that first weekend is good for you, we'd have time to go out and do something and I'd be able to recover(I hope) before classes started =)<p>We gotta work this out... I'm dying to meet another BR.<p>My e-mail is posted above and my phone number is: 336-778-1638.  Remember that I live on the East coast if you call and please don't call late. My wife is really sick (some kind of bug).  I'm NEVER home now, so if you want to call, you're more likely to catch me AFTER May 1st because I should be finished up with school.   If you don't already notice, I like to know exactly what's supposed to happen and plan things.. so let me know what (if anything) will work for you.<p>See ya!  (for real, hopefully)<br>GIP<br>aka Mitch Vassar<p>p.s.  I won't have a car, but I WILL have cab fare supplied by my work.  I figure we can either ride back to crash or tip the dancers ;)

: We gotta work this out... I'm dying to meet another BR.
