    <h1>The Rules of the Adventurers of the Silver Blade</h1>
    <font size='-1'>Last modified February 8, 2000</font> 
  </center>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Guild Leadership</h3>
  <b>Defining Our Leadership</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>Adventurers of the Silver Blade (ASB) will have a three (3) person council 
      to lead it. 
    <li>This council will be picked and voted for by the members of the guild. 
  </ol>
  <b>Voting Process</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>Every two (2) months the council should be voted upon. At this point new 
      council members may be elected, or the same council members can be reelected. 
    <li>A nomination process will be held before the actual election. This process 
      will last one week. Nominees that do not wish to serve on the council should 
      say so at this time. 
    <li>Then the actual election will be held. Each member may vote for up to 
      three (3) nominees. This election should last one week. 
    <li>The three (3) nominees that receive the most votes will be the new council. 
    <li>Current council members are automatically nominated. 
  </ol>
  <b>Ousting a Dictator</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>At anytime, a two-thirds majority of the guild may vote to have any member 
      of the council removed from it. Or they may vote to have the whole council 
      removed at once. 
    <li>After which a new council would be elected using the process described 
      above. 
  </ol>

  <br>
  <h3>Recruitment Process</h3>
  <b>Pre-initiation period</b> <br>
  <ol>
    <li>To become a candidate, a person must be sponsored by a vested member (not 
      an initiate). It is the responsibility of the sponsor to verify that the 
      candidates behavior they have been witness to, is compliant with our code 
      of conduct. 
    <li>Every candidate must read our rules beforehand on the web site and mention 
      to their sponsor that they understand and agree with them. 
    <li>During this period, a candidate should be making efforts to hunt with 
      a few members of the guild. 
    <li>Once an initiate has a member that will sponsor him into the guild they 
      will advance to the next phase. 
  </ol>
  <b>Trial Period</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>A trial period will last a minimum of two (2) weeks, and a maximum of 
      two (2) months. This period is used to get to know the people in the guild, 
      and to have them get to know you. 
    <li>Attendance to meetings, events and hunts of the appropriate level are 
      strongly encouraged for all initiates. This is the best way for people to 
      get to know you. 
    <li>At any time during the trial period a member of the guild may voice a 
      reason to end the trial period, if the initiate has broken a rule. If it 
      is a minor offense, then the council, the initiate and the member with the 
      grievance may happen. If it is a major offense, the council can vote to 
      end the trial period immediately. 
    <li>At anytime, after the minimum amount of two weeks, the majority of the 
      council can call for a vote for full membership of an initiate. At this 
      time, anyone who has reason the initiate should NOT become a full member 
      should e-mail the council stating so, and giving a detailed explanation 
      as to why. The council will investigate the grievance and decide whether 
      or not is it valid. One (1) 'veto' validated by the council or three (3) 
      without validation, is grounds for rejecting the applicant. This process 
      will last one (1) week. 
  </ol>

  <h3>Loot Guidelines</h3>
  <b>Common Loot</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>All Guild Hunts should have a master looter. 
    <li>If you leave the hunt early, it is your responsibility to ask for a split 
      at that time. It is not the looters job to hold a share for you. 
  </ol>
  <b>Special loot</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>All the people in the group that need the item for the character they 
      are playing random for it (/rand 100 -- highest wins). Random eliminate 
      should be in place, i.e. you can only get one special loot per hunt until 
      everyone gets one, unless no one else in the group needs the item. Elimination 
      applies to the <b>player</b>, not the <b>character</b>. Secondary characters 
      random with a -20 penalty. 
    <li>In the special circumstance that someone is playing a secondary character 
      at the request of the group, then they may random for their primary with 
      the other primaries without penalty, or for that secondary character without 
      penalty. They still only get one roll per random, however. 
    <li>If none of the characters in the group needs the item, then they may random 
      it for not-present primary characters belonging to group members that need 
      it. 
    <li>If no one in the group needs the item, it is up to the group to either 
      a) random it among themselves or b) do with as they see fit (e.g. - sell 
      and split the cash or give to a specific member, or random among guild primaries, 
      etc.) 
    <li>If, in a Guild Hunt, there are non-guild players present in the group, 
      then everyone will random for the loot. If a guild member wins it then the 
      Guild Hunt rules apply. Note that if the winner of this roll is eligible 
      for the item then they win it - no more rolling. Penalties for secondary 
      characters should still be taken into account in this situation. 
  </ol>
  <b>Special Circumstances</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>If a hunt is organized to get an item for a certain person, they get the 
      item. 
  </ol>
  <b>Handing Down Loot</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>Loot won is yours to do with as you see fit after you are done with it, 
      although it is <i><b>suggested</b></i> you consider handing it down to other 
      guild members if they need it. If someone gives you an item and places conditions 
      on it, though, you should follow their wishes. 
  </ol>
  <b>Defining a Guild Hunt</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>If a group has more than two (2) members and all the members are guild 
      members that should be a Guild Hunt. 
    <li>If a group has more than two (2) people, and 50% or more of them are guild 
      members that should be a Guild Hunt, unless otherwise stated by the group. 
      This should be done beforehand, at least before any major loot is acquired, 
      so that no misunderstandings happen. 
    <li>If a hunt is organized beforehand on the forum, it is a Guild Hunt. 
  </ol>
  <b>Defining Primary Characters</b> 
  <ol>
    <li>Everyone should specify their primary character. 
    <li>People can change their primary character by posting on the forum, but 
      the change will not take place until after a two-week waiting period. 
  </ol>
