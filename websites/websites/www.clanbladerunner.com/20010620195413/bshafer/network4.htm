<TD VALIGN=TOP>This page was set up after a question by one of my visitors
to my page. He had asked me if there was anyway that you could connect
your LAN to the internet going thru one pc's dial up account. I had never
done it before, but had heard of the software that makes it possible out
on the internet. I wrote him back telling him to go to <A HREF="http://www.windows95.com/">Windows95.com</A>
and search the networking site they have for the software. I had asked
him to let me know how it turned out, and if it worked, to write me up
a little information, so I can post it out on the web for someone else
that might have the same questions. He agreed. I haven't contacted him
about posting his name on the page, yet, but here is his url:

<P>Here is the final message he wrote me about setting up your LAN to connect
to the internet thru one PC:&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I went to window95.com and did a network search and read through several
of the gateway programs that were available. Many are very difficult to
understand or are very expensive to use. The one I went with is called
WinGate ver 1.3.06 (WinGate by Qbik Software )rel Feb. 2, 1996. It was
very easy to read and to set up.

<P>Part A: Configuring the Gateway Machine

<P>Step 1: Install the network adapter in the gateway machine (this part
is very simple and I know you know how to do this)

<P>Step 2: Install and configure Wingate on the Gateway machine Run WGSetup
( this will walk you thru all the steps to install the prog.) (it will
also ask you for information to register the program)

<P>Step 3: Configure TCP/IP on the Gateway machine Go to control panel
and click the network icon. select the tcp/ip properties that are assigned
to your physical network adapter. specify an IP address. 192.168.0.1 fill
in the subnet mask. ex: 255.255.255.0

<P>DNS configuration select ENABLE DNS enter your user name in the HOST
box. In the DOMAIN, put in the name of your provider. In the DNS SERVER
SEARCH ORDER section, put the IP address of your providers name server
and press the add button.

<P>(These are the only two options that must be set to use the gateway.)

<P>Part B: Configuring the Workstaion Step 1: same as above Step 2: Specify
an IP Address. this must be a number different from any other machine on
the network. usuall it is one number up from the gateway machine or the
next machine in the order of the network. The subnet mask will be the same
as the gateway machine.

<P>DNS configuration: Select ENABLE DNS The host box will be the name of
the workstaion machine ( this will not be seen on the outside network only
internally) leave the domain empty.

<P>In the DNS SEVER SEARCH ORDER add th IP address of the gateway machine.

<P>Step 5: Set up a HOSTS file on the workstation A host file tells the
workstaion where to look for a certain address. using notepad or similar
editor creat a file in the \windows directory called HOSTS. The only entry
in this file should be the ip address and the name of the gateway machine,
separated by atleast one space. ex: 192.168.0.1 gateway

<P>(again: leave the rest of the options empty)

<P>I hope that this is enough information for you to use. It came with
8 pages of information on setting up the net and also a few of the more
common programs to use with the gateway. I think they have done a very
good job in documenting their product and to me that is very important.

<P>Thank you and have a Happy New Year

<P>Tom&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well, that's it, if you have any questions, you can e-mail me and I
will forward it on to him, if I cannot answer your question.</TD>
