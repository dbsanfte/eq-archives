I saw <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031866.html">this</a> on the gameplay forum about Journeyman's Boots:<br><br><i>At last they have fixed the Jboot quest so that it cannot be multiquested. That's one in the eye for all you dr00d farmers.<br><br>Unfortunately they chose not to publicise this.<br><br>So, Hasten still wants the RoA, 3250 gp and a shadowed rapier. BUT they must all come from the same person.<br><br>Avengsis Ne'Kalsan<br>A Collector of Souls, 45th Teir'dal Necromancer, Luclin</i><br><br>This is unconfirmed.  If you have any information that could prove or disprove this, please leave a comment, or send me an email.<br><br><br><br><hr>
