  <p align="center">Ok this image came from a fall picture I had seen and wondered 

    if I'd be able make trees like this in Bryce 4. Well after about 2 days of 

    messing with the tree textures, I finally figured out how to change the colors. 

    This is what I came up with. Everything except the the bridge was created 

    totally in Bryce 4. The bridge is a product from 3D Cafe. E-mail me and let 

    me know what you think.</p>

  <p align="center">This image took me a total of about 5 days to create (while 

    at work). Couple days texturing the trees, and then a few more days getting 

    the trees and bridge set just right. This is actually my second version of 

    this picture. The first one doesn't have the bridge. </p>
