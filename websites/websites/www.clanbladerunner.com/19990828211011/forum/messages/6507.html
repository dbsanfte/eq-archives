Nope.. I'm *really* sick of their other stuff (from Dude Ranch) since it's *still* played 24/7 over here.  Also, I'm at home now, so I really don't have much access to new music until I go back to school.  Best Buy seems to have the best selection over here, and well, that place sucks for underground punk... oh well, I might catch it sometime, though I seriously doubt if I'll bother to get the album.  *shrug*<p>Oh yeah.. you're a level 11 druid, right?  I was wondering where and what you hunt at that level.  I'm in Misty Thicket right now (yeah, I'm a midget lvl 10 halfling), and currently hunt giant wasps, weak giant scarabs, or giant spiders, but the spawn isn't always that great -- I've been out to the common lands too, but that place seemed to be a bit sparse, too..<p>Hehe, okay.. I'm just rambling now, but, hey, I'm bored at work... see ya all later,<p>Storm / Aldaron
