I got an email about our pets losing their ability to kick sometime between now and the last few patches.  Here's the email I received:<br><br><i>Hi,<br>I love your sk site and play one myself, but I was wondering if you or any of the other mid level sks noticed that our lvl 30 pets have stopped kicking. Verent Nerfed our pets along with the necro pets, I could care less about the necro's pets since they have great spells. But I was wondering if you can put a note up on your site about this, so Verant gets some more feedback from sk's about this change and how sk's do not like it so they change our pets back to normal. Which is unlikely, but if enough people bitch to them they might take notice. Our pets are weak as it is, then to make them weaker is totaly unfair.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Steve</i><br><br>If anyone else has noticed this, or has a comment, please use the comments section, or start a thread in the forum.  Thanks again! =)<br><br><hr>
