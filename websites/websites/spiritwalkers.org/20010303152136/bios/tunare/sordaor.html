              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hail and 
                well-met friends. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I am Sordaor, 
                the only son of Tordaor and Shalla, merchants of Halas. As a child, 
                I had loving parents. I lived a typical life for a young Barbarian 
                growing up in Halas. It wasn't until my seventh winter that something 
                of note happened in my life. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was early 
                spring and father decided to bring me along on a quick trading 
                mission to Qeynos. I suspect mother put him up to it so she could 
                have a break from my constant chatter. Father and I left Halas 
                before dawn, bringing with us my fathers employee Trell and a 
                couple of hired guards, to ensure that the trip through Blackburrow 
                was uneventful. They would wait for us in the hills until our 
                return from Qeynos. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A few hours 
                out of Blackburrow, father and I came upon a small gnoll camp. 
                If not for my presence, father would have done battle. (He had 
                become a fair hand with a blade after many years of trading through 
                out Antonica and beyond.) The gnolls, for their part, were reluctant 
                to start a battle they had little chance of winning, however, 
                they were quick to satisfy their greed. They offered father two 
                bolts of silk and a couple worthless baubles. (The only reason 
                my father would ever make a trade with those hated gnolls was 
                to avoid the chance of losing his only son.) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We made for 
                Qeynos with all haste to inform the guard of our encounter. It 
                was here that the treachery began. My father, not wanting to fuel 
                a greedy faction of the Qeynos Trade Coalition, failed to mention 
                that a trade had taken place in the gnoll encounter. (A crime 
                that would have been forgiven, given the circumstances, in a just 
                city.) Good and evil have always been hard to distinguish among 
                humans. In my eyes, father had told a lie, the first untruth I 
                had ever heard my father speak. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After making 
                preparations for the night, I informed father of my feelings. 
                I then sat quietly (a great accomplishment for me) by the fire 
                and listened as he explained the politics involved in what he 
                did. Also, he conveyed to me the anguish he felt for having to 
                omit part of the story. Our father son talk was only momentarily 
                disturbed by the sound of a scurrying rat, and in the end, I forgave 
                him. However, we both knew things had changed between us. Something 
                always changes when a son discovers for the first time that his 
                father isn't perfect. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was less 
                than an hour after our talk that the guards came. It seems the 
                Qeynos Trade Coalition had leveled charges concerning my father's 
                trade with the gnolls. I knew then that the rat we had heard earlier 
                was of the human kind. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The trial 
                was held that very night. I can still see the glee in the faces 
                of the traders who brought the charges. They knew the outcome 
                of the trial before it began, thanks to a few well-placed platinum 
                I'm sure. Father, too honorable to lie under direct questioning, 
                could do nothing but make the admission that would lead to his 
                death. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I think the 
                traders would not have gloated as they did had they known that 
                in two years time a young Barbarian of nine winters would visit 
                their homes and silently end there lives. The boy Sor died the 
                night he saw his father hang. After placing my father on his funeral 
                pyre, Sordaor arose from the ashes. I stopped talking that night, 
                except to tell Trell and then mother, of what had happened.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It wasn't 
                until the night I returned from killing the merchant that I broke 
                my silence. I had just entered the peaks from BB when I heard 
                my fathers' voice being carried in the wind. "Justice has been 
                served my son." And then I felt the power explode within me. My 
                third birth. I ran then, toward my beloved Halas. The peaks passed 
                in a blur and when I reached the Halas caverns I did not wait 
                for the Gwenavyne. The water still held some winter ice but I 
                did not feel the chill. I walked from the docks to my mother's 
                home; "I have wrought justice for father." was all I said. It 
                was enough. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After I had 
                learned to control my new power. I sought out my friend Calamon. 
                He had joined the Spiritwalkers during the years after my father's 
                death, when I sat quietly in the peaks. From him, I had learned 
                much of the Spiritwalkers. He had told me I would be a welcomed 
                member when I was ready. I had just been born again and unlike 
                my previous rebirth I now needed a family to grow and survive.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I still 
                speak but very little. I do, however, see and hear all that is 
                around me. Some times I even hear my father speaking to me on 
                the wind. I am Sordaor. If you seek justice, take heart I will 
                arrive. If you are a fugitive from justice, your death will be 
                the sign of my arrival.</font></p>
