            <td colspan="3">
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu is the 
                youngest of three children, the only daughter. When she was around 
                4 seasons old, her parents were slain by an Orc war party while 
                they were hunting mammoths on the tundra</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Before her 
                parents' death, Sanu was a joyful child, bright and eager to learn 
                and full of laughter. Everyone in the village was always glad 
                to see her running around and the guildmasters of the Tribunal 
                were looking forward to Sanu's training.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When her 
                parents died, Sanu withdrew a bit. While it wasn't a total withdrawl, 
                she was no longer as cheery as before. Going to live with her 
                unkle, Sanu learned of the more serious side of life. Her Unkle 
                Mortekai was a kind, but strict man, burdened suddenly with the 
                responsibility of raising three children. She soon came to love 
                her unkle as she had her parents and looks upon him as a role 
                model. As she grew older, the powers of her mother continued to 
                stay dormant and the elders of the Tribunal despaired of ever 
                awakening.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And then, 
                one night, her unkle's power awakened and as he grew in power, 
                so too did Sanu's. Within months, Sanu was following both her 
                mother's and her unkle's footsteps on the Shaman's path. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Since that 
                time, her humor has returned as she had learned there is more 
                beyond death. Her humor is, however, tempered by a wisdom beyond 
                her years. As a result, she tends to be a bit more cautious then 
                her older brother Joril. While her brother will go charging off 
                to kill and Orc, she will bide her time until she is sure of a 
                victory. This is not to say that her hatred of Orcs is less than 
                her brother's. She hates them with a passion, wanted to make them 
                pay for her parent's untimely deaths. However, she wants to make 
                her actions count with her as the victor.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When she 
                became old enough and judged by the Tribunal to have advanced 
                in her training enough, she began her travels and adventures to 
                learn the ways of the world and the ways of the spirits..</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As she has 
                advanced in the Circles, Sanu has learned of judgement and that 
                judgement can come from all people, all races. With a bit of urging 
                from her unkle, she has learned not to judge the race, but the 
                individual. As a result, she has found that some of the darker 
                races and professions can serve justice in their own way.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu is tall 
                for her people, almost matching her unkle's height, she is 7'10. 
                She keeps herself fit as it takes both a fit mind and body to 
                be able to listen to the spirits. As well, the constant battle 
                to keep the North free of orcs and goblins gives her plenty of 
                exercise as well. Her dark red hair is kept short for better control 
                in the fierce winds of the North. Her dark blue eyes are filled 
                with humor and a wisdom beyond her age. While she doesn't wear 
                the tattoos generally seen on her people, there is no doubting 
                the power she holds nor the power within her eyes.</font></p>
