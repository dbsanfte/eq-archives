                It isn't everyday that one comes face to face with death. Or perhaps 
                rather, it is that one faces death daily, but rarely is the event 
                so personal.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; The day in question started like any other. Meditation 
                exercises, the ritual gathering of inner power, peeking through 
                the aether to find the exact spot in front of your nose. In short, 
                nothing new or even exciting for a young wizard in training. Routine, 
                even dull. Until IT happened.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Like a silent footfall it came, the event. With no 
                warning, no fanfare. No quarter asked, and none given. Just quiet 
                normalcy one moment and a shattered, twisted reality the next. 
                No one could have predicted such a thing, no one could have wished 
                it upon his or her foe, and no remedy could be applied. The mathematics 
                of wizardry compute the likelihood of such an event at so small 
                a probability as to be an unthinkable occurrence. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; The aether ripped open, flooding the small compartment 
                with power such as wizards of the mightiest sort might see once 
                in their lives. Blinding, twisting waves of sheer raw power flooded 
                through the small aperture in to the world, flowing like streams 
                of lighting, or perhaps liquid light, tearing and warping everything 
                they touched. Waves of force shredded the walls, rent asunder 
                the roof, and scorched the ancient stone floor, and vaporized 
                everything within sight. Everything that is, save the young aspirant. 
                The young man was largely unharmed, if one could discount the 
                singed flesh, the complete lack of body-hair, and his sudden nakedness. 
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops!", he said under his breath. "Guess I shouldn't 
                try opening a teleport-portal just yet." <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; And so it was that Rhender left the apprenticeship 
                of his master, and went to seek his fame in the world. </font></p>
