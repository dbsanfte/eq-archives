        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">by Mortekai Spiritwalker</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Listen to me 
        now my brethren, for I tell you grave news. Long ago, in ages dark and 
        less heroic than our own daemons sometimes walked the face of Norrath 
        in the service of Innoruk. One such foul creature was Drach'neyn a daemon 
        skilled in the arts arcane, and the powers of Evil. Long ago this foul 
        creature was imprisoned in a band of rune-encrusted metal, and hidden 
        away from the eyes of men. <br>
        <br>
        But such a thing is a device of power, and in the world of Norrath, power 
        can not long lay dormant. A mystic of the Ice Goblin tribes fashioned 
        a Circlet of Power to harness the daemon's powers. A mighty foe was this 
        goblin, possessed as he was by the spirit of the daemon, but no match 
        for a hardy band of Spiritwalkers lead by myself, Mortekai. The goblin 
        defeated, the Circlet indestructible, I wrapped the circlet in mighty 
        spells and bound guardian spirits to it. The Circlet has adorned my own 
        head since the defeat of the daemon-possessed goblin. Until now. <br>
        <br>
        Power is a terrible thing, and when it belongs to a daemon, it is a terror 
        to behold. Even the guardian spirits could not prevent the mighty daemon 
        from tempting those with darkness in their souls.<br>
        <br>
        And so it comes to pass that one amongst us has fallen prey to the daemon's 
        whiles. Whilst I was away, the Circlet was held in trust for me by my 
        niece. It was then that the foul creature trapped within reached out to 
        her, and somehow showed her the path to loosen its bonds. I fear that 
        her soul is in grave danger, for she has stolen the circlet from me, and 
        escaped with it. <br>
        <br>
        The Circlet must be recovered. We must not allow the daemon Drach'neyn 
        to consume the soul of my niece and wear her flesh. Aid me now, Spiritwalkers 
        for without your aid, I fear all is lost.<br>

        First to Fall</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By Ruldari</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A bitter taste still 
        welled up in her mouth as she contemplated her earlier defeat by Morrighan, 
        even though more skill folk than she had since fallen to the demon-possessed 
        necromancer who was soon to become her sister-in-law. It had been a long 
        time since she'd felt so helpless, so ... incompetent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The day had started 
        out normally enough, with another spider-slaughter in East Karana. Joril 
        wanted to improve his tailoring skill, and help the new members of the 
        guild, and she was determined to do her share of silk collection for him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then she'd heard 
        Morrighan gloating over killing Narissa Clothspinner, proclaiming that 
        the woman had provided no challenge, and that she hoped her sister was 
        more of a challenge. Now, Morri had always tended to have a strong sense 
        of macabre humor, but this was not a laughing matter, and it seemed that 
        Morri was not joking. She'd started killing merchants and bragging about 
        it!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ru didn't know what 
        was wrong with her future sister-in-law, but someone had to talk to her 
        and find out what was wrong, and all Morri's relatives were not around 
        at the time. With a worried frown on her face, she'd set out across the 
        Karanas as fast as she could run. Along the way, she got to listen to 
        Morri spew all sorts of nasty commentary about evil and darkness, hinting 
        that Ru, Unkle and others were &quot;weak&quot; and so forth. This was 
        not the Morri she knew at all ... which made her more worried, and run 
        faster. She had to speak with her face-to-face and find out what was wrong.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As she arrived in 
        Qeynos, she remembered that she'd had some rawhide shoulderpads for one 
        of their younger members, a paladin lass by the name of Ellen, so she 
        sought her out to drop them off, and gave her a few buffs. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then Morri appeared, 
        and Ru found out just how weak she was. She tried to keep her tone concerned, 
        but not judgemental, but she was distracted by the red glow emanating 
        from Morri's eyes. This was not good.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then Morri stepped 
        back and started hitting her with spells, while her skeleton pet closed 
        in, hitting and stunning her repeatedly. And stunned she was, shocked 
        that Morrighan would attack another Spiritwalker like that, ANY Spiritwalker, 
        much less one that was practically family. She was half-dead before she 
        gathered her wits enough to fight back, trying to defend herself from 
        the relentless blows of the pet. It wasn't until near the very end that 
        she could even bring herself to fling a burst of flame in Morrighan's 
        direction, so rattled was she by the attack. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Somewhere during 
        the whole attack she remembered telling Ellen to back up, to hide, and 
        then all she remembered was blood and pain. Her blood. Her pain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She was easily defeated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Perhaps she was weak, 
        as Morrighan claimed ... all she knew was that when she later found out 
        that a demon had been controlling Morri's actions, it had been small comfort 
        indeed ... she <i>felt</i> weak.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Things got worse 
        from there, as guildmembers streamed in from all over the globe, including 
        one young lass all the way from Felwithe. Aleayha, scouting the sewers 
        beneath Qeynos, was the next to fall to the murderous demon. Gyro, the 
        bouncing gnome, stopped bouncing as his heart <i>almost</i> stopped beating 
        shortly thereafter. The mighty Mortekai, goaded beyond belief at being 
        blamed for sending Joril and Sanu's parents to their deaths, was also 
        handily defeated ... and Ru could do nothing. Poor young Ellen was stalked 
        for a long time, and struck down even as Ru tried to heal her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After each attack, 
        Morri would either gate, or gather the dark shadows around her ... and 
        Ru could do nothing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She had not felt 
        so helpless, so useless, since the day her mother died.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="ellen"></a>Ellen's 
        Testimonial</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Ruldari told 
        me she was going to be stopping by to drop some things off in Qeynos, 
        I was delighted. We hadn't had a chance to talk much since I'd become 
        a Spiritwalker, and I was looking forward to a nice bit of a chat. When 
        she arrived however, she seemed distracted and tense. She told me that 
        she needed to speak to Morrighan before she would be free to visit, and 
        asked if I would mind accompanying her to rather private alcove outside 
        the town walls. She had asked Morrighan to meet her there, and I got the 
        impression that she was a bit nervous about going alone...although how 
        I could be of any help if things got rough was anyone's guess! Still, 
        I agreed to tag along, although not without reservations. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Indeed, those reservations 
        kept me far behind Ru as she boldly confronted Morrighan. I wasn't really 
        sure what was going on, although I had heard rumours about some kind of 
        problems with Morrighan's behaviour and attitudes. I missed most of the 
        earlier conversation, as I was pressed up against the stone walls..but 
        as I grew more brave, I began to move closer to them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Just as I was able 
        to catch a word or two, I heard Ru scream and saw Morrighan's Pet striking 
        her. I realized that Ru had been rooted, and was unable to even run away. 
        I stood, immobile, in a total state of shock for what seemed like forever, 
        but turned out later to be less than a minute. That was all the time Morrighan 
        needed however. She stood behind the vile undead creature she had summoned, 
        and watched as Ru fell immobile to the ground. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By this time I had 
        gathered what few wits I had left, and began screaming at Morrighan, pegging 
        her as the vile coward and murderess that she had just exhibited herself 
        to be...but she ignored me and continued on her way. I swore to her that 
        I would bear witness to the horrible act she had commited. This account 
        is that promised testimony. I stayed with Ru's body until she was able 
        to bring her soul back into it. She expressed deep confusion and unhappiness 
        and set out to find explanations and help.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Ru returned in the 
        afternoon with several of the elders, and an attempt was made to pull 
        the murderess Morrighan out of her guild, in the Qeynos sewers. It was 
        a total and unmitigated failure, ending with more mayhem, which Ru has 
        detailed in her own chronicle, and with Morrighan still free to hurt others. 
        It was during this time that the group learned of the existance of a circlet, 
        possessed of a demon, which it seems Morrighan had been given custody 
        of. This circlet was deemed the cause of Morrighan's present behavior. 
        I am having trouble with this, having never met Morrighan before these 
        unfortunate events...but I am trying as best I can to imagine Morrighan 
        as the decent person others say she was before. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Later that same day, 
        after the sun had fallen, I found myself in the Hills of Qeynos, hunting 
        with Coreena. I was busy looting a giant rat when I looked up and saw 
        what I took to be a decaying skeleton crossing the field. Peering closer, 
        I realized it was Morrighan's pet. Morrighan was in the field with me! 
        I am ashamed to say I panicked, and screamed for Coreena in guildspeak, 
        thus calling attention to myself. Morrighan began shouting, baiting me 
        to "come out and play" as she put it. I began running to Surefall Glade. 
        I was able to hide in the entrance of Surefall for a bit, but since it 
        was nightfall, and I am without a lightstone, I was unable to actually 
        enter the Glade. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Coreena stayed hidden 
        by the entrance, looking for Morrighan. After a few sightings and false 
        reports, she deemed it safe for me to come out, and we hurried down the 
        road together to Qeynos. About halfway there, Morrighan began to chase 
        us, cackling with delight at my fear and loathing of her. She used her 
        arts to follow me invisibly and to whisper taunts into my ear as I was 
        scurrying down the path. I managed to make it to the gates, and hid hastily 
        in the right hand guard tower, behind the door, my heart pounding in fear 
        as I crouched shivering there. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I heard her come 
        through the gate, and enter the left tower. I thought I would faint, waiting 
        for her to come and search the area I was in, but the Gods of good were 
        watching over me, and she passed me by, choosing to search the city instead. 
        After I heard her footsteps receding, I ran out the gates once more, and 
        hid by the very place Ru had been downed earlier. Coreena had called for 
        help as we were running. Joril and Ru, who were hunting in nearby BlackBurrow, 
        heard her, and met me outside. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I was frightened 
        when Morrighan started shouting for me again, but Ru answered. I had just 
        started feeling safe and secure once more when Ru informed me that she 
        intended to lay down her life again, rather than to have me lose mine. 
        I was horrified...not only at the loss of honor that implied..but at the 
        thought of Ru having to endure yet another death at the hand of that monster. 
        Ru and Joril had made me welcome during my first days of being a Spiritwalker. 
        Their generousity and kindness had overwhelmed me, and I thought of them 
        as being two of the best folk I knew. I could not pay their kindness back 
        with craven cowardice. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As I was trying to 
        explain how I felt to them, Morrighan reappeared by the city wall. Before 
        Joril or Ru could act, I dashed forward, shouting defiance. It was only 
        a matter of minutes before I was soundly defeated. As ashamed as I am 
        that I could not hold my own against Morrighan's evil...I know it is nothing 
        to the shame I would have known had Ru or Joril taken my place. I have 
        no regrets. There was no other action I could have lived with. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As for Morrighan...I 
        know you all counsel forgiveness, having known her yourselves as another 
        person....but in all honesty, I cannot say that forgiveness will come 
        easily for me. I have known no Morrighan but this evil, dark thing that 
        is making the lives of everyone I admire a nightmare. I believe that had 
        she not the natural inclination to be what she has now become, she would 
        have been able to resist the demon's power. She chose the dark arts...and 
        I have seen no proof that those arts can be turned to the benefit of good 
        in my (albeit short) lifetime. Know you this now...if she is returned 
        to her "former self," I honestly doubt that I will ever approach her with 
        anything but mistrust and wariness. I am sorry if this seems harsh..but 
        she has left an impression on me that I doubt will wear away in any short 
        period of time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This then is my testimony 
        of these events, put forth as honestly and fully as I know how.</font></p>

        mail and pieces of the famed Crafted Armor of the Centaurs of South Karanas. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He stepped away from 
        the railing of the ship, drawing his immense blade from its sheath. Sailors 
        scurried away from his dark scowl, fearful of further upsetting this brooding 
        (obviously) warrior. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril had not felt 
        such anger and bitterness in a long time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">How could his Unkle, 
        a man whom he always considered wise and knowledgeable, be so…unwise? 
        How could he have given an item that was the prison of a being of immense 
        power and darkness to one who practices the dark arts? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> He battled within 
        himself, with his feelings of hurt, anger and betrayal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> His sword flashed 
        brilliant silver as he spun about. His mind going over the events of the 
        past few days. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His foster sister 
        was possessed by a daemon. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">How could his unkle 
        have given the object that served as its prison to Morrighan? How could 
        he have thought that she, a practitioner of the dark arts, NOT be tempted 
        by such a thing of power? And how could he have shown so little faith 
        and trust in his own nephew? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril's visage grew 
        darker, matching the sky and clouds of the oncoming storm. He swung his 
        blade even faster, stepping up the tempo of his routine. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He thought of the 
        deaths of his fellow guild members. Poor Ellen and Windias. Among the 
        youngest and newest of the Spiritwalkers, their first meeting with Morrighan 
        had to be so traumatic. And Gyro, that bouncing happy little gnome. A 
        powerful summoner of elements who damn near came close to summoning no 
        more. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So many dead and 
        broken Spiritwalkers that day. And he had stood helpless as he watched 
        Mortekai fall to the daemon. Joril was unable to lift a finger to help. 
        And he had been standing RIGHT BEHIND the thing! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a growl, he 
        unknowingly split a wooden cask in two, spilling its contents onto the 
        deck. He spun again; feinting an attack with his blade and following it 
        with a massive leg in a kick that would have made a hill giant take notice. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His thoughts then 
        turned to his beloved and without knowing, he snarled the most viscous 
        snarl, so full of anger, that a plains cat would have sounded like a mere 
        house kitten. He reversed his blade and plunged it deep into the deck 
        piling. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril stood, breathing 
        heavily for a moment, eyes blank and unseeing. A soft scurrying noise 
        broke his trance. He leapt to the side, snatching his sword and then dropped 
        spinning to the deck, his sword coming up at the ready. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The poor old cook 
        almost dropped the platter of food that he had brought for the large warrior. 
        His heart stopped cold and then his face began to turn red as he suddenly 
        realized what that wet warm feeling on his leg meant. Shamefully he hurriedly 
        put the platter on a cask and scampered away. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril watched him 
        retreat to his galley. His face began to turn red as well as he realized 
        the scare he gave the kindly man. He stood and sheathed his sword then 
        picked up the tray of food and went below to the cabin. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He quietly closed 
        the door and set the platter down on the small table. He then turned and 
        gently sat on the bed, gazing with sorrow and love at the bed's occupant. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He knew the scars 
        she would carry for a long time. Gently he stroked Ruldari's hair. She 
        had been among those that the daemon had defeated that day. And he had 
        been unable to help her as well. Self-doubt welled up within him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He was glad that 
        she was with him on this journey. Perhaps this time he could do a better 
        job protecting her. And perhaps she could help him battle his own daemons 
        within. He knew not what the final outcome of this journey would be like 
        but he knew he had to do this. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For his sister Morrighan. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For his beloved Ruldari. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For the good of the

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And most of all, 
        for himself. </font></p>

        across the low ground, and the charnel smell of ancient tombs rose in 
        wisps to battle the breeze. The sky was filled with the reddening of the 
        setting sun, and a middle-aged Northman stood over the broken body of 
        a young redheaded woman. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The corpse was desiccated, 
        as if the very life and fluid had been blasted out of it by intense heat.

        his lost children, for the deaths of his friends, family and loved ones. 
        But his face is stern, and his eyes filled with a resolution. Preparations 
        need to be made, things gathered, and the timing carefully weighed. A 
        ritual of powerful magic must be executed flawlessly if one is to destroy 
        a daemon. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Powerful things, 
        wicked things, and things of seemingly no power at all were laid before 
        him on the table. A vial of Cyclops blood, several herbs, a knife, and 
        the still beating heart of D'vinn, the beginnings of a collection of things 
        that, the Tribunal willing, would spell the end of the Daemon. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gathering his will, 
        Mortekai reached deep into himself for the words and deeds that lead him 
        to this pass. Only by facing these truths, by clearing his own soul of 
        darkness would he have the strength to face his adversary.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">***</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Snow covered the 
        ground, blood-littered snow. The signs of a large battle were evident, 
        and the broken bodies of the slain were scattered all around. There lay 
        the shattered body of his sister's only love Culbarth not far away. Edain 
        herself lay in the finest furs on her funeral bower in Halas. As the only 
        adult family of the two, it is Mortekai's job to bring the bodies of the 
        fallen home for their final rest. It is a duty he does not relish. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his grief, pain

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"I should have been 
        here. I should have leant them my strength, such as it is. I should be

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"<i>I can help you</i>," 
        whispered a dry, sibilant voice in Mortkai's head. "<i>I can give you 
        the power to make things right</i>." </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Can you return the 
        dead to life?" Mortekai asked, his mental voice trembling with grief and 
        a glimmering of hope. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"<i>No, but I can 
        make <b>you</b> strong. You can protect their children, you can do so

        </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"What must I do?" 
        whispered Mortekai, a new look of grim determination spreading across 
        his face. </font></p>

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A goblin wizard feels 
        his strength drain his powers wane. This should not be! He can easily 
        best this mere barbarian! But such is not the case. Mortekai strips the 
        corpse of its' fetishes of power, and carefully wraps the circlet of rune-encrusted 
        metal in soft leather. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"<i>Excellent, Mortekai. 
        Now what I have promised you is yours. Place me on your head, and let

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Nae just yet. There

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mortekai sets his 
        leather-wrapped package on the ground, and removes a piece of brightly 
        colored chalk from his pouch. Other items follow, and are used to carefully 
        scribe runes and symbols on the ground. Once they are complete, he carefully 
        unwraps the circlet and sets it between the runes. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"<i>What are you

      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Neither was giving 
        you my soul, Drach'neyn!" And the chants pour forth from his lips, the 
        lights of the spirits called to help him swirl as the ritual binding begins. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"<i>You will pay

        Squabble, Part 1</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">by Sanu</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu's heart was 
        troubled as she sat in a quiet part of Halas, gathering her thoughts for 
        meditation. What she had witnessed this eve had struck her to the core. 
        That something needed to be done, she was certain. But what remained the 
        question. She was floundering with no data. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While traveling through 
        West Karana on her way to Freeport on a few errands for the guild, she 
        had finally come across Morrighan, her dark sister. She shuddered as the 
        vision of the daemon's possession flashed across her vision. Shavanna, 
        a young promising Shaman, was in battle with Morrighan. Shavanna hadn't 
        stood a chance. Morrighan, or rather the daemon, had come upon Shavanna 
        unawares while she was fishing and slew her before she could reach the 
        weapon within her grasp. And then, the daemon had fled, before she could 
        get a word in edgewise. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And this troubled 
        Sanu. How to fight something that refused to engage in combat? And how 
        to do it in such a manner as to return the Morrighan she knew? Or was 
        Morrighan gone and only the daemon remained? Gone to serve whatever darkness 
        she had bargained with? Her dark sister who she had come to trust in battle, 
        who, through Unkle's teaching, had opened her eyes to the many ways of 
        Justice? Another thought beat in the darkness, was this the Tribunal's 
        intent? Was this the Tribunal's Justice for Morrighan selling her soul 
        for her dark magicks? And if it was, could she interfere? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a troubled and 
        heavy heart, Sanu started her meditation exercises, to sooth the mind, 
        calm it to allow her to hear the spirits. And when the roar of the spirits 
        filled her ears, she let her spirit soar to join them, leaving her body, 
        guarded by the spirits and the tradition to never disturb a meditating 
        Shaman. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For a few moments, 
        she reveled in the freedom of the spirits, but then, her mind turned quickly 
        to the matter at hand. Morrighan. The daemon had fled her and she needed 
        information. While she could not affect the living world in this form, 
        she could talk to those still with the flesh. She sent her awareness to 
        search for Morrighan. Memories of childhood arose in her mind. Memories 
        of the day Unkle had returned home with her, a frightened child, hurt 
        in body and soul. She remembered Unkle caring for her and she remembered 
        one night seeing the spirits swirl around her, light and dark, warring. 
        It was then that she knew why Unkle had brought her home to become part 
        of the family, to provide what help he could in that battle, that light 
        would win over dark just this once. Her heart filled with love for her 
        Unkle, stern, demanding, but filled with so much love it almost hurt at 
        times to Look. And she remembered when she started down this dark path. 
        And Unkle, when he learned of it, not condemning her, but listening to 
        her and way she chose it. And of Unkle's attempts to temper her darkness 
        with light. At first, Sanu hadn't understood, but then as her powers grew 
        and Unkle demanded that she look before judging as the Tribunal demands, 
        she had understood. Darkness can serve Justice. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Her spirit soared 
        and followed the line to Morrighan. She almost returned to her body at 
        the sight of Evil in her dark sister. But her duties as a Shaman, her 
        Unkle's teaching and her own need to know if her dark sister had truly 
        turned kept her there. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Daemon, we must 
        meet," her spirit self said. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Morrighan looked 
        up to see her spirit form wavering near by. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"You will not find 
        me as easy as you have found our younger brethren, Daemon," Sanu said, 
        remembering that Rhaine, a young bard had recently fallen, struck from 
        behind with no chance of defense and had fallen before she could do anything. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Daemon smiled 
        a horrible smile, "I will remember your words as I stand over your fallen 
        corpse. I like it much when prey is prepared and falls anyway." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"You will go too 
        far, Daemon. You were bound once and will be again," Sanu said, struggling 
        with her anger, her eyes flashing and going hard. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I will be free until 
        the sky itself falls," the Daemon said, an unholy light in its eyes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"We shall see, Daemon. 
        Justice will prevail," and with that, Sanu willed herself back to her 
        body, before her anger got the better of her and she said something she 
        would later regret. Sanu's eyes opened and slowly focused on the scenery 
        around her. She watched for a few moments, her eyes following her fellow 
        clansmen and visitors to Halas. Watching their normal activities. She 
        wondered how many of them had the strength to look upon the Daemon as 
        she had. And if they had, how many would keep their sanity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> That the evil residing 
        in Morrighan's body was strong, Sanu had no doubts. But what do to about 
        it? And how to do it in such as way as to spare Morrighan? Those were 
        questions for which she had no answer. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unkle, she finally 
        decided, Unkle will know what to do. And with that decision made, decided 
        to follow that up with a good night's sleep. Announcing her intentions 
        to her guild mates, she prepared to camp for the night, also asking that 
        they pass on the message to Unkle that she needed to talk to him. But 
        even as she drifted off to sleep, secure in her decision to talk to Unkle 
        came another question. How could Unkle have allowed this to happen?</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The day began as a 
        usual day, her new friends and hunting companions were taking down some 
        aviaks and had some undead hunting planned for the nighttime. All in all, 
        a good day and good companions to hunt with. There was, however, a shadow 
        upon her heart, Morrighan, her dark sister. She knew that the time of 
        confrontation was soon. And with that thought in mind as she traveled 
        to meet her companions, making sure of a swift return to the Qeynos area 
        as Qeynos seemed to be the main hunting ground for the daemon.<br>
        <br>
        Resting after a fight with a troublesome aviak, she let her mind roam, 
        and she heard. Heard the call the spirits brought to her of a guild mate's 
        plight. Ellen, the young bard, was being stalked by the daemon again.<br>
        <br>
        Standing from her meditation, with barely enough power to send herself 
        home, she excused herself from her hunting party, letting them know of 
        her need to return. It touched her heart that none protested her leaving, 
        though the hunting was easier with her powers and skill at healing. All 
        gave their best wishes in confronting the daemon.<br>
        <br>
        As she gathered the spirits to take her home, she sent a few off to reassure 
        Ellen, help was on the way. As the spirits transported her to Everfrost, 
        they also gave her images of Ellen's plight. That she was terrified was 
        plain, trying to hide from the daemon that had so soundly defeated her 
        a few days ago.<br>
        <br>
        Arriving in Everfrost, Sanu meditated for strength, the trip having depleted 
        the stores she had. But once done, she made the trip quickly to Qeynos, 
        following the spirit's path. Querying the spirits again, she followed 
        their path through the northern part of Qeynos and then to the south. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The trail was lost in the rush of people and she felt frustration, not 
        wanting to search every room of Qeynos, needing to find Ellen quickly. 
        The spirits answered, though not quite as she thought they would. Coreena, 
        another young guild mate appeared, to show her the way. She smiled to 
        herself as Coreena lead the way to Ellen, smiling at the strength and 
        willingness of the young rogue to keep watch for the daemon and to warn 
        Ellen of any danger.<br>
        <br>
        To the large inn, Sanu was lead, through the maze of rooms until at last 
        one was reached. She opened the door, slowly, only to be greeted with 
        a shriek. Ellen clutched her chest as she sank to the bed, "You scared 
        me!" she accused Sanu, even as she hugged Sanu.<br>
        <br>
        Sanu smiled slightly as she returned the hug of the human bard, "You are 
        safe now. I will not allow her to harm you."<br>
        <br>
        Coreena nodded, "Yes, very safe. I'll watch outside"<br>
        <br>
        To Coreena, Sanu warned, "Do not tempt Morri if she comes. Leave that 
        to me."<br>
        <br>
        Coreena nodded as she returned to her vigil.<br>
        <br>
        "Thank the Gods you're here!" said Ellen, "What should I do?" Sanu could 
        tell the bard was strained as she smiled a bit sickly, not the usual expression 
        for one whose livelihood depends on entertaining others.<br>
        <br>
        "Stay here, I will see if I can deal with Morri," a vague plan having 
        formed in her mind on the run over.<br>
        <br>
        Ellen relaxed a bit, "Can I stay with you?"<br>
        <br>
        Sanu looked at Ellen, sensing her fear and the lessening she brought to 
        her. While she preferred not to have anyone else around if her plan backfired, 
        she saw that Ellen would be more upset and fearful if she requested her 
        to leave.<br>
        <br>
        "Yes," Sanu responded, "As long as you don't interfere. And run if it 
        goes badly. I will see what I can do to keep her distracted long enough 
        for you to get away. If things go wrong."<br>
        <br>
        Nodding, she responded, "Yes. Once is enough for me"<br>
        <br>
        Coreena poked her head in for an update, no sign of Morri. Sanu cast the 
        dice and sent the spirits to challenge Morri and lead her to them. Now 
        it was a matter of waiting, hoping and praying. That she was doing something 
        foolish, she was certain that Unkle would agree, but Unkle was not here 
        and she had to follow the dictates of her heart. Sanu was certain that 
        she could reach Morrighan and perhaps, just perhaps, help her to throw 
        off the daemon's yoke. It was risky and the price of failure would be 
        high. But for her dark sister, she was willing to take the chance.<br>
        <br>
        She glanced over at Ellen, seeing the fear on her face. That someone feared 
        Morri as much as Ellen did, made Sanu wince. Placing a hand on her shoulder, 
        trying to communicate some of the love she had for Morri, she said, "I 
        know you have only known her possessed, but she does possess a good heart, 
        if slightly damaged."<br>
        <br>
        Ellen nodded, "I will pray to the Gods then, for you. I'm sorry, but I 
        have no love to spare for Morrighan. I have to believe that she was worth 
        loving once, but now?"<br>
        <br>
        Calmly, Sanu said, "Unkle opened my eyes that darkness can be used to 
        deliver Justice. And with that, I learned to see Morrighan as she was, 
        and not the trappings of her dark art. She saw her parents murdered before 
        her very eyes in a most unpleasant way. Unkle took her in with the hopes 
        of healing her soul."<br>
        <br>
        Ellen raised an eyebrow as she thought for a few moments, "Perhaps, but 
        it seems to be a round about way of doing things. Can't she simply renounce 
        them? And doesn't it bother you that her pets might be someone else's 
        relatives? Their remains made to dance at her will?"<br>
        <br>
        Sanu had to chuckle at that question, memories of the day Morri's dark 
        arts summoned Bandl's grandmother, "You should have seen Bandl when Morri 
        used his grandmother for a pet." But before she could continue the story, 
        Coreena rushed past, saying that Morri was near.<br>
        <br>
        Ellen muttered, "I swear I will have my remains scattered to the ends 
        of..." and broke off at Coreena's information. "uh oh," she gulped.<br>
        <br>
        Wanting to confront Morri alone, with no other distractions, Sanu motioned 
        for Ellen to stand behind the door, out of sight. And then she waited. 
        And prayed for guidance on her task.<br>
        <br>
        The room was quiet, save for Ellen's short breathing. And Sanu waited 
        with the infinite patience of a Shaman, the eyes of the skull on her staff 
        glowing softly with power.<br>
        <br>
        And then, appearing the hall, her dark sister stood, her skeletal pet 
        beside her. "Well, well," came the daemon's voice. "You had something 
        to say to me?"<br>
        <br>
        Sanu studied Morri for just a moment, assessing the daemon's strength, 
        managing to still the shudder at the red eyes. "Morrighan, dark sister. 
        Dismiss your pet, Morri. And let's talk."<br>
        <br>
        The daemon sneered, "Talk, the pet stays."<br>
        <br>
        Sanu mentally shrugged, not surprised the daemon wanted the pet to stay 
        but figuring it was worth a shot. She addressed Morri, trying to reach 
        Morri with her love and form a lifeline for her, to pull her back out 
        of the daemon's darkness. "I know that you don't want to do this Morri. 
        Fight the Daemon."<br>
        <br>
        With all her power, Sanu tried to form her love into an tangible thing, 
        to pierce the daemon's darkness with the light of her love, to reach Morri 
        and pull her out. Strain etched Morri's face, and her voice cracked. Sanu 
        felt new hope when she heard Morri's voice, instead of the daemon's, "Sanu. 
        Don't make me kill you."<br>
        <br>
        Thrusting all fear aside, concentrating only on her love for Morri, Sanu 
        continued, "I know my dark sister wouldn't hurt me. Fight the Daemon, 
        Morri! I'll not fight you."<br>
        <br>
        A corner of her mind noted that Ellen stood there trembling, perhaps in 
        awe of Sanu's faith. Calling upon the spirits for aid, Sanu started to 
        glow a bit, her love translating into the real world.<br>
        <br>
        Tears formed on Morri's face, "Sanu, help me."<br>
        <br>
        Her cry, her plea for help tore at Sanu's heart and she took a small step 
        forward, holding out her hand, knowing that if Morri could take her hand, 
        she could make the contact more solid and perhaps guide her sister out 
        of the darkness. "Morri! Please, fight the Daemon! Come to me!"<br>
        <br>
        But the daemon would have none of it. Sanu saw the agony on Mori's face 
        as, with a shout of "No!" Morri turned away. Fleeing from Sanu, the daemon 
        ran towards the sanctuary of the necromancer guild. Without a pause, Sanu 
        ran after her, cursing the human establishments and their low ceilings 
        that caused her to duck, losing time.<br>
        <br>
        The trail lead to the Hall of Steel and there, Sanu found Morri, panting, 
        looking wildly around her. "Morrighan," she said as she neared, "Please, 
        fight the Deamon. This isn't you."<br>
        <br>
        Morri's eyes darted from side to side and Sanu could see the struggle. 
        Her voice strained, "Please, Sanu, don't make me kill you."<br>
        <br>
        Casting the die, knowing the time to be now, Sanu spoke the words, "I 
        love you, dark sister, please return to me."<br>
        <br>
        Tears ran down both their faces, mixing with the new rain. Sanu noted 
        Coreena in the distance, watching, her face tense, hoping.<br>
        <br>
        After a frozen eternity, the balance shifted, and the skeletal pet suddenly 
        struck Sanu, blindsiding her. Sanu staggered from the blows, trying to 
        recover her wits to defend herself from the pet, "Morri! No!! Please! 
        Don't do this!"<br>
        <br>
        And yet the pet still continued its ruthless attack, pounding Sanu. And 
        in the distance, Sanu could feel Morri gather her dark powers. She screamed 
        in pain as the dark magics hit her, burning her blood. And still the pet 
        continued to attack.<br>
        <br>
        Years of training came to her aid as she staggered to her feet again, 
        managing to at least ward off and strike back at the pet. She gathered 
        the frost spirits and sent them against the pet, but the pet, obeying 
        its orders, was unaffected by the blows. Again, Sanu cried out to Morri, 
        "Morri! Please! I'll not fight you! I don't want to hurt you! Please don't 
        do this!"<br>
        <br>
        The only response to her plea was the daemon's cackle and the continued 
        pounding of the pet. Again, she felt the dark magics strike her, suck 
        her down. Her soul howled with despair as the darkness swept her away. 
        As she fell, the darkness swirling around her, she was vaguely aware of 
        Coreena and could only hope she had sense enough not to join the fray. 
        Her last vision was one of Morri running away, leaving her to suffer her 
        last moments alone as the dark magics worked around her.<br>
        <br>
        As Sanu regained consciousness, failure and grief threatened to overwhelm 
        her. She had been so certain that her love would protect her. That Morri 
        wouldn't strike her down. And as she thought of that, she also remembered, 
        it wasn't Morri who struck her down. It has been the Daemon. Morri had 
        actually fled from her, knowing what the Daemon would do, wanting to protect 
        Sanu from its powers. And hope, that fragile butterfly, took flight again 
        in Sanu's heart. Morri was still there. Not all was lost. She must find 
        Unkle and let him know what she had learned. Together, with his skill, 
        they could free Morri's soul.<br>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The young girl was lost in a swirling darkness 
        and the wind lashed her long brown hair into her face to be damped by 
        the tears it found there. She had been wandering for longer than she could 
        remember. She had no clear recollection of how she had come here or why, 
        but she knew she had to find her way out again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;You will never escape here&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">There it was again, that horrible voice 
        that was everywhere and nowhere. She ran screaming through the darkness 
        but then another faint voice stirred. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">&quot;Morri… Dark Sister.. Why are you doing 
        this? You have to fight it Morri…&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Sanu? Could it be? But where was she?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The girl called out in the darkness &quot;Sanu, 
        Sister help me please!&quot; Slowly the darkness before her wavered into 
        a familiar place. It was the Arena of Qeynos, and there before her stood 
        her sister, face pained but her weapons ready. The girl felt familiar 
        dark magic surging in her flesh thrills through her body as the focused 
        in her hands…. She felt the poisons forming there… Oh spirits NO!!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The girl’s pet flashed by her and it’s decaying 
        claws raked Sanu’s face causing blood to well and flow. Then the energy 
        flashed from her hands in a dark surge of venom and arced across Sanu’s 
        body and she writhed in agony. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The girl’s screams where silent in her mind 
        and she struggled against the darkness that moved her like a puppet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In a whirlpool of pain and confusion the 
        arena faded from her eyes as Sanu fell, and one long anguished scream 
        rent the air. &quot;Noooooooooooooooo&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Then the girl was lost and alone again in 
        the darkness, her only companion the sure knowledge that she had slain

        Reflections </font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">by Ellen</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I have been searching 
        myself lately for some small scrap of charity...some tiny bit of understanding 
        that I can use to imagine a different Morrighan. I have made a discovery 
        about myself in the process. I am a bigot. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Necromancy...the 
        very word sends an involuntary shudder down my spine. To be a bard is 
        to be cursed with the most vivid of imaginations...and I cannot contain 
        my horror at the visions that particular word calls up. I cannot see a 
        Necromancer's summoned pet without wondering if I might have known the 
        remains in their (I am sure) happier living days. Could those staggering, 
        lurching piles of rotting, odorous scraps of bone and flesh have once 
        been a hunting buddy, or a fellow storyteller? Or, most terrible of thoughts....a 
        member of my own family?? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As for the rest of 
        the so-called art...almost all of which deals with death and disease...how 
        can one reconcile the origin of these powers and their devastating effects 
        to anything in the living, lighted world? In my mind, it is like summoning 
        a vision of Innourok bedding Tunare, and expecting joy from the union. 
        It is an obscenity. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yet this is not how 
        so many others in the guild see Morrighan at all. Last night, as I watched 
        Sanu approach her, speaking softly of sisterhood, I was stunned. Not, 
        as one might think, with sheer terror, although that had been my only 
        reaction to Morrighan earlier that eve..but instead with astonishment. 
        I could tell by the light in Sanu's eyes and by the tone of her voice, 
        that she <i><b>meant</b></i> it! Her love for Morrighan, and her trust 
        that she could never be hurt by one she called sister, lit her face like 
        a beacon. For just a few moments, I too believed in that Morrighan...the 
        one I have before this thought only a delusion. When she turned and ran, 
        rather than hurt Sanu, my heart soared with the hope of hate overturned 
        by love. And perhaps...just for a moment..it was. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But like everyone 
        before her, Sanu reaped the sad rewards of trust betrayed...love denied. 
        Coreena and I watched as she was cut down before our very eyes...yet another 
        victim to the myth of Morrighan's good heart. I ran from that section 
        of town, and spent the night in the slums, huddled beneath one tents in 
        the pit there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I know, I know...I've 
        heard it a million times. "This isn't Morrighan, it's the demon." And 
        I <b><i>do</i></b> try. I try to imagine myself possessed, to imagine 
        myself not in control of myself...to imagine what it would be like to 
        be inside, watching horrified as I felled everyone I loved, one at a time. 
        That works for a time..until I imagine a healing...a Morrighan no longer 
        possessed. Then I confront my own weakness...for I cannot imagine a necromancer 
        in honest tears over those she has so ruthlessly pursued and tormented. 
        I can't imagine a woman baptized in the blood of Innorouk feeling remorse 
        for the agony she has caused her family. I can't imagine a Death Mage 
        sorrowful over death! And so I return full circle to my distrust, that 
        I dare now hope is bigotry, and nothing more. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For if it <b><i>is</i></b> 
        bigotry,...and Morrighan is as most of the others believe, and not just 
        the dark reflection of my own fear and ignorance...then I may be able 
        to overcome it somehow. If it is not, then everything my heart and mind 
        screams at me is true, and there is no hope for either Morrighan or my 
        new family unless she is finally destroyed.</font></p>

        did love the mischevious, impertinent halflings that he had created. The 
        wee priestess Niami had capitalized on that on more than one occasion 
        in order to pull herself out of scrapes, and now it was second nature 
        ... even when dealing with a demon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What did this foul 
        beastie think it was doing anyway, taking over dear Morri's body and soul 
        like that? And such arrogance to boot! Imagine, thinking that it, and 
        it alone, believed it could bring about the entire world's destruction, 
        not to mention claiming Niami's very soul!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pfaugh! Not today 
        that wasn't going to happen. Thank you very much, next fantasy please!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Her hold on life, 
        however, it could temporarily suspend, and it waylaid her in the misty 
        thicket outside her homeland to prove that fact. She gave it a what for, 
        though, you can be sure! Divine wrath, even when called down by a wee 
        mite like Niami, was painful, as the demon soon learned. It had to resort 
        to several spells that would make her feet run while her spirit wanted 
        to fight, in order to fell her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And then it tried 
        to gloat! The nerve of some things!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, he, she, or 
        it was about to learn that clerics of Bristlebane are made of sterner

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Threaten to come 
        back, slay her again and take her soul, would it? Did it truly believe 
        it was that powerful, the demented thing?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Slay her all it wished 
        it could certainly do, and she'd be glad to oblige in hopes that it drained 
        the beast of some of it's power along the way, but it wasn't having her 
        soul.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Bristlebane watched 
        after his own, especially one so irreverent and impish as Niami. What 
        of her soul was not tied to her beloved family of Spiritwalkers was hers 
        and his, thank you very much!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A merry giggle wafted 
        out of the thicket as she told the demon that in no uncertain terms, and 
        had the pleasure of listening to silence answer her comments.</font></p>

        fresh wounds will heal on my already scarred soul ... and how similar 
        wounds will heal on my beloved Joril.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The daemon possessing 
        Morrighan taunted Joril until he did battle with it this day, and I was 
        next to useless. No matter how hard I tried to pull the bony pet off Joril, 
        so that he had a chance at touching Morrighan, I could not seem to land 
        a single blow ... I could not guard my beloved's back, and he fell in 
        front of my eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I went berserk with 
        rage and despair, maddened beyond all logical thought, and launched myself 
        at the foul fiend. I finally dispatched the bony pet, and launched myself 
        at Morrighan, only to find her slipping in and out of the shadows so much 
        that I kept losing sight of her, and could not follow her trail. The ground 
        was already too trampled and blood-soaked from her combat with Joril for 
        me to find a clear trail. I bandaged my wounds hurriedly, while trying 
        to find her, and was set upon by a second bony minion of hers. That too 
        was dispatched, as she stood at a distance and lobbed spells at me, robbing 
        me of breath, stealing my lifeforce. It felt like it was trying to tear 
        my very spirit from me. In a blind rage I rained blows down upon the form 
        of Morrighan, suddenly uncaring, unthinking that in destroying the form 
        of my future sister-in-law, I might destroy her utterly, but free the 
        daemon. I damaged it quite a bit, with a strength born of fury, but in 
        the end, I too was struck down, to lie not far from my beloved Joril.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I cannot fully explain 
        the deep despair I fell into, as I truly thought I had finally become 
        secure in my own sense of self-worth. Somehow, though, all that crumpled 
        in an instant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Vicious taunts from 
        the daemon rang in my head as I regained consciousness, preying on every 
        single self-doubt I'd ever had. The words themselves are gone from my 
        mind now, but the meaning behind them still burns painfully fresh. I was 
        worthless, I was useless. I was unworthy of being anyone's wife, I was 
        good for nothing other than being a scullery maid. Variations on the many 
        hurtful things my mother had said to me, her unworthy daughter, when I 
        was young. On and on, hitting raw nerves I thought had healed during my 
        time with the Spiritwalkers, with Joril. They continued, almost beyond 
        bearing -- I should crawl into a bottle like my mother did and give up 
        and die. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Oh, giving up was 
        such a tempting thought at that moment. I had failed, utterly. I had been 
        vanquished a second time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The daemon made a 
        miscalculation, though, as it became more gloating and overconfident. 
        It threatened to kill my father and make me stand by and watch ... just 
        as I watched my mother die. I remember protesting that my mother had died 
        all alone after leaving me behind, but to my own ears, my protests were 
        hollow. I should have tried harder to stop her from going, even though 
        I'd been such a wee lass at the time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The daemon sensed 
        my impending total emotional defeat. &quot;Poor Ru, all alone.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril, who had been 
        lost in his own pain and self-doubts, roused himself to my defense. I 
        was not alone, I had him, and all the rest of the Spiritwalkers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">and that is when 
        the daemon made a bad miscalculation, one that made us see where our strength 
        against this thing lies. It verbally started attacking Joril. Bad idea.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As Joril looked ready 
        to throw his beloved Langseax of the wolves in the ocean, I found the 
        energy and the inspiration, from Karana knows where, to launch a counterattack. 
        It had not studied us as much as I had thought. While my own worth was 
        still in doubt, I knew full well Joril's worth, his strengths. &quot;Have 
        you not realized yet, foul beast, that adversity makes men like my father 
        and Joril stronger? Joril carries Dvinn's still-beating heart as proof 
        of what happens when you try to defeat them. They return, stronger, more 
        powerful than before to exact vengeance.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I thank the gods 
        for that inspiration, as I watched Joril re-arm himself with his beloved 
        blade and stand straighter, launching himself into a full verbal offensive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So close ... we had 
        been so close to utter defeat, when all along, we should have remembered 
        that together we are strong, and that adversity makes us stronger.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But has it? I still 
        feel hollow inside, as if something vital, something precious, had been 
        torn from me in that battle. So hollow ... so weak. I only pray that whatever 
        inner damage was done, I can be strong enough to be at the final battle 
        against this daemon ... though I doubt I can withstand another such battle, 
        mayhaps I can buy enough time for the others to unite, and save Morri's 
        soul, and the world, from this foul beast.</font></p>

        Nebula </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Let me start by thanking 
        everyone involved. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Coreena, who helped 
        me with such immediate needs as daemon baiting, pen finding and lion unknotting. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Starwise, who tried 
        so very hard to "save" me. She misunderstood, but her heart was in the 
        right place. (Please note this is a literary truism. I have no real proof 
        of the positioning of said organ.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aesop and Sanu, for 
        sharing such preliminary data as they were able. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All of the SpiritWalkers 
        present at the time of the experiment, for their moral support. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That said, let us 
        now examine the details and occurrences in existence before the experiment. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As shown in Wizbing 
        Weaselpop's groundbreaking work, "Daemons Among Us, Run and Hide," daemon 
        possession <i><b>is</b></i> a real problem in our society today. The number 
        of daemon possession cases increases at an alarming rate. Yet in spite 
        of all the existing documentation, little is known of how to treat this 
        condition. We do have the good fortune to know something of the unsuccessful 
        treatments. For instance, Jonan Changer's unfortunate handling of the 
        Xanpit daemon has shown us the futility of using enchantment. Jonan, as 
        we all know, is still a mud toad, in spite of the entire enchanter community's 
        efforts to restore him to his original condition. We can see by this that 
        it is imperative that more research is done, and published regarding these 
        cases, so we may have some recourse for the general population when afflicted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In light of the 
        above, you can imagine my delight when I discovered a case of daemon possession 
        existing in the very guild I had joined just a week or two ago! I couldn't 
        believe my good fortune at being that close to one of these most unfortunate, 
        but fascinating souls. The following is a little of the background needed 
        to understand and follow the resulting experiment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In this case, the 
        guild leader had been guarding a circlet in which he had imprisoned the 
        daemon Drach'neyn. On being called away for a bit, he left the circlet 
        in the hands of a family member, who donned the circlet with predictable 
        results. The family member, referred to from here on in as M__, happened 
        to be a follower of the Necromantic School of magic. Details of her previous 
        alignment are sketchy, but as proved by Galaxia Spellsmith in her paper 
        "Daemons Made Me Do It, Fact or Convenient Excuse to Run Amok," a victim's 
        initial moral alignment has little or nothing to do with the eventual 
        outcome of these cases.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> M__, now under the 
        influence of Drach'neyn, became less and less able to control her reactions. 
        It has long been suspected that some interplanar vacuity may allow for 
        a transfer of force of will from the daemonic to the lateral (normal) 
        plane. Subject M__ would eventually be relegated to the unenviable position 
        of being only an observer in a corporeal prison, if indeed she did not 
        retreat entirely into a fugue state. (See Boneman Zombiemaker's timely 
        work "I Did What??" for some interesting and enlightening post possession 
        interviews.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Drach'neyn, now able 
        to manifest it's will in this realm, was naturally following the most 
        immediate of it's frustrated urgings. In this case, revenge upon it's 
        imprisoner seemed to be uppermost on it's mind. I'm sure this revenge 
        was all the sweeter in that the possessed was a family member of said 
        imprisoner. Drach'neyn began using the shell of M__ to systematically 
        hunt down and kill each of it's imprisoner's family and friends. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I was in the scientifically 
        fortunate position of being counted among those friends, albeit in the 
        most casual sense. Still, it was enough to attract the daemon's attention 
        to me, thus enabling me to observe first hand the effects and causal ends 
        of daemonic attack. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Drach'neyn had just 
        finished yet another battle with one of the more determined guild members, 
        and I had been attempting to garner what little information I could about 
        some unusual effects the victim claimed to have witnessed. It is most 
        unfortunate that untrained observer's nerves seem so tightly stretched 
        after these incidents. I was unable to get anything really concrete, and 
        finally retreated due to certain, ah, implied threats from fellow members. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Be that as it may, 
        I was in the process of unknotting a lion that had been deformed by an 
        experimental potion earlier that day, when I heard M__'s voice calling 
        me across the plains of Karana. I could hardly believe my luck. Drach'neyn 
        seemed to be challenging me to a death match!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I, of course, was 
        more than willing. I gathered up pen and paper, and waited at the designation 
        known as T2 for M__ to appear. The wait was a bit lengthy, and at one 
        point I was afraid Drach'neyn might not be angry enough to actually attack. 
        I enlisted Coreena's aid in gathering some effective jibes and insults. 
        I was a bit iffy about the pox comment, but it seemed to have worked, 
        as M__ showed up shortly afterward. T</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">wo things caught 
        my attention immediately. The circlet seemed out of place somehow, and 
        much too ordinary an item to be associated with a daemon of such strength. 
        Also, M__'s eyes seemed to have been changed from any humanly known color 
        to a smoky red, as if both pupil and iris had been set to smoldering. 
        I regret to say that I was so involved in these observations that I hardly 
        noticed the initial attacks of her summoned pet. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I must take a moment 
        here to mention that I found it a most unhappy circumstance that Drach'neyn 
        had possessed a Necromancer. Having a pet as an additional distraction 
        did nothing for my concentration. Add to this M__'s subsequent invisibility, 
        and it would be fair to say that I was less meticulous in witnessing than 
        I could have been.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I was at first suspicious 
        of the pet's power, but later investigation proved this to be the norm, 
        and in no way related to M__'s condition. (Special thanks to Kaeldare 
        for that bit of information.) </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The actual attack 
        was fast and furious enough to prevent me from utilizing any of my still 
        immature skills. I would have given a great deal to observe the daemon's 
        defensive, as well as offensive, tactics. Offensively, Drach'neyn proved 
        be less than elegant, as is often the case with the lower, more crude 
        and less subtle form of evil being. Suffice it to say I was pummeled to 
        death. I will leave it to future investigators of these phenomena to decide 
        if this might also have been due to my being perceived as being unworthy 
        of casting effort. Whatever the case, judging by my own and previous fighter's 
        failures, it is my opinion that single combat is not a viable tactic. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As an added note 
        to the above, I happened to notice Starwise reacting to my oncoming death 
        in a most touching and emotional manner. In retrospect, it seems that 
        this type of foe and situation brings out the cooperative aspect of our 
        personalities. Perhaps this is an unconscious manifestation of some deep 
        and interracial knowledge of more effective daemon destroying strategies? 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In conclusion, let 
        me recap and clarify what I have learned. </font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A new type of 
          fact gathering strategy should be researched and field-tested. At present, 
          it is very hard to get people to share data directly after attacks, 
          when it would be most accurate and easy to remember. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There is evidence 
          that the appearance of certain physical characteristics can be seen 
          as proof of demon possession. Eye color seems to be a clue. ( See note 
          of possible racial exceptions in the case of Trolls in Shaman Bukuku's 
          notes "Swamp Mud n Water an Pretty Eyes, Maybe You Drink?") </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Further exploration 
          into the strategies and tactics commonly employed by the possessed should 
          be initiated. Such studies could prove useful in developing self-defense 
          techniques for the victims. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The facts may 
          also suggest that single combat should be avoided when dealing with 
          this type of manifestation. it is this student's hope that through test 
          and observation proof will be found in the near future that daemon <b><i>can</i></b> 
          be defeated through acts of multiple will. </font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I humbly present 
        this paper to my peers and betters in hope that it will be added to the 
        archives in the Qeynos guild of Wizardry, on this 7th day of April, 3176.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As recounted by Sanu</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a bit of curiosity, 
        Sanu entered the Arena where she saw her Unkle and Triptych talking with 
        another entity that she couldn't quite make out. Her eyes widened a bit 
        as she saw the aura of power flickering around the floating apparition. 
        Unkle beckoned her over and whispered to her, "He's a powerful Avatar," 
        as she came near.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu nodded slightly 
        to herself, questions in her mind about what as going on, refusing to 
        admit to the gibbering fear that suddenly awoke being in the presence 
        of such a being. You knew this was likely to happen when you took up the 
        duties and responsibilities of Shaman, she thought to yourself, now is 
        not the time to go running in fear. A quick look a tUnkle confirmed her 
        first thought, Unkle was in need of support. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al, the 
        Lord of the Void, spoke, "I see more of your clan, Mortekai, made up of 
        many different types, it seems."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortekai bowed his 
        head slightly, "I am honored that you think so, Great One."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"It is not what I 
        think that matters. It is what the others think..." said Spyke Pha’al</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu noticed her 
        Unkle's brow furrow with worry, "Others, Lord?" he asked.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I am simply master 
        of the Void... the one that makes things appear, and disappear. Worlds 
        are eaten at my command. Yet what I think matters not. You seem to have 
        a... problem… within your clan. Is this true?" questioned the Avatar.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A shiver went down 
        Sanu's spine that she tried to suppress. That Morri's possession had called 
        the attention of one such as stood before them struck a chill to the depths 
        of her bones. More than ever, she wanted to run, to hide. But that would 
        accomplish nothing, and Morri's soul would be gone. And she was not about 
        to abandon her Unkle, even to one with such power. She stood by Unkle’s 
        side, trying to project her support to Unkle and to let it be known that 
        Unkle didn’t stand alone.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortekai replied, 
        "I was hoping to solve that soon, Great One. It seems my adoptive niece 
        has fallen to the possesion of the Daemon Drach'neyn."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sternly, Spyke Pha’al 
        asked, "Do you know what you have unleashed? What having Drach'neyn active 
        could mean?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a glance to 
        the side, she noticed in Triptych a break in the impassive mask she was 
        so used to seeing on one of her race. Sanu felt oddly reassured that she 
        wasn't the only one having problems with facing an Avatar. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a hint of defeat, 
        came the answer, "No, Lord. I bested the beast myself long ago, I thought 
        him small and weak. I knew not what fires I played with.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Avatar chuckled 
        dryly, "That is obvious."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I have come to beg 
        that the Gods give me the chance to perform the Ritual of Cleansing," 
        said Mortekai, "I pray that I may try to resolve this matter soon, before 
        worse happens, Lord.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu muttered to 
        herself, meant for her ears only, but not knowing of the Arena’s ability 
        to carry her words, the others heard, &quot;Worse has happened. Aesop 
        fell to the daemon's power this eve."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unkle stiffened and 
        paled at Sanu's words.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al's voice 
        resounded through the Arena, "Do you know the attention that this is gathering? 
        It seems that Cazic-Thule himself is taking much pleasure in watching 
        what your Necromancer does."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At mention of Cazic-Thule, 
        Triptych instinctively tried to hide herself, and in failing that, covered 
        herself with illusion to look like something meant to be here and not 
        a dark elf. Sanu paled even more and she could sympathize with Unkle’s 
        sudden wish for the ability to cast illusions and hide. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In disbelief, Mortekai 
        says, "Then the beast is not the servant of Innouruk? Then I know now 
        why I failed."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al's laughter 
        wafted through the Arena. "The small one may have the best idea there."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu almost laughed 
        at the small "meep" that seemed to come from the fire pot that now stood 
        where Triptych was. Almost.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al continued, 
        &quot;Oh... the one you speak of is not a servant of any that you </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">know. 
        There are powers that exist that are even greater than your Tribunal… 
        Innoruuk… even myself."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unkle cringed and 
        Sanu's heart went to him as he was chastised for his failure once again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al voice 
        continued, its power growing, &quot;Know this, if the creature is not 
        brought in... he is but the first. As he gathers souls of the mortal...his 
        power grows."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unable to stop herself, 
        Sanu gasped as it struck her the magnitude of what the daemon had done 
        to her beloved manly mage, remembering his words about feeling as if a 
        piece of himself was missing, and the soul-rending pain as the daemon’s 
        powers over came him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al did 
        not stop at her gasp, "And when he is strong enough, a gateway will open. 
        To a place that even I fear to tread. And then there will be nothing. 
        This world will simply…" Spyke Pha'al's voice lowered to a whisper, "not 
        be."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The flames in the 
        fire pot beside her wavered, as Triptych's illusion was almost extinguished 
        from the fear his words brought forth. Sanu was sure she heard a moan 
        from the flames.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shakily, Sanu whispered, 
        "Unkle," she drew in a breath, not wanting to go on, "Aesop said something 
        about a piece of his soul being taken.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Tears of despair 
        began to run down Mortekai's face, "Then the worst has already begun."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu stood very still 
        as the full meaning of the words sunk in. Beside her, the flame pot shimmered 
        and Triptych stood there, free of illusion, but white as a sheet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In a stronger voice, 
        Mortekai spoke, &quot;I have gathered the ancient pieces of the Ritual, 
        Lord of the Void. I plan to execute it here and destroy the best with 
        the help of my Clan."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Mortekai," Spyk 
        Pha'al's voice resounded again, "Do you wish to feel a taste of the power 
        that the beast holds?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I fear it, Lord, 
        but I must know it's strength,&quot; Mortekai answered.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a few muttered 
        words and gestures, arcane power flew from the Avatar’s fingers, striking 
        Mortekia full in the chest, throwing him across the Arena to hit against 
        its far wall.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Unkle!" Sanu cried 
        out, wanting to go to him, but also knowing that interference between 
        the Avatar and Unkle might not be looked upon too kindly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Silently, Spyke Pha’al 
        merely waited for the mortal to return to the dais. Sanu heard whimpers 
        from Triptych. That she still stood her ground impressed Sanu, that this 
        dark elf was made of sterner stuff was evident.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Limping back, Mortekai 
        said, "Verily is the beast powerful if this is but a taste."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"You amuse me mortal." 
        Said Spyke Pha’al dryly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych stammered, 
        "If that ... if it ... then we ... how?" feeling her ear-tips heat up 
        as she realized her temerity in speaking to the Great Lord.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha’al smiled 
        at the small dark one and Sanu only distantly noticed her faint as her 
        attention was caught in the Avatar’s next words.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al said, 
        "For that... I shall give you a hint. Know that I cannot intervene directly. 
        But if there are any pieces to pick up, I will help with that. You and 
        your clan have the only weapon that can make the beast able to be harmed."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortekai looked to 
        the Lord of the Void, unflinchingly, and resolute, standing tall under 
        his burden of guilt.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al went 
        on, "If you can destroy it, I do not know. But you have the potential 
        to be able to hurt it.&quot; As if reading his thoughts, he said to Mortekai, 
        &quot;Do not fear for your guilt, Mortal. For if you fail, you won't be 
        able to fear for anything."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Then we will find 
        the weapons, and we will defeat the beast if it can be done by such as 
        we," vowed Mortekai.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And once again, the 
        Avatar's laughter rang through the Arena, "Silly mortals. They have the 
        most powerful weapons in the cosmos. Yet, they never know it."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych returned 
        to her feet and a serious look came to her face as she thought on the 
        Avatar's words. Before she could stop herself she blurted, "Family. Unity. 
        Love." And then blushed fiercely, knowing how trite those words must sound 
        from one of her race.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu's face lit up 
        as memory rose before her, "Aye," she nodded and said softly, "The beast 
        ran from me, Unkle, when I confronted her with love." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha’al turned 
        his attention on Triptych, "What do you, one of Innoruuk's children know 
        of Love?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych gulped, 
        but stood her ground under his gaze. Finding her voice, she spoke, "I 
        am one of the Spurned, the Forsaken, Great Lord."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Forsaken by whom?" 
        questioned Spyke Pha'al.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"By my own kind, 
        as I was not dark and cruel enough for them."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortekai spoke up, 
        "Lord, I know not yet what the weapon may be, but if mortals possess it, 
        I will diligently seek it."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al ignored 
        Mortekai, awaiting Triptych's answer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych said, "I 
        do not follow ANY god. But I would willingly follow any Spiritwalker to 
        the Void and back if such would aid them."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al asked, 
        "And why is that?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a small gulp, 
        she continued, "They have taught me the true meaning of family, of love. 
        One that knows no limits of race or profession. One that accepts me as 
        I am... flawed, but capable of giving and receiving love."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a nod and chuckle, 
        the Avatar said, "Good," and turned his attention from a trembling dark 
        elf to Sanu.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As her attention 
        was caught by the Avatar, she heard Unkle mutter, "It seems even I have 
        much to learn about what it means to be a Spiritwalker."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu stood tall under 
        the Avatar’s unwavering stare, vowing to herself to meet whatever fate 
        awaited her standing proud. "Hail," said the Avatar and Sanu managed a 
        nod of </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">respect, 
        "Greetings, Lord," deciding to follow the form she had heard from Unkle, 
        her other teachings not having covered the proper form of address for 
        an Avatar.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"And what say you, 
        O woman of the towering coldness?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu gathered her 
        thoughts as best she could before responding, "Lord, the beast ran when 
        I confronted it, trying to bring out Morrighan, using the love I have 
        for my dark sister to give her a line back to us. But it was not enough."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al questioned 
        sharply, "Why do you say that? Why do you think it was not enough?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu paused, thinking 
        for a moment, trying to collect the words for what she just knew in her 
        heart. "Lord, part of being a Spiritwalker is being part of a family. 
        Unkle has taught me to look at the person, not the race or class.&quot; 
        She spared a glance at Triptych before continuing, &quot;Great deeds are 
        done when many people are involved. A family. The beast has defeated us 
        singly."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al smiles 
        and nods. "There are two that call themselves Spiritwalkers that seem 
        to know that I am speaking of." He turned to Mortekai, "But you... the 
        one that is at the head of the clan... seems to be too worried about his 
        own guilt to be able to look past it."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortekai looked to 
        the ground, "Lord, I have forgotten what it is to be a member of the family. 
        I let my grief and my guilt blind me to that which is our strength. Unity 
        and the power of many as one," came Unkle's response. "No single being 
        may defeat the daemon. But together, it can be done."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al clapped 
        his hands and mumbled to himself, the Arena walls allowing his words to 
        drift to the ears of the three mortals before him, "Sometimes you just 
        have to lead these mortals to it. But they usually can figure it out."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu smiled at Unkle's 
        words, worry for her Unkle fading as he remembered the meaning of being 
        a Spiritwalker.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych said into 
        the silence, "Grief and guilt can be powerful blinding factors, as several 
        of our members have found out, perishing to the beast." </font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unkle's lifted his 
        head, his face calm for the first time in weeks. And Spyke Pha'al smiled 
        to the small dark one again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al spoke 
        again, "Well then, it seems that you have some things to take care of 
        soon.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortekai said, "Yes 
        Lord. I will do that which is required, and I know that there are those 
        who will stand with me. I thank you."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Silly mortal barbarian. 
        The only thing that you have, that not even the gods have, is unity of 
        family and clan."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych, knowing 
        of the gods infighting, couldn't help but roll her eyes at Spyke Pha'al's 
        comment. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a nod, Sanu 
        said, "Aye. I fear for Aesop though. What will befall him with part of 
        his soul missing?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a new hope in 
        his voice, Mortekai said, "I pray that the Ritual of Cleansing will free 
        him as it does Morrighan."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al said, 
        "That all depends on what happens to the beast. At the very least, he 
        will have to die."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Before Sanu could 
        stop it, the words escaped her, "No!" her love for her manly mage instantly 
        protesting his death, wanting to protect him, defend him and keep him 
        from harm. Even as a small voice told her that defying gods or even Avatars 
        was generally bad for one's health, she knew that she would still have 
        chosen defiance over silence in this particular matter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Motekai's grim face 
        was counter to the chuckle heard from Spyke Pha'al.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al said 
        kindly, "Fear not. For it is the only way to bring his fractured soul 
        back together."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"So both parts of 
        his soul are on the same side?" ask Triptych.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Even though she saw 
        the truth of the matter, as the only way to save his soul, Sanu still 
        protested the death of her manly mage. Images of life without him swirled 
        around her and were too painful to confront.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Avatar moved 
        closer to her to whisper into her ear, "Remember who I am Mortal. The 
        Void is mine to command. I can link his spirit back to his physical form 
        before it reaches it's final resting place."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu listened, but 
        his words did not totally dispel the fear in her heart. "Yes, Lord," she 
        whispered in return, "But still I fear. I," she paused, finally daring 
        to speak of a fear she didn't want to confront, "I don't want to lose 
        him."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Then it is a sad 
        and yet jubilant day when the beast is destroyed," said Mortekai.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al tilted 
        his head at Sanu, a hint of amusement on his face. "Did you three not 
        just tell me what your greatest weapon is? Do you not think that if he 
        feels the same, that he will come back?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu smiled sheepishly, 
        "Aye. He had better come back." She chuckled, "Or I will kill him myself."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al chuckled.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Aesop will be whole," 
        Mortekai announced, "He is truly one of us."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a smile, Triptych 
        said to Sanu, "I believe you."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Smiling, Spyke Pha'al 
        said quietly, "I think they can be taught." Continuing in a more normal 
        voice, "Now that I have been about as subtle as the weapon that... Unkle... 
        is wielding... I think you have much to talk about… and plan for."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sanu chuckled as 
        she glanced at the large gavel Unkle had picked up on his </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">travels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha’al continued, 
        "But do not think that I am friend. Even if I help clean up this mess 
        after it is all said and done. I can cut as deeply as a sword and be twice 
        </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">as sharp."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortekai responded, 
        "Thank you, Lord. There is much I owe you for this aid. My heart is pierceable 
        Lord, and I bleed. But for this cause I would die."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spyke Pha'al nodded 
        slightly, "Oh, and just to remind you what you are up against." Arcane 
        fire flew from his fingertips once again to strike the mortals before 
        him, picking each up to be thrown across the Arena as rag dolls, to be 
        stopped only by the great wall surrounding the inner ring.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As the three returned 
        to the dais, humbled by the power, Spyke Pha'al spoke, "Remember that 
        power."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All three knelt before 
        the Avatar, murmuring assurances that they would not forget. Spyke Pha'al 
        patted Triptych on her head, "You will do well, child. You are one of 
        the ones…" He stopped, "I must be on my way. I have a world to devour."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And with another 
        summoning of arcane power, the Avatar disappeared in a flash and flurry 
        of light.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And there was silence 
        in the Arena, as three mortals tried to digest what they had witnessed 
        and been party to.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finally, Sanu broke 
        the silence, "Wow. Quite the light show."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unkle nodded, "Aye, 
        a powerful being indeed."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Gathering the spirits' 
        power, Unkle sent the summons to each Spiritwalker, to tell them the time 
        had been set, the battle was to be fought, the daemon stopped and souls 
        to be saved from the Darkness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was with a far 
        lighter heart that Sanu retired for the evening, knowing now the weapon 
        to be used, knowing she had been right. And knowing that now, there was 
        a chance. Now there was Hope and her family, being torn apart by this, 
        would come together again.</font></p>

        One</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">by Triptych</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unkle needed help, 
        so she went. Never mind that it was a long trip, through areas quite hostile 
        to a young enchantress, much less a dark elf. He needed help, and Triptych 
        would do <i>anything</i> for the Spiritwalkers. Anything ay all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And so she found 
        herself deep in Lake Rathe, at an arena dedicated to trial by combat.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She'd been lending 
        her small magical knowledge to the ritual that Unkle was perfecting to 
        save Morri when <b>HE</b> arrived, with Sanu's then-anticlimatic arrival 
        moments later.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Where there was empty 
        air one moment, the next there was a being of great power. To the eye, 
        he looked like an imposing high elven man, but it didn't take an enchantress 
        such as herself to know that he was more, much, much more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She had never been 
        one who wroshipped (or feared) any specific deity. Trip's view of the 
        gods up to that point had been rather jaded: they were akin to bored, 
        squabbling children, with far too much time, and power, on their hands. 
        It was always just best to avoid their notice where possible. But now, 
        in front of her inky little nose was an Avatar. Not one of the major deities, 
        but still one powerful enough to make her rethink her view. There was 
        <i>nothing</i> childish about this Great One, or the piercing regard that 
        sliced to the very core of her soul.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So overwheling was 
        his aura to her senses that she did not always pay much heed to the conversation 
        as she should. Let the holy types discuss demons and souls, she would 
        just concentrate on not drawing too much of that powerful regard in her 
        direction ...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, mention 
        of Cazic-Thules interest in the demon's antic brought her attention back 
        to harsh reality. Innoruuk <i>and</i> Cazic-Thule were involved enough 
        to concern this Lord of the Void? Two of the most destructive powers known 
        to this world wanted this demon running amok?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This was too much 
        for one as young as she, and without thought, Trip drew her magics around 
        her, instinctively trying to make herself less conspicuous ... as if that 
        would matter if a Great One was truly interested in one as insignificant 
        as her. She found herself imitatingthe form of a firepot, crackling merrily 
        despite her fear.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This, unfortunately, 
        drew the attention of the Lord of the Void, one of the things that she 
        had been trying to avoid. Though his laughter seemed kind, she couldn't 
        control the tiny, panicked &quot;meep&quot; of a young lass who was way 
        out of her league.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The conversation 
        continued around her as the Great One explained what could happen if the 
        demont got much stronger. Even the artificial flames of her illusionary 
        firepot almost flickered out at the mention of the possible destruction 
        of the world. She dropped her illusion at the mention of Aesop having 
        lost part of her soul, and the tiny part of Trip's mind that was not gibbering 
        in fear noted that she hadn't been this pale since she'd last worn a half-elven 
        illusion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She couldn't help 
        but moan when the Great One demonstrated a small fraction of the demon's 
        power, by sending Mortekai flying across the arena with studied casualness. 
        If that was only a fraction of the power that was the demon's abilities 
        ... "If that ... if it ... then we ... how?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She hadn't realized 
        that she had spoken aloud until the Great One's regard turned to her. 
        In pure terror, her body did the only logical thing. She fainted.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She must have regained 
        consciousness almost immediately, as the conversation was discussing how 
        they could defeat it. But what was this powerful weapon that mortals had 
        that the supposedly all-powerful gods did not? What, specifically, did 
        the Spiritwalkers have that was so special?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It came to her so 
        clearly that, once again, she blurted the words aloud before she thought 
        about it. "Family. Unity. Love." Trip then blushed fiercely, knowing how 
        trite those words must sound from one of her race.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"What do you, one 
        of Innoruuk's children know of Love?" The Lord of the Void queried.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, she'd gone 
        and done it now, she was going to get a personalized trip to Lavasorm 
        in a handbasket for speaking out.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But ... he seemed 
        interested in what she had to say. In for a copper, in for a plat -- if 
        she had said his much, she should finish before she was struck down for 
        her temerity. Perhaps it would show Unkle what he had forgotten -- what 
        the Spiritwalkers truly meant to one such as her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Spurned by her own 
        kind for not being evil and cruel. Spurned by other races due to the color 
        of her skin. Only through illusions did Trip have a chance to be accepted 
        anywhere -- until the Spiritwalkers found her. They'd seen the inner here, 
        and accepted her without reservation. They gave her love, support, family. 
        She would do anything for them, even risk her very soul. That there had 
        been indications that they would do the same for her continued to stun 
        and humble her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The words came pouring 
        out of her in a rush, and he seemed ... pleased?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then his regard turned 
        to Sanu, as he queried her as well. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then it was Unkle's 
        turn, and his tone became chiding. Unkle was suitably repentant, and Trip's 
        heart went out to him. She well knew how much strong emotions could make 
        people forget what they knew in their hearts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The rest of the meeting 
        passed in a blur, as she tried to control her shaken nerves. And then, 
        it became a blur of another sort, as the Lord of the Void gave yet another 
        demonstration of power. One moment she was standing on the dias, the next 
        she was flung halfway up an arena wall ... and it was a long drop. If 
        she had not been summoned back by him, she'd likely have fallen to her 
        death then and there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As Trip knelt with 
        the others before him, stammering, he patted her on the head and spoke 
        to her. "You will do well, child. You are one of the ones…" He stopped, 
        "I must be on my way. I have a world to devour."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But, but ... one 
        of what? But the Great One was gone, leaving her much to ponder about.</font></p>

        Ru Lost, Part 1</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">by Ruldari</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Hear us, o' gods!" 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ru stood as part 
        of the circle in the arena, chanting with her fellow Spiritwalkers. Joril 
        was a reassuring presence at her side as they lent their call to Unkle's 
        summoning. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Never before had 
        Ru been so frightened, or so determined. If the demon was not stopped, 
        Joril, Aesop and Ru's very souls were at risk, as was the continuing existance 
        of the entire world. Even if the demon was stopped, their souls could 
        easily be destroyed, weakened things that they currently were. Granted, 
        an Avatar had promised his aid, should they prevail against the demon, 
        but the risks were still not to Ru's liking. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Hear us, o' gods!"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ru threw a last, 
        lingering glance at her beloved Joril. At long last, they were to be wed 
        on the morrow. She prayed that they would survive to see that happy day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then, without warning 
        or fanfare, Morrighan was in their midst, the demon's mad glow radiating 
        from her eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Quickly, Ru called 
        upon the powers of the earth, urging forth grasping roots to hold Morrighan 
        in place. Around her, others were casting similar rooting spells, then 
        the battle was joined.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So great was the 
        combined firepower and physical strength of the gathered Spiritwalkers, 
        that the fight was over quickly. Ru simply stared down at her whip, still 
        dripping with Morri's blood after she struck the final death-blow. That 
        was too easy ... and she didn't feel any different.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A gasp drew her attention 
        to the center of the circle. There, floating above Morri's fallen form, 
        was the demon Drach'neyn, free of its mortal host ... and its glowing 
        red eyes were fixed upon <i><b>her</b></i>. Not only did it want the rest 
        of her soul, but it did not seem amused that she had struck Morri's death 
        blow. Oh, gods! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Agony arched through 
        her as, with a single gesture, the demon tore her spirit from its mortal 
        shell. It was an agony that seemed to last an eternity, though she could 
        sense that the battle with the demon had just been joined. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She was imprisoned 
        inside the demon, forced to watch as it battled her loved ones. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meanwhile a dark 
        vortex pulled at her, threatening total destruction. Drach'neyn's cruel 
        voice surrounded her. "I won't release you to that vortex yet, little 
        one. Not until I've sucked your spirit dry of anything of worth. Know 
        now the agony of watching those you love die, and know that <i>you</i> 
        are providing part of the energy with which I will do it." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Despair shot through 
        her, and she spared a fleeting moment's pity for Morri, realizing now 
        the depths of agony that her guildsister had been suffering. Fresh pain 
        lanced through her as Joril was struck down, and she felt a corresponding 
        surge in the demon's strength. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Noooooooo!"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As the demon's attention 
        was distracted by the many opponents it still faced in the Arena, Ru launched 
        her incorporeal self at the struggling form of Joril's spirit, now wholly 
        within the demon's domain. Regardless of what happened next, she wanted 
        them to face it together.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She felt the demon's 
        hold upon her weaken as they joined -- weakening the foul beast from within 
        with the power of their love. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Not, however, weak 
        enough, as Drach'neyn proved by striking down Aesop, and drawing in his 
        soul. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In a rage, the demon 
        waged battle from without and within. Doggedly, Ru clung to Joril, even 
        as it tried to tear them apart. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then, in the outside 
        world, Gyro struck a final blow to the demon, destroying it. Agony lanced 
        through the captive souls, and the destructive vortex surged upwards, 
        trying to suck them in, even as it started to shrink and disappear. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The incredible pressures 
        of their prison breaking up around them finally accomplished what the 
        demon could not. Ru and Joril were torn from each other and *flung* into 
        the spirit world, moments before the vortex would have destroyed their 
        souls. So close. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The aftershocks of 
        the demon's final destruction flung her about like a rag doll in a maelstorm, 
        tossing her hither and yon before finally spitting her out ... but where?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril! Panicked, 
        she cast about to find some trace of him, some reassurance that his soul 
        still existed. All about her was a featureless grey wasteland, with dense 
        grey fog swirling and eddying everywhere.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She could not find 
        him. She could not find anyone, and while she was not skilled at searching 
        the spirit world, surely there should be ... something ... shouldn't there?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then she hit a denser, 
        darker, pocket of fog, and along with it, a memory. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Mother, why 
          do we need to go to Halas?" </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Because I said 
          so. Now, shut up, you worthless chit, and get dressed!"</i></font></p>
        <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"But ... I'm 
          scared."</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pain tore through 
        her, just as it had on that day, the feeling of her drunken mother slapping 
        her across the face several times. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Panicked, Ru's soul 
        tore free of the pocket of memory.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Again, she tried 
        searching for some sign, any sign, to find her way back to those she loved. 
        A faint call teased the edges of her senses, and she surged towards it. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Without warning, 
        another pocket of that dark fog swirled up around her. </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"When I grow 
          up, I'm going to find my father." </i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Your father 
          would never want a puny half-breed like ye. Ye couldn't even fight your 
          way out of your nightshirt, much less be the mighty fighter that he 
          is." </i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She stumbled, and 
        the memory was gone ... but so was the faint call. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She was lost in the 
        spirit world.</font></p>

          Sanu</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
          roamed the lands of my youth with a far lighter spring to my stride 
          than in weeks before. A great evil has been vanquished. My manly mage 
          whole again and Morrighan, my dark sister, has returned to us, her soul 
          cleansed of the evil that gripped it and tried to corrupt it. And it 
          is with this light heart that I stop for a moment to set my tale to 
          words.<br>
          <br>
          Of the battle, I will let others more qualified than I tell that tale. 
          For I must admit I remember little of the battle after witnessing the 
          fall of my manly mage. Dimly, I remember gathering the spirits around 
          me as I went berserk with rage and grief.<br>
          <br>
          But eventually, the daemon fell to the combined might of our Clan. And 
          <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Drach'neyn was destroyed, sent back to whatever 
          Hell he came from, never to bother this world again.<br>
          <br>
          However, as I surveyed the battle field, my heart sorrowed at our fallen 
          Clan members. My brother, Joril and his wife-to-be, lay still on the 
          field. Beside them, my manly mage, Aesop. My heart stopped at the sight 
          of his still form, fears fluttered in my mind. And then, my eyes came 
          to rest on the unmoving form of Morrighan, my dark sister, for whom 
          all of this had been fought.<br>
          <br>
          Silence reigned as Hardd toed the body of the daemon and it shimmered 
          into nonexistence. Evil had been overcome, such was clear. I only hoped 
          that the <br>
          price of picking up the pieces would not be too costly. As I waited, 
          wondering what next to do, Morrighan and Aesop's spirits returned to 
          the Arena. My heart was glad, as were the others, but worry set in as 
          they were unable to join with the bodies. What if Lord Spyke did not 
          appear? How was I to exact Justice on an Avatar of the Gods if he failed 
          to do as he had promised? In the midst of my thoughts, I also noted 
          that Joril and Ruldari's spirits had not returned.<br>
          <br>
          It was then that Lord Spyke appeared. With the others, I too bowed to 
          the Lord of the Void. While my heart demanded answers, I forced myself 
          to wait, patience being the mark of a Shaman.<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke's voice resonated through the Arena, &quot;So, some of you 
          managed to survive. That is impressive.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Unkle replied, &quot;It is as you predicted, Lord.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I took that opportunity to remind others of what they might have missed, 
          &quot;Aye, but Joril and Ruldari have not returned.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke, choosing to ignore me, continued speaking to Unkle, &quot;I 
          see that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>your clan is truly 
          of all shapes and sizes, Mortekai.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Aye, Lord. They pride me by being so. I am one with them in soul 
          and purpose.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Eyes of power surveyed the scene, stopping briefly to rest on the fallen 
          clan <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>members, &quot;So these are the ones that fell. 
          These are the ones who's souls <br>
          have been darkened?&quot;</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
          Morrighan's eyes betrayed her confusion, and as Unkle spoke, another 
          filled <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>her in briefly on the past weeks and lead to 
          her being her in this way. I <br>
          noted her confusion and then horror as the full impact of what had happened 
          hit her. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I was just in the Ocean,&quot; 
          she broke off, her eyes widening, &quot;Oh gods, no.&quot; <br>
          <br>
          Unkle answered, &quot;Lord, these are the fallen. They are my family. 
          If I must give my soul for theirs, I will understand.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I forced myself to wait as Lord Spyke smiled at Unkle and spoke again, 
          &quot;No, I <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>have something else 
          for you,&quot; he trailed off. That Unkle barely controlled a shudder 
          of fear I could sympathize with, for I would not have wanted that smile 
          directed at me. &quot;But, for now, I shall do as I promised. I shall 
          link their souls back to their shells.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          A sense of relief went through me as he spoke. Watching, he stopped 
          at my brother's body. Memories of our childhood and the adventuresome 
          spirit that could not be dampened returned, and I smiled in spite of 
          my own fears.<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke's words wafted through the Arena, &quot;Brave Ranger, your 
          love for another shall make this easy.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Arcane and powerful magics flew from his fingertips to envelop Joril's 
          corpse. And in a flash that blinded but did not, my brother's spirit 
          appeared, none the worse for wear to my eyes. I smiled, and felt a bit 
          of sympathy as he put a hand to his head and groaned. Travels to the 
          spirit world are never easy.<br>
          <br>
          Joril knelt to Lord Spyke even as Lord Spyke spoke, &quot;Collect your 
          things. You shall be whole once more.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          A bit shakily, my brother responded, &quot;I, I am grateful to you, 
          Lord Spyke.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke waved off his thanks as he turned to the next corpse, that 
          of my manly mage. To say that I was merely tense would be an understatement. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Again, his voice rang through the Arena, &quot;So, it is the Manly Mage 
          of the Woman from the Hills of Ice.&quot; I was a little bit too occupied 
          with Lord Spyke, otherwise I might have blushed at the snicker from 
          Tasha. &quot;The Daemon loved the piece that he had of his soul.&quot; 
          I stopped breathing, tense and waiting for the axe to fall, &quot;But 
          no more.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          And with that, arcane magicks flew once again and the spirit of my manly 
          mage appeared, &quot;I am here, High One,&quot; we heard him say.<br style='mso-special-character:

          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Gather 
          your things, O' Master of All of the Trades,&quot; commanded Lord Spyke.<br>
          <br>
          A large smile crossed my face as I let out the breath I hadn't known 
          I was holding onto. My manly mage was whole again and I watched as he 
          happily gathered his things, grinning away.<br>
          <br>
          With a far lighter heart, I watched as Lord Spyke turned to gaze at 
          Ruldari's still form. He stood still for a moment, then said, &quot;Interesting, 
          most interesting.&quot; And turned away to look at my dark sister's 
          corpse, Morrighan.</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
          I was only dimly aware of Joril's look at he turned away. &quot;Morrighan 
          Bonedancer,&quot; Lord Spyke's voice commanded, &quot;step your spirit 
          forward.&quot; I could see the struggle on Joril's face, wanting to 
          demand an explanation, why Lord Spyke had turned away, but not sure 
          of the correct way of doing it. For once, my brother managed to control 
          his rash nature. I hoped I would be as lucky.<br>
          <br>
          As Morri's spirit stepped forward to face Lord Spyke, he spoke, &quot;Your 
          spirit <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>was the one the Daemon 
          loved the most. It was also your spirit that allowed the Daemon to be 
          destroyed. Do you know why?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Morri thought for a moment before answering in a quiet voice, &quot;My 
          love?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;For?&quot; he prompted.<br>
          <br>
          Morri's voice got a bit stronger as she answered, &quot;My family.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Again, Lord Spyke gently prompted, &quot;And?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;My sister. And for life,&quot; came the answer.<br>
          <br>
          I must admit that I was rather moved by her words. For I had known that 
          the relationship between myself and my dark sister was strong and deep, 
          but that it had survived such untainted and been the basis for Daemon's 
          defeat, moved me beyond words and I cherished the insight this gave 
          me. I had to blink back a few tears of love for my dark sister. Aesop's 
          arm curled around my waist and I felt his love for me as well. I returned 
          the hug, holding him tightly, words unable to express what I felt.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Lord 
          Spyke asked again, &quot;And their?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Morri was still for a moment as she thought and then answered, &quot;Love 
          for me?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          And as she spoke the words, she knew it for truth, that our love for 
          her, matched her love for us and tears began to run down her face.<br>
          <br>
          In a gentle voice, Spyke said, &quot;You mortals always amaze me. It 
          is like pulling teeth from an orc sometimes, but not always.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          At that moment, my eyes caught a glimpse of Joril, cradling Ruldari's 
          body. And his look of anguish tore at my heart. In looking at him, I 
          realized I was also looking at myself, had Aesop not been restored to 
          me. Joril, my brother, in body and spirit, who had defended me and taken 
          risks for me, was in need of help now. In Joril's anguish, I saw that 
          the bonds of love between him and Ruldari were as strong as they could 
          be and that Joril had found his heartlove. <br>
          <br>
          I turned to face Lord Spyke, daring to interrupt, daring anything for 
          my brother, for family, &quot;Lord,&quot; I started to say, ignoring 
          the looks of astonishment from my fellow guildmates at my audacity.<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke ignored me, continuing to talk to Morrighan, &quot;Do you 
          wish to be linked with your body again?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Between the astonishment at my interruption and the waiting to see what 
          happened, silence reigned supreme for a moment and then Morri's voice 
          spoke, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke's voice replied with an air of command, &quot;Then so be 
          it. This may take a moment.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I held my peace while Lord Spyke drew upon the arcane magicks at his 
          command to join my dark sister's spirit with her body once again. While 
          I would dare much for myself and family, I would not put them in danger 
          of magicks gone awry because of an interruption. Especially of the power 
          Lord Spyke was throwing around. And through the magicks, I caught a 
          glimpse of Unkle's face and I realized it was lined with worry, both 
          for Morri and myself. I smiled grimly to myself, knowing that whatever 
          fate awaited me for interrupting, would be mine alone, knowing I would 
          pay whatever price needed to be paid to get my brother reunited with 
          his love.<br>
          <br>
          For long moments, the magicks flew from his fingertips to swirl around 
          him and Morri until finally Morri was made whole. For the first time 
          in a long while, Morri stood before us, whole in spirit and body once 
          more. Relief swept through the guild as we looked upon Morri and knew 
          that the Daemon was truly gone.<br>
          <br>
          And as I was about to interrupt again, Lord Spyke turned to Unkle. And 
          even I could tell he would brook no interference with what he intended 
          on doing next. While I chafed at this, I also realized if he were to 
          strike me down, I could not help my brother's anguish. Standing next 
          to him, protecting him, was the best I could do while he cradled Ru's 
          body.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;And you, Leader of this Clan,&quot; came Lord Spyke's voice, all 
          gentleness gone.<br>
          <br>
          Unkle stood to meet him, &quot;Yes, oh Lord?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;The one who allowed his guilt for himself to almost cause the 
          loss of some of his clan,&quot; Lord Spyke's voice boomed forth, &quot;What 
          have you to say for yourself?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          There was silence, marred only by Joril's soft mourning of Ruldari, 
          and then Unkle spoke, &quot;I can say only that I have failed. But in 
          my failure, I have learned much of what it is to be a Spiritwalker. 
          I will pay any price to make restitution.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;And what is it that you have learned in your FAILURE, mortal?&quot; 
          Lord Spyke demanded.<br>
          <br>
          In a strong voice, Unkle answered, &quot;That only the collection of 
          many, united in love, honor and hope can carry the burden of the world, 
          Lord. One man cannot hold back the dark tides.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke clapped his hands in approval as Unkle continued, &quot;And 
          I have learned too, that there is no quick route to the goals I desire. 
          They take time and the help of those who share my dream. I was wrong 
          to do as I did, and guild is not payment for such a crime. Only restitution 
          can be made.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke gazed down at Unkle, &quot;You will pay a price.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Lord, I am willing to pay ANY price,&quot; replied Unkle.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;I have had an audience with The Tribunal and they wish for me 
          to their Voice in this matter,&quot; said Lord Spyke matter of factly. 
          Gulps and gasps of astonishment could be heard throughout as the reality 
          of the matter finally hit some of our guild. Were it not for the worry 
          I had for Joril, my voice probably would have joined theirs.<br>
          <br>
          Unkle shuddered, but stood tall as he awaited his Judgement.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;You are to pay a penance,&quot; Lord Spyke said, his eyes closing 
          for a moment as if remembering something, &quot;You are to gather three 
          items of power,&quot; he said after a moment, &quot;You shall quest 
          for these items.&quot;</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I 
          listened, but not with all my attention, for Joril's anguish was growing 
          and I knew I needed to act quickly. But I also knew that interrupting 
          The Tribunal's Judgement would be, to put it bluntly, a really bad idea.<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke's voice continued, ignoring the growing sounds of mourning 
          from Joril and my own impatience, &quot;You shall travel Norrath for 
          these items. Once you have these items, you shall disperse them to those 
          who will use them for good. Then, and only then, will your destiny be 
          back in your hands.&quot;</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril's 
          grief tore at my heart as I put a hand on his shoulder to comfort him. 
          His look in incomprehension as he gazed back at me, spurred me to action, 
          I could take no more. &quot;Lord,&quot; I again interrupted.<br>
          <br>
          Falamora also chose this time to interrupt, &quot;Lord, may he have 
          help in acquiring these Items of Power?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke opened his eyes, his mouth curling into a smirk, &quot;It 
          seems you may have the help of your clan. So be it. It is allowed.&quot; 
          <br>
          <br>
          Unkle stood frozen, waiting for the rest of the Judgement. And while 
          Unkle waited, I could not any longer, &quot;What of Ruldari?&quot; I 
          demanded as Joril also struggled to keep his composure.<br>
          <br>
          Ignoring me, Lord Spyke continued, &quot;The three,&quot; muttering 
          under his breath about The Tribunal always doing things in threes, &quot;The 
          three items are as follows. The Paw of Opalla, a pair of Lupine Claw 
          Gauntlets and a single Bracer of Erolissi.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Unkle seemed to lose a bit of color as the Judgement seared his soul. 
          &quot;I have felt the Judgement of the Tribunal, Lord. I will do their 
          will.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke smiled, &quot;Not that you have much choice in the matter, 
          mortal.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Then Unkle spoke up, &quot;What, then, of my nephew's love, Ruldari?&quot; 
          standing taller than he had in many moons.<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke looked a bit curious, &quot;Who?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Aye,&quot; I piped up as well, &quot;What of Ruldari? She has 
          not returned.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Thag from the side commented &quot;The dead half-elf you forgot to resurrect 
          when you was doing everyone else, Lord Spyke. She deserves to be raised, 
          she make good pies!&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke nodded, &quot;Ah, her. The Ranger-Warrior.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Joril raises a tearful face to Lord Spyke, &quot;Please, Lord Spyke.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;I sensed no soul to link with the shell when I went to it,&quot; 
          responded Lord Spyke.<br>
          <br>
          Joril blinked, &quot;What? No link? How can this be?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;But she has not yet reached the Void?&quot; asked Unkle.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;I am Master of the Void. Not even the slightest part of her soul 
          has touched my Realm,&quot; replied Lord Spyke.<br>
          <br>
          In utter confusion, &quot;But, we are to be wed on the morrow,&quot; 
          said Joril. He blinked, &quot;No, I cannot accept this. We are one, 
          she and I.&quot;</font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
          murmurs of the guild faded in the distance as I remembered a long ago 
          vow given to Ruldari when she first started courting for Joril's hand. 
          A vow spoken with all the force of a Shaman of the Tribunal. A vow that 
          spoke of <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Justice being delivered if Ruldari were to harm 
          Joril. A vow to hunt Ruldari down, to the Spirit World if necessary.<br>
          <br>
          My blood ran cold as I realized just what such a hunt would entail. 
          And I knew that I would be the one to do it. The vow was there, the 
          connection made. Now was the time for me to prove my worth as Shaman 
          and my dedication to The Tribunal and Justice.<br>
          <br>
          I glanced over at Unkle and he knew what I had in mind. &quot;Sanu,&quot; 
          he said, &quot;You must. You may go where I cannot.&quot; I merely nodded, 
          the dangers of this task chilling my own soul while a small voice in 
          the back of my head ironically talked about vows coming true in odd 
          ways. <br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke's voice penetrated my thoughts, &quot;If she is not in my 
          Realm, I can do nothing.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I took a deep breath as Unkle spoke again, &quot;You must find her, 
          my niece. You must bring her here.&quot; Again I nodded, wondering if 
          Unkle knew the dangers of what he asked and what my vow demanded of 
          me. Part of me wanted to run. But the vow was spoken and must be fulfilled.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, I found my voice, &quot;Yes. I will go. The vow was made long 
          ago. Long ago, I vowed to hunt her if she hurt Joril, in this world 
          or the next. To deliver Justice. That vow will be fulfilled. The hunt 
          completed.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          As the others watched, I sat down in front of Joril, trying to protect 
          a confidence I did not feel. The consequences if I failed were almost 
          enough to freeze me in fear. Forcing my voice to be smooth and calm, 
          I looked into my brother's tear-stained face, &quot;Brother, I need 
          your help to do this.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Without question, Joril nodded, &quot;Aye, sister. Ye have it.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          That he trusted me without questions warmed my heart and stilled my 
          fear. Perhaps this was possible. Once again, my brother's strong arm 
          would protect me. &quot;I need an anchor to this world.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;Anything, as long as my Ru is returned to me, sister,&quot; he 
          responded.<br>
          <br>
          A weak smile came to my lips, yes, I thought, the strength is there. 
          Strength enough to bring us both back. &quot;Join hands with me now, 
          brother. Calm your mind and think only of her. Remember your love.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Falamora, a younger shaman of our guild, asked, &quot;Is there anything 
          I may do, Sister Sanu?&quot;<br>
          <br>
          To her and the guild I replied, &quot;Guard my mortal shell. And be 
          ready to join me if necessary. I know not what forces I will have to 
          contend with to bring us back.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Falamora nodded, &quot;I pledge it, so let it be done.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Again, I smiled, gaining strength from their support. Yes, the thoughts 
          raced through my mind as I prepared to enter the Spirit World, this 
          is what it means to be a Spiritwalker. Closing my eyes, I launched my 
          soul into the Spirit World, seeing as my spirit left my mortal shell 
          Joril reaching for Morri and Unkle's hands to join the small circle. 
          Yes, with this many to guard my entrance to the Spirit World, I should 
          have no problem returning. For a moment, I looked at my guildmates with 
          spirit eyes, drinking in the light of their love, especially that of 
          my manly mage and his thought of being with me always. The warmth and 
          strength that gave me there are no <br>
          words for.<br style='mso-special-character:line-break'>
          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 
          transition into the spirit world was harsh and sudden in this place 
          where death ruled. Cold winds blew around me, white-grey mists swirling 
          to obscure the landscape around me. I extended my senses, trying to 
          locate Ruldari.<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke's words came to me through my link to Joril, &quot;Find her 
          in the Spirit World. And through the link you have forged, I will bring 
          her back.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I nodded my understanding and let the spirit winds draw me deeper into 
          their realm. &quot;Ruldari!&quot; I shouted to the winds. And, knowing 
          that I needed a <br>
          personal link, a personal call, I acknowledged Ruldari as a sister, 
          opening my heart to her, &quot;Sister! Come to me!&quot;<br>
          <br>
          The whine of the winds were my only response. The mists in front of 
          me writhed and formed an image, an image from my memories, memories 
          I opened myself up to when I acknowledged Ruldari as a sister of my 
          heart. Memories of my parents' death and that pain of loss, loss of 
          a family member. That pain making it difficult to accept Morri as a 
          family member at first. And now, I had admitted another to the circle 
          of those who could hurt me.<br style='mso-special-character:

          </font></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Before 
          I could stop, I turned away from those images. And in doing so, made 
          an almost fatal mistake, for I granted the mists power by my denial. 
          The mists grew louder and accusations started to spew forth from the 
          mists as they gathered round me. I faltered beneath the mists, growing 
          colder as the mists seemed to leach the warmth from my very soul. But 
          as I went to one knee, light and warmth came to embrace me. My brother, 
          somehow sensing my distress, doing what he has always done, lending 
          me his strength, strength of body and strength of love.<br>
          <br>
          I stood and faced the mists. Yes, I knew, I could be hurt. But there 
          would always be love to help me recover. Something, that as a Spiritwalker, 
          I would never be without. The mists disbursed as I stood, fleeing at 
          the light and warmth that radiated from me, their power broken. A living 
          spirit had to give power to the dead spirits which I had done by denying 
          them. Soft wails could be heard from the mists as I advanced, the mists 
          now parting before me.<br>
          <br>
          Looked around, the first danger overcome, I realized that the hunt would 
          take me deeper into the Spirit World. This was not going to be as easy 
          as I had hoped.<br>
          <br>
          I wandered for what seemed like ages, calling her name. &quot;Ruldari! 
          Sister! You are needed into the mortal realm! Come! Return to Joril! 
          Come to me and I will show you the way!&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Direction being useless in the spirit world, I walked as my instincts 
          told me. There was a time when I felt I was being watched and a time 
          I felt I was guided. But time was meaningless. An then, at last, a trail. 
          A trail in this cold and barren world. &quot;Ruldari! Sister!&quot; 
          I called, my feet quickening as I followed the trail. Somehow I sensed 
          her close.<br>
          <br>
          And then, it happened, faintly I heard her voice, &quot;Help me!&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I ran towards the voice, heedless of the mists and terrain, &quot;Ru! 
          Sister!&quot; And then, in the mists ahead of her, a hand, one not made 
          totally of mist, one with the delicate fingers of elvish blood in the 
          veins. And then I found myself stopped, I could go no further into the 
          spirit realm. I had not the power to venture further.<br>
          <br>
          &quot;No,&quot; I growled, &quot;This is not how it will end!&quot; 
          I sent a call back to Joril, using the power of our love as a link, 
          &quot;Joril, join with the others!&quot;<br>
          <br>
          And almost instantaneously, I felt the surge of power and rushing headlong 
          towards the hand I had seen that was being pulled into the mists.<br>
          <br>
          Our fingertips brushed, &quot;NOW!&quot; I screamed to Joril and though 
          him to Lord Spyke. I felt the power flow and somehow miss as Ruldari 
          was swept away by the mists. My soul was chilled by her hand, such despair 
          had filled Ru's soul. That Ru had given power to her nightmares in this 
          place I know knew <br>
          for truth. That someone should have such nightmares, chilled me.<br>
          <br>
          Without thought, I plunged into the mists, the mists she had given life 
          to, heedless of the danger, of being claimed by the mists forever. And 
          in the mists, I felt a hand and gripped it, ignoring the chill. I pulled 
          the hand closer and an arm appeared. A sense of worthlessness almost 
          overcame me as I clung to her hand. But I let it wash over me. Giving 
          in to such was not part of my duty here. Rescuing my brother's true 
          love was. Again, I pulled, and as I pulled, I projected love and warmth 
          and most importantly, acceptance. Acceptance of her as she was. In a 
          rush, Ru fell into my arms, to cling to me, sobbing. I hugged her without 
          reservation and hoped that Joril would know to bring us both back, for 
          I lacked the strength to do naught but hold her.<br>
          <br>
          As I learned later, somehow, Lord Spyke knew that contact had been made 
          and it was time to act. I felt a pull and then a rather rude jerk. And 
          the next thing I knew, I was opening my eyes to stare a bit blankly 
          at my manly mage. That I was spent would be a bit of an understatement 
          and it took a few moments for the world to begin to make sense to me 
          again.<br>
          <br>
          But when it did, I could only smile as I saw Ruldari whole again and 
          my brother happy. I let the warmth of my manly mage sink into the still-chilled 
          corners of my soul to banish the last of the cold and dark of my journey. 
          As I recovered, Aesop told me of what happened during my absence, that 
          Joril had gotten everyone to join the circle. I nodded, knowing that 
          is what enabled me to drive into the mists with even a chance at returning. 
          And when the time was right, I smiled wryly as I told Ruldari, &quot;I 
          told you I would hunt you down.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          &quot;So ye did, Sanu, so you did,&quot; she replied.<br>
          <br>
          Grinning somewhat, &quot;I just didn't think my vow would take me to 
          such places.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          It was then that my glance fell upon Lord Sypke, sitting on the throne, 
          looking as though he had been wounded. I heard him say, &quot;It is 
          what had to be done.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Unkle approached him, &quot;Lord, twice now you have visited me. I shall 
          not give you cause for a third.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke chuckled, &quot;Let us hope that you do not give me reason 
          again,&quot; as he winced.<br>
          <br>
          Blurgle spoke up, &quot;Is yew ok Mister Spyke?&quot; concern on his 
          Troll face.<br>
          <br>
          With a nod, Lord Spyke answered, &quot;Time heals all wounds, good Troll. 
          I simply was not prepared for what I had to do.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          And I watched as my family and guild began their healing now that the 
          ordeal was over, Morri returned to us and Ruldari joined as well. We 
          were a family once again, and I could not help but smile as Unkle congratulated 
          us on our victory.<br>
          <br>
          Lord Spyke had a final comment before leaving in his usual light show, 
          &quot;The ability for mortals to know love is something that even the 
          gods are envious of. But I must depart. I have used much strength here. 
          The scales have been balanced and I do not wish to be the one to tip 
          them the other way.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          We all showed him our respect and thanks as he looked us over one last 
          time. And as the magicks gathered about him to transport him elsewhere, 
          I was glad he had come a bit closer to mortals, glad for his guidance 
          and glad I had done my duty in delivering Justice.<br>
          <br>
          And when he had left, Ruldari told the rest of us what Lord Spyke had 
          told her, of what price he had paid to fulfill his oath to pick up the 
          pieces. The arena was quiet as we heard her words, &quot;My friends 
          and future family, I was brought back at a great cost, it seems. Lord 
          Spyke had to give up a part of himself to save me. Part of his spirit 
          was spent, pulling me back. The Daemon had taken the last of my soul 
          and I was lost in a vast wasteland. Almost,&quot; she paused as memories 
          returned, &quot;almost was I lost forever.&quot;<br>
          <br>
          I nodded, now understanding the jerk that had brought us back. Deep 
          in the spirit world had Ruldari gone. So deep that it took all the clan's 
          power to find her and more to bring us back. I smiled to myself as I 
          considered the debts paid and incurred this day. My view of the gods 
          had changed, and while I have probably lost a bit of awe, I have also 
          gained a new respect and understanding.</font></p>
