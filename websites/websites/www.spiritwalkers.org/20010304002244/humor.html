        Ladies and Gentleman of the class of '99: /con everything. If I could 
        offer you only one tip for the future, /con'ing would be it. The long 
        term benefits of /con'ing have been proved by scientists, whereas the 
        rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own, meandering experience. 
        I will dispense this advice now. <br>
        <br>
        Enjoy the power and beauty of your newbie food. But never mind, you will 
        never understand the power and the beauty of your newbie food until it's 
        gone. But trust me, in ten levels time you will think back to the food 
        you ate and recall in a way you can't grasp now, how much muffins lay 
        before you and how hungry you would become. You do not have as much food 
        as you think you do. <br>
        <br>
        Don't worry about red mobs or worry knowing that worrying is just as effective 
        as trying to solo a dragon with a rusty dagger. The real mobs in Norrath 
        are apt to get you in ways that never crossed your worried mind. The kind 
        that hit you for 150 damage from behind a wall. <br>
        <br>
        Do twenty things every day that gain you experience. <br>
        <br>
        Meditate. <br>
        <br>
        Don't be reckless with your mana, don't put up with group members who 
        are reckless with theirs. <br>
        <br>
        Sit. <br>
        <br>
        Don't waste your time /who'ing 50's. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes 
        you're behind. The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Remember mobs that give you great xp, forget the green ones. If you succeed 
        in doing this, give me a list.. Keep your good group members, throw away 
        the morons. <br>
        <br>
        Group. <br>
        <br>
        Don't feel guilty if you don't know where you want to go when you level. 
        The most interesting people I know didn't know at level 20 didn't know 
        where to hunt; some of the most interesting level 50's I know still don't. 
        Get plenty of bandages. Be kind to your buffs, you'll miss them when they're 
        gone. <br>
        <br>
        Maybe you'll level, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll find Hatar, maybe you 
        won't. Maybe you'll reach level 50, maybe you'll lose connection on your 
        first trip to Nagafen's lair. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself 
        too much or berate yourself either. Your attacks are half chance, so are 
        everybody else's. <br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your Lute. Use it everywhere you can. Don't be afraid of it or what 
        other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Hail. Even if you've Hail'd the NPC a dozen time before. <br>
        <br>
        Ask for directions to Qeynos, even if you don't follow them. <br>
        <br>
        Do not read rants about your class, they will only make you feel weak. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Get to know your items. You never know when they'll be gone for good. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Be nice to your group. They are your best way to level and most likely 
        to camp with you until you get the tomahawk. <br>
        <br>
        Understand that named NPC's come and go. But there are precious few you 
        should camp until the minos come home. <br>
        <br>
        Work hard to bridge the gaps inbetween Erudin and Faydwer, for the older 
        you get, the more info you'll need about the dungeons you died in when 
        you were young. <br>
        <br>
        Live in Highpass once, but leave before it makes you a camper. Live in 
        Greater Faydark once, but leave before it makes you an arsehole. Zone. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Accept certain inalienable truths: Packetloss will rise, trade skills 
        will suck, you too will get old and when you do, you'll fanaticize that 
        when you were young, packetloss was reasonable, trade skills were profitable 
        and players respected their GMs. Respect your GMs. <br>
        <br>
        Don't expect anyone else to heal you. Maybe you'll have a great group, 
        maybe you'll have a strong pet but you never know when either will get 
        killed by a hill giant. <br>
        <br>
        Don't mess too much with your keyboard settings, or by the time you attack 
        the mob, your group will be four zones away.. <br>
        <br>
        Be careful whose banded you buy, but be patient with those who supply 
        it. Banded is a better form of chain. Making it is a way of taking all 
        your plat, trading it for metal, grinning through all the failures, and 
        selling it for half what it's worth. <br>
        <br>
        But trust me on the /con'ing. <br>
