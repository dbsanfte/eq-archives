                and deep night to you all, I am Morrighan, daughter of Andrasta 
                and Camulous.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I am what 
                some would call an Abomination, skinwalker, bone crafter, death 
                dancer, or a Necromancer. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Does this 
                make me evil and less worthy of life than you? Some would say 
                yes, and those that do will soon be lost to their own blindness. 
                But you seem to have an open mind so sit and listen to my side 
                of the story. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My unkle 
                thinks watching my parents die is what put me on my path in the 
                night. My only answer to that is, it made me see death as a service 
                and release. Something to be less feared than a life of pain. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I have found 
                great strength in the darkness and power to face the forces that 
                took my parents from me. I do not perceive what I am as evil. 
                I am a force of nature. I cut away the dead flesh from the world 
                and use sickness and disease to strengthen all that I touch. for 
                it is only with that strength we can overcome that which the fates 
                have in store. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Even now 
                some of you find me disquieting to be around. Even my beloved 
                bright sister Sanu has had her moments of doubt about me. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I can understand 
                your fear of the dark and the night. The bright gods tell you 
                to be afraid of us, for they understand not the balance of all 
                things. The world moves in patterns of light and darkness and 
                neither can exist without the other. Unfortunately many of the 
                lords of light cannot see this and in their righteousness seek 
                to destroy all my kind.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> My Unkle 
                is the only one who seems to understand me, and I owe him much 
                for that. For he has shown me that my kind can find strength and 
                fellowship in the followers of your gods, and that we need not 
                fear each other. Life and death are flip sides of the same coin, 
                so are good and evil. should we each serve our side of the coin 
                to the detriment of the other? Or should we instead serve the 
                whole coin. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I hope you 
                can learn to understand me too, for there is much beauty and joy 
                in my darkness. Come explore...... </font></p>
