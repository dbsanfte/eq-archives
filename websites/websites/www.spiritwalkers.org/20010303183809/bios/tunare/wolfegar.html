                be his upon reaching manhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
                </span>For this job, Wolfegar was trained and instructed from

                and trainer of the clans wolves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
                </span>Almost from birth he was placed among the wolves with their 
                pups, and if one didn’t know better, they would think it was the

                </span>It was this closeness that formed the special bond between 
                Wolfegar and his future charges, and as he grew instead of having 
                normal friends to play with, Gar (as he was often called) had 
                a wolf brother who became his closest friend.<span

                began to train the wolves and take them on sled runs so they would

                a huge bear.<span

                as a sound, which all barbarians who travel the tundra and frozen 
                waters are taught to fear, surrounded them. It was a loud crack 
                and then a ripping sound as if the earth herself were tearing 
                apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was not far 
                from wrong, because blinded by the raging winds and snow the pair

                somehow had survived.<span

                wrapped around him was the body of Silvermane, as it had been 
                so many times before, but this time there was no warmth, no movement.<span

                had simply frozen to death, as with his last breath, he protected 
                his “brother” from the very chilling winds that were killing him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
