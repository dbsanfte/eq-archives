              <p>&quot;Take that! And that!&quot;<br>
                Windias the magnificent warrior spun around, and, brandishing 
                his mighty sword, struck down foe after foe, gnolls and orcs each 
                falling to his blade in turn. Twirling once again, he jabbed out 
                at the mighty Orc Chief and --&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Windias!&quot;</p>
              <p>At his mother’s voice, Windias’ imaginary battle faded away, 
                changing into his family’s meager front room and one somewhat 
                battered table leg.</p>
              <p>&quot;Windias! Could you get that bear pelt for me? It’s outside.&quot;</p>
              <p>Still clinging to his daydream a little, the young Windias began 
                to sheath his sword, trying to poke his wooden, slightly cooked 
                sword into his beltless tunic. Realizing what he was doing, he 
                placed the sword, his most prized possession, up against the doorless 
                doorframe. Walking out into their small, slightly dusty front 
                step, he grabbed a clump of fur on the pelt hanging from the wall 
                rack and tugged on it. The pelt fell onto him, but he was strong 
                enough to take it, with the rear half dragging, into the house, 
                and into the back room. Windias’ mother was a tailor, and provided 
                for the two of them with her earnings from her business. Buying 
                pelts was expensive, and they had to buy them, having no one to 
                go out and hunt for them.</p>
              <p>&quot;Thank you so much, dear,&quot; said his mother, with a 
                smile and a loving look. &quot;I don’t know what I’d do without 
                you.&quot; Smiling for the umpteenth time at his mother’s beautiful, 
                singsong voice, Windias hugged his mother, then scurried out of 
                the room. </p>
              <p>Windias was the only child of a human family, and his father 
                had gone out hunting and never returned when he was only four 
                years old. Ever since then, his mother had taken care of him as 
                best she could, having no nearby relatives to assist her. They 
                lived in Qeynos, in a nice three-room house. They felt save there, 
                and the new mayor of Qeynos, Antonius Bayle, was sure to do a 
                noble job of keeping the city up and running. </p>
              <p>Even at this early age of seven, Windias was an adventurer at 
                heart, and had a constantly working imagination. Unfortunately, 
                he couldn’t leave home now, or ever, really, because of the fact 
                that he couldn’t leave his mother to fend for herself. He would 
                have to stay with her and keep the family business running. </p>
              <p>Then, one day, a plague rat got into the house. Windias’ mother 
                called for the guards, but none could hear her. Only Windias heard 
                her. He had been playing on the grass in front of the house when 
                he heard his mother’s screech. Rushing inside the house, he saw 
                the plague rat perched atop his mother, it’s paws stained with 
                blood. Windias didn’t freeze for a moment. Bringing his blunt 
                wooden sword up to the battle stance he’d imagined so many times, 
                he attacked the rat with a mighty swing, knocking the rat onto 
                the floor. Leaping back up onto its feet, it took another blow, 
                this time to the shoulder. Hissing at Windias, the rat stepped 
                back a little, then leapt forward, towards the blond-haired boy. 
                The boy’s crossed arms could not stop the thrashing claws. He 
                screamed, and this time the guards heard. They burst into the 
                room, a pair of them, golden armor seeming to radiate, and slew 
                the rat with one swipe. One ran for a paladin, seeing the damage 
                the foul rat had done. The paladin healed Windias’ face the best 
                he could, but Windias’ mother was too far-gone. </p>
              <p>Skip ahead many years. Windias has matured. He has become a traveler 
                and a warrior, as was his dream. He has taken inspiration from 
                his mother’s beautiful voice, which he also has, and studied the 
                musical arts. He has learned to live, and fight, with his one 
                good eye, and wears the runed eye patch given to him by his adopted 
                father, the paladin who saved his life that day, but who has gone 
                off to travel and teach now that Windias is come of age. </p>
              <p>Brandishing his axe, a bit rusted in places, Windias sets off 
                on a journey to find a family, turning where the winds will take 
                him.</p>
