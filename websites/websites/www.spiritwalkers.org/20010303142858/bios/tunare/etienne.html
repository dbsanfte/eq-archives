              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Excerpted 
                from Dobbins' <i>"A Bard's Travels Across Norath": </i></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>April 
                23, 3174</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I have spent 
                the last few days travelling with a warrior-monk by the name of 
                Etienne Wayfarer. I have found him to be a pleasant and interesting 
                companion, if a bit quiet and enigmatic. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you have 
                ever visited the Ashen Order of Freeport or the Silent Fist Order 
                in Qeynos then you have undoubtedly seen the monks going about 
                their training regimen. They spar with each other and wooden dummies, 
                punctuating each blow with an explosive yell. They beat each other 
                or repeatedly plunge their hands into pots filled with sand, among 
                other strange rituals, to toughen themselves. They perform all 
                manner of strenuous activities. And I would be hard pressed to 
                ever imagine Etienne in such a setting.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As I write 
                this I can see him performing his evening routine. He moves with 
                a glacial slowness as he flows gracefully through an intricate 
                series of movements that more closely resemble a dance than a 
                highly refined fighting style. There are no sudden moves, no harsh 
                cries. Yet, having witnessed him fighting I cannot deny it's effectiveness. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Curious about 
                this discrepancy I have questioned him about his past but he is 
                oddly reluctant to speak of it. Normally this would indicate some 
                experience in the past that he either wishes to hide or to not 
                remember but with Etienne that is not the case. I'm not sure if 
                I can describe it other than that the past is not particularly 
                important to him and he seems to believe that my knowing his past 
                would interfere with my understanding his present. To illustrate, 
                at one point he took out a flask of water and asked which was 
                more important; it's past, whether it was the melted snows of 
                Everfrost or drawn from a well in the Karanas, or it's present, 
                whether or not it could quench my thirst. In any case I have kept 
                at him and this is what I have been able to piece together.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His parents 
                are farmers somewhere in the Karanas. Like many farmers, they 
                had many children to help them work their land and Etienne is 
                one of their younger sons. One year, when he was young, there 
                was a terrible drought. They prayed to Karana to send the rains. 
                They made sacrifices to the god. As the drought continued they 
                even begged the god for his forgiveness for whatever sin they 
                had committed to anger him so. All to no avail. Finally, Etienne 
                determined that he would run away from home and go to Qeynos. 
                That way there would be one less mouth for his family to feed 
                and he would get to see the city. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The rains 
                finally came as he was making his way through the mountains. There 
                was a torrential downpour from which he caught a fever. He sickened 
                and was unable to continue. He would probably have died there 
                upon the mountain side were it not for an elderly hermit, named 
                Jerome, who found the boy and carried him back to his cottage. 
                There he tended to Etienne until his sickness broke. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jerome, it 
                seems, was once a member of the Silent Fist but he had discovered 
                what he considered a better Way than that of the Fist and so had 
                broken ties with the order and come to live alone on the mountain 
                side where he studied what he called the Way of the Universe in 
                a quest for Enlightenment. Something about the old hermit clicked 
                with Etienne and he decided to stay with Jerome and study the 
                Way rather then continue on to Qeynos. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Years passed 
                and Etienne grew into a young man. Then one day Jerome called 
                Etienne to him and told him that it was time for Etienne to leave. 
                Jerome had shown Etienne as much of the Way as he could. Now it 
                was time for Etienne to find his own Way in the world. Thus it 
                was that Etienne resumed his journey of long past and finally 
                came to Qeynos. There he forged a lifelong friendship with a young 
                barbarian shaman named Mortekai...</font></p>
