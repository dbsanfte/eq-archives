<P>This page is devoted to parsing the <I>eqlog.txt</I> file found in your Everquest directory (in most cases, it wil have the player character name in the filename too) if you've turned on logging during play. You can turn on logging by typing: <I><B>/log on</B></I> from your main chat window each time you start the game, or you can edit a the everquest.ini file in your everquest directory and set logging to TRUE in that file which will, from that point on, make loging on until you type <I><B>/log off</B></I>.  With logging on, all of your chat display area will also be written to a file called <I>eqlog.txt</I> file found in your Everquest directory (this may contain your CHARACTER name and server number in the file name as well). It does not get over written each time, so be sure to rename it between sessions, or it will just get bigger and bigger. Be certain to look into the <I>Options</I> menu and turn all filters on (meaning that you see all text, at least all hits and misses for you and your target) or you may miss a lot of data and make this parse CGI useless (note, you don't have to have others misses or hits turned on). For example, if you have <I>Your Misses</I> or <I>Your Hits</I> turned off, it is impossible for me to determine what your hit ratio is. Also, if you have /OOC turned off, it is difficult to determine how many /ooc's you had.</P>

<P>Please understand that the log files are <B>not</B> very good at making it easy to parse spell content or experience points. There will be problems there. You also don't always get credit for kills if your pet does the majority of the damage (send me a BRIEF portion of your log file if you have pets and I'll try to get this working). Also, if you pick up money from your corpse, there is no way (based on the log) to see that it is off of your own body, so your money gained stats may be excessive if you die a lot and pick up stuff off your body. Please send Verant emails and /feedback about this and ask for more descriptive numbers in the log files as well as more descriptive spell info. Use to be, all you would see was 'You begin casting'. Duh, that tells you very little about what spell or what target you are casting it on (this has been fixed now by Verant, and seems a lot more specific, but Fizzle still doesn't tell you which spell you were TRYING to cast...). Also note, dodges and parrys, etc are included in the 'miss' count. Strangely enough, these appear even if you have 'misses' turned off in your options filters.  Also, please understand that the damage done per kill was never meant to estimate the points required to kill a MOB, but to rather, inform you of some way to judge your effectiveness in the nights plunders.  For if you spend time finishing off others kills for them, and gain narry a kill for yourself, you have indeed done a good for all, but may, perchance, have neglected yourself in gain.  So use these stats for what they are.</P>

<P><I><B>Things you can do to make the log file more accurate!!!</B></I>
  <UL>
    <LI>Always do a <b>/who</b> when you first come into the game.  This makes certain that you can find your name, class, and race for printing.
    <LI>Make sure that your chat filters or not filtering (in Options->Chat turn all hits on and misses on).
    <LI>Periodically move the log file over to a new file name to save upload/parse time as well as protect potential corrupting of the file.
  </UL>
</P>

<P>When you are ready to try, simply open up the <I>eqlog.txt</I> file found in your Everquest directory via the <I>Browse</I> button below, and click <I>Process File</I>. I'll do the rest for you! You should do them in order (time wise) if the file is a concatenation of sessions (in otherwords, you can mess it up if you tack Level 1 log file on to the end of level 8). The final numbers will be the results across all logs.</P>

<P>I play as <B>Jhondra</B> on <I>The Seventh Hammers</I> server, so if you ever see me, just give me a wave and a tell!  Enjoy.</P>

<P>Additionally, I must tell you of a couple of most wonderful client side apps that have been developed.  You may find them at <a href='http://kqp.mpog.com/EQParse' target=new>http://kqp.mpog.com/EQParse</a> and <a href='http://www.bit-net.com/~poiuyt/feekle.html' target=new>http://www.bit-net.com/~poiuyt/feekle.html</a>. I hope they serve you well.</P>

<P>If you have access to a PERL installation on Windows (I recomend <a href="http://www.activeperl.com">Active Perl</a>), or a LINUX/UNIX box, you may want to run this program on there with a lot more options.  You may download the full commandline program from my temporary <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/tooreal/eqstats">EQStats page</a>. Send me email if you find bugs or need something explained or would like new features at <a href='mailto:jmcclain@micron.net'>jmcclain@micron.net</a>. Enjoy!</P>
