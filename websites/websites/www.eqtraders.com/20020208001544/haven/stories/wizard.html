        <p class=MsoNormal><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This 
          document contains both an explanation of my own viewpoint regarding 
          sex, and a long overdue proposal for the study of the sexual proclivities 
          of the various races and classes within Norrath.<br>
          <br>
          It has long astounded me that sex is made so much of in today's society. 
          In my conversations and interactions with various denizens, sex is so 
          often mentioned and commented on that one wonders how half our citizenry 
          even manages to leave the bedroom! It is a mystery to me how such a 
          straightforward subject as breeding can be twisted into a myriad innuendoes 
          and rituals.<br>
          <br>
          My own parents had sex of course, or I wouldn't be here. But they did 
          it the proper way, after a long study of the subject, a drafted strategy 
          of experimentation, and with the express purpose of producing myself, 
          as it should be. Once done, it was never spoken of again, although I 
          was allowed to read the ensuing documented report of the process when 
          my parents considered me old enough. I was, needless to say, impressed 
          with the clarity and efficiency of their efforts. However, I did find 
          the whole described process to be messy and distasteful, and understood 
          immediately why I had no siblings.<br>
          <br>
          Not so, it seems, with the average adventurer. In a short poll taken 
          by myself, in various locations, I found that a high percentage of races 
          engage in sex more than once in a lifetime. In fact, shocking as this 
          may be, some of them claimed almost weekly sexual activity...many of 
          them without even a thought of the consequences! My poll shows that 
          sex is thought about, talked about, hoped for and acted out all over 
          Norrath on a daily basis! Yes, I know. Hard to imagine, isn't it? But 
          there it is, mathematically calculated, and double checked.<br>
          <br>
          Spurred by these results, and in the interest of science, I decided 
          to take a closer look at the subject. Armed with a lurid treatise of 
          gender related interaction, appropriately titled &quot;Ohh...You Rogue 
          You!&quot; by Gentian D'Tart, I somewhat hastily tutored myself in the 
          ways of sexual attraction and set forth. <br>
          <br>
          My first experiment was in the area of flirting...a strange and ritualistic 
          verbal exchange seemingly meant to show your interest in a member of 
          the opposite sex. After several bad starts (I was actually laughed at 
          once..hmpph) I was able to capture the attention of a fellow erudite. 
          I noted several strange phenomena during this verbal exchange, that 
          I think may be a form of primitive &quot;body language.&quot; There 
          seemed to be a significant amount of eyebrow bobbing, leering, &quot;cow 
          eyes&quot; and hip bumping. <br>
          <br>
          Encouraged by these signs, I moved to the next stage...the exchange 
          of flattery and endearments. At this point I was hard pressed indeed 
          to continue. Standing still while someone is calling you &quot;sweet 
          thing&quot; and &quot;babe&quot; is, as far as I'm concerned, above 
          and beyond the call of duty. How can someone retain their dignity during 
          such a display? Still, I braced myself, and remembered my preparation. 
          I duly interspersed my conversation with such drivel as &quot;handsome 
          mage&quot; and &quot;studmuffin.&quot; Fortunately, I had taken a digestive 
          aid before I hit the field, so to speak, and was able to control my 
          incipient nausea.<br>
          <br>
          It was shortly after the exchange of these ridiculous name callings 
          that the subject leaned over a whispered a suggestion in my ear. He 
          wished us to find a place to be alone. I realized suddenly that I hadn't 
          prepared myself properly for the next stage. In my haste to check out 
          my theory, and in my obviously faulty assumption that things would progress 
          in a more leisurely fashion, I had neglected to finish the book. I hastily 
          excused myself, and hurried off to the nearest nook to read.<br>
          <br>
          I was halfway through the sixth chapter, &quot;Wild Thing in the Karanas&quot; 
          when I lost all objectivity. The suggestions Ms D'Tart put forth were 
          not only crude and tasteless, but beyond my ability to comprehend, much 
          less mimic! The straightforward act of reproduction so tastefully put 
          forth in my parent's work had been reduced to smut. And it was <em>illustrated</em>! 
          Indeed, I was so mortified at what I now realized my subject had in 
          mind, that I marched right back, and slapped him. He was understandably 
          baffled as I stormed back to my laboratory. All semblance of scientific 
          method had disappeared at this point.<br>
          <br>
          Later, in the lab, when I had composed myself over a nice hot cup of 
          tea, I realized that I had been most naïve to have taken such a study 
          onto myself. I had done my subject, myself and the entire magic community 
          a disservice by rushing into a study I was obviously not professional 
          or detached enough to do effectively. <br>
          <br>
          I hereby apologize to my peers and betters for my unforgivable haste, 
          and humbly suggest that someone more objective and much more experienced 
          in these matters continue these studies. Although I have bungled most 
          awfully, I have not lost my conviction that this is a subject that should 
          be explored further. If not for the sake of knowledge alone, let it 
          be then for the future of Norrath. It is my belief that if this behavior 
          is left unchecked, we will shall all find ourselves awash in the unplanned 
          progeny of thousands.<br>
          <br>
          As for myself...suffice it to say, the family line ends here. I will 
          leave my work for posterity rather than offspring. I obviously have 
          not my parents composure or courage. I am, however, more respectful 
          than ever of their commitment to the greater good, and more determined 
          than ever that their sacrifice not be in vain.<br>
          <br>
          Respectfully submitted for your review on this, the 1st of April, 3178.
