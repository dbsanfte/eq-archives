            <p>This is a 1-person website, for the most part, but content has 
              been, and will continue to be, fueled by input from the active tradeskill 
              community on the message boards. Please remember to read the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm56">Visitors 
              Corner</a> message board threads before posting onto the boards, 
              as there are some rules of the road that guests are asked to follow, 
              not only to keep things focused on tradeskills, but also to cut 
              down on the massive workload involved in maintaining and updating 
              this site.</p>
            <p>Just why did I make this site shortly after the launch of EQ anyway? 
              Partly for myself, since I was gathering some of this knowledge 
              for my own tradeskilling and partly to help others working in the 
              trade skills. </p>
            <p>Since then, demand has grown, tradeskills have hit the mainstream, 
              and there are often weeks I just can't keep up with it all. On weeks 
              like that, please excuse the random redheaded outbursts. Generally 
              it's sparked by the 0.1% of the folks on the boards and in game 
              who are selfish snerts and decide to either stomp about complaining 
              about the things I have or have not done to this site, or ones who 
              just decide they have to be &quot;trolls&quot; on the boards in 
              a bid for attention. (And no, this does not mean that I am against 
              trolls the in-game race, but in real-life folks who decide they 
              need to ruin things for the sake of ruining them.) Unfortunately, 
              as time goes on, and tradeskills become more popular, that 0.1% 
              becomes a larger physical number of folks, and they just don't seem 
              to understand they're not welcome here.</p>
            <p>I never thought I would have to so baldly state the below, as, 
              when tradeskills were small, and tradesfolk were considered hobbyists 
              instead of folks who could make &quot;l33t&quot; stuff (&quot;elite&quot; 
              for those of us who don't speak d00d speak), the 0.1% was small 
              enough in physical numbers to be easily ignored. The rest of us 
              had fun exchanging recipes, celebrating our successes, and commisserating 
              over the more creative failures. Unfortunately, 0.1% of the new 
              user base is not such a trivial number anymore, so perhaps they 
              will listen to the following, while those of you who are here because 
              you enjoy tradeskills and want to learn more realize that I'm not 
              doing this to be a selfish wench, but to preserve my sanity while 
              continuing to provide a valuable resource for the ever-growing tradeskill 
              community. It's likely, however, that the folks who really SHOULD 
              read this are the very ones who will ignore it, and the clearly-stated 
              rules on the message boards, and continue to have to be slapped 
              down when they act up and try to ruin it for everyone else.</p>
            <p>So, here it is, plain and simple ... my site, my rules. If you 
              don't like this, you have two choices. 1) siddown, shuddup, use 
              the resources here that you need but keep your kvetching to yourself, 
              or 2) go somewhere else. If you think you can do better, put your 
              time and money where your mouth is, and leave the rest of us alone.</p>
