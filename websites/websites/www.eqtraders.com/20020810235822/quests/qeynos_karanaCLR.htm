            <h3>Qeynos Karana Cleric Youngling Armor Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new armor quests for young human clerics 
              of Karana that originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should 
              be lore (other than the bracer) no drop, HUM, CLR only.</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Vansted Rohenga'</p>
            <p>Vansted Rohenga says 'Pleased to meet you Asalin, I am Vansted 
              Rohenga High Priest of Karana. I have spent all of my years studying 
              the ways of the Cleric in our wonderful Temple of Thunder. We receive 
              many new recruits every day and it is my duty to place them in my 
              [training program].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what training program'</p>
            <p>Vansted Rohenga says 'Well all young clerics of Karana are brought 
              up from their first day of training to know and respect their practice. 
              I have developed a number of exercises that will enable a young 
              cleric to make a set of their own armor by means of collecting certain 
              items and making [enchanted armor materials] out of them.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what enchanted armor materials?'</p>
            <p>Vansted Rohenga says 'Recently we have discovered that combing 
              certain items in certain quantities using a magical assembly kit 
              can forge together an armor material. These armor materials are 
              used with specific armor molds to create a piece of enchanted Stormhealer 
              Armor. If you would like to [begin forging armor materials] I will 
              present you with your Stormhealers Assembly Kit.'</p>
            <p><br>
              You say, 'how do I begin forging armor and materials?'</p>
            <p>Vansted Rohenga says 'Excellent Asalin, please take this Stormhealers 
              Assembly Kit. It is in this kit that you will combine certain items 
              together into materials necessary for crafting your armor. I can 
              present you with the material recipes and armor molds for Stormhealer 
              [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] 
              and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to gather the items for an 
              armor piece simply tell me what piece you [want] to craft. Once 
              you have created a specific material take it to a forge along with 
              the applicable mold to create your armor piece.'</p>
