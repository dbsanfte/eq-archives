            <p>(Note that this quest requires the Planes of Power expansion.) 
              Find Ramos Jerwan in the Plane of Knowledge (a barbarian near a 
              pol at loc -31.28 1431) and hail him.
            <p>&quot;Hail Ramos Jerwan&quot;</p>

              <p>Good Day Traveler... perhaps you have come to help me with my 
                studies?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&quot;I can help you with your studies&quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>It's quite simple really. I'm interested in studying some aquatic 
                specimens from around the planes....</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&quot;What hand?&quot;</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>There are some particularly interesting chichlid swiming about 
                in the Plane of Nightmare. I also hear the discus in the Plane 
                of Valor are quite Plentiful. I need you to bring me two sets 
                of bones from each for study. You do know how to extract them, 
                yes? If not, I believe the lovely Peras Glickon may have something 
                that can instruct you . Best of luck lad.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Nightmare cichlid are fished in Plane of Nightmare, and are prepared 
              as per our standard prepared fish recipe. (fish, roots [foraged], 
              celandine herb [from <a href="../location/alchemy.htm">alchemy vendor</a>], 
              filleting knife [<a href="../secrets/smithing_implements.htm">smithed</a>]). 
              No details are available yet on the Valor discus, so the quest reward 
              remains unknown at this time.<br>
