            <h3> Coalition Trader Armor - Freeport Rogue Quests</h3>
            <p><i>Much like other &quot;newbie&quot; zone revamps, this is a quest 
              for young Freeport rogues who wish to make armor. Armor is lore 
              (other than bracer), no drop, HUM, ROG only. It has a dark leather 
              graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, 
              the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before 
              you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>Hail Tovan Tenlah, he mentions something about needing proper equipment 
              for my employment as a Coalition Trader. He handed me a note to 
              give to Venora Rankin, another NPC a few rooms away.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Tovan Tenlah' </p>
            <p>Tovan Tenlah says 'I suppose you're one of Nestrals new employees, 
              eh? Well if that's the case I can help get you outfitted with some 
              [gear] necessary for people in this [line of work].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what gear' </p>
            <p>Tovan Tenlah says 'The first thing you need is a suit of sturdy 
              traders clothing. Take this note to Verona Rankin and she'll help 
              you with a suit tailored to your needs. Once you have been outfitted 
              in your traders clothing return to me and I will inform you of your 
              [next task].' </p>
            <p>Verona Rankin says 'Ah, Tovan sent you for a suit of traders clothing. 
              I can instruct you on how to prepare your suit of clothing but you 
              will have to acquire the required materials yourself. Use this Curing 
              Kit to construct the clothing once you have done so. Do you wish 
              to prepare Coalition Trader [Gloves], Coalition Trader [Boots], 
              a Coalition Trader [Bracer], a Coalition Trader [Cap], Coalition 
              Trader [Leggings], Coalition Trader [Sleeves], or a Coalition Trader 
              [Tunic]?' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I wish to prepare a Coalition Trader Boots' </p>
            <p>Verona Rankin says 'To craft Coalition Trader Boots you require 
              two [silk thread], two ruined cat pelts, two desert spiderling hairs, 
              and a rattlesnake skin. Once you have the necessary components combine 
              them in your Curing Kit with this Tattered Boot Pattern.' <br>

            <p>You say, 'what next task?' </p>
            <p>Tovan Tenlah says 'Ready to get to work are you? Listen carefully. 
              Outside Freeports South gate you will find one of our employees, 
              Rigg Nostra, who is acting as an intermediary between the Coalition 
              of Tradefolk and some recently acquired business associates. Give 
              him this card so he knows I've sent you and he will give you further 
              instructions. Do not mention any of our names in public. The Freeport 
              Militia would likely impose high taxes on the Coalition if they 
              found out about the goods being exchanged to us by our new associates.' 
            </p>
            <p>Rigg Nostra says 'Excellent I've been waiting for the Coalition 
              to send me some assistance. I have an associate waiting for some 
              supplies that have not yet been collected. I need you to acquire 
              a [crate of pick heads] and a [bundle of hardwood shafts] and bring 
              them to me so that I may prepare them for delivery to my associate.' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'what crate of pick heads' </p>
            <p>Rigg Nostra says 'I've heard that a dwarf who calls himself Grendig 
              and has not registered with the Coalition of Tradefolk has recently 
              arrived in Freeport and is staying at the Freeport Inn just inside 
              the South Gate. He has brought to Freeport pick heads from his home 
              city of Kaladim. Find Grendig and 'convince' him to 'donate' a crate 
              of pick heads to the Coalition of Tradefolk as tax for peddling 
              his wares in our city.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what bundle of hardwood shafts' </p>
            <p>Rigg Nostra says 'There is a halfling named Jimble Woodentoe that 
              occasionally visits Freeport to peddle his woodcrafts. He can be 
              found traveling through the Commonlands from the direction of Rivervale.
