            <p>The Cazic Thule zone was massively changed on March 7, 2002. Along 
              with new, nastier mobs, there were new recipe books that dropped. 
              All require drops from the Cazic Thule zone, and most need either 
              more translating, or the drops are missing/too rare for us to find. 
              Until things are sorted out, this will be a <i>TEMPORARY</i> holding 
              spot for the recipes.</p>
            <p> Below are the pertinent comments from books 2 through 5. (Book 
              1 contained no tradeskill information.) As you can see, much more 
              research is needed before we have these recipes nailed down. We've 
              had confirmation for some of the drops, but still not all of them 
              <i>(no hides/pelts have been found, there are issues with the blood, 
              the drop rate on the meat is reported as having, well, dropped ... 
              also unsure if the chunk of raw silver is used for jewelcraft, or 
              if the ore is MIA)</i></p>

            <ul>
              <li>Day 5. Our rations are low. Kinopio bless his brave gnomish 
                soul, dared to step outside the room today. He was gone for some 
                time, and came back with - well, with a dead Tae Ew runtling. 
                The door is secured again. I wonder if we dare cook this lizard? 
              </li>
              <li>Day 6. Hunger is a cruel thing. Kinopio went to work on cooking 
                the runtling this morning. It tastes so good! Cooked on a skewer 
                with a little spice and some sauce, the lizard meat is most pleasing. 
                Kinopio ate the meat rolled on a batwing - such an odd gnome</li>
              <li>Day 8. (more) Todays meal consited of a raw lizard sandwich. 
                Revolting </li>
              <li>Day 10. (more) Our meal today consisted of a soup. Lizard meat 
                in water from the drain, with a little sauce, in Kinopios pot. 
                Ugh.</li>
              <li>Day 12. Woke in the middle of the night to Kinopio screaming. 
                I must admit that my dreams have not been so pleasent lately either. 
                In a fit of creativity, Kinopio created us a crude pie made from 
                now-festering lizard meat in a little dough in his pie tin </li>
              <li>Day 17. (more) I cooked lizard in a little frosting with spice 
                - superb </li>
            </ul>
            <p align="left">translating the above, we get a few Tae Ew baking 
              recipes. Note that the meat is called &quot;Tae Ew Meat&quot; and 
              it <i><b>does not stack</b></i> (the finished products stack, once 
              they are baked). </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tae Ew Skewers: chunk of Tae Ew meat no stack), spices, jug

                meal, trivial &lt;=162)</li>
              <li>Tae Ew Roll: chunk of Tae Ew meat (no stack), bat wing, combine 
                in spit or oven (miraculous meal, trivial &gt;163)</li>
              <li>Tae Ew Sandwich: chunk of Tae Ew meat (no stack), bread, combine 
                in spit or oven (feast)</li>
              <li>Tae Ew Soup: chunk of Tae Ew meat (no stack), water flask, jug 
                of sauces, combine in spit or oven with a pot (yield 1, miraculous 
                meal, weight 1.0)</li>
              <li>Tae Ew Pie = chunk of Tae Ew meat (no stack), clump of dough, 
                combine in spit or oven with a pie tin (miraculous meal, yield 
                2, weight 1.0 ... cookie cutter icon?!)</li>
              <li>Candied Tae Ew: chunk of Tae Ew meat (no stack), frosting, spice, 
                combine in spit/oven (miraculous meal, yield 8, weight 1.0, trivial

            <ul>
              <li>Day 13. Kinopion tells me that he used to be a smith of some 
                reknown in his youth. I find it easy to believe. He spent all 
                afternoon laying out plans for a set of chainmail: A mold, a vial 
                of distilled blood, and several sheets of metal. If only we had 
                sheets of metal!</li>
              <li>Day 17. Though ill, Kinopio has gone to work with a will. Using 
                my lizard-blood temper, he hammered two pristine lizard scales 
                togeather to form a large plate - it looks exceptionally tough. 
                Perhaps we can use it to escape. (more) </li>

                Hands off!! </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Making a long sword - so nice. So very nice! With a few molds, 
                  a sheet of metal, and a little lizard blood temper, I created 
                  one in just an afternoon! Use a long blade mold, a hilt mold, 
                  a pommel mold, otherwise it won’t sit right in your hand. You 
                  can try it with a heavy steel blade mold, or a dagger mold instead 
                  if you like. I bet they work just as well. </li>
                <li>The Swampwood staves are great things. Take a sheet of metal, 
                  and wrap it around using a little of that lizard-blood temper 
                  (Tastes nice too) and hammerhead mold and you’ve got a really 
                  handy sledgehammer! I use mine to keep my tent pegs in the ground 
                  I suppose even a mace head mold would work if you were that 
                  way inclined. Mind you, who wants a mace when you can have a 
                  good gnomish hammer. </li>
                <li>Now then, shields. Shields are tricky things. Big, heavy beasts 
                  they are - not so kindly if you're not so tall. I reckon with 
                  a few sheets of metal, some of that tasty lizard-blood temper, 
                  a mold and my smiting hammer that I could knock up a shield. 
                  I'll give it a go! I hate this jungle. - Spanner</li>
              </ul>
              <li> Day 20. Kinopio showed me plans for a suit of full plate armour 
                based on the lizard plating that he constructed several days ago. 
                With a smithing hammer, flask of water, leather padding, mold 
                and several of the lizard platings, he claims to be able to make 
                anything.</li>

              <li>Day 9. Kinopio discovered a barrel suitable for brewing, in 
                one of the piles that line the walls, using two vials of runtlings 
                blood and a single vial of distilled mana, I managed to distill

              <li>Day 14. What a day. It started well-from a scale temper and 
                vial of lizards blood (Thankfully still in good condition after 
                all this time due to my preservations) I created a lizard blood

              <li>Day 2. Within the mounds of jumble I found a strange ore. It 
                seems local to this area's geology - and has fascinating properties. 
                 Using my firestaff as a makeshift forge I found that two lumps 
                  of this ore could be enchanted with a vile of distilled mana

              <li>Day 7. Gods, a week has passed. Kinopios nightmares are worse. 
                They are effecting his judgement. My day was spent curing the 
                hide of the runtling - a long process, using a vial of the poor 
                creatures blood the result is a hard leather. Perhaps I can put 
                it to use.</li>
              <li>Day 8. Kinopio is restless, so I put him to work with the cured 
                hide. He has hidden talents: From one section of hide he created 
                a tough belt for himself, and from another section he produced 
                a gorget. Amazing. (more) </li>
              <li>Day 10. Kinopios skills know no bound. Using the distilled blood 
                and two sections of hardened hide, he created a backpack the likes 
                of which I have never seen before. From two portions of the distilled 
                blood, a section of hide, and a whip pattern of his own he even 
                made a rudimentary weapon. (more) </li>
              <li>Day 11. The day went slowly. Kinopio and I discussed possible 
                uses for this cured hide. He seems to think that one could fashion 
                an entire suit of armor from it, simply using sections of cured 
                hide in various quantity with appropriate pattern. I slept most 
                of the day.</li>
              <li>Day 21. Kinopio woke before me and ran out of the door. He was 
                gone all morning, and appeared soaked in blood and sweat in the 
                afternoon. Locking the door behind him he sat in a corner, staring 
                into space, clutching a strange silk substance in his hand.</li>
              <li>Day 22. Kinopio sleeps fitfully. From two of the stands of the 
                silk, smeared in some form of unidentifiable ichor, I was able 
                to make a crude swatch of silk. From whatever creature this originates, 
                I would rather not know - it is strong, and yet flexible. Inordinately 
                so.</li>
              <li>Day 23. I fear for Kinopio's mental state, he appears to have 
                gone quite insane. Whilst constantly gibbering about some kind 
                of sacrifice, has shaking hands crafted something from the silk 
                swatch and a pattern of his own making - imagine my suprise when 
                the poor soul presented me with a hand-sewn cap!</li>
              <li>Day 24. A tranformation has occured in my companion. His former 
                state of incoherence and madness has been replaced by a firm determination. 
                He seems resolved, though in what I cannot say. The cap fits well 
                - it seems that the silk can be used to make other garments.<br>
