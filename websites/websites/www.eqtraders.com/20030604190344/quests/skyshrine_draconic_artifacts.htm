            <h3> Skyshrine: Lost Draconic Artifacts Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This quest was introduced with the 19 November 2002 patch. This 
              quest requires you be non-KOS with Claws of Veeshan, but exact faction 
              level needed is unknown at this time.</i> 
            <p>Iago Sabuela can be found on the second floor of Skyshrine, at 
              loc 297, -638. 
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Iago Sabuela'<br>
              Iago Sabuela says 'Salutations dragon friend ____. I am Iago Sabuela 
              archeologist, enchanter, and proud member of the [Draconic Loyalist 
              Fellowship]. Please make yourself comfortable and enjoy your visit 
              to Skyshrine.' 
            <p> You say, 'what draconic loyalist fellowship?'<br>
              Iago Sabuela says 'The Draconic Loyalist Fellowship is people like 
              myself of a non-draconic heritage that have pledged obedience to 
              the dragons and dragon-kin of Skyshrine. We have proven that we 
              can provide valuable services and resources to the dragons and dragon-kin 
              that would otherwise be difficult or impossible for them to obtain. 
              Among the occupations I pursue here in the Skyshrine is the acquisition 
              of lost [draconic artifacts].' 
            <p>You say, 'what lost draconic artifacts?'<br>
              Iago Sabuela says 'The dragons and their kin have an ancient and 
              complex culture like any intelligent creature in Norrath. I have 
              spent the majority of my years studying the ancient dragon civilizations 
              of Norrath and recovering lost draconic artifacts. There are several 
              artifacts I am currently searching for and could use the assistance 
              of a capable group of adventurers. Are you interested in [hunting 
              for lost artifacts]?' 
            <p>You say, 'I am interested in hunting for lost artifacts'<br>
              [Iago Sabuela says 'Excellent. With the help of the texts provided 
              me by the dragon-kin here in Skyshrine I have narrowed my search 
              down to a few locations where I believe the artifacts I seek may 
              be hiding. Before the artifacts may be recovered however you will 
              need a special container in which to store them in. They are quite 
              old and who knows what condition they may be in. I am missing some 
              materials that are necessary for the insulation of the container 
              thus it would be appreciated if you could provide me with a [crystalline 
              silk mesh] and two [oily goo secretions] I will finish the construction 
              of the artifact container and provide with the information I have 
              obtained of the lost artifacts.' 
            <p>You say, 'what crystalline silk mesh?'<br>
              Iago Sabuela says 'An experienced tailor must craft the woven crystalline 
              spider silk mesh in a tailoring kit out of four crystalline silks.' 
            <p>The exact trivial level for this combine is unknown at this time, 
              but is reported as being &gt;36 &lt;=76. Oily goo secretions are 
              a rare drop from the tar goos in the geonid caves in the southern 
              end of Wakening Lands. They are no drop. 
            <p>Hand in the crystalline silk mesh and two oily goo secretions to 
              receive:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Empty Artifact Container<br>
                Lore, No Drop<br>

            </blockquote>
            <p></p>
            <p>Iago Sabuela says 'Thank you Xeonio. Here is the container that 
              artifacts must be stored and returned to me in once they have been 
              recovered. the artifacts I seek are a [Crystal Dragon Eye], a [Dragon 
              Scripture Tablet], and a [Platinum Dragon Scale]. When all the items 
              have been recovered, seal the artifact container and return it to 
              me. You shall be rewarded well for your assistance, I assure you.'</p>
            <p>You receive positive Claws of Veeshan and Yelniak faction, and 
              negative Kromzek faction.</p>
            <p>You say, 'What crystal dragon eye?'</p>
            <p>Iago Sabuela says 'I have uncovered some texts here in the Skyshrine 
              that speak of a crystal carved in the visage of a Dragons eye. the 
              dragon sorcerer, Xervolithax, who was slain by enemies of the Dragons 
              several centuries ago in the Great Divide, crafted this crystal 
              dragon eye. As it was an artifact of some sifnificant undisclosed 
              magical power it believed to now be hidden somewhere in the labyrinth 
              of the kromzek sorcerer, Velketor.'</p>
            <p>Icepaw sorcerors in Velketor's Labyrinth drop the crystal dragon 
              eye. </p>
            <p>You say, 'What golden dragon claw?'</p>
            <p>Iago Sabuela says 'Draconic legends mention a hollow golden dragon 
              claw artifact that would fit over one of the fore-flaws of a dragon. 
              This dragon-crafted jewelry was more than a simple adornment. The 
              legends claim that the dragon that wore this claw had the ability 
              to swiftly carve powerful runes into the surface of any object. 
              These runes were apparently some form ancient spellcrafting art 
              and it is said the dragon, Ulvaxazoviak, who for a time possessed 
              the claw would carve runes of protection and power into his own 
              scales. When Ulvaxazoviak's spirit finally fled this realm he was 
              buried in the Dragon Necropolis, which is where I believe the golden 
              dragon claw has rested to this day.'</p>
            <p>The golden dragon claw drops off chetari runemasters in Dragon 
              Necropolis. </p>
            <p>You say, 'What dragon scripture tablet?'</p>
            <p>Iago Sabuela says 'Certain dragon scholars engraved their writings 
              onto tablets of Velium, believing the magical ice that is found 
              throughout velious to have been formed by the breath of Veeshan 
              herself. There are accounts of one such tablet that was lost many 
              decades ago in the Eastern Wastes. I have visited the Coldain city 
              of Thurgadin many times during my stay here in Velious and I do 
              not believe that the tablet is in the possession of the dwarves. 
              It may however have fallen into the hands of the Ry'Gorr clans orcs 
              that man a keep in the eastern wastes.'</p>
            <p>The dragon scripture tablet has been reported to be a rare drop 
              of an Oracle of Ry'gorr in the orc fort.</p>
            <p>You say, 'What platinum dragon scale?'</p>
            <p>Iago Sabuela says 'There are tales among the dragon-kin of a platinum 
              dragon scales marked with mystical runes in the ancient dragon script. 
              Whether this scale was crafted from platinum ore, encased in platinum, 
              or is actually from a lost species of dragon is unknown. the last 
              written accounts mentioning the scale place it in the vicinity of 
              the Cobalt Scar. It is my assuption that the magically adepts sirens 
              of Sirens Grotto may now be in possession of the scale.'<br>
            </p>
            <p>The platinum dragon scale can be dropped by siren sorceresses in 
              Sirens Grotto.</p>
            <p>Place the items in the artifact container, hit combine, and return 
              the result to Iago to receive:</p>
