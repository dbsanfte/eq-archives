<span class="headers">Qeynos Bertoxx Cleric (Pestilence Priest) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other than the bracer, no drop, HUM/CLR only. Due to the location and the faction of the NPC down in the sewers, it's not recommended that you attempt this if you are not a worshipper of Bertoxxulous. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
You say,'Hail, Xeture Demiagar'
</p>
<p>
Xeture Demiagar says'I have much to do here for the defense of our Temple and the appeasing of our patron Bertoxxulous, the Plague Lord. If the Plague Lord has gifted you with the desire to [serve his will] as a priest of the Bloodsabers I will assist in your training. If not, then leave me now and do not interrupt me again.'
</p>
<p>
You say,'I desire to serve his will.'
</p>
<p>
Xeture Demiagar says'By spreading the disease, decay, and destructive powers of the Plague Lord you will in turn be gifted with great insight and power. First however you must learn to survive in this city, surrounded by those who would see you destroyed for your faith. Take this note to Torin Krentar. He will instruct you on how to acquire a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our [enemies].'

Torin Krentar says'Well met young disciple of Bertoxxulous. Perhaps one day you shall serve the Plague Lord in his realm, but for now you will serve the Bloodsabers, his mortal agents on Norrath. The armor you seek must be assembled using this Mail Assembly Kit. The materials necessary to construct the armor vary depending on the piece being crafted. Do you wish to craft [Gauntlets of the Pestilence Priests], [Boots of the Pestilence Priests], a [Bracer of the Pestilence Priests], a [Helm of the Pestilence Priests], [Greaves of the Pestilence Priests], [Vambraces of the Pestilence Priests], or a [Breastplate of the Pestilence Priests]?'

You say,'who are our enemies?' 
</p>
<p>
Xeture Demiagar says'The self-righteous ruler of this city, Antonius Bayle IV, is backed by the Knights of Thunder, paladins and clerics of the Storm Lord Karana, and the Temple Life, paladins and clerics of the Prime-Healer, Rodcet Nife. Be wary when not within the security of our temple here in the Qeynos Catacombs, should the Qeynos Guards discover you allegiances they would have you executed. Once you have been properly armored return to me and I will give you [further instruction].' 
</p>
<p>
You say,'what further instruction?' 
</p>
<p>
Xeture Demiagar says'The Priests of Life, those who claim allegiance to the Prime Healer, Rodcet Nife, have proven to be a large obstacle in our conversion of the people of Qeynos to the ways of the Plague Bringer. Lately a Priest of Life by the name of Rolon Banari has been campaigning amongst the beggars and sickly, a social group from which we have gained many converts. Find this meddling priest and bring me his head.'
