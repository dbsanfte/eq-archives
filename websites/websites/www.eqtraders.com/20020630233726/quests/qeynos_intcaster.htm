              Juegile Sohgohm says 'I have heard word that there are numerous 
              gnolls in the hills terrorizing a good friend of mine Rephas. I 
              need you to go to the hills and assist my friend Rephas. Rephas 
              had 3 pages of research he was studying and they were stolen by 
              these gnolls. I need you to retrieve these pages and bring them 
              to Rephas. He will then give you a completed book to return to me. 
              Bring me back the completed book from Rephas and I will surely reward 
              you for your efforts.' </p>
            <p>Rephas is located on (or near) the shore of the lake in Qeynos 
              Hills. Despite being amiable to me his only reply to hails was to 
              threaten me with the wrath of Karana.</p>
            <p>The pages of research drop from gnoll scouts in the QH area and 
              are Lore items (so they are affected by the TLC code on the FV server). 
              Take all three pages and give them to Rephas. You will get a book 
              in return which is lore,no-drop, a small amount of experience and 
              the following faction adjustments -<br>
              + Arcane Scientists<br>

              - The Freeport Militia </p>
            <p>Take the book back to Juegile Sohgohm, hand it over and you will 
              get a small amount of experience, the following factions adjustments
