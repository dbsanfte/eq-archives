            </h3>
            <p><i>(This quest requires the Planes of Power expansion.)</i> Once 
              you have completed the <a href="pop_planartravelersmanual.htm">Planar 
              Traveler's Manual</a> quest you will find that several NPCs now 
              respond differently to you. They may also level-restricted quests: 
              a level 10 was unable to quest further (though her hobgoblin surprise 
              was eagerly kept by the NPC, who said he'd make sure it got into 
              the proper hands), but a level 36 was able to receive the beginner's 
              books with no problems.

              <p>Zauvudd Gigoth says 'Hello, ____. I see you have obtained a manual 
                on planar travel. It is good to see your determination has taken 
                its first step to true glory. I think you may finally be ready 
                to learn the basics of planar combat, that is if you are [willing

                aspects to your battle readiness is your strong willpower and 
                bravery. Years ago I discovered a particular concoction that will 
                very readily put your willpower to the test. Unfortunately I ran 
                out not too long ago and I am in need of some more [Planar Blood 
                Brew]. If you can make some more for my students, it would certainly 
                look favorably upon you in your future teachings. Bring me some

                you must attain some Nightmare Mephit Blood, Slarghilug Blood, 
                Bubonian Blood, Soda Water, Grapes, a Cask, a Cork, and a Corking 
                Device. Mix them in a Brew Barrel, and if you are skilled enough, 
                the resulting swill should curl the hairs on even the hardiest 
                of traveler's heads!'</p>

                best Planar Blood Brew I have ever tasted! You have passed the 
                first test with flying colors. Here, you take this book and learn

                we? Magic can be a susceptible, yet volatile force sometimes, 
                especially when wielded in the hands of dark beings. I fear there 
                is one such being in particular that seeks to damage the very 
                foundation of our mystic abilities, an ugly warrior by the name 
                of Vhaksiz the Shade. He calls the Plane of Nightmares his home. 
                You must seek this foul creature out and acquire proof of his

                a few things for me. When you can locate a Tornado Gem, a Battle 
                Worn Trinket, and a Blue Diamond, return and hand them to me along

                for, the struggle for survival. There are very dangerous places

                Essence, a Water Flask, and some Sculpting Tools. Use these items 
                in a pottery wheel to create your base model to work from. Crush 
                some Valor Crystals together with some Glaze Lacquer in a glaze

            <p>Hand him the Beginner Stealth Manual, as well as the head of Rallicus 
              Rattican, and he will give you the Intermediate Stealth Manual (stats 
              to be provided later). (Hail text not available). He will tell you 
              to speak with Ethoach Trokith to continue. </p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Ethoach Trokith'<br>
            </p>

              <p>Ethoach Trokith says 'Good day, Kati. It would appear you have 
                learned much about the art of stealth already, and this is good. 
                Are you ready to learn more? If so, listen closely. To graduate 
                to the next level of precision and cunning, you need to discover 
                a few items. Bring forth a Blizzard Gem, a Symbol of the Daiku, 
                a Blue Diamond, and your Intermediate Stealth Manual. I feel this 
                will be an adequate test of your skill at this stage in your development. 
                Good luck!'<br>
