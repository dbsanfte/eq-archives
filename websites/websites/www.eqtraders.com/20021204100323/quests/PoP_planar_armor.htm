            <h3> PoP Planar Armor Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p><i><b>(Note that this quest requires the Planes of Power expansion.)</b> 
              </i>New questable armor has been made available with the release 
              of PoP for the &quot;experienced planes traveler.&quot; While the 
              final combine for this armor does NOT require any tradeskill ability, 
              the quest is included here due to the need for several player-made 
              items for the combine. 
            <p>Experienced planes traveler, eh? Just what does that mean? It means 
              that unless you have certain character flags obtained from various 
              boss mob encounters in Planes of Power, the NPC that gives this 
              quest will not deal with you. We're still working out the various 
              flag combinations that will make him happy. We know that he will 
              speak to you if you are flagged as having defeated Terris Thule, 
              but we're still working on the other various flag combinations that 
              will encourage him to share his information (and the quest container/emblem 
              needed). We suspect that the flag for finishing the Tactics trials 
              will work in place of the Terris Thule flage, but further experimentation/verification 
              is needed. The armor molds/patterns, which are only mob drops (they 
              are <i>not</i> the vendor-sold patterns/molds), are tradeable. The 
              final result is not.
            <p>At this time, we have discovered that there are at least two sets 
              of armor for each class, based on the mold/pattern used. The first 
              set for each class uses &quot;ornate&quot; patterns and molds, which 
              have been reported as dropping off higher-end encounters in Tactics, 
              and Honor B (such as the dragon event). The second set uses &quot;elemental&quot; 
              molds/patterns. The first reported drop of one of these was from 
              Xuzl, in the Solusek Ro's Tower.
            <p>Bor Warhammer (708, -1736) in Plane of Tranquility is willing to 
              share his planar armor secrets (and the appropriate combine container 
              and emblem) to making planar armor ... for a price. He is unwilling 
              to share this information with just anyone, and will not deal with 
              you unless you have certain character flags, as mentioned above. 
              His responses to a properly flagged person will vary based on your 
              character class.
            <p><b>All classes: </b> 
            <p> 
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Bor Wharhammer' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Greetin's t'ye ____! Isn't the area 'round 
                'ere so nice an' quiet? Such a departure from me old days; slaving 
                o'er the forge t'create masterpieces! T'be 'onest, at times I 
                do miss the old forge, but after I created me finest breastplate, 
                it seemed as if nothing else I made could ever live up t'it. So 
                I left me home to'wander the land an' see what I could learn o'the 
                world. I 'ave learned quite a bit from the elders 'ere an' the 
                skilled craftspeople in New Tanaan. I 'ave even devised a type 
                o'emblem that will impart the magic o'tranquility into the user 
                t'create planar armors from pieces o'energy found in the planes.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'what planar armor?' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'From me understanding, the very fabric o'the 
                planes is so strong out 'ere, it can be found in raw form the 
                deeper ye traverse. Anyone who ventures far into the planes finds 
                that they must wear excellent armor t'protect them from the savage 
                environment. The very essence of planar energy can be focused 
                into a form that can fit our shape. As ye progress deeper into 
                the planes, ye will find many molds an' patterns with which t'base 
                a set o'armor. If ye want t'know 'ow t'craft the various types 
                o'armor, I can instruct ye about plate, chain, leather an' silk. 
                '<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'what emblem' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Well ____, the emblems dinnae be easy t'craft 
                but I will gladly give ye one fer the price of 500 platinum pieces. 
                They allow a planes traveler with no craftin' skills t'create 
                many fine pieces o'planar armor in a special, magical kit I also 
                'ave an' will throw in with the price. The kit acts as a focal 
                point fer the wild magic energy o'the Planes. Ye will only be 
                able t'use each emblem an' kit once when ye create the piece, 
                'owever I dinnae be goin' anywhere soon! Just venture back when 
                ye need another an' dinnae ferget the coin! </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Give him 500pp and you get back either a Mystical Forge of Ro(plate/chain 
              classes: 8-slot portable forge that can be used only for these quests) 
              or a Druzzil's Sewing Kit (leather/silk classes), each with a &quot;____ 
              Emblem&quot; inside it. (Emblem will match the class of the person 
              hailing him.)</p>
            <p><b>Plate classes:</b> 
            <p>You say, 'what plate?' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Ahhhhh ____! The fine rigid armor that can 
                stop a shaft from piercing yer heart! Too bad it be so cumbersome 
                an' difficult t'move about in. To construct a piece o'plate armor, 
                ye need t'combine a plate mold, an emblem, various amounts o'sheet 
                metal an' use one o'those crafty Tanaan smithin' 'ammers all within 
                a furnace touched by Ro. Ethereal metal sheet construction is 
                another matter. Ye will need t'combine two bricks o'ethereal energy, 
                an ethereal temper an' a Tanaan smithin' 'ammer within a Tanaan 
                forge. I would seek a skilled craftsperson t'make the metal sheets 
                fer ye; the emblem will enable ye t'craft the final armor piece 
                no matter what yer skill be. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Have a skilled smith combine two bricks of ethereal energy, an 
              ethereal temper, and a tanaan smithing hammer in one of the forges 
              in Plane of Knowledge. Trivial is &gt;250.</p>
            <p>You say, 'What ethereal temper?'<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Temper be the juice o'smithin'. T'make an 
                ethereal temper, ye will need t'combine two celestial essences 
                along with soda an' an emerald tealeaf. A skilled brew master 
                can distill the power o'the raw ingredients fer ye. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Have a skilled brewer combine 2 celestial essence, soda and an 
              <a href="../location/PoKnowledge.htm">emerald tea leaf</a> in a 
              brew barrel. This is a skill restricted combine, and a brewer of 
              206 unmodified skill may not even attempt the combine. Further details 
              on trivial narrowing as well as minimum skill to attempt the combine 
              will be provided as available. There are reports from Test server 
              that the skill levels on the various tradeskill combines may have 
              changed, so this information may changed based on the next patch.</p>
            <p>Basic recipe is: ornate plate ___ mold, class-specific emblem, 
              tanaan smithing hammer, 1-3 ethereal sheets of metal. Combine in 
              the Mystical Forge of Ro. (bracer: 1 sheet; gloves, helm, sleeves, 
              boots: 2 sheets; leggings, breastplate: 3 sheets)</p>

            <p><b>Chain classes:</b></p>
            <p>You say, 'what chain'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Bor Wharhammer says 'Ahhhhh _____! Chain armors, while not as 
                sturdy as plate, provide so much more mobility if constructed 
                properly. T'construct a piece o'chain armor, ye need t'combine 
                a chain pattern, an emblem, various amounts of ethereal metal 
                rings an' use one o'those crafty Tanaan smithin' 'ammers all within 
                a furnace touched by Ro. Ethereal metal ring construction is another 
                matter. Ye will need to combine a brick o'ethereal energy, an 
                ethereal temper an' a file within a Tanaan forge. I would seek 
                a skilled craftsperson t'make the rings fer ye; the emblem will 
                enable ye t'craft the final armor piece no matter what yer skill 
                be. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It is suspected that the chain patterns needed will also drop off 
              various mobs in PoP. (Confirmed drop in Plane of Tactics)</p>
            <p>Have a skilled smith combine a brick of ethereal energy, an ethereal 
              temper (instructions in the plate section above), and a file in 
              one of the forges in Plane of Knowledge. Trivial is &gt;242.</p>
            <p>Basic recipe is: ornate chain ___ pattern, class-specific emblem, 
              tanaan smithing hammer, 1-3 ethereal metal rings. Combine in the 
              Mystical Forge of Ro. (Bracer: 1 ring; gloves: 2 rings; leggings, 
              tunic: 3 rings. Other pieces unknown at this time.)</p>

            <p><b>Leather classes:</b></p>
            <p>You say, 'what leather'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Leather armor provides little protection 
                due t'the make-up o'the materials. We shall do our best, 'owever, 
                t'see ye make a quality piece. T'do so, ye must combine a pattern, 
                an emblem, various pieces o'cured ethereal energy an' a Tanaan 
                embroidery needle all within a sewing kit boilin' with magical 
                energy. The cured energy may be problematic fer an unskilled craftsman, 
                'owever. Just sew two silk ethereal swatches together using a 
                Tanaan embroidery needle within a Tanaan loom. I can just imagine 
                yer next question t'be about swatches, aye?'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Again, it is suspected that the patterns in question dropfrom various 
              mobs in PoP.</p>
            <p>Cured ethereal energy is made by combining two ethereal silk swatches 
              and tanaan embroidery needle in one of the stationary looms in Plane 
              of Knowledge. Trivial is &gt;250</p>
            <p>You say, 'what swatches'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Bor Wharhammer sighs at you. 'T'make a swatch, ye need t'combine 
                two strands o'ether along with a curing agent in a Tanaan loom. 
                Ye will need t'seek a skilled brew master t'make the curing agent 
                fer ye. Just 'ave them create it by using two celestial essences, 
                soda an' paeala sap<br>

            <p>Have a skilled tailor combine two strands of ether and the ethereal 
              curing agent in a stationary loom in Plane of Knowledge. Trivial 
              is &gt;250</p>
            <p>A skilled brewer must make the curing agent by combining two celestial 
              essences, soda and paeala sap in a brew barrel. As with the temper 
              for the plate and chain armors, this is a skill-restricted combine, 
              and must be attempted by a 200+ skill brewer.</p>
            <p>Basic recipe is: Ornate ____ pattern, Tanaan embroidery needle, 
              appropriate class-emblem, 1-3 swatches of cured ethereal energy, 
              combine in Druzzil's Sewing Kit. <i>(Leggings and tunic are reported 
              as needing 2 swatches, which makes them different ratios than the 
              other sets of this armor. Other pieces require an unknown number 
              of the swatches. Sandals require 1 swatch. All other combinations 
              are yet to be verified)</i><br>

              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Har! It be quite funny that we be referin' 
                t'silk as armor, fer the amount o'protection it provides be miniscule 
                at best. The planar armor made from strands o'ether can still 
                be quite useful fer its magical properties, 'owever. Ye will need 
                t'take up a Tanaan embroidery needle, a pattern, an emblem an' 
                various amounts o'ether silk swatches t'create a piece. Craft 
                it all within a sewing kit boilin' with magical energy.</p>

            <p>The patterns we've heard a drop report for were, again, from the 
              dragon in the Halls of Honor trials. We assume that they can drop 
              from various higher-end mobs in PoP.</p>
            <p>Follow the instructions in the leather section above for the construction
