  Guide to Pottery by <A HREF="mailto:Keith@SanDiablo.Com" TARGET="main">Etienne</A>,

<P>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Pottery is a unique trade 
  skill in a number of ways. First of all, pottery seems to be the only trade 
  skill aimed at enhancing another trade skill. Most of the goods you'll manufacture 
  with this skill will only be of interest to bakers. Second of all, it is the 
  only trade skill, to the best of my knowledge, that requires you to make two 
  skill attempts in order to manufacture goods. Third, it&#146;s incredibly easy 
  to raise. Finally, you can make a good profit off this skill just selling goods 
  to vendors though you'll have to have a high skill level before this is possible. 
  </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> To start with, first verify 
  that everything you need to practice pottery is readily available. That means 
  you'll need to find a pottery wheel, kiln, and vendors to buy sketches, clay, 
  and firing sheets from. When I first started practicing pottery I was using 
  a pottery wheel and kiln in South Qeynos, buying my clay and firing sheets in 
  West Karana, and was getting my sketches from a barbarian shaman who was making 
  frequent trips between Halas and Qeynos. Trust me when I say it was a very frustrating 
  period for me and I eventually just relocated to Halas, where I paid higher 
  prices for raw materials and received lower prices for finished goods, just 
  to have all of my pottery needs met in one small area. You'll eventually also 
  want glass shards and bits of metal for more advanced pottery but you can worry 
  about that when the time comes. </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Next you'll want to spend 
  a practice point on pottery just to get it started. Once you start practicing 
  you'll find that pottery raises fairly easily and I certainly wouldn't spend 
  more than 1 practice point on it. Certainly not before trying it a few times 
  just to see what sort of raises you get on your own. Buy the basic pottery book 
  for the instructions and "recipes." </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The actual practice of 
  pottery is a two-stage process. First you place a sketch, a flask of water, 
  don't use the globes of water some casters can summon or the pods of water that 
  woodsy types can forage for, the appropriate amount of clay, and any necessary 
  extras like glass shards on a pottery wheel and click combine. If you're successful 
  you'll be rewarded with an unfired product that you can then place in a kiln 
  with the appropriate type of firing sheet(s) and combine to get your end product. 
  When practicing keep working with an item until the pottery wheel returns the 
  message that the item is trivial for someone of your skill level to make but 
  ignore the kiln if it tells you that an item is trivial. It is harder to turn 
  something out on the pottery wheel than it is to put it in the kiln to harden. 
  The kiln will tell you something is trivial to make long before it&#146;s trivial 
  to make on the pottery wheel. </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Clay, firing sheets, and 
  some sketches don't stack so when buying trade supplies you may find yourself 
  pressed for space. Because of this I recommend that you don't buy firing sheets 
  until you actually have unfired products ready to put in the kiln. Otherwise 
  you'll probably wind up dragging around excess firing sheets that are filling 
  inventory slots that could be better used carrying clay. </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> What to make? The first 
  few items in the pottery book, skewers, ceramic linings, and clay jars, are 
  good starts. After those, however, there's a sharp increase in prices. I've 
  never made a pot because I can't find a pot sketch but it also calls for metal 
  bits and a smith friend has told me that they cost around 7 gp to make. Smoker 
  and cookie cutter sketches are expensive as well, running in the 5 to 6 gp range. 
  As you can see, at this point failures become very costly and you may want to 
  jump ahead to more difficult but cheaper items. As of this writing, the recipe 
  for small bowls appears to be broken. At least I get the message that "those 
  items don't appear to combine in those quantities" when I try it. However, the 
  next recipe, pie tins, works just fine and, even better news, actually turns 
  a tidy profit when successful. It costs me slightly under 2 gp to make a pie 
  tin and I can sell it to a merchant for slightly over 5 gp for a profit of 3 
  gp and mind you I'm dealing with merchants who give me bad prices because they 
  don't like me. Cake rounds are slightly more expensive to make since they require 
  glass shards but they also return a profit. Beyond that, I don't know the profit 
  potential of the larger bowls because I haven't tried them yet and probably 
  won't until pie tins and cake rounds become trivial. I suspect some of them 
  will be quite profitable too, especially mixing bowls which may actually have 
  a player market now that the baker's recipe for clump of dough has been fixed.

<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Now if you'll excuse me, 
  my cookies are about ready and they're always best straight out of the oven. 
  (I like to bite the heads off the troll shaped ones.) </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>Addendum by Etienne:</B> 
  </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Since the writing of this 
  pottery guide, Verant has implemented a patch which has effectively made pottery 
  non-viable as a trade skill. NPC merchants now pay below cost, in some cases 
  as much as 1 to 2 pp below, on all items listed in the basic pottery book. NPC 
  merchants also sell some pottery goods, primarily those that other players would 
  be interested in buying, for less than a potter can make them. Which means that 
  you will lose significant amounts of money practicing pottery, even when you 
  successfully make whatever item it you're attempting, and then be unable to 
  sell your goods to anyone but NPCs because players will prefer buying pottery 
  goods at the lower NPC prices. </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> If you choose to be a 
  potter then I urge you not to sell any of your more saleable goods (skewers, 
  pie tins, cake rounds, muffin tins, mixing bowls, vials, etc.) to NPC merchants. 
  They don't normally stock pottery goods so if we don't sell to them then they 
  won't be able to undercut the prices we're now forced to charge in order to 
  make a profit. When you generate excess stock of these items through practice, 
  bank what you can to sell later and destroy the rest. I know that sounds bad 
  but when you reach my skill level and are looking at expending 40-60 pp just 
  to master large bowls, &nbsp;which are not a saleable item, you'll be thankful 
  for the existence of a player market for your wares and that market can only 
  exist if the merchants aren't undercutting us. Hopefully Verant will make pottery 
  more viable some day but in the meantime this is what we have to do if we're 
  to pay for our craft. </font>
