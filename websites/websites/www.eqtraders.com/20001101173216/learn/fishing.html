  near future)</font></i>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Fishing is <B>the</B> 

  easiest trade skill to master and the quickest one to turn a profit. It also 

  has the added benefit of being the only trade skill you can avoid<B> </B>spending 

  training points on, and still be able to keep your learning/profit margin in 

  the managable ranges. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Fishing can keep you fed. 
  Fishing can earn you coins enough to buy those spells or supplies you need in 
  order to practice your more difficult/costly trade skills.</font> 
<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I highly recommend that 

  everyone learn how to fish at one point or another, unless you've found the 

  secret to independent wealth! </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> What do you need in order 

  to fish? A fishing pole, some bait, a couple open inventory spots in order to 

  transport your booty to the nearest shopkeeper, and a stream/river/lake or ocean 

  to fish in. &nbsp;The pole will cost you over 2 gold, and it can/will break 

  on you at some point, so be prepared for the need to replace it. The bait will 

  cost you a few copper per bait, and you'll need at least one bait per fish you 

  hope to catch. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Make sure when you are 
  trying to fish that your pole is held in your melee weapon hand, that you're 
  standing/sitting at the edge of the water, and facing the water. (You can also 
  meditate while fishing, as long as you've equipped the pole in advance, and 
  are sitting on the shoreline.) Then just cast your line and wait for the fish 
  to bite. Cast. Wait. Cast. Wait. Eventually, you should catch ... something. 
  Remember that I mentioned something about "booty"? Yep, that's right. There's 
  more than just fish available in the water. You can sometimes find fish scales 
  and other oddities snagged on your hook. Don't throw them away, as you can sell 
  them to any (NPC) merchant to add to your slowly growing profits. As you continue 
  to fish, your fishing skill should improve. </font> 
<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When I had a couple hours 

  of fishing under my belt, and about 20 ranks in fishing, I made a profit of 

  over 6 gold in half an hour. It's still a <I>slow</I> way to make money, but 

  its relaxing and you're unable/unwilling to hunt, it's a great way to earn some 

  money. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When you're done fishing 

  for the day, stow that fishing pole and some bait (or some extra coins) in the 

  bank. You never know when you're going to end up with your corpse on one continent, 

  and yourself on another continent with no gear, and no way to get to your corpse 

  without food and money. Being able to run to the bank and fish your way into 

  food and coins can make all the difference in the world. </font>
