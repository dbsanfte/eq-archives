            <h3> Akanon Initiate's Watchman Armor Quest (Warrior)<br>
            </h3>
            <p><i>One of many new youngling armor quests, this one is for gnome 
              warriors. Some minor smithing skillups have been seen from this 
              quest</i></p>
            <p>Hail the guy in gemchopper hall (Narron Jenork), and tell him you 
              are a gnome warrior, then you are ready to be tested. He'll give 
              you the assembly kit (which you must combine all the ingredients 
              in), then when you ask about the specific piece (ie &quot;i want 
              to craft a breastplate&quot; , he'll give you the mold. First you 
              combine all your bronze, legs, mace, scalp whatever in the assembly 
              kit, and you get &quot;*piece* material&quot;. And then to the forge 
              (not the Ak'anon forge, use the one over by the clockwork merchant 
              on the other side) with the mold and material. Combines are trivial 
              at skill 21, but give skill increases until that point. All items 
              are no-drop, and all but the bracer (iirc, doesn't make sense for 
              it to be) is lore. Nice newbie armor, especially for a gnome. Has 
              the look of a gray-ish fine plate.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Boots<br>
              3 bricks of crude bronze (drops off most kobolds in steamfront)<br>
              1 aviak beak (drop from krag warriors, not sure about the other 
              birds)<br>
              2 wolf meat (off coyotes)<br>
              1 red wine (in Felwithe, none in Ak'anon)<br>
              Result:<br>
              Initiate Watchman Boots<br>
              AC5 str 1 sta 2 gnome/warrior only</p>
            <p>Greaves<br>
              4 crude bronze<br>
              1 coyote pelt (off coyotes)<br>
              1 rusty black box (common drop off rogue clockworks)<br>
              1 bottle (purchased throughout Ak'anon)<br>
              Result:<br>
              Initiate watchman's Greaves<br>
              AC 6 str 2 sta 5</p>
            <p>Helm <br>
              2 crude bronze<br>
              1 scrap metal (very common, on 90% of rogue and rebel clockworks)<br>
              1 ruined cat pelt (off mountain lions and pumas)<br>
              1 raw bamboo (no idea if/where it drops, but it's a staple for the 
              vendors )<br>
              result:<br>
              Initiate Watchman's Helm<br>
              AC5 str 1 sta 2</p>
            <p>Wrist<br>
              1 crude bronze<br>
              1 rusty mace (takes forever to find, silly skeletons)<br>
              1 kobold tooth (rare-ish, i got 2 in 3 hours)<br>
              1 bottle of milk (off vendors)<br>
              result :<br>
              Initiate Watchman's Bracer<br>
              AC4 str 1 sta 4</p>
            <p>The rest I haven't done, as some of the components didn't drop 
              in over 200 kills, and the brownies spawned 5 when I first got there, 
              and never again in 6 hours.</p>
            <p>Gloves<br>
              3 crude bronze<br>
              1 runaway clockwork gearbox<br>
              1 young ebon drake wing (about 1 in 20 ebon drakes)<br>
              1 Minotaur scalp (rare)<br>
              Result:<br>

              1 brownie brain (gosh darn brownies!)<br>
              1 rusty long sword (also hard-ish to find, as the lack of skel's 
              with weapons)<br>
              1 kobold scalp (drop rate, for me anyway, was around 1 in 30)<br>
              Dilopera's bracer (drops off dilopera, who's in a group with other 
              rebels near the observatory. She's around lvl 10, and a cleric I 
              think.. she healed herself and nuked me a bit /blush And I'm level 
              20)<br>
              result :<br>
              Initiate watchman's breastplate<br>
