<p>
Spell research is the art of turning words, runes, pages and assorted odds and ends into spells. It can be performed by INT casters of level 16 and above. While EQTraders Corner has only recently started tracking this (having always left it in the past to be tracked by spellcaster sites), we'll try to get a few items up here to help you learn the basics of spell research.
