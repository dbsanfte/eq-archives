              aspect to Everquest, a complete understanding of exactly what each

            <p align="left">When Verant first revamped the old alchemy into the 
              new alchemy, many shamans on many servers spent untold hours and 
              many thousands of platinum discovering its secrets by trial and 
              error. Many potions have been discovered, and there are likely others 
              still to be discovered. For the time being, we do have quite a few 
              potions (59 at last count) to work with. </p>
            <p align="left">The following information will be vital in determining 
              which potions you might need, and which you do not.</p>

                  lasting approximately 12 minutes. You must have a <font color="#408080">batwing</font> 
                  in your inventory as a component before drinking this potion. 
                  Despite the necessity of a component, this is a very popular 
                  potion in areas of deep canyons (Dagnor's Cauldron) or for crossing 
                  expanses of water (Ocean of Tears) or lava (Sol A &amp; B, Skyfire). 
                  To many players, well worth the average price of 20 pp.</p>

              <p><strong>TIP: </strong>Whether you need a utility potion for some 
                specific mission or raid, or whether you just want to keep a few 
                around for emergency purposes (the most likely reason), these 
                utility potions can give you the edge you need to survive, conquer 
                or escape death and the xp loss that death conjurs. Ask yourself, 
                &quot;Is it worth a half bubble of lost xp to gobble down a potion 
                at the right moment?&quot; The answer is academic. A tank walking 
                out of the Frenzied room in Guk would find an Unlife Awareness 
                potion handy. Being stuck alone deep in a dungeon or on the planes 
                after going link dead could be disastrous without a gate potion. 
                There are a thousand different situations where you may find yourself 
                needing a potion.</p>
