            <h3> Qeynos Rodcet Nife Paladin Lightbringer Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, PAL/HUM, HEF 
              and allow the young human paladin to gain a small amount of smithing 
              skill. Color of the armor is Grey/Silver. <i>Please note that while 
              the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make 
              your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i> 
            <p> 
            <p>This quest originates with Davloran Girionlis up the path to the 
              spaceship in Qeynos. </p>
            <p>Davloran Girionlis says 'Good day Ramladilae, I am Davloran Girionlis 
              Holy Knight in service to the Prime Healer Rodcet Nife. I pride 
              myself on being responsible for ridding my homeland of unimaginable 
              evil during my fighting days. Nowadays I just like to train new 
              Temple of Life paladin [recruits].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what recruits' </p>
            <p>Davloran Girionlis says 'We have a number of new recruits entering 
              our guild hall every single day. For this reason I have developed 
              a set of exercises that test the hunting and gathering skils of 
              all young paladins. If you are a [Paladin of Rodcet] I might be 
              able to present these tests to you as well.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a Paladin of Rodcet' </p>
            <p>Davloran Girionlis says 'Fantastic _____, let me explain to you 
              how the exercises work. You will combine a number of magical items 
              that you will gather from our city and in the training areas and 
              combine them in a Lightbringers Assembly Kit. Certain items used 
              in certain quantities will combine into a specific armor material. 
              These materials can then be taken with the appropriate mold to a 
              forge and be combined together to create a piece of Lightbringers 
              Armor. I can present you with the material recipes along with the 
              correct armor molds for each armor piece once you are [ready to 
              begin your exercises].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am ready to begin my exercises' </p>
            <p>Davloran Girionlis says 'Very well _____, please take this Lightbringers 
              Assembly Kit. When you are ready to gather the items for a specific 
              armor piece you must only tell me what piece you [want] to craft. 
              I can provide you with the recipes and armor molds for Lightbringers 
              Platemail [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] 
              and [Breastplates].' </p>

            <p>Davloran Girionlis says 'I have been working for quite some time 
              at my blacksmithing skills in my spare time. My initial interest 
              was to make armor for our new recruits. However, after I discovered 
              these armor recipes there has been more of a need for weaponry rather 
              then armor. I have began to construct weapons suitable for all those 
              that pass the training exercises but I have run short on supplies. 
              I need someone to [gather the necessary supplies] for me.' </p>

              willingness to help me gather these items. I would go get them myself 
              but I must always be available here should any of the other newcomers 
              need my help. Please collect 2 Flawless Gnoll Hides and 2 Wisp Essences 
              for me and I will do my best to fashion you a weapon together for 
              your trouble.' </p>
            <p><i>Give him 2 Flawless Gnoll Hides and 2 Wisp Essences</i></p>
            <p>Davloran Girionlis says 'These are exactly what I needed! Its for 
              sure that I have a lot to learn about Smithing but low and behold 
              I was able to create this fine blade out of my remaining materials. 
              Please carry it with you as a symbol of my gratitude. Rodcet smiles 
              down upon you young ______, you have done well.</p>
