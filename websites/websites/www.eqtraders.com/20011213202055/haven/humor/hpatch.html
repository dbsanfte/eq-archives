12/05/99 - New changes with latest patch: (by Trajan of Brell Serilis)
<P>
As you know, there is a scheduled outage this Wednesday where a new patch
will be installed for Everquest. I have obtained insider information on the
new proposed game changes:
<P>
&nbsp; <BR>
<B>WEATHER</B><BR>
Weather-related haze and reduction of visibility has been increased. &nbsp;A
new gnome tinkering item has been introduced: fog lights, which will increase
visibility by 5% except when being chased by anything undead, in which case,
visibility will be reduced by 5%.
<P>
Dropped items now have a 25% chance of being swept away during rain storms,
excluding rusty weapons and foraged grubs, which will now litter the landscape
for an extra 20 minutes when dropped.
<P>
A new NPC "Noah" will wander around Norrath, most often in South Karana,
looking to round up two of each creature.
<P>
&nbsp; <BR>
<B>PETS</B><BR>
Necro pets have been modified. They will still do the same amount of damage
in melee, but will now give "the finger" to any monk passing by. This behavior
can be toggled via the "/pet humble" or "/pet arrogant" commands.
<P>
Pets no longer disappear when zoning, however they pretend they don't know
you and immediately befriend the nearest NPC with an abundance of non-summoned
food.
<P>
New pet commands: <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;/pet sit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;/pet SIT (all caps)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;/pet goddamit SIT!!
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>NPC BEHAVIOR / AI</B><BR>
If you accidently give the wrong combination of items to an NPC or the right
items to the wrong NPC, the NPC will laugh hideously at you and immediately
run to the nearest merchant to sell these items, at which point there will
be no way to re-acquire the misgiven items.
<P>
Pathfinding has been improved in zones such as Mistmoore, Everfrost and
Permafrost. Mobs no longer "appear then disappear, then appear" right in
front of you. Now they simply appear in front of you without any prior visible
evidence of their existence.
<P>
Mobs will no longer be able to hit/target thru walls &amp; doors - instead
in select zones, walls and doors will be considered autonomous NPCs which
can deal damage similar to other monsters in the area.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>DYING</B><BR>
When dying, you will no longer lose experience. Instead, you will have a
random number of personal effects disappear (both from your person and the
bank).
<P>
The cleric revive spell will teleport you to your body as well as a nearby
property insurance agent (GM) who will then tell you you're out of luck if
you think you can get any lost items back. The cleric ressurrect spell does
the same thing but gives you a few animated items which disappear when you
log.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>SPELLS</B><BR>
New Druid Spells: Ring of Desktop (29th), Circle of Desktop (34th) - Immediately
teleports you to the Windows 98 desktop, thereby aborting Everquest; in-game
action similar to going link-dead. Circle of Desktop has the same results
but affects the entire party. Succor: Desktop was decidedly left out as it
took three times more time than required to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL which caused
the same effect.
<P>
New Shaman Spells: Spirit of GM (Allows you to run faster than SoW in opposite
direction when asked for assistance)
<P>
New Enchanter Spells: Clarify (automatically makes excuses to other mage
classes as to why you can't cast Clarity on them)
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>SKILLS</B><BR>
A new skill has been introduced: "slacking" - Humans, Ogres and Trolls begin
with a bonus to this skill of 35. It is available to all races. &nbsp;"Slackers"
- experts in this field will be able to manufacture new game items: television,
la-z-boy recliner, cheetos, remote control - all of which improve hp regeneration
while adding to encumberance.
<P>
Another new skill: "pimping" is available to all classes except Shamen,
Enchanters &amp; Druids. Experts in this skill will be able to force others
around them to cast Sprit of the Wolf on them at will. &nbsp;Masters of this
skill may force druids to teleport them far out of their way while thinking
you're doing them a favor.
<P>
Another new skill: "whining" available to all classes but melee classes start
with 50 skill points, monks start with 60. Masters of this skill have the
ability to root GMs for extended periods of time.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>EMOTES</B><BR>
The following new emotes are available with accompanying animation and special
effects:
<P>
/macarena immediately start dancing<BR>
/hurl expunges pieces of food in immediate vicinity (sometimes the former
may case others around to perform the latter)<BR>
/rap you begin bragging of your wealth<BR>
/gangsta rap same as above but you also swing your weapon
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>NEW COMMANDS</B><BR>
/youdied? feins linkdead status when a party member dies and you're a
healer<BR>
/oom covertly casts heal and SoW on yourself, and points you in the
direction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of the nearest zone, while telling party
you are OOM<BR>
/commend file a compliment/commendation on a local GM (untested)<BR>
/guild emancipate &lt;player&gt; Removes guild status from &lt;player&gt;
(without his knowledge)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;until he reaches a high-enough level where
he posesses good spells and items <BR>
/pimp filter ignores any say/guild/shout/ooc comments which contain the words
"tp" or "sow"
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>NEW QUEST ITEMS</B><BR>

as the person you are targeting - extremely useful for finding groups and

the game, attainable only by killing tons of mobs that all con green to you.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
<B>MOBS / MONSTERS</B><BR>
New class of monsters can be found at Castle Mistmoore and Unrest - it seems
they mysteriously appeared in the wake of large numbers of deaths due to
trains. This class of mob is called "Lawyer". Here is a breakdown of the

other group in Norrath, both good and evil.
