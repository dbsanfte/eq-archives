            <p>Jewelry making is not for the faint of heart, or the empty of pocket. 
              Rather, it is a skill that will take a lot of time, training, patience 
              and financial resources before you can excel in it. However, once 
              you excel in it, you will find that your wares will command a high 
              price indeed.</p>
            <p>At first glance, it may seem that much jewelry is "just fluff". 
              In many cases it is. However, this is a role playing environment, 
              and I'd be willing to bet that moon-eyed fellow in the corner would 
              love an engagement ring to present to his beloved. And what about 
              wedding rings for that big ceremony if she says yes? And what about 
              a lovely gaudy show of wealth for that vain elf over there?</p>
            <p>If that were all there were to it, however, it would not be that 
              popular a trade skill. Like tailoring, greater skill and better 
              materials allow you to make more valuable items ... including enchanted 
              jewelry. By enchanted jewelry, I mean jewelry that will enhance 
              stats when worn. (i.e., +5 mana, +4 save vs. poison, +4 strength, 
              to name a few.) You must use enchanted metals to make enchanted 
              jewelry (you will need to hire an enchanter that can cast the proper 
              enchant spell, if you're not an enchanter yourself).</p>
            <p>Now that I've got you drooling and mentally counting the riches 
              that could be yours, let me inject more reality into the picture. 
              There are 5 basic metals to use in jewelry making: silver, electrum, 
              gold, platinum and velium. These are listed in order of cost <b>and</b> 
              in order of difficulty. If you have problems making a simple silver 
              bar and a cheap piece of malachite combine into a ring, don't even 
              think of trying out electrum or the others. Cheap gems are also 
              easier to work with than the really expensive ones.</p>
            <p>However, with a <b>lot</b> of training in the skill before you 
              start trying to make anything, and a careful squirreling away of 
              any pretty stones you find along the way, you should be able to 
              progress well.</p>
            <p>By the time I had a jewelry skill of 30, I was able to make a (very) 
              few different electrum pieces, and a good chunk of silver and gem 
              combinations. I'd made some very lovely pieces of jewelry that took 
              my breath away, and whimpered when I destroyed a gem that cost over 
              a platinum on a failure.</p>
            <p>How did I do it? Start small, with silver and lesser stones, and 
              work your way up to more expensive stones before you try the same 
              thing with electrum. Keep good notes of what combinations of stone 
              and metal bar make what. My recommendation is to just work with 
              plain silver and gems for the first little while, to get your skill 
              up. Once you have relative ease with making a certain item, then 
              get a piece of enchanted silver and try the magical verion of the 
              item. Find other folks working in jewelry and compare notes. You 
              can both save yourselves some costly experiments if you share your 
              knowledge.</p>
            <p><b>The basics:</b> You need a jeweler's kit (sold where the silver/electrum/gold/platinum 
              metal bars are sold -- it looks like a small sack), a metal bar 
              (start with silver) and a gemstone (start with the cheapest - malachite). 
              Put the single metal bar, and a single stone, in your jeweler's 
              kit, close your eyes, pray to your chosen deity, and press combine. 
              I'd recommend training yourself up to 20 ranks in the skill, or 
              as close as you can, before you start trying anything (to save yourself 
              coin). Malachite and silver will become trivial at skill rank 21, 
              at which time you start using another cheap gem, such as lapis or 
              turquoise for practice.</p>
