<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and restricted to HUM/WIZ, ENC, MAG. This quest originates in South Qeynos, in the caster guild area with Juegil Sohgohm (loc 335, -640). Pieces are reported to be bright orange in color. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>

You say,'what task'
</p>
<p>
 Juegile Sohgohm says'I have heard word that there are numerous gnolls in the hills terrorizing a good friend of mine Rephas. I need you to go to the hills and assist my friend Rephas. Rephas had 3 pages of research he was studying and they were stolen by these gnolls. I need you to retrieve these pages and bring them to Rephas. He will then give you a completed book to return to me. Bring me back the completed book from Rephas and I will surely reward you for your efforts.' 
</p>
<p>
Rephas is located on (or near) the shore of the lake in Qeynos Hills. Despite being amiable to me his only reply to hails was to threaten me with the wrath of Karana.
</p>
<p>
The pages of research drop from gnoll scouts in the QH area and are Lore items (so they are affected by the TLC code on the FV server). Take all three pages and give them to Rephas. You will get a book in return which is lore,no-drop, a small amount of experience and the following faction adjustments -
</p>
<p>
 + Arcane Scientists<br />
 + Knights of Truth<br />
 - Opal Dark Briar<br />
 - The Freeport Militia 
</p>
<p>
Take the book back to Juegile Sohgohm, hand it over and you will get a small amount of experience, the following factions adjustments -
</p>
<p>
 + Order of the Three<br />
 + Guards of Qeynos<br />
 - Bloodsabres<br />
 - Opal Dark Briar
</p>
<p>
and the final item:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dagger of the Arcane Order<br />
 Magic Item, Lore Item<br />
 Primary<br />
 Piercing 27 / 5<br />
 +1 Cha, +2 Int<br />
 Wt 1.5, Size Small<br />
 Wiz, Mag, Enc, Human only
