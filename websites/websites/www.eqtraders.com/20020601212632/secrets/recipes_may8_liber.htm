            <p>These books were found scattered throughout the lands, written 
              in varying languages. Thanks to the hard work of the folks on the 
              EQTC message boards, and the folks over at the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showMessage?topicID=5298.topic" target="_new">Druid's

              has been solved</a>, and the Protection of the Cabbage spell (single-person 
              PoTG druid spell) has been introduced into the lands.</p>
            <p>The spell will be made more obtainable with the next patch (June 
              5), but the quest will stay in place for those of us tradeskill 
              junkies who wish to work our way through it. Hopefully in a couple 
              more days, this section will move to a more permanent home in the 
              Quests section of the website ...</p>

                  In times a-passed, I was much more thin!<br>
                  In these works I shall recount my tale,<br>
                  On pages extant, lest my memory fail ...<br>
                  Once during every thousand years,<br>
                  Throughout the shards, across the spheres,<br>
                  The planets into alignment fall.<br>
                  Through unseen barriers, laws do stall:<br>
                  Upon each shard - a sacred Wood.<br>
                  The realities bend, and 'twixt them could<br>
                  A faithful spirit through them travel,<br>
                  Into neighbouring worlds; and space unravel. 
                  <p>My tale is of one time now passed.<br>
                    When the Blessed Grove of each world touched last:<br>
                    Priests of Nature, from every sphere,<br>
                    For a brief time, met without slightest fear.<br>
                    Strangers all, they came as one,<br>
                    To praise their Gods, and tell of victories won ...<br>
                    A throng of Nature's priests did meet.<br>
                    In that Sacred Grove, and each other greet.<br>
                    As if they had known one another forever.<br>
                    Perhaps kindred spirits, apart but never<br>
                    Separate - united by their art,<br>
                    Each a single facet of Nature's part.</p>
                  <p>After feasting, and much merriment,<br>
                    There came a silence, exuberance all spent.<br>
                    'Twas the ritual Sacrifice's time,<br>
                    And the purpose of this humble rhyme.<br>
                    Heed these words, for should ye follow<br>
                    In their wake, and not in tawdriness wallow,<br>
                    Thou shalt perhaps catch eye of higher powers,<br>
                    Whom look down upon our mortal hours,<br>
                    And in sacrificing, as did we that night,<br>
                    Blessings to ye,m impart they might.<br>
                    About ye thy sharpest wits do keep!<br>
                    'Til Sacrifice is made, restless be thy sleep!</p>
                  <p>For now, ensure to pay closest heed,<br>
                    For upon these pages, the secret ye shall read,<br>
                    As to the Sacrifice's construction.<br>
                    And so, to work ye go, after some deduction.<br>
                    Keep handy ye store of scholarly wits,<br>
                    For in tongues quite foreign are these writs,<br>
                    So from the Heathern to safe-guard,<br>
                    The hidden knowledge - by study hard,<br>
                    Thou shalt the Naturewalker's Tale unfold,<br>
                    And to the eventual Sacrifice travel bold.<br>

                    Their three gifts held in whitened hands...</p>
                  <p>There came a tall elf named Sylvaned Tree,<br>
                    Carrying a bottle bigger even then me!<br>
                    Of workmanship it was most refined,<br>
                    the jewelled bottle well definied.<br>
                    The bottle itself was first created,<br>
                    from magical gold, with opal mated,</p>
                  <p>With a glass bottle, by jeweller skilled,<br>
                    what gorgeous craft with drink to be filled.<br>
                    Once bottle crafted, now came this brew:<br>
                    Using the magnum, wine yeast, and double grapes too,<br>
                    With a little soda water mixed to taste,<br>
                    Not a drop of liquid gone to waste.</p>
                  <p>With these fine ingrediants five,<br>
                    The result was a champagne for which to strive!<br>
                    In order to mix the soda water,<br>
                    Ye should seek out Mudhand's Daughter.<br>
                    Thus water and soda should ye simply mix,<br>
                    To produce more fizz than Fizzlepop's six!</p>

                    First I must tell you of captured essence,<br>
                    So that what follows makes more sense.<br>
                    Across the worlds there are scattered,<br>
                    Runes, words and other magicks mattered.<br>
                    Here in Fungus Caves can be found,<br>
                    A Celestial Solvent, from elf-girl bound.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    Place a vial of this within a mortar,<br>
                    And grind in rune, or word, without water.<br>
                    The result is purest magic's flavor,<br>
                    With many uses, ye shall savour.<br>
                    One such use is in powder blessing:<br>
                    Imbue the Elf-deity's gem with Tunarean tressing.</p>

                    With this gem, and acid, and magical essence,<br>
                    Fire in a kiln, to release the magical presence/<br>
                    For each of the Sickle's three main parts,<br>
                    The process is similar, say truest hearts:<br>
                    Each main part is made of Seven:<br>
                    Dust blessed from Tunare's Heaven.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    Your hammer, and a metal sheet,<br>
                    Celestial Essence and a temper meet,<br>
                    A gem - one from red, green or blue,<br>
                    And finally the correct Mold too.<br>
                    Whether making blade, hilt or pommel, choose thy Mold,<br>
                    And the correct product shall ye behold.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    The temper of which I have said,<br>
                    Is brewed from Elf-wine, coloured red,<br>
                    Mixed with Magical Essence but,<br>
                    Also add a sprig of the leaf that the Sickle shall cut.<br>
                    From these three can the temper be made,<br>

                    Then, so strong and pliant the cord,<br>

                    Use that egg's oil with silk cord to treat.<br>

                <td class="intable">Such a wonderful pie, all the halflings agreed,<br>
                  All eyes on the crust, so great was our need!<br>
                  That gift delivered, it was my wish,<br>
                  To give to Karana our customary dish;<br>
                  My eyes well up, tis how strongly I feel,<br>
                  When I contemplated this epic meal.
                  <p>Listen closely, and I shall teach you the making,<br>
                    Though it requires much study of baking!<br>
                    The Picnic is something that we all adore,<br>
                    One always desires to have just a little more!</p>
                  <p>Eight components there are to this feast,<br>
                    The first, a cheese, is but the least.<br>
                    Add mints, salad and jumjum spiced beer,<br>
                    And two slices of jumjum cake, nothing to fear!<br>
                    And the eighth is a basket, bringing up the rear.</p>
                  <p>The most widely known is the jumjum cake,<br>
                    From usual methods, add jumjum, to make!<br>
                    Mints are simple, and can be made by the sheaf,<br>
                    Just mix frosting with a eucalyptus leaf!</p>
                  <p>Now listen closely for brewing of spiced beer - <br>
                    Barley, hops, spices and jumjum you shall need near!<br>
                    Mix in some water, and into a bottle pour;<br>
                    The salad requires ingrediants (sic) four:</p>
                  <p>Lettuce, and fennel, vegetables and jumjum,<br>
                    Tasty on its own, sometimes nice with rum!<br>
                    Mix three frostings and a fruit portion,<br>
                    Creates a spread quite lovely, use caution!</p>
                  <p>Mix it with bread and a sandwich you'll find.<br>
                    That's for the picnic, if you've been left behind!<br>
                    Weave two mandrake roots together, task it!<br>
                    Then sew in some boning: your picnic basket!</p>
                  <p>A meal so good, a while it takes to eat,<br>
                    More than a food, a religious treat! </p>
