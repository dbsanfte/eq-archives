<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The elder shaman (level 
  25 or above) has the ability, if he/she cares to exercise it, to make many magical 
  potions. This skill has undergone several tweaks, but is still considered buggy. 
  Each potion requires that the shaman mix two or more items in a medicine bag. 
  A legendary shaman by the name of Jonas has had 5 volumes of his Letters published 
  in certain spots, that outline the ingredients needed for each potion. These 
  letters are generally available in the same cities that carry the medicine bag 
  and some of the needed herbs. Many of the components needed for this skill, 
  however, must be scavenged from creatures in the wilds. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Potions are currently quite 
  expensive to make, and skill increases still seem broken. As of this update 
  (January 2000), the first recipe in the book &quot;Somber Origins&quot; does 
  NOT make a hangover cure, but rather a potion that grants temporary charisma</font>.
