              The internet is my friend. The internet is my friend. But my friend 
              seems unwilling to play nice today. If you can't reach the message 
              boards today, you're not alone. I can't reach any EZBoard site, 
              nor can I connect to ICQ, etc. Hopefully things will settle down 
              soon.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">Nothing new of any tradeskill note in 
              yesterday's patch ... unless someone posted a find to the boards 
              late last night after I last read the boards. Somehow, I don't have 
              a lot of hope for stackable pelts for halfling and wood elf cultural 
              tailors, or the myriad of other nigglies that are still a bit awry, 
              and likely will stay that way, with Luclin taking up so much of 
              Verant's attention. Time will tell. Meanwhile, I'm going to take

              We're back!! You never know how much you take something for granted 
              until it's gone ... such as my wonderful webhosting provider, who 
              was laid low for several days. (I never did find out why, but given 
              the timing, I presume it was that dratted Nimda.) Anyway, we're 
              back, and I'll have more of an update on Monday.</p>

                <p><b><font size="+1">GU Comics closes it's doors</font></b>.</p>
                <p> After more than a year and some 18 million+ page views, I 
                  feel that GU Comics has run it's course. There are a ton of 
                  people I'd like to simultaneously thank and say goodbye to; 
                  but for the sake of brevity, I'll do that else where and at 
                  another time. </p>
                <p>I would like to thank Everlore at this time though. They were 
                  wonderful hosts for my little web comic. I appreciate all the 
                  hard work they put into keeping GU live. You guys own. Thanks. 
                </p>
                <p>And to the fans... I love you guys. At the darkest moments 
                  and the lowest point you were there to lift me up and support 
                  my work. I enjoyed the time you shared with me, and I hope I 
                  brought atleast one smile to you. And, hopefully helped you 
                  realize that EQ is a game... and that it's okay to take yourself 
                  lightly. </p>

                Everlore's still having some residual problems, so while the <a href="http://gucomics.everlore.com">/gu 
                comics</a> addy I have listed works most of the time, Woody's 
                FTP access for putting up new strips was still unhappy at last

              <p>In other news, yes, imbued field plate boots work now, and yes, 
                I'm mostly absent from the site and EQ for a while. Time for a

                Imbued field plate boots are supposed to be working as of today 
                - I'll try to get some updates done later today once folks have 
                a chance to test them and report back with stats. ... Now, if 
                only we could get imbued armor, any imbued armor, for some of 
                the forgotten deities, such as my own Bristlebane! ;) <i>{said 
                very tongue-in-cheek, I know there's lots going on}</i></p>
              <p>The village newspapers have brought forth information on another 
                new recipe, this one for <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1025.topic">vegetable 
                roughy</a>. Again, site updates will happen later in the day.</p>
              <p>I was getting pretty antsy without my /gu comics fix until Woody 
                gave me a happier URL for it. For those of you used to hitting 
                http://www.gucomics.com, try <a href="http://gucomics.everlore.com" target="_new">http://gucomics.everlore.com</a> 
                for your humor fix. I'll go through the site, yep, you guessed 
                it, later in the day, and make sure all my links point to the 
                working URL.</p>
              <p>I'm really burnt out on EQ, tradeskills and the site, and am 
                going to be taking it easy for a while longer, trying to remember 
                where the &quot;fun&quot; part of all this is. (Yes, the tell 
                bombs are still bad, and most folks think that even the simplest 
                question requires 10 tells to dance around the subject before 
                they come to the point, adding to the load of spam scrolling across 
                my screen, and making it hard for me to concentrate on everything 
                else going on ... like raids that they've interrupted.) I'm not 
                running away yet, I'm not closing down the site or anything silly 
                like that, but I'm going to take my grumpy redheaded self and 
                hide a lot until I can become ungrumpy again. :)</p>

                Top news from the patch message is that non-quest pelts will be 
                stackable, and that two of the deity-specific pottery idols have 
                been changed. (We know some non-quest tailoring pelts were overlooked, 
                but we're not sure if it was accident or intent - I've submitted 
                an enquiry) about it. At least one of the idols we consider &quot;bugged&quot; 
                has not been fixed (Rallos Zek), and another (Cazic Thule) had 
                a couple surplus classes removed from the list of who could wield. 
                More details as they become available.</p>
              <p>New issues of the newspapers should be available in all starting 
                cities. Please use <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=624.topic">this 
                message board thread</a> to track anything regarding tradeskills 
                that is found in local papers.</p>
              <p>Site updates have been slow due to an RL death in the family 
                last week. I hope to get a bit more caught up on information from 
                the boards, screen shots, etc., as time goes on. So far, the biggest 
                news item since the last front page update, was information on 
                three different imbued versions of the <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">erudite 
                steelsilk</a> armor.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">7/10/01 - Patch Day</span><br>
                As usual, I'm going to be swamped, the boards are going to be 
                VERY busy, and very slow. It looks to be a good patch day tradeskill-wise, 
                but it's going to take time for us to verify everything mentioned 
                in the patch message ... and the stuff that wasn't mentioned. 
                :)</p>
              <p>On the confirmed list, we've got the new weight stats for the 
                <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_leathers.htm">black panther armor</a> 
                (two pieces stayed at their old weight of 0.3, all others had 
                their weight reduced), the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_silks.htm">ice 
                silk lined slippers</a> had their stats updated, spider silk and 
                silk swatches are now stackable, and at least some types of sheet 
                metal and folded sheets of metal are stackable (we've not yet 
                tested all the racial sheets yet). More information will be on 
                the message boards as the day goes on. Meanwhile, I'm going to 
                be working on editing and submitting screenshots to EQ'Lizer and 
                Alla'Khazam's, so that they have the updated stats on the changed 
                tailored items ... and maybe get some more sleeeeeeep.</p>

                Nothing <i>too</i> earth-shattering to report with this patch. 
                Pottery idols are now equippable, for the most part, by the proper 
                races and classes. (I've added in a <a href="secrets/pottery_idols.htm">stats 
                page for the idols</a>, and we're slowly filling in the blanks 
                on it.) One new baking recipe (orange flavored cod) was found 
                in the village newspapers. </p>

                else, so it will be slow to get updates until I find another fashion

              <li>I've added info about mana vials to the FAQ section of the boards,

                Do not expect one overworked halfling to sit there and personally

                <b>Patch Day</b>. As usual, this means I'll be really busy once 
                the servers come back up, seeing what's changed on the live servers. 
                Also, as usual, it means the message boards will be VERY slow 
                loading, as it's likely to hit the 20K hits in a single day mark 
                today. Patience, grasshoppers. I'll get updates up as able.</p>
              <p>I normally don't talk a lot about what's going on over on the 
                Test server, though we randomly get updates from the Test tradesfolk 
                when something is coming through that will impact the trade community. 
                After all, it <i>is</i> Test, and things can/will/do change often 
                on Test before they hit the live servers. (And I absolutely refuse, 
                under any situation to post recipes/stats on the main part of 
                my site until it's verified as &quot;live&quot;.) However, an 
                accomplishment last night on Test deserves a little cheering. 
                The fleeting quiver has been very much a &quot;holy grail&quot; 
                type item for tailors and archers for 2 years now, and finally, 
                the recipe was put in place on Test. Given the difficulty of obtaining 
                the needed ingredients on Test, and the fact that there is a much 
                smaller tradesfolk community on Test, extra kudos go to Uind and 
                Gyodokan for reporting the first known success on a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=1676.topic">fleeting 
                quiver</a> on Test last night about half an hour before the servers 
                went down. Well done! I'm sure the folks on the live servers will 
                quickly follow suit once the servers are back up. :)</p>
              <p><b>Addendum:</b> The new imbued pottery idols are in-game. Recipe 
                is on the pottery recipes page and has been verified as functional. 
                Discussion and stats are on the message board. Snake meat can 
                now be pickled and made into steaks. Another fish recipe (marinated 
                muskie) has been found that trivials at 142. The fleeting quiver 
                recipe is live, and folks who have tried it today confirm that 
                it's not trivial at skill 209.</p>

                <b>Tailoring Recipes Found</b>. My thanks to Suppina as well as 
                a large number of other folks who took the challenge of the missing 
                recipes and ran with it. We have stats, plus rough trivial levels 
                for an entire new set of silk armor (<a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring.htm">Wu's 
                Fighting Armor</a>) that will get tailors into the 150-range with 
                their tailoring skill. You folks on the message boards have done 
                the EQ tradeskill community proud with your cooperation and information 
                sharing! My one comment on all this, though, is that they just 
                recently stated that the Coldain Tanners Kit could be used for 
                ALL recipes other than the cultural tailoring ... but they don't 
                have enough slots in them for the 3-silk pieces of this armor. 
                Hmmmmmm ... Are tailors stuck needing multiple sewing kits ... 
                again?</p>
              <p>Last week, Aragir also posted results on the enchanted Antonian 
                longswords. It seems we had the right recipes all along -- sort 
                of. (The &quot;ruby&quot; and &quot;emerald&quot; mentioned by 
                the NPC turned out to be &quot;star ruby&quot; and &quot;fire 
                emerald&quot;, respectively)</p>
              <p>New baking discoveries seem to have trickled to a halt for the 
                moment, but it's likely we'll figure out a few more once the dust 
                settles.</p>
              <p>Potters are eyeing a couple new items on Test with some interest. 
                There's a lot of speculation going on, but we'll just have to 
                bide our time to see what actually makes it to the live servers.</p>
