<p>
<p>
Those wood elves, oh those flighty wood elves. These folk can't seem to stick to "just one" thing, and their cultural tradeskills are no exception. These flutterheaded folk are able to perform the following cultural tradeskills: fletching, tailoring and weaponsmithing.
Note that these recipes are for wood elves only. Illusioning into a wood elf and wandering around going "Duuuuude, I'm a valley elf!" won't fool a cultural tradeskill container ... totally. <p>All combines listed as requiring a <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7858&menustr=">Fier'dal Fletching Kit</a>, <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2563&menustr=">Fier`dal Sewing Kit</a>, or <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5506&menustr=">Fier'dal Forge</a> MUST be performed by wood elves. (These containers check your starting race before allowing you to perform the combine. Use of illusions will not work.) Unless otherwise noted, fletching must be done using the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7858&menustr=">Fier'dal Fletching Kit</a>, tailoring must be done in the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2563&menustr=">Fier`dal Sewing Kit</a>, and smithing must be done using the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5506&menustr=">Fier'dal Forge</a> (illusions won't fool these containers, you have to be a reall, 100% wood elf to use them). This includes the May 8, 2002 upgrade to wood elf cultural tradeskills. (NPC text for the upgrade can be found at the bottom of the page)

<p>
Some of the older cultural smithing recipes had their trivials changed during the June 5, 2002 patch, and much trivial re-narrowing is <b>still</b> needed.
