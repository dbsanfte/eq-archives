<span class="headers">Freeport Warrior (Steel Warrior) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Freeport. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer) and no drop. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Go to the platform overlooking the arena in West Freeport, and speak with Arinna Trueblade. (loc -240, -225)
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Arinna Trueblade'
</p>
<p>
Arinna Trueblade says 'Well met Paeonia. I am Arianna Trueblade, Warlord of the Steel Warriors. I am personally in charge of all the training that our young warriors receive. I take pride in knowing that my teaching can help make the foundation of a Freeport Champion. If you are a [warrior] then we might just have something to talk about.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am a warrior'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'So you think you have what it takes to become one of Freeport's finest? I will warn you now that we expect every single warrior that is brought into our ranks to go through a series of exercises. Rest assured you will be rewarded for your hard work with a set of armor that I will walk you though the process of making. Are you [ready to begin your testing]?'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am ready to begin my testing'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'Very well Paeonia, Here is your Steel Warriors Mail Kit. This kit will be your main tool in creating your own armor. You will gather various items from all areas of Freeport from monsters and stores alike. You will use specific item combinations in this kit to fashion together armor materials that you will combine in a forge with the appropriate mold to make an armor piece. Once you are ready to attempt a piece of armor simply tell me what piece you [want] to craft. I will then present you with the recipe and mold for Steel Warrior [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft Helms'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'Any Steel Warrior that is caught not wearing a helm is usually placed on probation. We feel it is necessary sometimes to do this so that our younger ones in training will understand the importance of keeping your head well protected. To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Rat Ear, 1 Meat Pie and 1 Barley in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Helm.'

You say, 'I want to craft Bracers'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'As you progress further through your training you will find yourself in heavy battle more and more often. Bracers will ensure that you are able to fend off your opponents blows with minimum injury. To create your bracer material you will need to combine 1 Brick of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Rotting Zombie Skull, 1 Snake Bile and 1 Tiny Dagger in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Bracer.'

You say, 'I want to craft Armguards'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'A slash or gash to the arms can greatly hinder a warriors combat abilities. Wearing these armguards will ensure that this does not happen. To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Young Kodiak Paws, 1 Young Plains Cat Scalp and 1 Freeport Stout in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Armguards.'

<p>
You say, 'I want to craft Boots'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'Boots are very necessary for any warrior especially when you will usually be the one leading most combat units. Being on the front line and treading across terrains first make good boots a must. To create your boots material you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Shadow Wolf Tibia and 2 Spiderling Eyes in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Boots.'

<p>
You say, 'I want to craft Greaves'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'While most armor pieces are very vital to a young warriors survival, greaves are one of the most important armor pieces you will craft. To create your greaves material you will need to combine 4 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Giant Fire Beetle Brain, 1 Lion Tail, 1 Bottle and 1 Young Puma Skin in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Greaves.'

<p>
You say, 'I want to craft Gauntlets'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'Keeping your hands well guarded is without question the most important thing a warrior will do. Suffering a blow to the hands that would prevent you from defending yourself would most certainly mean death. To create your gauntlet material you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Armadillo Tail, 1 Severed Orc Foot, and 2 Spider Legs in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Gauntlets.'

<p>
You say, 'I want to craft Breastplates'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'Your dedication to learning everything about your class is impressive Paeonia. I have no doubt that you are ready to collect the pieces for your Steel Warriors Breastplate. To create your helm material you will need to combine 5 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Deathfist Orc Skull, 1 Woven Spider Silk, 1 Armadillo Carapace, 1 Matted Lion Pelt and 1 Rusty Short Sword in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Breastplate. Please come back to see me after you are finished with your breastplate for your [final task].'

<p>
You say, 'what is the final task?'
</p>
<p>
 Arinna Trueblade says 'I am in need of some assistance to craft a special sword that I would like to present all graduates of my training like yourself with. However, I don’t have all the pieces I need to make one. If you could retrieve a Pristine Giant Scarab Leg, 1 Lion Paw and 1 Vial of Smoke I will have all I need to create this weapon. I would have no problem presenting you with the first if I was able to create it. See you soon.'
