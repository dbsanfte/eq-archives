Protection of the Cabbage Quest - Spell-only Version
<p>
<i>With thanks to the folks at the Druid's Grove for their input</i>
</p>
<p>
NPC Rebecca Cabbageleaf can be found in the vendor area in Fungus Grove. In addition to selling some recipe books and some lovely baked goodies, this lass also turns quite conversational ...
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Rebecca Cabbageleaf'
</p>
<p>
Rebecca Cabbageleaf seems lost in thought and looks up only briefly from her work. "Oh, hello ____, welcome to the New Thicket Inn! If you'll excuse me, I'm a bit busy copying this new [scroll]. I'll be with you in a moment to chat, or to trade if you've come about the [earring]."
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What scroll?'
</p>
<p>
Rebecca Cabbageleaf looks up again with a quiet smile, "I'm making a copy of a new Protection spell, it's very exciting! The druids of Norrath have just completed an important ritual, and the gods have blessed us with this new spell! I'd be happy to scribe you a copy, if you were to fetch me the [ingredients]."
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What ingredients?'
</p>
<p>
Rebecca Cabbageleaf says, "Oh, let me see... I'll need a sheet of fancy Blessed parchment, a small flask of Dark Root ink, and of course a large quill. I think a Stormraven's quill would be best, certainly better than this one I've been using so far. Bring those items to me and I'll be happy to make you a copy for yourself. I'm not sure where you'll find all of those, I seem to have bought up the last of the stock in several places. Someone's bound to have them for sale, good luck with it!"
</p>
<p>
Rebecca Cabbageleaf smiles warmly, "Brilliant, you've brought me some more supplies! Here, please take this last copy I've made. I'd planned to use it for myself, but I'll let you use it so you don't have to wait for me to make a new one. I do hope you enjoy it!"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Feed her the three supplies, and you will gain experience as well as a copy of the level 59 Protection of the Cabbage spell (500 mana, no drop)
</p>
<p>
Now, where in tarnation do you find these supplies, you ask? And what's it going to cost an enterprising druid? Well, prices will vary based on your faction and your charisma, but with a bit of gear-swapping before you shop, you can cut your costs down to around 756pp total.
</p>
<ul> 
<li>Byl Babbinsbort, potion vendor extraordinaire in Rivervale, now sells the Blessed Parchment. He lurks in one of the burrows near the Fool's Gold tavern, at approximately -140, -120. He'll ask 252 pp (amiable, 101 CHA) to 284-ish pp (apprehensive con) for the parchment, depending upon your faction and CHA</li> 
<li>Next, you'll want to visit Kelethin, and shop with a fellow by the name of Bilrio Surecut for Dark Root Ink. This fellow's a tad sneaky, and if you can find your way to Bilrib's Smithy, it seems you'll find him around the outside of the building, to the right (loc -645, 385). Don't be like this RL vertigo sufferer, and wobble off the edge of his platform! Expect to shell out another 250+ for the ink.</li> 
<li>Finally, you'll want to head over to Surefall Glade, where they've found the secret to obtaining Stormraven Quills in bulk. The vendor to find is in the druid guild (building is labeled Jaggedpine Treefolk). Shop with Seqquea Erthinon and be prepared to plunk down another 254-260 pp for a quill.</li>
</ul></p><p>
