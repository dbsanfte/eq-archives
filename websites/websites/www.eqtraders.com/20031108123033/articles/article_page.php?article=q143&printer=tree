Hail Bloogy Shellcracker and he says 'Hello, strange one. I am Bloogy Shellcracker, the preparer of meals for my people. I am not familiar with the culinary tastes of your kind but you are welcome to purchase some of my supplies. I will also barter for ingredients to some of my exotic dishes."
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what ingredients' 
</p>
<p>
Bloogy Shellcracker says 'The rarest treat I can prepare for my people is saucy salted seadragon steak. I wish to barter for some water dragon or sea dragon meat, saltwater seaweed, and fish eggs. The rest of the ingredients are collected locally by our collectors."
</p>
<p>
- You need one <b>sea dragon meat</b>. It can drop off either kelorek'dar (Faydedar clone in Cobalt Scar ocean) or Faydedar in Timorous Deep. (Some people also claim drops off Faydedar in OOT).
</p>
<p>
- <b>Saltwater seaweed</b> is fished in the Ocean of Tears and Timorous Deep. You need two of these. 
</p>
<p>
- <b>Fish eggs</b> are made by combining Thunder Salmon (fished in the Karanas) and a skinning knife, combined in a tacklebox. This yields two fish eggs. 
</p>
<p>
Give him two fish eggs, two saltwater seaweed and the seadragon meat for your reward: Othmir Prexus Totem. NOTE: Items cannot be stacked, therefore you will need to give hime some items, then give him the rest of the items.
