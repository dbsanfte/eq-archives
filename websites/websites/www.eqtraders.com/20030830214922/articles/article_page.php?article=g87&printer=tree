<span class="headers">Becoming A Master Potter on 30pp Or Less</span>
<p>
<p class="headers"><a name="Master">by Kury</a> (E'Ci)</p>

<p><i>(DenMother's note: Since this guide was written, the price of firing sheets has dropped drastically, topping out at 4sp 2cp for HQ firing sheets. It may be worth firing items now, if funds are a concern. One of our message board members has written an update to this guide. I will get this guide updated as time permits)</i></p>

<p>Would you like to become a Master Potter in just over 4 hours, for less than 30 platinum? Here&#8217;s how I did it.</p>

<p>Since your Pottery books tell you how to make the items, let's skip to the good stuff. (If you need more information on that, just visit the main Pottery page.) All prices are with apprehensive faction with the merchants and a charisma of 45.</p>

<p><span class="headers"><b><u>What I Bought</u></b></span><br>
50 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1378&menustr=">Medium Jar Sketch</a> <br>
200 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1377&menustr=">Medium Bowl Sketch</a> <br>
1 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1001&menustr=">Water Flask</a> per sketch (summoned and foraged items don't work...grrr)<br>
1 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1300&menustr=">Block Of Clay</a> per sketch<br>
Don't worry about the firing sheets at this time. (Will explain shortly.)</p>
            
<p><span class="headers"><b><u>What I Did</u></b></span><br>
Start on the pottery wheel with the med JARS, continue till it becomes a trivial thing for you (You can't make med BOWLS till then). Next move to the med BOWLS and continue till you become a Master Potter. At this point you can move to the more profitable and nifty items.</p>

<p><span class="headers"><b><u>Why No Firing Sheets?</u></b></span><br>
Sheets are pricey, and you just never fail at the kiln. It&#8217;s best to destroy your successes since you&#8217;ll loose money if you fire up and sell the med JARS and BOWLS (at least I did).</p>

<p>My cost thus far has been:<br>
   50 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1378&menustr=">Medium Jar Sketch</a> at 1s8c each<br>
   200 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1377&menustr=">Medium Bowl Sketch</a> at 3s7c each<br>
   250 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1001&menustr=">Water Flask</a> at 1s5c each<br>
   250 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1300&menustr=">Block Of Clay</a> at 6s each<br>
   For a grand total of: 27p5s.</p>

<p>But if I had bought a high quality firing sheet at 5g1c apiece for each success, the price would have shot through the roof. </p>

<p>Just learn the lay of the land, find your supplies and have fun. </p></p><p>
