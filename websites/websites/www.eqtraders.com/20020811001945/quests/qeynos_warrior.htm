            <h3> Qeynos Warrior Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and are restricted 
              to HUM/WAR. This quest originates in South Qeynos with Ebon Strongbear.

              Ebon Strongbear says 'Welcome. I am the champion of the Steel Warriors. 
              There are none who can challenge me. I guide this brotherhood of 
              Steel Warriors. From Qeynos to the trade city of Freeport, the ways 
              of the Steel Warriors are taught. I welcome all [young Steel Warriors].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a young steel warrior'<br>
              Ebon Strongbear says 'Then listen well to the words of the trainers 
              of this arena. Learn to aid our friends such as the Knights of Thunder, 
              the Priests of Life, the rangers and druids of Surefall Glade, the 
              monks of the Silent Fist Clan and always support the Qeynos Guards 
              for many of our brothers have entered their ranks. Oh yes.. You 
              can also trust the bards of this city, after all, they do perform 
              at all of our major events. If you are a [new recruit] I have some 
              tasks for you to complete.'</p>

              Ebon Strongbear says 'I am always pleased to see new blood ready 
              to serve the Steel Warriors. All new recruits are asked to go through 
              training that I personally oversee. These training exercises will 
              test both your mind body and spirit because they are not easily 
              completed. If you are [ready to begin] I will explain to you how 
              the tests work and present you with your Steel Warriors Assembly

              In this kit you will combine numerous [magical items] that can be 
              infused in certain quantities to create an armor material. These 
              armor materials can then be placed in a forge along with the correct 
              mold to fashion a piece of Battlemasters Platemail Armor.'</p>

              Ebon Strongbear says 'The items you will need for your armor materials 
              will be collected throughout the Qeynos area. You will find items 
              that you need by hunting and by talking to local merchants. Once 
              you are ready to begin collecting the items for an armor material 
              you must simply tell me what piece you [want] to craft. I can provide 
              you with the recipes and armor molds for Battlemasters Platemail 
              [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets]

              Ebon Strongbear says 'I have heard word that the corrupt guards 
              are up to it again and this time one has gone too far. Guard Beris 
              has stolen my sisters coinpurse by claiming it was due for city 
              tax. This is not true because my family is held in high regard here 
              and we always pay our taxes promptly. This was simply a ploy to 
              steal money and I do not take kindly to that. I must ask that you 
              retrieve my sisters coinpurse from Beris, he can usually be found 
              in the hills fishing on his off-duty time. Bring me whatever you 
              can from him along with 3 perfect gnoll skins and I will reward 
              you with a finely refined blade for your trouble.' </p>
