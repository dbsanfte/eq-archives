A huge THANK YOU to Belgar Frostvenom, the original caretaker of alchemy for Norrath.

Potion Stacking: Word is that since the patch which removed the negative effects from most potions, they are also stacking much more often than they did previously.  At this point we know that damage shield potions should stack with everything except the coldain ring clickies, and that potions which have a strength component will not stack with spells, songs, or other potions which have strength components.  In some cases they will even overwrite a much better spell effect.  Please report any other stacking problems you find to the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=14">Alchemy Forum</a>.
