            <p> This quest provides an alternate method to gain entance to the 
              Halls of Honor. It involves a smithing combine (that may be skipped 
              if you wish to pay the NPC to make the combine instead) and both 
              versions of the combine have a chance of failure. This quest requires 
              the Planes of Power expansion.
            <p>Collect to following three items:
            <ol>
              <li>From PoN - Nightmare Mephit Heart ~ droped by nightmare mephits</li>
              <li>From PoV - crystal spider brain ~ dropped by Lumini Crawler 
              </li>
              <li>From PoI - Solid Block of Perilium ~ dropped by any named mob 
                (ie. corroded prototype, corrupted system) </li>
            </ol>
            <p>You then hand these three items and 3000pp to Borik Darkanvil in 
              PoK for him to combine to make the key to HoHa, alas Borki is not 
              that experienced at smithing, and does have a chance of FAILING 
              the combine, in which case you LOSE everything including the 3000pp. 
              Alternatively, you can combine them yourself in a tanaan forge with 
              a smithing hammer and a flask of water, trivial smithing &lt;= 117. 
            </p>
            <p>Either of these methods should result in a box of souls. </p>
            <p>You then go to PoJ where you need to kill the tormented souls who 
              live in a cell near the final stairs down to the trial area. You 
              need to kill them 1 at a time until they spawn a named mob on death, 
              named either exiled trooper of Marr, exiled officer of Marr or exiled 
              soldier of Marr. Each shade in the room will spawn one of these 
              mobs on death. Once the exiled spirit spawns, hand it the box. </p>
            <p>You should then recieve a soul orb and have the box returned to 
              you. </p>
            <p>You need to do this once for each tormented spirit in the room, 
              until you have the 3 soul orbs. </p>
            <p>You then make your way to PoV and find Grenic Drere, to whom you 
              hand the 3 soul orbs. This will result in a Ring of Marr, your key 
              to HoHa! As of the April 8, 2003 patch, everyone that is grouped 
              with you for this final handin, should also receive the ring.</p>
