<span class="headers">Freeport Cleric (Armor of the Ordained)</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of several armor quests for younglings that was recently added. This one is for Freeport human clerics, and will be HUM/CLR, no drop and lore (other than bracer). <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p> 
<p>
The following items must be combined in the Gem Encrusted Mail Kit obtained by talking to Salinsa Delfdosan outside the Temple of Marr.
</p> 
<p>
Each item is made from the special material obtained by combining the correct items in the kit, and the specific mold, also obtained from Salinsa Delfdosan, combined in a forge. Trivial <=21 smithing skill and are no-fail combines. Armor is grey with a slight purple tinge. 
</p> 
<p>
You say 'Hail Salinsa Delfdosan' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Pleasure to meet you ____, I am Lady Salinsa Deifdosan of House Marr. I have spent many hours on the battlefield in service of our glorious god however these days I spend my time training new [recruits].' 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'What recruits' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Well you see sense I am such a well seasoned adventurer my knowledge is very helpful to the young members of our house. That is why I have developed a system of hunting and gathering assignments that reward the new recruit with a set of armor that they work very hard to craft themselves. Are you a [young cleric of House Marr]? If so I will be happy to offer my assignments to you.' 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I am a young cleric of Marr' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Great! Let me first begin by explaining how you will be creating your own armor. You will use this magical kit I have presented you with to gather numerous [recipe components]. Your magical kit will be used to gather specific materials that will form together in certain numbers and quantities to create an armor material. You must then take the material you have fashioned to a forge along with armor molds that I will supply you with to create your armor.' 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'What recipe components' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'There are many different items that you will need to collect for your material components in all areas surrounding Freeport and our temple. I will be able to supply you with the mold for any armor piece you [want] to craft. I have the molds and recipes necessary for [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to craft a piece simply tell me what piece you would like to craft. For example if you wanted to create boots you would say, “I want to craft boots”.' 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a helm' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Any cleric should always be very selective about what headpiece they choose for it can mean the difference between life and death. To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Leaf Scarab Carapace, 1 Armadillo Tooth and 2 Fish Scales in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Helm of the Ordained.'

<p>
You say, 'I want to craft gauntlets' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Gauntlets will be a very important part of your armor set because it is extremely important that you keep your hands free from harm or you will find yourself having troubles with your spellcasting. To create your gauntlets material you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Black Bear Paw, 1 Giant Scarab Brain , and 2 Spider Legs in your assembly kit.

You say, 'I want to craft a breastplate' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'I am very proud to have seen my newest student progress through their training so fast. I have no doubt that the time has come for you to craft your Breastplate of the Ordained. To create your breastplate material you will need to combine 5 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Preserved Snake Eye, 1 Young Kodiak Paw, 1 Lion Mane, 1 Darkweed Snake Bile and 1 Large Leaf Scarab Leg in your assembly kit.

</blockquote>You say, 'What final mission' 
<p>
Delfdosan says 'As you must already know the Freeport Militia has been a thorn in our side ever sense they were trusted to care for our city during the crusade. Things have never been the same sense then and things are actually starting to get worse. There have been numerous reports of Freeport Militia soldiers harassing all those that do not follow their rules of tyranny. My sister was bringing me a newsletter from qeynos when she was abducted. She escaped but [Deisnak] stole the newsletter she was delivering to me.' 
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'Who is Deisnak' 
</p> 
<p>
Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Deisnak is a high ranking officer in the Freeport Militia, some would even call him untouchable. I need you to retrieve my newsletter for me by all means necessary. It had some very important messages from Qeynos and I must have it. Return to me with my newsletter and 2 Pristine Spider Eyes and I will reward you greatly for your efforts.' <font color="#400000"><i>Note that while the text says pristine spider eyes, you actually need to pristine scarab eyes, which drop off giant leaf scarabs.</i></font>
</p> 
<p>
Exact details on the weapon are not available, but it is reported as being damage 8, delay 29, Magic, Lore, No Drop
