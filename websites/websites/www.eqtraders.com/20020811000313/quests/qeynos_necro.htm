              will assist you in the creation of a staff but first you must complete 
              a task for me. The sorcerers of The Order of Three are supporters 
              of Antonius Bayle IV, the haughty ruler of Qeynos. They lend magical 
              aid to the Knights of Thunder and Priests of Life to identify and 
              capture members of the Bloodsabers. A rather troublesome member 
              of The Order of Three, Larkin Tolman, has recently been spotted 
              at a settlement in the Western Plains of Karana. Find this Larkin 
              Tolman and bring me his head.' </p>
