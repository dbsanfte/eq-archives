            <h3> Akanon &quot;Evil Caster&quot; Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many youngling armor quests, originating in Ak'Anon. 
              This one is meant for evil gnome casters (necros, and other INT 
              casters that follow Bertoxx).
            <p>Similar structure to the other class-specific quests - you get 
              a kit (Curing Kit) from the quest giver (Tilkzog Mournunder), who 
              will then tell you the recipe for each item and give you a pattern 
              (Tattered [xxx] Pattern) when prompted. It seems from the text that, 
              unlike the good INT-caster recipes, you don't need a piece of cloth 
              armour or a sewing kit to make the final piece. My understanding 
              (untested as yet) is that all the ingredients are combined in the 
              Curing Kit to make the final piece. You do need quite a few silk 
              threads of course, which require either a loom or a sewing kit, 
              but you could do those in one go at a loom and then just carry the 
              curing kit and patterns around with you. And the spiderling silks 
              to make the threads are a) readily available in Steamfont, and b) 
              stackable unlike the cloth armour. And the threads are stackable 
              as well of course.
            <p>Your Location is 2069.33, -453.37, -182.0606 (in Ak'Anon)</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Tilkzog Mournunder'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'Hail Genumkin. I am Tilkzog Mournunder, 
              Necromancer of the Dark Reflection. It is my duty here to assist 
              not only the young necromancers of the Dark Reflection but also 
              those wizards, magicians, and enchanters that have been called into 
              the service of the Plague Bringer. I will aid you in obtaining an 
              outfit of [durable clothing] suitable for a young sorcerer of the 
              Dark Reflection. Once you have been adequately outfitted for venturing 
              beyond our homeland in service of the Plague Bringer return to me 
              and I will assist you in obtaining a [staff of dark reflections].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what durable clothing?'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'The sorcerous servants of Bertoxxulous, 
              the Plague Bringer, are privileged with the sight of the Dark Reflection. 
              This gift enlightens us to the powers of disease, decay, death, 
              and destruction. Forces that are misunderstood and feared by the 
              majority of Norrath, including our fellow gnomes of Ak'Anon. These 
              forces are the catalyst of change, cleansing Norrath of the old 
              and weak, and we are the agents of this catalyst. However, before 
              you will be of much use to the Dark Reflection you must gather the 
              [components] necessary for the outfit that will protect and aid 
              you in your duties.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what components?'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'You will need this Curing Kit and varying 
              components depending on the piece of clothing you wish to fabricate. 
              Do you desire to craft a [plague sorcerer cap], [plague sorcerer 
              wristband], [plague sorcerer gloves], [plague sorcerer boots], [plague 
              sorcerer sleeves], [plague sorcerer pantaloons], or [plague sorcerer 
              robe]?'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to craft a plague sorcerer cap'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'To craft a Plague Sorcerer Cap you will 
              require two [silk thread], ebon drakeling bile, and a grikbar kobold 
              scalp. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your 
              Curing Kit with this Tattered Cap Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to craft a plague sorcerer wristband'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'To craft a Plague Sorcerer Wristband you 
              require a [silk thread], ebon drakeling bile, and a large rat pelt. 
              Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Curing 
              Kit with this Tattered Wristband Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to craft some plague sorcerer gloves'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'To craft Plague Sorcerer Gloves you require 
              two [silk thread], ebon drakeling bile, and two yellow recluse silks. 
              Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Curing 
              Kit with this Tattered Glove Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to craft a pair of plague sorcerer boots'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'To craft Plague Sorcerer Boots you require 
              two [silk thread], two ebon drakeling bile, and two large rat pelts. 
              Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Curing 
              Kit with this Tattered Boot Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to craft plague sorcerer sleeves'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'To craft Plague Sorcerer Sleeves you require 
              two [silk thread], young ebon drake bile, and three yellow recluse 
              silks. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your 
              Curing Kit with this Tattered Sleeves Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to craft some plague sorcerer trousers'<br>
              You say, 'i wish to craft some plague sorcerer leggings'<br>
              You say, 'i wish to craft some plague sorcerer pants'<br>
              You say, 'i wish to craft some plague sorcerer trews'<br>
              You say, 'oh, come on! you know what i mean - i wish to craft some 
              of those things you wear on yor legs, you know... &lt;lowers voice 
              to a whisper&gt; plague sorcerer pantaloons'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'To craft Plague Sorcerer Pantaloons you 
              require two [silk thread], young ebon drake bile, and four yellow 
              recluse silks. Once you have the necessary components combine them 
              in your Curing Kit with this Tattered Pant Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'yes, alright, keep your voice down! lastly, i wish to 
              craft a plague sorcerer robe, preferably long enough to cover up 
              those ridiculous pantaloony things'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'To craft a Plague Sorcerer Robe you will 
              require three [silk thread], ebon drake bile, a giant rat pelt, 
              and two yellow recluse silks. Once you have the necessary components 
              combine them in your Curing Kit with this Tattered Tunic Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'and, without without wishing to encourage you to prattle 
              on in any way, did you mention something about a staff of dark reflections?'<br>
              Tilkzog Mournunder says 'The Dark Reflection has many enemies even 
              within our home of Ak'Anon and the surrounding Steamfont Mountains. 
              Many fear and oppose the beliefs that grant us our vision and powers. 
              A wizard of the Eldrich Collective by the name of Winex Kloktik 
              has been aiding members of the Deep Muses hunt and slay those loyal 
              to Bertoxxulous and the Dark Reflection. Seek Winex Kloktik and 
              eliminate her. When you have completed this task bring me Winex's 
              Staff.'</p>

              the text)...<br>
