<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The elder shaman (level 
  25 or above) has the ability, if he/she cares to exercise it, to make many magical 
  potions. Each potion requires that the shaman mix two or more items in a medicine 
  bag. This skill has undergone <i>many</i> changes since it was first introduced, 
  and the old guide that was here is horribly out of date. A new one will be put 
  in it's place shortly, outlining some of the basic information regarding basic 
  alchemy potions, charged potions, skill increases, etc.</font>
