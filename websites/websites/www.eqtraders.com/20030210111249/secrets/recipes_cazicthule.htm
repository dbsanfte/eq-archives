            <p>The Cazic Thule zone was massively changed on March 7, 2002. Along 
              with new, nastier mobs, there were new recipe books that dropped. 
              All require drops from the Cazic Thule zone, and many of the drops 
              required are extraordinarily scarce. For now, the recipes, other 
              than the baking recipes, are staying here, as we continue to chip 
              away at verifying recipes, stats and drops.</p>
            <p> Five books were added to the game at the relaunch of this zone. 
              Below are the pertinent comments from books 2 through 5 <i>(book 
              1 contained no tradeskill information)</i>, as well as what information 
              we have on the finished product.</p>

            <p align="left"><b><a name="smith"></a>Blacksmithing - some recipes 
              verified</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Day 13. Kinopio tells me that he used to be a smith of some 
                reknown in his youth. I find it easy to believe. He spent all 
                afternoon laying out plans for a set of chainmail: A mold, a vial 
                of distilled blood, and several sheets of metal. If only we had 
                sheets of metal!</li>
              <li>Day 17. Though ill, Kinopio has gone to work with a will. Using 
                my lizard-blood temper, he hammered two pristine lizard scales 
                togeather to form a large plate - it looks exceptionally tough. 
                Perhaps we can use it to escape. (more) </li>
              <li>(Spanners book) This book is property of Spanner Scrapsnatcher. 
                Hands off!! </li>
              <ul>
                <li>Making a long sword - so nice. So very nice! With a few molds, 
                  a sheet of metal, and a little lizard blood temper, I created 
                  one in just an afternoon! Use a long blade mold, a hilt mold, 
                  a pommel mold, otherwise it won’t sit right in your hand. You 
                  can try it with a heavy steel blade mold, or a dagger mold instead 
                  if you like. I bet they work just as well. </li>
                <li>The Swampwood staves are great things. Take a sheet of metal, 
                  and wrap it around using a little of that lizard-blood temper 
                  (Tastes nice too) and hammerhead mold and you’ve got a really 
                  handy sledgehammer! I use mine to keep my tent pegs in the ground 
                  I suppose even a mace head mold would work if you were that 
                  way inclined. Mind you, who wants a mace when you can have a 
                  good gnomish hammer. </li>
                <li>Now then, shields. Shields are tricky things. Big, heavy beasts 
                  they are - not so kindly if you're not so tall. I reckon with 
                  a few sheets of metal, some of that tasty lizard-blood temper, 
                  a mold and my smiting hammer that I could knock up a shield. 
                  I'll give it a go! I hate this jungle. - Spanner</li>
              </ul>
              <li> Day 20. Kinopio showed me plans for a suit of full plate armour 
                based on the lizard plating that he constructed several days ago. 
                With a smithing hammer, flask of water, leather padding, mold 
                and several of the lizard platings, he claims to be able to make 
                anything.</li>

              <li>Day 9. Kinopio discovered a barrel suitable for brewing, in 
                one of the piles that line the walls, using two vials of runtlings 
                blood and a single vial of distilled mana, I managed to distill

              <li>Day 14. What a day. It started well-from a scale temper and 
                vial of lizards blood (Thankfully still in good condition after 
                all this time due to my preservations) I created a lizard blood

              <li>Day 2. Within the mounds of jumble I found a strange ore. It 
                seems local to this area's geology - and has fascinating properties. 
                Using my firestaff as a makeshift forge I found that two lumps 
                of this ore could be enchanted with a vile of distilled mana - 
                interesting. <br>
              </li>
              <li>Day 4. The enchanted ore seems to bond well with certain jewels 
                I have with me: Diamonds, blue diamonds, sapphires, black sapphires, 
                and rubies. I shall note these for further investigation on our 
                return to the academy.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Day 7. Gods, a week has passed. Kinopio's nightmares are worse. 
                They are effecting his judgement. My day was spent curing the 
                hide of the runtling - a long process, using a vial of the poor 
                creatures blood the result is a hard leather. Perhaps I can put 
                it to use.</li>
              <li>Day 8. Kinopio is restless, so I put him to work with the cured 
                hide. He has hidden talents: From one section of hide he created 
                a tough belt for himself, and from another section he produced 
                a gorget. Amazing. (more) </li>
              <li>Day 10. Kinopios skills know no bound. Using the distilled blood 
                and two sections of hardened hide, he created a backpack the likes 
                of which I have never seen before. From two portions of the distilled 
                blood, a section of hide, and a whip pattern of his own he even 
                made a rudimentary weapon. (more) </li>
              <li>Day 11. The day went slowly. Kinopio and I discussed possible 
                uses for this cured hide. He seems to think that one could fashion 
                an entire suit of armor from it, simply using sections of cured 
                hide in various quantity with appropriate pattern. I slept most 
                of the day.</li>
              <li>Day 21. Kinopio woke before me and ran out of the door. He was 
                gone all morning, and appeared soaked in blood and sweat in the 
                afternoon. Locking the door behind him he sat in a corner, staring 
                into space, clutching a strange silk substance in his hand.</li>
              <li>Day 22. Kinopio sleeps fitfully. From two of the stands of the 
                silk, smeared in some form of unidentifiable ichor, I was able 
                to make a crude swatch of silk. From whatever creature this originates, 
                I would rather not know - it is strong, and yet flexible. Inordinately 
                so.</li>
              <li>Day 23. I fear for Kinopio's mental state, he appears to have 
                gone quite insane. Whilst constantly gibbering about some kind 
                of sacrifice, has shaking hands crafted something from the silk 
                swatch and a pattern of his own making - imagine my suprise when 
                the poor soul presented me with a hand-sewn cap!</li>
              <li>Day 24. A tranformation has occured in my companion. His former 
                state of incoherence and madness has been replaced by a firm determination. 
                He seems resolved, though in what I cannot say. The cap fits well 
                - it seems that the silk can be used to make other garments.<br>
