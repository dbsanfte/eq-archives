            <h3>Deep Muses Armor - Ak'Anon Paladin Quests</h3>
            <p>This is one of many armor quests for younglings. This one originates 
              with Lewis Reldnok, in the Paladin's guildhall of Ak'Anon, and results 
              in lore (other than bracer) no drop armor that is PAL/GNM only. 
              It is gold in color when worn. <i>Please note that while the bracers 
              are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first 
              bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Lewis Reldnok' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'Greetings _____! I am Lewis Reldnok, first 
              Paladin of the Deep Muses. When I was just a young lad I journeyed 
              to Kaladim, the home of our cousins the Dwarves. At the Temple of 
              the Duke of Below I studied the ways of a Paladin of our creator 
              Brell Serilis. I have returned to Ak'Anon to train interested young 
              gnomes the ways I have mastered so that we may defend Ak'Anon and 
              Brells disciples everywhere from the threats that would see us destroyed. 
              If you are a Paladin of the Deep Muses I have some [armor quests] 
              for you to complete.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what armor quests?' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'I have armor quests that I present to young 
              gnomish paladins when they are ready to venture out into the Mountains 
              of Steamfont and begin their training. Are you a gnome that is [ready 
              for training]?' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am ready for training' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'Fantastic! Let me first begin by telling you 
              how you will create your armor young _____. I will present you with 
              a Tinkerers Mail Assembly Kit that you will use to collect all different 
              kinds of items from Ak'anon and from the Steamfont Mountaints. You 
              will use specific [armor recipes] in this kit to create materials 
              that you will use along with the molds I provide you with in a forge 
              to create your armor!' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what armor recipes?' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'I have all the armor recipes and molds that 
              you will need to get started all you must do is simply tell me what 
              armor piece you [want to craft]. I can provide you with the recipes 
              and molds for Deep Muses [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], 
              [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. I must recommend that 
              you attempt to gather the items for your breastplate last because 
              the components required for it are the most difficult to collect.' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a Helm' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'That's a great idea young ______. Having good 
              helm on the ol noggin will protect you from many hamrful attacks. 
              To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of 
              Crude Bronze, 1 Ruined Cat Pelt, 1 Rat Tooth and 1 Gnomish Spirits 
              in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material 
              take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own 
              Deep Muses Helm.' <br>

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a bracer' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'A bracer is what you wish to craft eh? Well 
              if you think you are ready you will need to collect 1 Brick of Crude 
              Bronze, 1 Grikbar Kobold Scalp, 1 Rat Whisker and 1 Short Ale. Once 
              you have created the proper material in your kit take it to a forge 
              along with this mold to fashion your very own Deep Muses Bracer.'

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft an armguard' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'Any smart paladin knows that your arms must 
              be well guarded in battle. How else would you be able to swing your 
              blade in Brells name! To create your armguard material you will 
              need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Ruined Coyote Pelt, 
              2 Bone Chips and 1 Russet Oxide in your assembly kit. Once you have 
              created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold 
              to fashion your very own Deep Muses Armguards.' </p>

            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'I wouldn&#146;t recommend going out in the 
              Mountains without some Boots on Gearsword. Who knows what kobold 
              surprise you might find out there! To create your boot material 
              you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 2 Spiderling 
              Silks, 2 Flasks of Water and 1 Iron Oxide in your assembly kit. 
              Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along 
              with this mold to fashion your very own Deep Muses Boots.' <br>

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft gauntlets' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'Gauntlets are a very good idea indeed to keep 
              your hands protected while on the battlefield. To create your gauntlet 
              material you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Diseased 
              Bone Marrow, 1 Harpy Wing, 1 Aviak Talon and 1 Moss Covered Drake 
              Scale in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material

              4 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Spiderling Eyes, 1 Minotaur Horn, 1 
              Bottle of Kalish and the dastardly rogue Galorin`s Head in your 
              assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it

            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'It pleases me to see that you have come this 
              far in your training. When you complete your breastplate and round 
              out your armor set you will truly be a worthy paladin of Brell. 
              To create your breastplate material you will need to combine 5 Bricks 
              of Crude Bronze, 1 Grikbar Kobold Scalp, 1 Low Quality Coyote Pelt, 
              1 Micro Servo 1 Scrap Metal and the evil warrior Berinsan`s Shirt

            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'I'm glad to see you are back, it is clear that 
              you have progressed very well in your training for you to be here 
              ready for this task. I am constructing a blade for all of our new 
              recruits to carry. If you [gather the items] I need I might be able 
              to craft you won as well. </p>
            <p>You say, 'I will gather the items' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'Thank you for your willingness to help Gearsword. 
              I must warn you though I need some items from monsters and areas 
              that are quite treacherous so I would recommend you take some worthy 
              companions with you if you are to venture out on this quest. Are 
              you [up for the challenge]?' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am up for the challenge' </p>
            <p>Lewis Reldnok says 'Ok I will need 4 things to construct this blade. 
              Bring me a Finished Sheet of Metal, a Kobold Backbone, Preserved 
              Rat Pelt and 1 Bottle of Clockwork Oil that was stolen from me from 
              some renegade clockworks not too long ago. Once I have these items
