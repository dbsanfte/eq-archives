<p>
This is the first of the shawl quests to involve tradeskills. That makes it the step where those who have never tradeskilled in their lives begin to get a glimmer of into what they've gotten themselves. If you find yourself getting seriously bored or frustrated during the duration of this quest, may I gently urge you to seek another way to occupy your time before you inflict the rest of the quests on yourself? If, however, you have enough of the tradeskiller's blood in you, and find a certain delicious thrill in leaping each hurdle, then there just might be hope....

<h4> <a name="inst">Detailed Instructions</a></h4>
<p>
I describe the quest here in the order it is given to us, to be consistent with the Coldain. However, I recommend doing all of the parts of this quest together in three parts: collecting ingredients and implements, baking the foods, and distributing to NPCs. Each main ingredient in the four dishes come from creatures scattered throughout East Wastes, so to save time finding the right animals I just ran around at random killing any of the four until I had everything I needed. This may not be as much of an issue for trackers or those without any particular hurry. But we all know how it is: when you need a griffin you can't take two steps without tripping over a snow bunny, but when you need a snow bunny.... 
<p>
<i> Basic Baking Information </i>
</p>
<p>
The most difficult item you will need to bake for this shawl becomes trivial somewhere not much below 127. For information on how to improve your trade skills for the shawl quest, see <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q3&menustr=120060010000#how">"What is the quickest way to raise Xxxxxx skill?"</a>. A typical, basic baking recipe calls for you to put the ingredients of your recipe into an Oven and press the Combine button. Ovens are stationary containers found mainly in cities, including one in Mordin's Meats in Thurgadin. Anything that can be made in an oven can also be made in a Spit. Spits are portable containers like tailoring kits, which you can carry with you and use to combine your ingredients any time. Spits can be bought from a few certain vendors, including Wevil Doughbeard in the Thurgadin bank, or can be made by smiths. The only advantage to using a spit instead of an oven is that a spit is portable, so that you do not need to be at an oven to make your combine. There are also Collapsible Spits which can be made by tinkerers and are stored as a single item rather than as a container, so that they do not take up an entire inventory or bank slot.  If you do not plan to do extensive baking beyond this quest, I would recommend ignoring both kinds of spits completely and just using ovens. A few recipes cannot be made in an oven or spit, but instead require a Mixing Bowl. Mixing bowls are another kind of portable container that can be made by potters or bought from vendors in various cities, although not in Thurgadin. Sometimes you can find them on one of the vendors in the Thurgadin bank since players will make one to use once and then immediately sell it back to a vendor so that they do not have to carry around this nuisance container. Collapsible Mixing Bowls are also available from tinkerers if you wish to be able to store the item in another container, but are likewise not recommended if your only interest in baking is for the shawls.
</p>
<p> 
There are also implements sometimes used in baking, including pie tins, pots, cake rounds, skewers, and smokers. These are items that must be combined in the oven or spit along with the food ingredients of the recipe. In any non-quest recipe, you should get the implement back whether or not you successfully make your food. However, for the shawl quest recipes you will not get your implement back when you succeed. I am not sure whether you get it back if you fail on your combine. See <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/pottery_recipe_page.php?article=56&rsa=Pottery&sb=item&sub=tools&menustr=080090100000">Pottery Recipes</a> for the recipes to make these implements as well as mixing bowls.
</p>
<p>
All of the vendor ingredients required for this quest can be bought in Thurgadin. Mordin Frostcleaver in Mordin's Meats sells Bread and Flasks of Water. Perkins Doughbeard in the bank sells Vinegar, Spices, Jugs of Sauces, Cups of Flour, and Milk.
</p>
<p>
<i> Beginning </i> <br>
When you finish the second shawl quest, Loremaster Borannin tells you about this one. He is found in the Temple of Lore at -320, 720. To get there, after you enter Thurgadin and come in to the town area, turn left. When the path forks to the right, continue going straight down the ramp. The building all the way at the back of that area is the Temple of Lore, and Borannin is inside on the stage. When you ask him "what chore?" he will give you "Borannin's Seal". Go to Mordin Frostcleaver in Mordin's Meats at -220, -231. To get there when you enter Thurgadin and reach the main town area, turn right. After the first bend to the left, his shop will be close by on the left. Give him the seal, and you will receive "Leif's Napkin".
</p>
<p>
<i> First Dish </i>
</p>
<p>
Make a Tundrabear Sandwich.
</p>
<p>
Combine in Oven: 1 Tundra Kodiak Meat + 1 Jug of Sauces = Saucybear Meat. (trivial 26) <br>
Combine in Mixing Bowl: Saucybear Meat + 1 Loaf of Bread = Tundrabear Sandwich. (trivial <51) <br>
Tundra Kodiak Meat drops off of Tundra Kodiaks in East Wastes. It does not drop every time but both the kodiaks and their meat are common enough that this shouldn't be too painful.
</p>
<p>
Take the sandwich to Guard Leif, who is at -281, 500 outside the Paladin Guild. The guild is located just before the Temple of Lore, on the right, by the creepy statue with the glowing red eyes. Leif stands on guard just to the right of the entrance to the guild. Be careful not to be confused by Leifur, a completely different coldain that hangs out in the basement of a building and gives the bard armor quests. Give Guard Leif the tundrabear sandwich and his napkin, and he will give you back his Used Napkin. Return the napkin to Mordin and he'll give you "Trita's Napkin". 
</p>
<p>
<i> Second Dish </i>
</p>
<p>
Make Snow Bunny Stew.
</p>
<p>
Combine in Mixing Bowl: 2 Bunny Meat + 1 Jug of Sauces = Saucy Bunnymeat. (trivial 41-50) <br>
Combine in Oven: Saucy Bunnymeat + Spices + 2 Flasks of Water + Pot = Snow Bunny Stew. (trivial 68) <br>
Snow bunnies are all over East Wastes and drop the meat often enough, but they can be hard to see on the white snow. When doing the second combine, make sure that the two flasks of water are not stacked.
</p>
<p>
Take the stew to Trita Coldheart, who is downstairs in the house at -110, 270. To get there from the entrance to town, turn left and go past the bank. Follow the path when it bends around to the right, and Trita's house is the first one on the left. Give her the stew and her napkin, and she will give you back her "Dirty Pot". Take the pot to Mordin and he will give you "Brita's Napkin".
</p>
<p>
<i> Third Dish </i>
</p>
<p>
Make Ulthork Meat Pie.
</p>
<p>
Combine in Mixing Bowl: 2 Ulthork Meat + 1 Vinegar + 1 Spices = Spicy Ulthork Meat. (trivial 82) <br>
Combine in Mixing Bowl: 1 Egg usable for dough + 1 Milk + 1 Cup of Flour = Clump of Dough. (trivial 17) <br>
Combine in Oven: Spicy Ulthork Meat + 1 Clump of Dough + Pie Tin = Ulthork Meat Pie. (trivial 89-95) <br>
Ulthorks and their meat are common enough. The meat is edible when you loot it, so be careful not to gobble it up before you get around to baking it. (If you get any ulthork tusks while collecting the meat, be sure to save them for making the burin for the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q136&menustr=120060070000">seventh shawl</a>. You can make the burin ahead of time if you have the skill and collect all the ingredients.) When making the Spicy Ulthork Meat you must put the two ulthork meats in separate slots, do not stack them. Many different kinds of eggs can be used to make clumps of dough, see <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1461">Clump of Dough</a> for more details on what kinds of eggs can be used and how many clumps of dough each egg makes. You will probably find it easiest to leave Velious to get an egg that will work.
</p>
<p>
Take the meat pie to Lorekeeper Brita, who is at -180, 810 in the Temple of Lore. When you enter the Temple, turn right into the library and she is in the aisle all the way on the left. Give her the pie and her napkin, and she gives you her "Used Pie Tin". Return the pie tin to Mordin and he gives you "Thoridain's Napkin". You are now done with Mordin.
</p>
<p>
<i> Fourth Dish </i>
</p>
<p>
Make Snow Griffin Souffle.
</p>
<p>
Combine in Oven: 4 Snow Griffin Eggs + 1 Spices = Snow Griffin Souffle. (trivial 118-127) <br>
Snow Griffs and their eggs are a great big pain in the patoot to find. They are rare to begin with, and can be extremely rare because of folks after them for this quest. They are No Drop, so you cannot buy them or have someone else collect em. I suggest focusing generally in the areas around and between the bridge, orc fort, and Kerafyrm's Lair entrance, as these three places tend to have higher frequencies of griff sightings. When I did this part, my tracker and I found the Elder Griffin southwest of the bridge. Each time we killed him he immediately respawned within druid tracking range and we ran and killed him again. I'd say maybe one in every three or four griffs drops an egg. If you are without tracker or aren't finding any griffins at all, try randomly killing other animals in the area to see if you can get griffs to spawn. The souffle is trivial at less than 127, but this is definitely harder than the previous recipes. Make sure that you do not stack the eggs in the oven, they must be in separate spaces in order to successfully combine. I am told that "griffon eggs" drop or are foraged in other zones, but the only ones that work for this quest drop from the snow griffs in East Wastes.
</p>
<p>
Take the souffle to Grand Historian Thoridain who is right next to our old friend Borannin on the stage in the Temple of Lore. Give him the souffle and his napkin and he'll give you "Seal of Thoridain". Give it along with your Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl to Loremaster Borannin, and he returns the very same Seal to you to keep, as well as your Woven Coldain Prayer Shawl. Two prizes, whoo hoo!
