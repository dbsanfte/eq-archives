            <h3> Neriak Rogue Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Neriak. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer) and no drop. This starts 
              in the rogue guild in Neriak 3rd Gate. Details on the armor received 
              are not yet available. <i>Please note that while the bracers are 
              not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer 
              before you get the parts for a second one</i> 
            <p>Selzar L`Crit says 'What have we here? Another hopeful member of 
              the House of the Ebon Mask? You've got much to learn before you 
              will be of much use to our House or the secret operations that support 
              both the thrones of our King and Queen. First you need to outfit 
              yourself in a suit of [armor], Branaddar. ' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what armor?' </p>
            <p>Selzar L`Crit says 'Seek Kanthu M'Rekkor and give him this request 
              parchment. When you have outfitted yourself in a suit of armor return 
              to the House of the Ebon Mask and I will grant you [another task]. 
              ' </p>
            <p>(hand in the parchment to Kantu M`Rekkor, also in the Rogue Guild) 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Kanthu M`Rekkor' </p>
            <p>Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'Greetings, Branaddar. So you are one of Selzar's 
              new recruits. You are to assist in the construction of the armor 
              you will don as a new Rogue of the House of the Ebon Mask. I have 
              assembled a kit that is used in the crafting of Ashen Bone Mail. 
              You must travel beyond Neriak into the Nektulos Forest for the [materials] 
              that compose the armor. ' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what materials?' </p>
            <p>Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'Many species of dangerous creatures, the 
              restless dead, and halfling invaders from Rivervale inhabit the 
              Nektulos Forest. You must defeat these creatures and halflings in 
              order to obtain the materials. The materials you seek depend on 
              the piece of armor you desire. Do you desire to craft [gloves], 
              [boots], a [bracer], a [coif], [leggings], [sleeves], or a [tunic]? 
              ' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what gloves?' </p>

              bone. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your

            <p>Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft Ashen Bone Mail Sleeves you require

              '</p>
            <p>Back at the original quest giver:</p>
            <p>You say, 'what another task?' </p>
            <p>Selzar L`Crit says 'Ah, you are eager to advance further within 
              the House of the Ebon Mask. Although it is my duty to aid your training, 
              do not allow your arrogance to blind you to your lowly position 
              in our House. I can see that you have not yet learned to temper 
              the use of your tongue. Your next task is to assist the construction 
              of a [weapon] and [bow] worthy of being wielded by a Rogue of the 
              House of the Ebon Mask. ' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what weapon?' </p>
            <p>Selzar L`Crit says 'Beyond the mouth of Neriak lies the Nektulos 
              Forest. There the Halflings of Rivervale have set up camps at ancient 
              druid holy sites in an attempt to cleanse Innoruuks corruption that 
              is spreading through the Nektulos Forest. Slay these trespassers 
              and bring me a Large Snake Skin, a Halfling Fibula bone, and a Halfling 
              Clavicle bone. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what bow?' </p>
            <p>Selzar L`Crit says 'The Halfling Druids from Rivervale that frequent 
              the ancient druid ruins in the Nektulos Forest are guarded by Leatherfoot 
              Warriors. The peck druids perform the rituals that they hope will 
              prevent Innoruuks corruption from spreading deeper into the Forest 
              and the lands beyond. Should you slay the peck warriors guarding 
              the druids and obtain a Leatherfoot Short Bow, take the bow, a Black 
              Mamba Skin, and a Lock of Zombie Hair to Andara C'Luzz at The Bleek 
              Fletcher in the Neriak Commons near the headquarters of the Indigo 
              Brotherhood. ' </p>
