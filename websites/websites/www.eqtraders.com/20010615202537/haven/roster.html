  <P ALIGN=left> This roster has been indefinitely removed due to a recent high 
    incidence of &quot;stalking&quot; folks across multiple personas. Information 
    formerly contained within this roster will be posted for Vodirunner-only viewing 
    on the message boards soon. Those of you who had been using this roster as 
    a means to &quot;track&quot; various players behind the personas, learn to 
    respect that we deserve some downtime on some of our lesser-known alts too. 
    Don't make us use /ignore to get some peace and quiet.
