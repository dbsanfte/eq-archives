<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Good day tae 
  ye. I be Niami, a wee halfing Priestess o' Mischief from Rivervale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Nay, nay! Naught the troublemaking 
  kind of mischief! I be one o' those who relish curiousity an' laughter, an' 
  try tae find some bright side tae any adversity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My curious questions tae 
  th' folks from other lands may betimes get me in a wee spot of hot water, but 
  I don't mean tae be rude when I ask th' questions, only tae learn. (What <i>IS</i> 
  in that water up in Halas that makes them grow sae tall??) </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According tae me family, 
  th' spirits o' th' ancestors be strong in me. My parents always thought they 
  spoke tae strongly within me, but sometimes th' spirit guidance is much needed. 
  <i>"Ye've got yuir Great Uncle Rupert in ye, lassie, tae be wandering aboot 
  like that instead of sitting at home an' minding yuir lessons like a proper 
  lass!"</i> (This is not tae be confused wi' cousin Rupert, mentioned below, 
  though it does seem tae be an ill-fated name in my family!)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ah, but Great Uncle Rupert 
  was a great seeker of knowledge, and like he, I, strongly believe there are 
  answers to everything ... somewhere. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"What in tarnation's 
  name are ye doing helping that elf?! Just like yuir Aunt Mabel, helping outsiders 
  as if they be family!" </i>An' if I do nae help, who will? If I do nae show 
  that th' same spirits move within us all, an' help a stranger, who will help 
  me, or my friends, when we are lost in a strange land?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I may not agree with th' 
  dark paths that some have chosen, but mayhaps a bit o' my kindness will rub 
  off on them, enow that they may some day see their way tae a less destructive 
  path. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Ye didn't get any o' 
  that prayer mumbo jumbo from me - ye must hae gotten it from yuir mother's side 
  of the family."</i> The god of Mischief might be a perverse god at times, but 
  there's nae denying th' extra strength I gain through proper prayers an' spells. 
  I share gladly o' that strength an' knowledge, an' ha'e been known tae die, 
  repeatedly, by trying tae heal and/or otherwise save someone in trouble. Ne'er 
  mind that th' person, an' the creature they are fighting, be significantly more 
  seasoned than I, if they are in trouble, an' I am able, impulse an' me upbringing, 
  tend tae lead me intae adversity more often than not. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now that my parents hae 
  been killed by those evil orcs, I hope that their spirits, as well, speak within 
  me, for I miss them greatly an' could use their pithy comments tae remind me 
  o' why I don't want tae sit at home an' become like them. I want tae learn all 
  I can learn, see all I can see, bring a bit o' mischief an' laughter intae the 
  lands outside Rivervale ... an' I want tae take this meat tenderizer o' mine 
  and turn every kodiak I can intae bear meat, sandwiches an' backpacks. That's 
  nae tae much tae ask, is it? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">E'er since I was a young 
  lass o' forty winters old, I hae taken several young ones under my wing, including 
  Jarno, son of my lamented Cousin Rupert (eaten by foul carrion spiders -- och!). 
  This willingness tae take on foundlings, as well as me overally motherly nature 
  has earned me the nickname &quot;Den Mother.&quot;</font></p>
