              <b>She's ba-a-a-ck!</b> I'm back in town, though it will take me 
              a few days to catch up on everything. I can now say from personal 
              experience, though, that even a 1-hour flight is a total nightmare 
              when flying with an ear infection. (Ugh) Othmir fur is finally dropping 
              in-game. A few new pieces of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
              tailored armor</a> have had recipes/stats verified. A few more stats 
              are in place for imbued jewelry. The enchanted seafarer's weapons 
              for <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">human cultural 
              smithing</a> that have been listed as bugged since the September 
              smithing patch may have been changed/deciphered. (The NPC source 
              for this is now apparently asking for enchanted sheets that are 
              made from HQ ore, instead of the original request for enchanted 
              MQ sheets). And ... cod is still totally, 100% believed to be missing. 
              CodFest 2001 was a bust, fishermen and women have thrown down their 
              fishing poles in frustration, and I'm praying something about it 
              will appear on the SONY boards sometime with a confirmation or an 
              ETA.</p>
            <p>As mentioned below, if you have questions, and can't find the information 
              on the site, please post to the message boards instead of filling 
              up my mailbox. You're far more likely to get a response if you post 
              there. :)</p>

              <b>Patch Day ... and the DenMother runs away!</b> Murphy and his 
              laws caught up to me again, and instead of having a &quot;leisurely&quot; 
              24 hours in which to verify patches to tradeskill stuff before going 
              out of town, I ended up with far less time. (Tunare was down for 
              the count for a while this afternoon, and once it was back up, and 
              I'd fished my way through a couple hundred bait, it was time for 
              me to go down for the count and take a nap!)</p>
            <p>I've managed to verify only a few things today: gator rolls (had 
              been bugged since launch, I think) now work with the in-book <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">recipe</a>, 
              holgresh fur cap and boots are working (email verification from 
              someone on the cap, though it failed; I made the boots, and stats 
              are on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious tailoring</a> 
              page). Some stealth-additions to <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
              jewelry</a> went in, and while I'm very under-impressed with the 
              Karana imbue (and many other imbues from Jan 31, such as Niami's 
              Bristlebane imbue), I'm ecstatic over the Tribunal imbue.</p>
            <p>Sadly, our cod fishing expedition met with no luck. We only had 
              time to test 40 to 60 fish in each of the following zones before 
              we put away our fishing poles in frustration, but either these fish 
              are somewhere really odd in Velious, or they've broken the pattern 
              of all other Velious tailoring recipes, and need a spawn from another 
              continent. (Iceclad, Eastern Wastes, Kael Drakkel, Great Divide, 
              Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Skyshrine, Sirens Grotto and Western 
              Wastes were all fish-tested today.) Soooo, the 40 velium bits and 
              dozen arctic wyvern hides that my guild helped me collect will have 
              to sit in the bank a while longer, and we have an entire suit of 
              tailored armor that still can't be made. If anyone finds cod (and 
              please, no &quot;friend of a friend of a friend of mine&quot; stories) 
              PLEASE post to the message board ... there's a thread in the tailoring 
              section about our most recent attempts.</p>
            <p>A lot of the patch stuff is not yet verified ... and I'm running 
              away!? Yep. I'll be out of town until next Tuesday. <font color="#400000"><b>If 
              you have ANY updates for the site, news on stuff that is or isn't 
              patched as advertised, trivial rates, or even &quot;just&quot; questions, 
              PLEASE post to the message boards.</b></font> Do not make the folks 
              that read this site wait for days on end for me to process my email 
              for an update on something that is broken/fixed, etc. This causes 
              a lot of duplication of effort, and a lot of strain on my mailbox. 
              Once I return, I WILL be removing my email link from most of these 
              pages, due to a massive increase in email that's mostly &quot;simple&quot; 
              stuff that could be handled better on the boards. I can't tell you 
              how many times I get email on things that are stated on the recipes 
              pages, location pages, etc., or have been beaten to death on the 
              message boards, yet still, several folks have to send me email with 
              questions about it. Seriously, folks ... there's a HUGE tradeskill 
              community discussing things on these message boards, and if you're 
              relying on one single halfling for your information via email instead 
              of going to the message boards and relying on all the folks there, 
              you're not only overloading the wee halfling, but there's an increasingly 
              high chance that your questions will not get answered. (Especially 
              if you join the 30+ folks who believe I'm holding back some &quot;secret&quot; 
              to finding the yew leaf ground spawn, and that by sending me email, 
              my answer posted on the recipes page will change. Random means just 
              that ... we can't find a pattern or specific area of Wakening Lands. 
              Asking me over and over again in email won't change that answer. 
              /bonk) For those of you great folks who are reporting in trivial 
              levels and such, much as I LOVE getting such confirmations, if you 
              could start posting that stuff to the message boards instead of 
              mail-bombing me, it makes it easier for others to see the info, 
              and gives me a chance to address it when I'm dealing with site updates, 
              instead of keeping it in unread mail for days on end. :) </p>

              <b>Save that bait!</b> It seems that the lovely cod for <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velium

              postpone further hunting for the elusive fish until Verant can restock 
              the appropriate body of water with them once again. (Translation: 
              save your scrounging/theories/etc. about this fish until after the

            <p><span class="dates">02/09/01</span><br>
              I don't like having something negative and grumpy on the front page 
              of my site. Unfortunately, a lot of inconsiderate folks drove me 
              to it. I'm moving <a href="the_rant.htm">&quot;the rant&quot;</a> 
              to it's own page. If you are on the Tunare server read it before 
              you even THINK of sending me a tell in-game. Period.</p>
            <p>For the rest of you newer visitors, who have seen something about 
              the new tailored ranger, monk, rogue, etc. armors, please note the 
              following before you think of mail-spamming me for the recipes. 
              Recipes for these pieces are found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious 
              recipes</a> page. Stats for any pieces that have been made are listed. 
              If you don't see stats for the piece you want, I haven't made it 
              yet, and nobody else who has made it has reported it to me yet. 
              Do not ask me for them, I can't give them to you if I don't have 
              them. If you want something more up-to-date than the recipes pages 
              that I sometimes update several times a day, check the message boards. 
              Do NOT email bomb me asking for more details. There is an entire 
              HUGE community of tradesfolk on the message boards, several of whom 
              can likely answer your questions in a more timely manner than me. 
              To expect me to answer up to 100 pieces of email a day for information 
              that is either clearly printed on the recipes pages, or easily answered 
              on the message boards is silly.</p>
            <p>Those of you who have been loyal followers, and have been showering 
              the boards and my mailbox with your words of support, thank you. 
              I feel a bit better now. Last night was a bit more tolerable, with 
              only one person not wanting to accept my response to &quot;PLEASE 
              visit the website instead of asking me for info&quot;, and sending 
              me another dozen tells while I was, amazingly enough, trying to 
              keep a guildmate of his alive in Kael. Errrmmm. Hopefully word will 
              eventually go out that my tolerance for tell nukes in game is gone. 
              If not, I'll let my &quot;bodyguard&quot; take care of 'em. ;)</p>
            <p>A few more of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
              tailoring recipes</a> have been verified, and Bristlebane smiled 
              upon me a bit. There were actually more successes than usual on 
              this extremely difficult and extremely frustrating armor ... and 
              some of the pieces may actually be worth wearing.</p>
              <p><b>02/04/01<br>
              </b> Weekend update: Post-patch news. <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">Field 
              plate</a> boots are now fixed, but imbued versions are still DNC. 
              The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">holgresh fur</a> cap and 
              boots that were to be fixed are also still broken. Some <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
              jewelry</a> combinations were implemented, and we've heard that 
              there is more in the works. There is also supposedly something in 
              the works so that the &quot;missing link&quot; between non-cultural 
              tailoring and the extremely difficult velium tailoring will be implemented 
              eventually.</p>
            <p>This brings me to an interesting point, and yes, it means you get 
              to hear another mini-vent here. &lt;g&gt; I was treated rather condescendinly 
              by someone on my server the other day because I am &quot;wasting&quot; 
              my time on the velium tailoring before my halfing racial tailoring 
              was maxxed. (Mind you, this same fellow then tried to hound me into 
              giving/selling/trading haze panther skins, so that he, with his 
              lesser skill, could have the chance to make these items, but that's 
              another story.) I am working on velium tailoring for one reason, 
              and one reason only ... all you folks. I, at least, am enough of 
              a stubborn redhead to keep trying until all the recipes are verified, 
              and the stats are known. There is nothing more frustrating to a 
              tailor to make repeated expensive and time-consuming attempts at 
              making armor, only to find that when you <i>do</i> end up with a 
              success, that the item you've made is nowhere near worth the work 
              you put into it. By collecting as much information as possible on 
              DNCs and stats, I hope that many of you tailors can focus on trying 
              to make the pieces that <i>are</i> worth your while. (Each set seems 
              to have some great items, and some items that no person over level 
              20 would want.) For those of you who are going to sneer at me as 
              being &quot;foolish&quot; by &quot;wasting&quot; my time on this 
              stuff, while being hypocritical enough to then try to get me to 
              collect pelts for you ... keep it up and you'll find that while 
              I've been the soul of politeness so far, I am well capable of using 
              /ignore ... and the rest of my guild is too. You ARE making use 
              of the fruits of my research on this site, and as such, you have 
              no right to snipe at how that research is done.</p>
            <p><b>01/31/01:</b> LOTS of tradeskill changes/fixes/additions went 
              in with today's patch, and, frankly, I'm more than overwhelmed. 
              PLEASE have patience and do NOT harass the DenMother either in-game 
              or via email demanding stats/recipes, etc. on this stuff. The message 
              boards have threads about the imbued jewelry (I'm underwhelmed, 
              but at least my deity's gem finally makes ... something), stackable 
              velium &amp; mithril boning, etc. It's still going to take days/weeks 
              to verify that everything that was promised now works as planned. 
              To save a lot of duplication of effort, if you have verified something, 
              and you don't see it listed on the site as being verified/fixed, 
              post it to the message boards. This lets everyone else know that 
              it's working (or not, as the case may be), and saves me from multiple 
              pieces of email all saying basically the same thing.</p>
              <p><b>01/29/01</b>: I ended up NOT out of town 
              for the weekend, but still took a much-needed break from tradeskilling, 
              email and the message boards. It's gotten more than a little bit 
              crazed when I'm on my two primary personas, the sheer amount of 
              tells I'm getting from total strangers about the site, about the 
              new velium leathers, etc. While it's exciting to know my site is 
              so popular, it can be exhausting as well, especially when I'm in 
              the middle of a Hate raid, or something equally dangerous that requires 
              my full attention. To answer one of the more commonly asked questions: 
              No, I'm not selling my tailoring experiments right now, and I'm 
              not taking orders or setting prices, either. I'm sorry, but this 
              is far too much a time-eater right now, and my main focus is verifying 
              recipes, and then verifying stats on different pieces. Write down 
              those <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">recipes</a>, start the 
              hours of collecting all the pieces needed times ten, and find another 
              skilled tailor/smith/brewer to try it for you. You'll save yourself, 
              and me, a lot of extra grief. ;)</p>
            <p>Hopefully I'll get enough parts to verify a few more recipes in 
              the coming week. The tigeraptor is likely to be my main focus, thanks 
              to the foraging efforts of Tytania. Once I can snag several guildmates, 
              I also hope to have a couple more pieces of cobalt drake armor made 
              in the next week, and hopefully the monk boots. Rogue armor will 
              come as I manage to find haze panthers willing to drop their pelts.</p>
            <p>On another happy note, Niami is probably one of the most purple 
              female halflings on my server. I'd not realized how super rare female 
              halfling clerics were until I started randomly running amok in Hate. 
              She's got two more pieces to go, but if you see her up in Hate at 
              all in the coming week, it either means a) tradeskills got to be 
              too much again, or b) I got a chance I couldn't refuse. ;) </p>

              Site updates will be slow during that time. It may also give me 
              a chance to calm down more from a bad customer service experience 
              I had in-game, to where I can write up a proper complaint letter 
              instead of a flaming mad redheaded hissy fit.</p>
            <p>On a happier note, my personal thanks to my guild (<a href="haven/index.html">Voidrunners</a>, 
              on Tunare) for not only dealing with the crazed tailor-fest talk 
              in guildspeak, and their frenzied leader/DenMother, but also for 
              the massive, and I do mean massive, collection efforts. Thanks to 
              them, I was able to make many more attempts at armor today, and 
              got stats for several more monk pieces, and the rogue boots. (Droolific 
              boots ... makes me wish I had a rogue in my lineup.) Also thanks 
              to Tevren on Tunare for his kind financial &quot;sponsorship&quot; 
              of this experimentation. Hopefully he'll be pleased with the results.</p>
              <p><b>January 19:</b> A year ago today, EQ Traders Corner was considered 
              &quot;big&quot; enough to need a better message board, and the boards 
              were moved to EZ Board. The site was already about 9 months old 
              at that time, but still had a pretty small following. And I was 
              <i>still</i> kicking and screaming about making recipes available 
              on my site, since many folks still considered it a &quot;cheat&quot;.</p>
            <p>What a difference a year has made! There have been almost a half 
              million hits to <i>just</i> the message boards in that amount of 
              time. While traffic tracking on the website itself was hazy while 
              the site was hosted by Webcom, the numbers I did see were enough 
              to impress me. More recent surges in traffic, have, of course, increased 
              my workload yet again, and I am working on volunteers to take some 
              of the load off me.</p>
            <p>Recipes abound on the site now, and are regularly added to by an 
              active tradeskill community. These are not static recipes culled 
              from books and then forgotten, but recipes that are actively tested 
              and corrected by many folks across all the servers. I've been told 
              that it's likely the most complete and accurate collection on the 
              net. If this is true, then it's because of all you folks who stop 
              in, and take some time to add to the knowledge pool. I &quot;just&quot; 
              do the gruntwork of getting it all organized, run around testing 
              rumors and new stuff, and vent just like everyone else when I blow 
              several hundred plat only to find that a recipe that was supposed 
              to be patched is still broken.</p>
            <p>Several times I've hit tradeskill burnout, and almost given up, 
              not just on tradeskills, but on the site. However, we've built such 
              a wonderful supportive community here that it's been hard to stay 
              away. Yes, &quot;we&quot; have built ... I could not have done it 
              without all the information folks have helped cull, and, equally 
              important, all the warm fuzzies I've received from folks. While 
              I've received my share of annoyances from folks who would rather 
              tell bomb me in game insisting I teach them everything there is 
              to know about x, y, z while I'm in the middle of a dangerous hunt, 
              these have been counterbalanced by a LOT of lovely compliments and 
              moral support.</p>
            <p>Those of you who are active &quot;regulars&quot; on the boards 
              have proven to me what a strong, dedicated community EQ Traders 
              Corner really is. You come from every server, every race, every 
              class, joined together by a love/hate relationship with tradeskills. 
              You're, for the most part, well mannered, and willing to help out 
              others when they wander in with questions. (Really, all you newcomers, 
              it <i>is</i> ok to admit ignorance of tradeskills with this group, 
              we'll be gentle with you.) </p>
            <p>The rude snerts who wander through rarely last for long before 
              the regulars slap them down ... if I don't get to them first. Last 
              night, in fact, was the first time we had a serious case 100% inappropriate 
              personal attacks and outright filth in a post. It didn't last long, 
              and it's the first time I've used the EZBoard tools to block a user 
              from further posting. We are a tradeskill community. If you want 
              to do a personal flame against someone else, take it somewhere else, 
              as it has no benefit to us, and we just plain don't want to see 
              it. </p>
            <p><b>January 12: </b>Ouffff. The last several days have been exhausting, 
              to say the least, not only for myself, but my husband Adam. Round 
              one of the site redesign, and the move to site hosting under <a href="http://www.refplace.com">Refplace</a>. 
              Most of you folks won't even see this news update for a few days, 
              as we're still link-checking and such before doing the DNS change, 
              but it will be ready and waiting for you once everything goes &quot;live&quot;.</p>
            <p>A lot has been going on, in regards to the site, and there's still 
              plenty more to go. I appreciate everyone's patience as we get through 
              this set of growing pains, and look forward to providing you with 
              even more site enhancements as time goes on. Of course, as evidenced 
              by the message boards and my mailbox, I can't please everyone, and 
              no matter how hard I try, some small portion of folks are going 
              to complain because I don't have everything they want to see. Some 
              days it frustrates me, other days I just shrug and go on. I don't 
              put this much time and effort into this site for the ones who can 
              only complain, anyway ... I do it for the rest of you fabulous tradesfolk 
              who have enlivened the message boards, my mailbox, and the site, 
              with your comments, added information, suggestions, and just plain 
              &quot;warm fuzzies&quot;.</p>
            <p>Some of the holiday warm fuzzies came at just the right time, when 
              I was feeling pretty burnt out, and overwhelmed by the thought of 
              the site move (at the time I still had no &quot;home&quot; for it) 
              and the redesign. Lots of you helped in many ways, and a few bigger 
              emails really made me feel good about the site.</p>
            <p>First came Woody Hearn of <a href="http://www.gucomics.com">/gu 
              comics</a>. In the time that his site has been up, he's not only 
              had 2 million hits to his site, but made t-shirts from his more 
              well-known comics, and brought tears of laughter to myself and my 
              guild. It definitely helps add some perspective and humor to the 
              often-frustrating, but quite addictive, land of EverQuest. Little 
              had I known that he'd been a silent visitor to my site for longer 
              than he'd been doing /gu. His offer of artwork was gladly accepted 
              (the first pieces are currently up in the smithing and tailoring 
              portion of the Learn a Skill pages), and while I've been running 
              20 directions at once, I've got my eye on a few more pieces, and 
              have some ideas percolating that he may wish to turn into more comics.</p>
            <p>On the same day, came email from the wife of <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net" target="_new">Lum 
              the Mad</a>. It seems she is another another trade skill junkie 
              like myself. (&quot;Hello, my name is Niami DenMother and I am a 
              trade skill junkie.&quot;) While I didn't take her up on the site 
              hosting option, her warm fuzzies regarding the site were definitely 
              appreciated, and I'm sure we'll have many chats regarding trade 
              skills in days to come.</p>
            <p>Then came the mail from Rory from <a href="http://www.refplace.com" target="_new">Refplace</a>/<a href="http://www.eqportal.com" target="_new">EQPortal</a>, 
              with a site hosting offer that was too good to pass up. Turnaround 
              time has been wonderfully fast, and his help has been greatly appreciated. 
              He also hosts Fulcrum's Tinkering site, and the Tal Kor Jewelry 
              Academy (currently inactive, but a well done site).</p>
            <p>Yesterday came the happy news that the fledgling Fashion section 
              is going to be managed by my newly-appointed Fashion Editor, FeistyGirl. 
              (She made up the initial fashion pages, and has been hosting them 
              on her site until we could get settled in our new home. While she's 
              weaning herself away from EQ, she's volunteered to take on our cultural 
              fashion archive, and a <a href="mailto:fashion@eqtraders.com">mailbox</a> 
              should be set up shortly for submitting screen shots of cultural 
              armor.)</p>
            <p><b>January 6:</b> Happy Gnoll Ears! Um ... Gnu Fear ... um ... 
              something like that. The faster I go, the behinder I get, and while 
              I have the best of New Year's intentions to get caught up on things, 
              I know I'm likely to let a few things fall through the cracks. the 
              site hit another spurt of popularity, my mailbox is overflowing, 
              my old web hosting provider is no longer an option, and the site 
              will be moving and undergoing a redesign in the next few days. Thankfully, 
              the changes should be pretty seamless from a visitor point of view, 
              and you'll just wander here some day and find us with a slightly 
              new look, better navigation, and the same old URL.</p>
            <p>I had several folks offer webspace and hosting options and basically 
              got an offer that was too sweet to refuse. Advertising still may 
              be coming down the line, but won't be happening from day 1. When/if 
              the advertising becomes a reality, the message boards would have 
              to be moved, so that EQTC instead of EZBoard is making the profit 
              from my traffic, but we'll deal with that eventuality when/if it 
              happens.</p>
            <p> I <i>still</i> need to contact all the folks that volunteered 
              to do site work, and figure out who is going to help with what, 
              but it was hard to do much when I didn't know where the site was 
              going to be, etc. I hope to have email out to them this weekend 
              to coordinate things.</p>
            <p>The next news post you will see should be from the new webserver. 
              Wish me luck!</p>
            <p><b>December 17:</b> The front page has most of the news, but for 
              those of you who wandered here as well, I'm still here, I'm still 
              alive, but I'm beyond burnt out, and a bit overwhelmed by the sheer 
              volume of email and posts to be handled each week. Please have patience 
              as I try to catch up on things and I figure out what, if anything, 
              can be delegated.</p>
            <p><b>December 10:</b> Velious is here, and I'm ready to pull my hair 
              out. There's a TON of places to explore for new merchants, I was 
              backlogged badly before the new zones opened, and I am falling further 
              behind. Please a) have patience if things don't go up quickly, and 
              b) remember to provide full details when you find new merchants 
              or ground spawns. I'm trying to get my level 35 enchantress safely 
              over to some of the new merchants in out-of-the-way places, but 
              anyone who's been to Velious knows how agro everything is over there, 
              so it's a risky proposition. (My 51 shammie is much safer on the 
              exploration, but in places like the crystal caves, she's dubious, 
              with no quick way to raise her faction.)</p>
            <p>I also need to find, in the next few weeks (in between houseguests, 
              and more holiday travel) a new web hosting provider, and it sounds 
              like I'm going to need a passable amount of space if I'm going to 
              consider doing screen shots of a fashion archive. The site redesign 
              will likely be implemented during the server move, once I've got 
              a new hosting provider, and I am looking for advertisers as well. 
              (Yep, after not quite 2 years of funding this site out of my own 
              pocket as a one-person operation, I'm going to *try* to expand to 
              meet demand, which means I need to start having the site pay for 
              itself.)</p>
            <p>n the plus side of things however, Niami finally hit 49 in the 
              midst of all this chaos, and is cradling her brand-new ressurrection 
              spell gleefully. Woot.</p>
            <p><b>November 15:</b> The harder I work, the behinder I get. {gibber} 
              I'm definitely hitting tradeskill burnout, and I'm not as fast on 
              processing email and message board posts as I used to be ... so 
              of course, this patch added still more to update and change.</p>
            <p>As of about an hour after the servers came back up today, I can 
              tell you that: a) wood elves have mithril leather recipes now, but 
              not only is the book bugged on the servers (Yakatizma provided the 
              details until that can be fixed), but also the recipe for the fier'dal 
              sewing kit is also bugged; b) halflings have cultural leathers as 
              well, but we've not figured out all parts of the recipes yet; c) 
              trivials for fine steel have changed and we don't know new numbers 
              yet (there was a difference in trivials for the various sizes before 
              this patch); d) I've heard nothing on any of the reported new ring 
              combinations or the ornate chain. Updates will be provided as we 
              get them.</p>
            <p><b>October 30:</b> It's been a busy several weeks, and while the 
              insanity has slowed down to a dull roar, I expect there to be more 
              changes to things after tomorrow's patch. I'm still a bit behind 
              on some of the nigglies, and we're still working on redesign ideas, 
              but we'll get there.</p>
            <p>We've got a lovely new poison guide in place at long last. I've 
              also got a jewelcraft and pottery submission that I still need to 
              process, and hope to get them up soon.</p>
            <p>A couple folks have responded to our logo contest, but we've not 
              found anything that leaps out and grabs us yet. My hubby has joined 
              Brynne in working on reworking the navigation (buttons, etc.) and 
              other basic content style changes while I'm still scrambling to 
              keep all the information current. Once we're ready to release that 
              portion of the redesign, I'll be banned from site updates for a 
              couple days while they work their magic.</p>
            <p>n the meantime, however, <b>some recipe/location pages are changing 
              daily</b>, so if your printouts are more than a week old, they may 
              not have all the current information. That's the price of progress, 
              I fear.</p>
            <p>The ornate chain book for the "anysmith" chain has been found, 
              but it's still got us stumped. Folks on the test server report a 
              LOT of ring recipes that don't currently work on the live servers, 
              but they're still stumped on finding a working recipe. We don't 
              know how much tomorrow's patch will help, but one can always hope. 
              Discussion/debate/moans/wails and whimpers, plus probably a few 
              primal screams here and there, can be found on the message boards. 
              I've pulled all the ornate chain threads into their own forum to 
              make it easier to sort through.</p>
            <p><b>October 13:</b> Fishing lure recipes were put in place a few 
              days ago, thanks to feedback from many intrepid fishermen. We're 
              still trying to figure out if the lures grant any advantages in 
              fishing, so keep an eye on the DenMother's Corner section of the 
              message board for details. After a bad insomnia night, I decided 
              to tackle splitting the new smithed armor stats and smithed weapon 
              stats off onto their own pages. Not all info is there yet, but it's 
              a definite step in the right direction. Anyone out there want to 
              compile a similar list of stats for the various tailored armors? 
              :)</p>
            <p>Brynne is back! After many months of silence as she's been busy 
              with other projects, my web designer has come out of hiding and 
              is working on a totally new redesign for this site (we all agree 
              it's kind of ... blah ... after a while.) While I've asked her to 
              make sure that things still print nicely (a necessity with many 
              of the recipes and trade supply lists), I've basically turned her 
              loose to see what my evil twin will come up with for ideas. She's 
              asked for help in coming up with a new logo for the site, and while 
              we can't promise anything more than our eternal thanks, it may give 
              some budding graphics designer a nice resume builder. Contest rules 
              can be found here.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that I'm generally spending a couple hours per 
              day, on average, just processing email and posts from the site. 
              This not only cuts down on my testing time, and my play time, but 
              means I have a lot less "oomph" to personally answer every single 
              email and post. Thanks for your understanding on this if your email 
              is one that didn't get a personal (or timely) response.</p>
            <p>I've received a couple lovely trade skill guides recently, and 
              hope to have them on the site next week. I still need an hour or 
              so of quite time to read them all thoroughly, and then time to format 
              them, etc.</p>
            <p><b>September 30:</b> New non-alcoholic brewing recipes have been 
              found in a newly-added recipe book.(Thanks, Ikipu!) Experimentation 
              has already verified several more recipes, based on the guidelines 
              provided within it. As more recipes are verified, the brewing recipes 
              page will grow. Wood elves now have a cultural forge and a few recipes 
              for mithril weapons have been determined (thanks, Snowscale!) Slowly, 
              we're getting information on various cultural smithing items (stats, 
              recipe verifications, etc.) Sometimes the recipes pages will change 
              hourly, as I try to get you the most up-to-date information. A good 
              rule of thumb before you're about to sign on for a trade skill session 
              is to check the recipes page first, then quickly browse through 
              the message boards, in case there's something on there I've not 
              had a chance to web yet.</p>
            <p>My mailbox and the message board are still very active with recipe 
              corrections and additions. However, I'm starting to notice a disturbing 
              trend. I've received several emails and seen several posts announcing 
              something "new" or something "broken", when they *correct* information 
              has been on my site for several days (or longer). I can't control 
              what other sites put up for recipes <grin>, so if you find something 
              that doesn't work, be sure you got the information from my site 
              before you report it to me. If my site has it wrong, by all means, 
              let me know so I can fix it! :)</p>
            <p><b>September 27:</b> The patch was finally completed, and yours 
              truly went on a sleep deprivation binge in order to get new, correct, 
              information onto the site. There are still missing recipes, the 
              cultural recipes section needs cleaning up, etc., but a LOT of information 
              is now available. We now have fully verified temper recipes from 
              numerous sources, we know which dye extracts are currently not working, 
              other recipes and rumors are being chased down, and the dust is 
              finally settling. I'm working on a page that will show what the 
              various dyes look like, and will be starting housekeeping on the 
              cultural recipes, so that the individual pages are easier to read. 
              Any new smithing recipes that are not cultural in origin (limited 
              to being made by a specific race), will be on the advanced smithing 
              page. A LOT of active discussion is going on in the message boards, 
              including talk of fishing and possible uses for the tacklebox, a 
              discussion of Cabilis hints on some unique recipes over there, folks 
              trying to sort out the entire enchant/imbue concept as it applies 
              to armor, etc., etc. Stop on over, ask a question, share your knowledge 
              ... the more we share, the more we all can learn about new recipes 
              that are being discovered almost daily.</p>
            <p>My many, many, thanks to all who have helped make this huge patch 
              more manageable. From adopting zones and checking merchants, to 
              posting recipes, to providing feedback on trivials and broken recipes 
              and more, your help is making this site a truly useful resource 
              to folks working on tradeskills. Keep up the lovely work!</p>
