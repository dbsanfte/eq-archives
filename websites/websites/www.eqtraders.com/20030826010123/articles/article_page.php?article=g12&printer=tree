<p>
<p>
Some of these guides are meant as extremely basic introductions to a particular tradeskill, others will be far more complex. While some will be geared towards power-skilling, others will be aimed for those with limited finances.  I can't promise we'll have something of interest to everyone, but the offerings here should be good to get you started.
</p>
<p>
We've just added a tradeskill guide editor, but have called a halt to adding new guides to the site until the database is settled into place. Please pardon our dust, and feel free to drop by the Tradeskill Guides forum to see what other guides are in the works
</p>
<p>
If you are totally new to tradeskills, you will first wish to check out the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g7&menustr=030000000000">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> and read Niami's <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g113&menustr=040000000000">"Before you Start"</a> article. It should answer some of the more basic questions and brace you for the fascinating but often-frustrating world of tradeskills.
