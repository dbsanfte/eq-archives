            <h3> Dark Courage (Zek-bane Weapons) Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>The god of War (Rallos Zek), is a very difficult opponent indeed. 
              Special weapons have been found that grant the wielder extra damange 
              versus Rallos Ze <i>and</i> his many minions in the Plane of Tactics. 
              Several folks have worked very hard to solve the quests, based on 
              very sketchy in-game hints. These items, of course, require the 
              Planes of Power expansion. 
            <p>There are two types of Zek bane weapons, and there are at least 
              six varieties of each (1HS, 2HS, 1HB, Hand to Hand, 1H Piercing, 
              and Archery). Each variety of the first type is called &quot;Dark 
              Courage,&quot; regardless of which version you make. The second 
              type, which is made by forging your Dark Courage with a special 
              temper to turn it into a Black Insanity, is identical to the first 
              but with higher bane damage vs. Zek. 
            <p>The source for the original information comes from NPC Eriak, an 
              ogre located deep in the Plane of Tactics. He responds differently 
              based on which of the Zek flags you have completed at the time. 
              Original hail text is not available. 
            <p>The initial out-of-game spoiler, based on much research, <a href="pop_zekbane_poem.htm">was 
              provided in poem form to the EQTC message board community</a>. The 
              author of the poem has kindly provided the following information: 
            <p><b>Additional hail text from Szrix Hammertail in Plane of Knowledge:</b>
            <p>You say, 'What Dark Courage?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail stares at you long and hard. 'Long ago I escaped 
              imprisonment from Drunder, such things I saw there I would not wish 
              to think of again. Never again would I even think of speaking of 
              Drunder was it not for the favor owed to the Lord of Guile. The 
              task he set to me I accomplished to a degree. I was able to obtain 
              the materials Eriak spoke of through much difficulty. I was also 
              able to create a set of weaponry that will do much harm to the Warlord. 
              Should you wish to test your skill I may be <i>(note: Yes, it does 
              just cut off there.) </i>
            <p>You say, 'I wish to test my skill.' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail glares at you. 'Very well Khoren, I will teach 
              you. Combining Decorin ore and a flask of water in a forge makes 
              the base metal of Drunder. Ye then need a temper brewed for the 
              weaponry. Find the shards of valor and decant their essence with 
              a celestial solvent. Based on what type of weapon ye desire is the 
              mold that is needed. Do you wish to craft a Sword, a Bastard Sword, 
              a Claidhmore, a Battlehammer, a Ulak, a Dagger or a Bow? </p>
            <p>You say, 'What sword?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the sword, combine Drunder's steel, 
              pulsing blue vial, long blade mold, hilt mold, and a pommel mold 
              in a forge. This will make a weapon that will cause some worry to 
              the Zeks.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'What bastard?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the bastard sword, combine Drunder's 
              steel, pulsing blue vial, dual-edged blade mold, hilt mold, and 
              pommel mold in a forge. This will make a weapon that will cause 
              some worry to the Zeks <b><i>(note: You must ask him &quot;What 
              bastard?&quot; to learn about the bastard sword. If you ask him 
              &quot;What bastard sword?&quot; or &quot;What bastardsword,&quot; 
              you get the response for &quot;Sword.&quot; I assume the bastard 
              sword is the 1H knight version, but I haven't seen one, and it's 
              not Magelo'ed. Maybe I'll magelo one tonight, but I have only very 
              few sheets left.)</i></b></p>
            <p>You say, 'What ulak?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the ulak, combine Drunder's steel, 
              pulsing blue vial, pommel mold, short blade mold, and a hilt mold 
              in a forge. This will make a weapon that will cause some worry to 
              the Zeks.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'What battlehammer?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the battlehamme, combine Drunder's 
              steel, pulsing blue vial, mace head mold, and an oak shaft in a 
              forge. This will make a weapon that will cause some worry to the 
              Zeks.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'What claidhmore?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the claidhmore, combine Drunder's 
              steel, pulsing blue vial, heavy steel blade mold, hilt mold, and 
              a pommel mold in a forge. This will make a weapon that will cause 
              some worry to the Zeks.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'What bow?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the bow, combine Drunder's steel, 
              pulsing blue vial and a file in a forge. This will make a weapon 
              that will cause some worry to the Zeks.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'What dagger?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail says 'To make the dagger, combine Drunder's steel, 
              pulsing blue vial, dagger blade mold, and a hilt mold in a forge. 
              This will make a weapon that will cause some worry to the Zeks.' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'What black insanity?' <br>
              Szrix Hammertail hisses at you as if about to attack. 'Won't you 
              let me be! Torment me no more about memories of the past! This is 
              the last bit I shall tell you then hope to never see you again. 
              Combine any of the weapons with a substance made from decanting 
              the black blood, insanity fangs and celestial solvent. The weapons 
              made thusly will cause even the Warlord to flinch at the thought 
              of facing them. <b>All but the bow must be made in a forge, combine 
              the bow and the substance in a fletching kit. </b><br>
            </p>
            <p><b>DARK COURAGE </b></p>
            <p>To make a Dark courage, you must forge: <br>
              -drunder's steel (stackable, non-lore) <br>
              -a plusing blue vial (stackable, non-lore) <br>
              -appropriate molds to create the specific variety of Dark Courage 
              you want </p>
            <p>Trivial for this combine is between 11 and 28, and appears to be 
              a no-fail combine.</p>
            <p><b>Drunder's Steel </b><br>
              Drunder's Steel is made in a forge (verified to work in a Tanaan 
              forge, not tried in an older-expansion forge) by combining: <br>
              -Decorin Ore Shard <br>
              -Water Flask </p>
            <p>Decorin Ore Shards (non-stackable, LORE, NO DROP), come from Animated 
              Decorin Blades, which spawn only after Tagrin Maldric, the giant 
              troll in the depths of Tactics, has been aggro'ed. They continue 
              to spawn for the duration of the Tagrin fight, but it has been my 
              experience that only the first several will drop ore shards. We 
              have never been able to get more than 6 ore shards in one attempt 
              (although it's possible we had a few blades carrying ore shards 
              despawn) before all the rest of the blades dropped nothing but a 
              &quot;Useless Hunk of Metal&quot; (which really is useless, at least 
              as far as Zek banery goes). You don't actually have to fight Tagrin 
              to get blades to spawn, since their spawning is only tied to his 
              being aggroed, and they don't despawn immediately if he calms down 
              (making use of this tidbit of information is left as an exercise 
              for the reader). But there still seems to be a limit on the number 
              of shards you can get at one time. In an hour we got 6, and then 
              for two hours we a constant stream of useless hunks. In that time, 
              Tagrin had been aggroed and deaggroed dozens of times. Eventually, 
              we got tired and killed him. :p </p>
            <p>The steel is trivial at 200, and is not trivial at 193. It was 
              failed at 135, and succesfully made at 193. I have not failed in 
              14 sheets at 250. This means a high skill smith will have to loot 
              these NODROP, LORE items. The decorin blade corpses rot in 8 minutes. 
              You may want to take a lot of smiths. Or, if you're very clever, 
              you may be interested to know that player corpses (regular or duel-created) 
              return to the nice, safe zone-in/zone-out of Tactics in about 21 
              minutes, and that having a lore item on a corpse doesn't mean you 
              can't loot another. </p>
            <p><b>A Pulsing Blue Vial </b><br>
              This is made by combining, in a brew barrel (trivial &lt;=165): 
              <br>
              -valorium shards (stackable, no-drop, NON-lore) <br>
              -celestial solvent </p>
            <p>Valorium Shards come from just about everything in the desert in 
              the Plane of Valor. </p>
            <p>Known Mold Combinations:<br>
              Dark Courage (1H Piercing version): Hilt Mold, Dagger Blade Mold 
              <br>
              Dark Courage (2H Slashing version): Hilt Mold, Heavy Steel Blade 
              Mold </p>
            <p><b>BLACK INSANITY </b></p>
            <p>Black Insanities are nicer than Dark Courages since they have higher 
              bane damage. To make all of them but the bow, you must forge: <br>
              -your Dark Courage <br>
              -a pulsing black vial </p>
            <p>Again, this is trivial at 11, non-trivial at 28, and is probably 
              a no-fail combine. The bow must be made in a fletching kit.</p>
            <p><b>A Pulsing Black Vial </b><br>
              To make this last temper, you must combine in a brew barrel: <br>
              -insanity fangs (stackable, no-drop, NON-lore) <br>
              -celestial solvent <br>
              -A vial of black blood (NODROP, LORE) </p>
            <p>Insanity fangs come from any of the four types of constructs in 
              the plane of Torment. This combine is trivial &lt;=162</p>
            <p>A vial of black blood comes from Eriak deep in Tactics (in the 
              same room as Tagrin, in fact, right where the basement zone out 
              is). Ask him &quot;What Blood?&quot; and he'll give it to you. Remember, 
              it's NODROP and LORE, but the pulsing black vial is droppable. How 
              to get enough of these to your people with the nodrop insanity fangs 
              is left as an exercise to the reader. A rogue with shroud of stealth 
              who loots insanity fangs will have a particularly easy time. You 
              may or may not have to be a good brewer for this step. </p>
            <p>------------ </p>
            <p>Combines, in Brief: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>PULSING BLUE VIAL: Brew Barrel: Valorium Shards + Celestial 
                Solvent </li>
              <li>PULSING BLACK VIAL: Brew Barrel: Insanity Fangs + A vial of 
                black blood + Celestial Solvent </li>
              <li>DRUNDER'S STEEL: Forge: Decorin Ore Shard + Water Flask </li>
              <li>DARK COURAGE: Forge: Pulsing Blue Vial + Drunder's Steel + Appropriate 
                Molds </li>
              <li>BLACK INSANITY: Forge: Dark Courage + Pulsing Black Vial </li>
            </ul>
