              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Today's patch 
              has many lovely little tidbits for tradeskillers, especially shaman 
              alchemists. My comments are in italics after the various items:</font> 
            <blockquote>
              <p>- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): 
                Shadeweaver Portal. - <i>recipe has been found, and is <a href="secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm">up 
                on the site </a></i><br>
                - Renamed one of two items called Figwort. The Figwort sold in 
                Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion. 
                - <i>the Gulon's Impunity alchemy potion will now use ground figwort</i><br>
                - Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk. The Drachling 
                Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid 
                Silk. - <i>these are two Kunark forages that have been annoying 
                due to having the same name. They're currently still only vendor-fodder, 
                but at least they have unique names! </i><br>
                - Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes. 
                These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye 
                intact when killed. - <i>this should allow shammies to now make 
                the Assailing alchemy potion</i><br>
                - Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Soul of Incorporeal&quot; 
                to use a &quot;feather&quot;. <i>- finally, a use for foraged 
                feathers!! </i><br>
                - Fixed the recipe for the potion &quot;Troll's Essence&quot;. 
                <i>- it's been broken forever, but this old alchemy potions should 
                actually work!</i><br>
                - Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent 
                with their single dose versions - <i>several of the potions listed 
                as &quot;Luclin potions&quot; on our alchemy recipes page had 
                a cast time of 30.0 for the charged versions, but lower cast times 
                for the singles. The charged versions should now have the lesser 
                cast times of their single-dose kin</i><br>
                - General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he 
                was having a problem crossing in the past. - <i>8th shawl questers, 
                rejoice! If the silly little General can remember his new route, 
                he should no longer get stuck under the ice floes and lose his 
                way! </i><br>
                - Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of 
                planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable. 
                - <i>erudite tailors, wood elven fletchers, folks making blessed 
                fishing poles and others should be happy with this. If folks can 
                post verification of these, I'll update the database accordingly</i><br>
                - Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable. -<i> tinkers 
                rejoice! Since this little item is not only used in a quest, but 
                in two other recipes, it's been impossible for younger gnomes 
                to get access to this.</i><br>
                - Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents. 
                <i>- potions that don't use reagents are happy things!</i><br>
                - Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability. 
                - <i><a href="secrets/recipes_trophies.htm">Grandmaster's Medicine 
                Bag</a> has been made! Many thanks to Frizznik for convincing 
                Jolum to give up information that he's temporarily forgotten - 
                Thursday's patch should see the hail text in place on the live 
                servers, as well as the ammo slot added to the trophy itself.</i></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With so many 
              of these changes being related to alchemy, it would likely be good 
              to dive into the old Letters of Jonas alchemy books, and see how 
              they have been changed/updated to reflect this information. My many 
              thanks to Verdandi for putting together a &quot;laundry list&quot; 
              of things outright broken/bugged with alchemy, as it looks like 
              it's helped pinpoint, and address, several outstanding problems. 
              <i>(My thanks also go to the folks who put in these fixes as it's 
              a good step in the right direction at addressing several nigglies).</i>

              morning did not fix the problem, and we're still crossing our fingers 
              that someone over at the phpBB support forums will have some insights 
              into exactly what's going awry. I suspect I'll have several more 
              grey hairs interspersed with the red before all this is sorted out, 
              and I know it's frustrating for our very active message board community 
              as well. The problems last week with the boards turned out to be 
              due to some other site running on the same machine as our message 
              boards, but this time it's something awry with our software or the 
              message board databse. ... bleargh!!</font>

              it is a problem with the software (I doubt many have tested phpBB

              with the server software or the new hardware. (The boards were very 
              recently moved to yet another machine.) I'm more than ready to pull 
              my hair out over it, and I'm sure some of you are as well. As we

              so it doesn't scan well, but at least it is some acknowledgement 
              that the holiday season is in full swing. Whether your main holiday 
              was over days ago, or if that day of days is just finishing ... 
              whether you celebrate New Year's in a week, or whether your new 
              year follows a Chinese calendar, you're likely around a lot of folks 
              that are celebrating <i>something</i> right now. So, I have to be 
              properly mom-ish right now, and say a few things:</font> 
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">May your 
                holiday season be a safe and joyous one. Regardless of the stresses 
                of everyday life, remember to take time now and then to savor 
                the company of those around you.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember 
                there are real people behind those characters you run into in-game. 
                Just because the game isn't &quot;real life&quot;, don't forget 
                that the people behind those players are very real, and your in-game 
                actions have the chance to hurt, or help, other people.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember 
                that practicing real-life alcohol tolerance and driving don't 
                mix. Remember that others may/will forget this fact, and be extra 
                careful when traveling. Generally, those irresponsible in their 
                partying seem more likely to hurt innocents than they are to hurt 
                themselves.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember, 
                there is no &quot;rez plz&quot; in real life.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember 
                to take time out to just plain have fun now and then. It helps 
                you keep perspective.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember 
                that random acts of kindness <i>DO</i> come back to surprise you 
                now and then; so, whether in-game or out, surprising someone &quot;just 
                because&quot; with a kind word, an ambush buffing, etc. really 
                <i>does</i> make an impact, even if you don't see the direct result 
                of it.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember 
                that compliments cost nothing, and that criticism can do more 
                damage than expected. So when your group actually manages to survive 
                when something goes badly wrong, throwing in comments about what 
                was done <i>right</i> can help ease the blow of the inevitable 
                commentary about what was done wrong. This, of course, applies 
                to the real world as well, but after having someone in a pick 
                up group last night actually making an effort to praise stellar 
                crowd control, it rememinded me that too often we're silent when 
                things go right, and very noisy when things go wrong.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember 
                to pamper yourself now and then. If <i>you</i> can't expend the 
                effort to spoil yourself, why should you expect that anyone else 
                will either?</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Remember

              like the code tweak needed so that phpbb properly tracks what you've 
              really read, and what you haven't read, was never stress tested 
              with the sort of load that we see on a regular basis, nor for the 
              sheer number of boards that we have. So, yes, things are beyond 
              sludged right now, and I apologize for that. We have a couple options 
              from this point, and we'll be looking at those alternatives carefully 
              over the next day or two. One alternative would be to back out the 
              tweak that uses the proper &quot;read&quot; indexing, and go back 
              to it using your last visited timestamp to determine what you may/may 
              not have read. I don't really like that alternative, personally, 
              as I like to process posts from the boards in manageable chunks. 
              The second alternative is to get rid of the Marketplace forums. 
              This would <i>more</i> than halve the hits to the database as the 
              main forum listing was generated, given the sheer number of servers 
              there are these days. I really don't like that one, either, but 
              it may be something we need to consider. Another alternative, which 
              opens up issues with seeing if one registered user list can be shared 
              between two separate message boards, is to make the Marketplace 
              a separate message board.</font>

            <p> 
            <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Today has been 
            a &quot;quiet&quot; day with respect to tradeskills and the patch. 
            There are a couple things to mention, however. A couple (or more, 
            we're still waiting on reports regarding the others) of the PoP pottery 
            items have had a recommended level flag added to them, as well as 
            the addition of being range-wieldable (woohoo!) There also may be 
            an issue with faction in Crystal Caverns. Those cantankerous dwarves 
            in there can't seem to make up their minds, and while they REALLY 
            dislike all those annoying orcs in &quot;their&quot; caverns, killing 
            the orcs themselves now results in <i>negative</i> faction with the 
            Froststone dwarves. I suspect this will be fixed relatively quickly. 
            <p>We would like to thank everyone for your patience and tremendous 
              support as we made the switch to the new message boards. It's still 
              going to be a bit awkward until the dust settles some more and we 
              can get past the glaring issues to fine tune the less critical settings 
              (in between keeping up with the flow of new information for the 
              site!) Your patience and continued cooperation are much appreciated! 
              In the end, all the effort should be well worth being able to host 
              the community far more economically. 
            <p>That said, we would like to offer our thanks to the folks at EZBoards 
              for their hosting of our message board community for close to three 
              years. While the time has come for us to move on, EZBoards were 
              the home where our community grew and thrived, up to this point. 
              They still have much to offer communities that may not have the 
              time, interest, or technical know-how to create and host their own 
              boards. <i>(As well as for those communities, such as my server's 
              boards, where folks seem more willing to put up with popups than 
              they are to contribute cash to support the boards.)</i> We hope 
              that the Everquest community does not see our change of venue as 
              an indication that we are in any way dissatisfied with the quality 
              of their services - we'd just rather spend more of our own time 
              and effort, and less of our cash! Thank you and fond farewells, 
              Vanchau and crew!</p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With the chaos 
              that has abounded IRL due to PoP launch, the Fan Faire, the grand 
              opening of the House Ogre's comics and gaming shop (last Friday!), 
              my strep throat and whiplash, I've delayed on this annoucement until 
              the last minute, as I needed some breathing time before doing final 
              tweaks to the [<a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/index.php">new 
              message board</a>]. You ask, 'What new message board?'</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many of you 
              likely remember us mentioning our desire to explore other message 
              board options, after we saw how much renewal for our EZBoard Gold 
              membership was going to cost. We had a lot of folks approach us 
              with different alternatives, including the folks at Mazevo, and 
              the EZBoard folks also worked hard to come up with a more viable 
              option for us. Fortunately, we had enough in the Community Chest 
              to extend the board Gold status to cover the PoP launch chaos, but 
              that extension is about to expire. After a lot of deliberation and 
              price comparisons, and our very strong desire to keep the boards 
              and site as ad free as possible, we've decided to host the boards 
              with our site hosting provider, and run phpBB. While it <i>does</i> 
              mean a lot of chaos for the next little while, as folks get their 
              registrations set up, etc., if board traffic stays relatively stable, 
              it will cost us about 25% of what our Gold renewal would cost. I 
              suspect that the actual numbers may be closer to 50% if the current 
              growth curve continues, but it's still a hefty amount of money.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I fully realize 
              this means everyone needs to register for yet another message board, 
              and re-do your preferences for sigs, etc. It will also mean that 
              custom posting titles will be pretty much MIA for the time being, 
              and that those of you who earned titles due to post count tallies 
              may not be happy about having to re-earn titles all over again. 
              Much as I am sorry for the extra chaos this causes for everyone, 
              better that chaos than a) ads all over the place, or b) me deciding 
              this is costing too much time and money and throwing in the towel. 
              (Really, I don't want to do 'b'. I very much don't want to do that, 
              and I've turned down some very blunt cash offers for the site ownership 
              recently. I will not do that to this community ... but I am <i>very</i> 
              burnt out IRL, and I'm very much dreading the hubub that's going

              and I have safely returned from the San Francisco Fan Faire. It 
              was a fun, if tiring weekend. While the weather was not the greatest, 
              we did manage to squeeze some time in at Muir Woods (yes, I hugged 
              a redwood), and crossed the Golden Gate Bridge (though we couldn't 
              even see the top of the bridge through the fog). I also met various 
              EQ community leaders, including <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com" target="_new">Allakhazam</a>,

              and various VI personalities I've interacted with electronically, 
              including Absor, Axgoreth, Frizznik, and Lyndro. (I also, of course, 
              spoke with Yakatizma, but we'd already been acquainted due to the 
              San Diego Fan Faire a while back.) I met a lot of great folks from 
              the EQTC boards, though I suspect that by the end of Saturday, I 
              likely had a slightly glazed look in my eye from all the names and 
              faces that flashed before me. At long last, I also finally got to 
              make good on a long-ago promise to bring &quot;Ester the Tester&quot; 
              chocolate. (After, of course, buying a second bar of the dark chocolate 
              with rapsberries for myself, to assure it was worthy of eating!) 
              While I had to start camping the line for the 6 pm Tradeskill panel 
              at 5 pm due to the two earlier sessions being filled to capacity, 
              I'm going to leave it to someone else to post some of the information 
              from the panel that I attended (as well as the 2 earlier full ones).

                affect them. If you're an EZBoard community supporter, you will 
                still be able to use HTML in your board sig files. If you have 
                not signed up directly with EZBoards to be a community supporter, 
                you will no longer be able to use HTML code in your sig files. 
                This is why you're seeing a lot of ugly code in some people's 
                posts instead of their old sig files. Read the <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/releasenotes/releasenotes_v70.html">release 
                notes</a> for more details, specifically the link about security 
                changes. There is also information there about added EZCode functionality 
                for those who need/want to convert their sig file into EZCode. 
                <i>(Also note that becoming an EZBoard community supporter means 
                that ALL EZBoard Gold communities will no longer be charged for 
                your visits to their boards, as well as making you ad-free when 
                you visit non-Gold communities.)</i></font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Currently, 
                EQTC is &quot;playing it by ear&quot; with regards to EZBoard 
                Gold renewal. The folks at EZBoards were kind enough to give us 
                a 1-month extension on our current subscription based on what 
                was in the community chest (which is separate from the paypal 
                donations that folks are sending donations to in order to help 
                pay for site costs), so we didn't have to worry about either renewing, 
                or moving to a new home for the boards in the middle of the PoP 
                chaos. This will give us a bit of breathing space to see what 
                EZBoards can/will offer us with regards to renewal, or prep for 
                moving to php boards via our site host.</font></li>

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Today marked 
              the day when the Planes of Power expansion went live. While I didn't

              you'll agree that the time was well-spent.</font>

              the following in their patch message, little did we know that this

            <blockquote> 
              <p>One of the new features included in the Planes of Power is a 
                new way for NPCs deal with Player Characters. It allows NPCs to 
                recognize certain actions taken by player characters. This may 
                mean that an NPC will not be interested in talking to you until 
                you've accomplished a certain task or until certain events have 
                occurred. So some NPCs may not have much to say to you upon your 
                first meeting, but might be more talkative later. This can also 
                apply to events and locations that might react differently to 
                a character that has accomplished a task than to one that has 
                not.</p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Various folk 
              have been running around hailing NPCs in Plane of Knowledge, and 
              it seems that they've received different responses based on if they 
              were a grandmaster (or near-grandmaster) in a specific tradeskill, 
              or if they had no or low skill. So, after seeing what recipes were 
              posted in the PoP Data forum, I broke out my horde of tradeskillers 
              and tried to fill in the gaps.</font>

              fish to be cataloged, vendors to be cross-referenced, etc., but
