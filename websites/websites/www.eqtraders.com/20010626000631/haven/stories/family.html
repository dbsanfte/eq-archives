        Stuff of Dreams</b> - by Triptych</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Having grown up as 
        an unwanted, spurned Tier'dal had given <a href="../bios/triptych.htm">Triptych</a> 
        a consuming need to be wanted, to be loved. The Spiritwalkers, with their 
        open acceptance of who she was, and their open support of who she could 
        become, had filled that need nicely. They were her family -- all the family 
        she'd wanted, or needed, until recently.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now, she was faced 
        with the fact that much of what she had been told of her past was lies. 
        She was faced with blood kin she knew nothing about, and she was deeply 
        disturbed. She also had a sinking feeling that the worst of the surprises 
        was yet to come ...</font></p>
      <p>~~~~</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It had started with 
        a dream. Not just any dream, but one of those dreams that left her pounding 
        her sleeping mat with frustration. It left her with the feeling that if 
        she'd had just a moment longer in the dream, she could have figured out 
        what it was trying to tell her.</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Child of darkness, 
          child of light, child that's neither day nor night </font><br>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Three perspectives 
          on one soul, while apart will ne'er be whole </font><br>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Magics lull, enchantments 
          blind, godless spirits you cannot bind </font><br>
          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To break this spell 
          they must be one, only then is it undone.</font> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For weeks the voice 
        had echoed repeatedly in Trip's dreams, always reciting that same verse. 
        Accompanying it were three faces. One was her own. One looked just like 
        her, only the face had green eyes instead of violet. The third was blurred, 
        obscured, and try as she might, she could never quite focus on it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At first, Trip thought 
        the dream meant that she had in her the capacity to be good, evil, and 
        neutral, and that she had to merge these three faces of hers into one. 
        However, evil had <i>never</i> lured her, and, much to the chagrin of 
        her foster-parents, she'd not been very good at neutrality either. So, 
        she'd continued to wonder and worry ... until a fateful day in West Karana.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After that, she had 
        a completely new set of worries and puzzles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She'd traveled to 
        the western portion of the Karanas to see about ridding the area of some 
        of the bandits that plagued travelers there. An elder enchantress had 
        been there, and Triptych paused to exchange pleasantries with the woman.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As she prepared to 
        camp for the evening, she noticed a Spiritwalker that she'd never met 
        before, and stopped to say hello to Theolandra. Violet eyes met green, 
        and both wore mirroring images of befuddlement as they stared into a face 
        that looked familiar. Too familiar. A face that, other than the eye color, 
        they'd seen every time they stared at their reflection in a still pool 
        of water or a mirror. While Triptych appeared to have been through a bit 
        more hardening in real-world experiences, Theo seemed to have the more 
        jaded outlook on life.</font></p>
      <p>~~ </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An hour later, Triptych 
        was still reeling as many of her basic beliefs lay shattered all around 
        her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">... She'd believed 
        that she was a pure dark elf. Now she found that her father was a high 
        elf enchanter who'd worked powerful enough magics to not only deceive 
        her mother, but also ones powerful enough that Triptych appeared to be 
        a dark elf, and was treated as such for all intents and purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">... She'd believed 
        that she was an only child. Now she found that she had two other sisters, 
        neutral and evil, as counterparts to her own good nature. Triplets.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">... She'd believed 
        that her mother simply hadn't wanted her due to the demands of her position 
        as high priestess of Innoruuk. Now she found that she'd been discarded 
        due to a curse that had been proclaimed at her birth ... and that her 
        mother had actually kept one child with her, to feed her on the evil and 
        hatred so central to her religion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">... She'd believed 
        that the Spiritwalkers would be the only &quot;family&quot; tie she would 
        ever truly acknowledge. (She never really counted her foster parents as 
        family, and knew they felt the same about her.) Now she found herself 
        acknowledging her neutral sister, Theolandra, as blood kin ... and learned 
        of the existence of her blood father, Mith, as well. A father that Theo 
        had grown up with.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It had taken them 
        a while to compare notes, and to accept what the facts were telling them, 
        but finally accept it they did. The evidence was just too strong: matching 
        birth dates, matching mother's name, matching dreams that recited the 
        contents of the &quot;curse&quot; ... not to mention the fact that they 
        looked exactly alike other than eye color. It didn't take long for them 
        to jump to the next obvious conclusion about which of them was the &quot;child 
        of light&quot; and which was the one that was &quot;neither day nor night&quot;. 
        Trip's reputation as a &quot;nice&quot; dark elf was growing day by day, 
        whereas Theo couldn't seem to fully understand the loyalty, nay, the love, 
        that Trip had for the Spiritwalkers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That led to wonder 
        and worry about the third triplet, the &quot;child of darkness&quot;. 
        Had she been informed of their existence by their mother, or had she, 
        too, been kept in the dark about the circumstances surrounding their birth? 
        Was she truly a child of darkness, filled with evil and hatred?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych was filled 
        with curiousity, not only about her reputedly aloof father, but also about 
        the third triplet. She believed in her heart that nobody was irredeemable 
        ... not even Morrighan ... and couldn't conceive of her sister <i>NOT</i> 
        wanting to meet them and to learn more about them. Perhaps it was time 
        to take a visit back to Neriak ...</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="revelations"></a>Revelations</b> 
        - by Theolandra</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Theo 
        stretched as she awoke from her rest. Rubbing her eyes after a long night 
        of studying, she almost went back to sleep. But that was when the message 
        came, that her sister Triptych needed to talk to her.<br>
        <br>
        A faint note of worry ran through her as she remembered their last conversation, 
        cut short by the yawns and the fact that she couldn't concentrate on what 
        her sister was trying to say. Sister, Theo thought, I have a sister, two 
        sisters if Trip is correct. Definitely a far cry from what Father told 
        me. Theo sighed and prepared herself to go meet her sister.<br>
        <br>
        Upon entering the area of West Karana, Theo thought it best to cast an 
        illusion in case she ran across any of the residents. She had yet to prove 
        her worth to the simple farmers of the land and had little desire to be 
        chased off with their scythes. A small debate thought whether to don the 
        image of a wood elf or a gnome came up with a gnome. <br>
        <br>
        She was interested in an uneventful trip to the old Combine Spires in 
        West Karana. The gnome illusion was working well. Having noticed the looks 
        the farmers gave passing wood elves, not only did she not want to be chased 
        off with their scythes, but she did not want to be chased down because 
        of lust.<br>
        <br>
        So, scurry it was. Gnomes were seldom bothered in the lust department 
        and their height often made them overlooked. And overlooked was what she 
        wanted at the moment. As she ran towards their meeting place, Theo reviewed 
        what little she had learned from Trip.<br>
        <br>
        Apparently, she had been part of a trio. A trio that her mother, a dark 
        elf, had split up. Father had never told her of such things. A wistful 
        sigh escaped her as she continued on. Father rarely talked to her unless 
        it was to discuss some aspect of magic or the latest in fashion. She wondered 
        if he had even noticed she had run away.<br>
        <br>
        So Mother was a dark elf cleric of high standing. Well, she could understand 
        not being wanted by her mother. As dark elves went, from what she had 
        learned in her travels, she was a bit of a disappointment. Evil, to her, 
        seemed to be a waste of time and she couldn't quite get a grasp on this 
        good stuff. You did what you had to do and that was it.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, she spotted the spires in the distance and hurried her pace to 
        reach the top. Upon reaching the top, she spotted an old cart that could 
        not have possibly made it up there under any power. Looking a bit closer 
        as her father had taught her, she saw the faint sparkle of magic proclaiming 
        an illusion.<br>
        <br>
        "Hello, sister," Theo said.<br>
        <br>
        "Evening sister," Trip responded, the cart transforming into her sister 
        as the illusion dropped. "You may want to sit for this," her violet eyes 
        troubled as she looked into Theo's green eyes.<br>
        <br>
        Theo nodded, still not quite used to seeing her own reflection save the 
        difference in the eyes. "Alright, what do you need to tell me?"<br>
        <br>
        Trip composed herself, "I spoke with Lord Spyke before my very ill-timed 
        visit to Neriak." Trip shivered.<br>
        <br>
        "Ah, that's right, I have heard a few bits and pieces about your visit 
        to the homeland and its results," Theo said into the pause. Trip continued, 
        "It seems that mother dearest wanted to make a Bride of Innoruuk. She 
        wanted it so much that she captured and bespelled a certain high elven 
        enchanter of impeccable morals to make the corruption even more absolute."<br>
        <br>
        Theo raised her eyebrow at that one. Father? Was she talking about Father? 
        Impeccable morals? More like Impeccable Fashion Sense. But that was neither 
        here nor there. "Rather arrogant of her, isn't it?"<br>
        <br>
        "Aye, seems we get our own arrogance from more than just our father," 
        Trip's voice was dry. <br>
        <br>
        Things clicked and Theo realized that she was talking about Father. Well, 
        that explained her natural state as a dark elf. Theo shrugged, "Guess 
        so. Wouldn't have put Father in the impeccable morals class. Impeccable 
        fashion sense, perhaps."<br>
        <br>
        "Too stuffy to be anything but, from what I've seen," responded Trip rolling 
        her eyes, remembering having her nose put out of joint at their earlier 
        meeting.<br>
        <br>
        Under her breath Theo muttered a few unkind words about Mith's attention 
        to his fatherly duties.<br>
        <br>
        Ignoring that, Trip continued with her story, "Anyway, she got her conception, 
        F</font><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ather 
        got away and that should have been that. However, mother was VERY presumptuous 
        and wanted to hedge her bets along with her standing in the temple. So 
        she split a single soul into three parts. Something unheard of and greatly 
        overstepping her bounds."<br>
        <br>
        Theo's eyes widened, "What?" She gulped, thinking of the power required 
        to do that.<br>
        <br>
        Nodding, Trip continued, "She split the soul, but not into three evil 
        parts, as she'd hoped. Instead of tripling her chances of being Mother 
        to the Bride of Innoruuk, she ended up with two "flawed" pieces, in her 
        eyes, due to the curse.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Theo thought for a moment, "Flawed? I take it we are the castoffs?"<br>
        <br>
        "You were just a disappointment to her, methinks. I am an abomination, 
        at least in her eyes. You see, we aren't evil enough to be the future 
        Bride," Trip concluded.<br>
        <br>
        With a grimace, Theo said, "Who would want to? I mean... bride to a God? 
        That doesn't sound very fun at all."<br>
        <br>
        Trip voiced her agreement and then spoke again, "However, the curse was 
        NOT just about making a ‘child of darkness, child of light, child that 
        is neither day nor night.'"<br>
        <br>
        Looking a bit pale and somber under her dark complexion, if such was possible, 
        Trip continued. "The curse was supposed to act such that, if we did not 
        unite, upon our naming majority, we would go mad from the lack of a full 
        soul. What Rodcet Nife and the others did not take into account was several-fold. 
        The first was that we were separated after birth and did not know of the 
        curse, at least the two of us did not."<br>
        <br>
        Theo interrupted, "Father never mentioned such things."<br>
        <br>
        Trip shook her head slightly, "Father never knew. He throught there was 
        only one of us, you, and didn't know of the curse by Rodcet aided by the 
        Lord of the Void. The second was that, due to our experiences and temperaments, 
        we have matured at different rates."<br>
        <br>
        With a wry expression on her face, Theo commented, "Father always said 
        I lacked direction."<br>
        <br>
        "Aye, and I had too much focus, too much drive. If not for certain interventions, 
        I'd be stark raving insane right now, it seems. We need to prevent you, 
        and the other, from meeting such a fate."<br>
        <br>
        Thoughtfully Theo asked, "So this Lord of the Void, he laid the curse 
        on us that we would go mad?"<br>
        <br>
        "I think he only pushed Rodcet in the right direction. I'm not sure he 
        knew the final outcome. However, when he had his full powers, and was 
        not mortal, who knows what he thought of the value of one fractured dark 
        elven soul."<br>
        <br>
        Quietly, Theo thought as Trip continued, "Due to a certain assistance 
        I'd given him in the past, and having impressed him with my strivings 
        in the land of the light he repented, at least in part, on my behalf."<br>
        <br>
        "So this Lord of the Void and this Lord Spyke I have heard of are one 
        in the same? And he is now mortal?"<br>
        <br>
        "Aye," Trip confirmed, "he is the Lord of the Void no longer. He dabbled 
        one too many times in the affairs of mortals, the last being an effort 
        to save the souls of a few Spiritwalkers and he is now <i>VERY</i> mortal. 
        I think he begins to see the enormity of the issue facing us. And realizes 
        it might be a concern after all."<br>
        <br>
        Theo muttered that it seemed fitting. "So, the basic upshot is that we 
        each have a part of a soul and will be going mad when we reach our majority?" 
        Theo's face and voice transmitted her displeasure.<br>
        <br>
        "That's the ‘basic' upshot. However, I have a bit more buffer than you 
        two. I <i>will</i> find some way to reunite us without us getting killed 
        before the madness strikes."<br>
        <br>
        To ease her irritation, Theo took out her Dragoon Dirk and started cleaning 
        her nails. "Oh?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yes, I am under Spyke's protection and have been since the unfortunate 
        Morri demon incident. Apparently my, spunk? Determination? Innate desire 
        to be good? Impressed him and he shielded me," said Trip with a certain 
        impish grin.<br>
        <br>
        With a grin, "Or your dark elven good looks," Theo added. "Has the third 
        been found?"<br>
        <br>
        Trip's eyes darkened a bit, "If that red-eyed spitfire who shares our 
        face and tried to kill me in Neriak the other day is our sister, aye, 
        I found her. Fat lot of good it did me. As for my good looks, at the time 
        I impressed Spyke, I was, um, a firepot if I remember correctly."<br>
        <br>
        Theo chuckled softly. "I suppose Mother knows of all of us," Theo said 
        all humor aside. "And if our third was raised by Mother, then she knows 
        of us.<br>
        <br>
        Nodding, "Aye, and I can only wonder what she told the other, that she 
        now wants to kill us and risk insanity. Of course, anyone who would <i>want</i> 
        to be the Bridge of Innorruuk is already insane in my book."<br>
        <br>
        Theo raised an eyebrow, "Perhaps she has been told that only by killing 
        us can we be ‘reunited'".<br>
        <br>
        Trip paused and blinked. "You know, I think you have something there, 
        sister. Reunited in death? How twisted," she completed with a shiver. 
        "I only hope there is some shred of her soul, our soul, that we can reach 
        within her. I am not losing either of you, if I can help it. No matter 
        how twisted our other sister is, she's still our sister."<br>
        <br>
        With a shrug, Theo said, "If Mother can split a soul before its birth, 
        I don't think reuniting one after death will be so difficult for her."<br>
        <br>
        After a moment, Theo spoke again, "You know, this is very annoying."<br>
        <br>
        "You have a talent for understatement, sister."<br>
        <br>
        Ignoring the interruption, Theo continued, "I decided in my youth not 
        to worship any diety because I didn't want the hassle of deities getting 
        involved in my life. And now to learn that they have meddled in my affairs 
        from my very birth, nay, from even before my birth!" <br>
        <br>
        Trip agreed, "Aye, I chose to worship none as well, as a renunciation 
        of my birth. However, at the time, I thought I was just an unwanted singleton, 
        not part of a trio!"<br>
        <br>
        "Aye. I thought the same, Father wasn't very talkative about Mother," 
        Theo said.<br>
        <br>
        Trip shivered a bit. "And he wasn't much better when I spoke to him of 
        her, sister. However, I got the feeling that <i>*hate*</i> was too weak 
        a word for what he felt."<br>
        <br>
        Thoughtfully, Theo said, "Guess I will have to be a bit careful if I return 
        to Neriak."<br>
        <br>
        "Aye," Trip agreed, "Be very careful if you need to return. She's got 
        her henchmen looking for us now. Illusions will help, but only so far."<br>
        <br>
        "Well, I have developed a few places over here in Qeynos that are slowly 
        accepting me. Seems my necklace of gnoll fangs is enough to combat my 
        dark skin," Theo said, "And I can share their dislike for those noisy 
        dogs they call gnolls."<br>
        <br>
        "Aye, sister, with effort, you can find other places where you can be 
        accepted until this family issue is resolved," Trip said, "And yes, those 
        gnolls are quite the annoyance."<br>
        <br>
        Both sisters sat in thought for a moment, going over the dilemma of their 
        situation.<br>
        <br>
        "Well, if Mother is the typical dark elven cleric or worse," Theo started.<br>
        <br>
        "Or worse, it seems, sister. And Father is the stereotypical, um, snot 
        elf?" Trip continued.<br>
        <br>
        "Then our third sister is probably close to the edge herself," Theo finished. 
        "I have seen a bit of what going on in those temples." Theo shuddered, 
        "Not my idea of fun."<br>
        <br>
        "Aye," Trip agreed, "Our third is probably very close to the edge. I can 
        only pray we can reach her in time to pull her back from the brink. And 
        I don't know if I can get protections extended in time for you, should 
        she lose it and be lost without us able to reunite."<br>
        <br>
        Theo sighed, "My own skill is a bit on the lacking side. I am still learning 
        a lot about the powers I can command." <br>
        <br>
        Worry showed in Trip's eyes, "This whole thing troubles me greatly and 
        has caused me much loss of sleep since I learned of it."<br>
        <br>
        Theo's eyes flashed, "Just introduce me to this ‘Lord Sypke'."<br>
        <br>
        "<i>If</i> I can find him again. He is most elusive and only shows up 
        at the worst possible times. The last time I saw him was while I was still 
        reeling over meeting Father for the first time."<br>
        <br>
        With a snort, Theo said, "Typical immortal. Another reason why I refuse 
        to worship them. Totally unreliable."<br>
        <br>
        Sighing, Trip continued, "I fear I was too rattled to ask the questions 
        I should have. I was nothing, compared to our father, in the rattled department, 
        however."<br>
        <br>
        Theo giggled at the image, "Probably did him well."<br>
        <br>
        "I swear, when he slid into tree illusion, I thought I heard the branches 
        shaking," Trip remembered, "And his earth elemental form looked like it 
        would crumble to dust at any moment."<br>
        <br>
        Wistfully Theo said, "Often I have tried to shake him up a bit. But have 
        failed each time."<br>
        <br>
        With a shrug, "He faked it well, and recovered admirably, but he was rattled. 
        Then he had the gall to get back on his high horse and question me!"<br>
        <br>
        "That's father for you," Theo said with a short laugh.<br>
        <br>
        Indignantly Trip continued, "It wasn't enough that I'd attained this skill 
        mastery, or that I had keen fashion sense, or that I traveled the lands 
        of the light. He wanted to know what <i>else</i> I was good at!"<br>
        <br>
        Theo chuckled at her sister's lost composure, wondering if the flailing 
        arms were part of a levitate spell and making a mental reminder to check 
        it out at a later date. "How did he know it was you? Did he mistake you 
        for me?"<br>
        <br>
        "I overheard someone speak his name, and went up to him and addressed 
        him as "Father". I thought he was going to choke for a moment," Trip muffled 
        a giggle.<br>
        <br>
        Trip continued, "He was like "I only have one daughter." and so on. I 
        asked him if he'd spoken to you recently, since I had <i>thought</i> you 
        were gong to speak to him."<br>
        <br>
        Ignoring the accusing glance, Theo shrugged, "Sorry, I got distracted 
        with a gnoll invasion." Theo managed to barely withhold the frustration 
        in her voice at her failure to get her father's attention. "Let me give 
        you a clue as to how to handle Father. Just know that whatever you do, 
        it will never be enough."<br>
        <br>
        Nodding, Trip asked, "I presume he's one of those bookish high elves who 
        is easily... distracted... from the real world as well?"<br>
        <br>
        Grinning wryly, "Of course," Theo said, "Dust in the library can send 
        him into a rage. As well as dust removed from some tomes of knowledge."<br>
        <br>
        Triptych shook her head, mumbling about Valley Elves.<br>
        <br>
        "That's Father for you. High Elf all the way. And I mean... All The Way," 
        Theo said with great conviction.<br>
        <br>
        Theo stood up, "Well, if you find this Lord Spyke, will you please let 
        him know that I would like to have a talk with him. As well as Father 
        if you see him?"<br>
        <br>
        Trip stood as well, nodding, "I will do so, sister."<br>
        <br>
        "You have given me much to think about, sister," Theo said as she hugged 
        Trip.<br>
        <br>
        "Aye, quite a bit," Trip said as she returned the hug, her eyes filled 
        with worry.<br>
        <br>
        "Be well, sister, I will keep in touch," Theo said as she stepped away 
        from her sister.<br>
        <br>
        "The best I can be, sister. As always," and Trip summoned her magicks 
        and disappeared into a mystical gate.<br>
        <br>
        It was a thoughtful dark elf who made her way back to Qeynos. Suddenly 
        her life had taken some turns she did not like. She muttered under her 
        breath about gods and their messing with mortal's lives. And then it started 
        to rain.</font><font  size=3 ptsize=10><br>

      <p><a name="losing"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Losing 
        It</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - by Triptych</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych was still 
        worried about Theo, as well as the third triplet, whose name she had yet 
        to learn. Supposedly, the protections placed upon her by the former Lord 
        of the Void would keep <i>her</i> sane from the strain of sharing a split 
        soul with her two siblings, but the other two had no such protections. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Even after heading 
        back to Neriak to help search for Andrasta, and being almost killed by 
        the third triplet had not lessened her desire to help the misguided one. 
        After all, it wasn't the fault of that one that she had the more evil 
        third of the soul, or that Theo got the neutral third. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Perhaps it was the 
        "good" in Triptych that made her want to help, perhaps it was the mysterious 
        bond shared by triplets, but Triptych wanted desperately to help. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She was not a religious 
        type, but she knew her magics alone were not enough. Additionally, Spyke 
        was missing from the world, possibly permanently, so she could not enlist 
        his aid, either. So she prayed to the goddess of love, figuring that if 
        anyone would help three cursed siblings become whole once more, that would 
        be the one to pray to. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After sending out 
        a heartfelt prayer, suddenly, it seemed that the world around her was 
        becalmed a long moment. There was total silence in the swamp surrounding 
        her. Triptych felt a deep wrenching within her, then a feeling of vulnerability. 
        Spyke's protections on her were seriously diminished and weakened. Was 
        this a sign that the goddess of love was angry at her? Or had she imparted 
        some part of her shieldings upon Theo and their sister? </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Only time would tell.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The next day found 
        Triptych no closer to an answer. She had yet to find Theo, and was not 
        ready for a repeat visit to Neriak so "mother dearest" and her sister 
        could try to kill her again. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Since the area that 
        she was hunting in carried some risk of serious injury, she decided to 
        illusion into the form of a troll, so that she could have some regenerative 
        abilities. Thankfully, Toxiss didn't seem to mind sharing his camp with 
        a troll any more than he'd seemed to mind sharing with a dark elf. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Triptych could <i>swear</i> 
        she felt her intelligence diminishing, the longer she was in troll form, 
        and she also found herself talking like one. In true trollish form, however, 
        this didn't really bother her at the time, nor did the incessant butt-scratching. 
        Never had she felt this much impact from an illusion, but it was "otay 
        wid her, dis be fun!" </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hours later, when 
        she was back wearing her own form, however, she stared aghast as she realized 
        that the "tasty snack" she was eating was halfling toes. Something was 
        very wrong ...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She could almost 
        discount the recitations of her supposed actions while under illusion 
        as embellishment ... almost, but not quite. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Gaps in her memory 
        were happening more frequently, and she'd find things like gnome meat 
        in her packs after being in troll form, etc. This troubled Triptych, deeply. 
        She was neither violent nor evil, but some of her urges lately scared 
        her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And then one day, 
        she went from scared, to out and out irked. Always before, her "little 
        episodes" had been when she was under an illusion. Often, she found herself 
        taking on the emotional/mental makeup of the race in question. Sometimes 
        she couldn't even remember what had happened while she was under illusion. 
        So, she'd stopped illusioning unless it was absolutely necessary.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then one day she 
        blanked out while not under an illusion. One moment she was in lavastorm, 
        the next she was in Kithicor. She couldn't remember a thing about the 
        intervening travel time, and she <i>knew</i> her bind point was nowhere 
        near there. Plaintively, she asked the guild what happened. Quilan responded 
        by calling the Wrath of the gods down on her via spell. He never did give 
        her a straight answer on what she had done that was so bad that he felt 
        the need to blast her solidly to "snap her out of it", but it troubled 
        her that any Spiritwalker would feel the need to cast <i>any</i> attack 
        spell on her. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What troubled her 
        more was the pure rage she felt at the "attack". A rage worthy of a black-hearted 
        dark elf, not one who had spent her entire trying to walk in the light. 
        She no longer could predict what her actions would be if a guildmate tried 
        the same sort of stunt in the future. Damn the gods ... ALL of them ... 
        for playing their little games with HER soul. She was beyond fed up with 
        them and her "dear" mother too. She only prayed she could keep some shred 
        of sanity ... and not hurt anyone ... while they figured out how to break 
        the curse.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Theo awoke knowing 
        something was missing. Not the usual feeling something was missing, which, 
        if her sister was to be believed, that something was part of her soul, 
        but something else. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She shivered as she 
        donned her gear for another day of fighting the gnoll invasion. The two 
        things these gnolls seemed to have, unending numbers and stupidity. However 
        was in charge of the Darkpaw family was a complete nut case in Theo's 
        book. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Well, might be best 
        to find her sister and see if this was another move in the game with her 
        soul. Theo snarled to herself. She hated being a pawn in some god's amusement. 
        Well, she said to herself, a pawn can become a queen if they are careful 
        enough and last long enough. She would show these gods what it meant to 
        fiddle with her life</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Taenalie slipped 
        back into the shadows of an alleyway, allowing her illusion to drop before 
        she stepped back out into the street. As expected, the angry mob passed 
        her by. In a few moments, they'd find the <i>real</i> owner of the form 
        she'd worn, and, with any luck, would imprison and likely kill the visitor 
        for a crime he didn't commit. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Her lips drew back 
        as she bared her teeth in a feral grin of satisfaction. The hatred went 
        on, and grew with every innocent she framed, with every illusion she used 
        to bring out the worst in people. </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After all, if she 
        was to become Innorruuk's intended bride, the more hate in the world, 
        the better, right? </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She had long ago 
        dispensed with her troublesome conscience, much to her mother's approval. 
        Or at least she let her mother <i>think</i> her conscience was totally 
        gone. Once in a while a tiny voice in the back of her head would tell 
        her how wrong this all was, but it was quickly squashed. She was <i>not</i> 
        weak and flawed like her sisters, and any such perceived flaws were due 
        to the curse. All would be well when the curse was lifted. It had to be. 
        Mother said so. </font> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The one time she'd 
        heard the curse repeat in her dreams, she'd asked her mother after if 
        it meant that the triplets needed to be rejoined. Her mother cuffed her 
        soundly, then told her it meant that the others had to die, that only 
        one was allowed to live. The proper one, the evil one. Her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Of course, how could 
        it mean anything else? She was the perfect child of evil and the fitting 
        bride for the god of Hate. The flawed images of her <i>must</i> be destroyed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She'd almost had 
        the goodie two shoes Triptych once. The guards helping her were just an 
        honor guard, she could have taken her out on her own, really, if Trip 
        hadn't somehow gated out of trouble in the nick of time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Of <i>course</i> 
        she wasn't jealous of the fact that her sister looked well-dressed, successful 
        and content, nor that she seemed to be welcomed almost everywhere! Her? 
        Jealous of that flawed one? Never! She and that weak fence-straddler Theolandra 
        were just defective, fragmented receptacles of a soul that should be wholly 
        Taenalie's by right.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">They had to die. 
        She was the <i>only</i> proper one. Mother said so, and Mother always

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Theolandra tossed 
        and turned in her bed, the sheets twisted and soaked with sweat. The nightmares 
        were getting worse each night, this one by far the worst. In her dreams, 
        she found herself being hunted, chased down by some horrible darkness, 
        twisted and malignant. Run as she might, it was constantly getting closer 
        and closer. Once, in her dreams she had turned to look back. That was 
        the night she had awoken screaming, the burning red eyes forever etched 
        in her memory.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Tonight she had taken 
        the potion given to her by a local shaman for her dreams. He had told 
        her it would help. With her current lack of sleep, Theo was willing to 
        try anything. It was only dreams, she told herself. Dreams can't hurt 
        you. Then why are you scared, a small voice asked in her head.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Angry with herself, 
        she downed the potion and sought her sleep. But once she had closed her 
        eyes, the nightmare had taken her, stronger than ever. Burning red eyes 
        formed before her, eyes of hate. A voice whispered to her, "Well met, 
        sister," the venom causing her to shrink back.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Theo backed away 
        only to bump into a wall of some force. With a gasp, she found herself 
        caught behind a barrier of some sort, caged in a circle of power. Trembling 
        slightly, she said, "This can't be happening. I don't believe it. It isn't 
        true."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The eyes moved closer 
        out of the darkness, coalescing into a small dark shape. "Oh, it's happening, 
        dear sister. Like the prophecy said it would. Our souls will be united. 
        You will become one again." Taenalie paused, "With your death!"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At that, Taenalie 
        came into full view and Theo couldn't suppress the gasp of recognition. 
        "That's right, sister dear, I'm the third one, the Chosen One. And with 
        your piece of my soul, I will become that much more powerful and whole. 
        And after your weakling fall, our other part will fall just as easily," 
        the venom seemed drip from her voice.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"How?" asked Theo, 
        frantically searching for some way out of this dream that was no dream 
        but a frightening reality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Oh, it wasn't all 
        that difficult," Taen shimmered to that of a shaman, "when you have the 
        right face."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Theo watched in horror 
        as the figure returned to that of a female dark elf. "Illusions can be 
        very helpful in gaining ones objectives, don't you agree, sister?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The other smiled, 
        "But enough chit-chat. Time to finish what was started."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dark forces spewed 
        forth from the other, surrounding the circle of power. Theo could only 
        watch in horror as the powers of Hate came forth, just chanting to herself, 
        "No, this isn't possible, I don't believe. The gods have no power over 
        me."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The power grew and 
        grew, the eyes boring themself into Theo until finally the dam broke and 
        poured into Theo, sucking her soul from her body. Theo screamed in anguish, 
        the pain of death nothing compared to that of losing one's soul. Eons 
        passed while the power surged and waned, until finally, it vanished.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Theo's limp body 
        fell to the ground, a dark form now devoid of soul. Taen picked herself 
        up from the floor as well, a maniacal grin on her face, "I am victorious 
        Mother! Soon I will be whole again!" Then she too vanished from the dream, 
        as quickly as the dark powers had.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Long moments passed 
        and all was still in the dream. But the intrusions were not done for the 
        night. A small figure poked his head in, surveying the scene. He wandered 
        over to Theo's form, prodding it for any signs of life. "Hello? Anybody 
        home?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He glanced from side 
        to side, making sure no one else was around. Then a big grin blossomed 
        on his face. "I think I have just the thing for you."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He shook his fingers 
        out and then clapped them together, forming a ball shape with them. Muttering 
        a few words, his hands started to glow, or rather, something inside started 
        to glow. With a smile of satisfaction, he opened his hands, allowing the 
        small glowing ball of light to float free.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It wavered there 
        a moment and the small figure nodded towards the limp form of Theo. "There 
        you go, if you want it."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The small ball seemed 
        to glow with approval and then dove for Theo's body. The light grew and 
        grew, causing even the small one to avert his eyes. When it faded he looked 
        back and whistled. "Won't this put some starch in someone's shorts," he 
        grinned as he cackled gleefully fading into the night.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Back in the real 
        world, another stared in horror at what had happened, just that moment 
        to late. Triptych stared at the figure that was her sister, shocked and 
        horrified at the powers that had been called up, feeling the anguish of 
        Theo and the evil joy of Taen as the hideous deed was done. "Nooooooooo!" 
        Trip screamed, angry that she had been too late to realize what was happening 
        to Theo, fearful that she would suffer the same fate. Quickly, she gathered 
        her powers and fled the sight of her soulless sister. The time of battle 
        was at hand, Trip thought as she cast the spell to take her home, and 
        by all the powers of Norrath, she would see Theo avenged.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Trip's figure faded 
        from view as a misty light settled around Theo's body, infusing with it 
        and changing it. Her last sight was the clouded figure of a wood elf where 
        Theo's body had been. Dismissing the sight from her mind, Trip began to 
        plan her battle. If Taen thought to take her as easily as she had Theo, 
        Taen had another thing coming, she was much more skilled in her arts than 
        Theo had ever been, even for all her study with Mith. The time of reckoning 
        was at hand.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meanwhile, Theolaendra 
        stirred and awakened, her memories blurred. Unsteady, she got up, blinking 
        blearily, trying to brush the fuzziness from her mind. Something important 
        had just happened that she should remember, but it eluded her. Groping 
        for a mirror, she finally found one to stare in shock. Her hair was... 
        blonde. And her skin, light. Not as light as a human's but still much 
        lighter than a dark elf. Everything seemed changed and yet she knew that 
        was the way it was supposed to be. Only her eyes hadn't changed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Something was still 
        not quite right, there was something else missing. But it wasn't missing 
        at the same time. Theo shook her head in confusion and went outside her 
        home to see if she could make sense of something. Looking around it seemed 
        like the first time she had seen this area and yet it seemed totally familiar. 
        She felt as though she should be able to go over to the guards and have 
        a nice amiable conversation with them, but that didn't feel right either.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"What has happened 
        to me?" she moaned out loud.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Sorry to intrude," 
        a voice said from behind her, "but you seem to be a young to be so far 
        from Kelethin. Are you alright?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Theo spun around 
        to see another wood elf. Part of her wanted to run over and hug her with 
        relief at seeing someone like her, but that other part, that fuzzy part 
        in her mind, seemed to tense up, as if expecting an attack. "I, I, don't 
        know," Theo stammered, "Something happened, I don't... it's hard to... 
        I don't know what..." Theo paused and took a deep breath, "I don't know 
        who I am or how I got here."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The wood elf smiled 
        gently, "Then I know just the people who can help you and where you can 
        stay until you are feeling better and more confident. My name is Brighid 
        and I am part of the Spiritwalker Clan."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Theo's memory sparked, 
        she knew that Clan! But how? Confusion still reigned in her mind.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Heard of us, have 
        you?" asked Brighid.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Numbly, Theo nodded. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I am sure Mortekai 
        or Sanu can help you out, or who knows, maybe even Morri. But even if 
        they can't, I am sure you will be welcome to stay. You seem a good sort. 
        What's your name, anyway?"</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Theolaendra," Theo 
        said without hesitation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Brighid looked strangely 
        at the wood elf before her, suddenly knowing she had stumbled onto something 
        that the elders of the Clan should know about, for the Theolandra she 
        knew was a dark elf and yet it was obviously a wood elf that stood before 
        her now.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Well then, Theolandra, 
        shall we go?" asked Brighid as she readied her spell.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Absently, Theo nodded, 
        "Sure thing. And it is Theolaendra," as the magic engulfed her, whisking 
        her away to a new area of Norrath.</font></p>

      <p><a name="two"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And Then 
        There Were Two - Triptych</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She never knew what 
        woke her from a sound sleep and had her grabbing the nearest druid, flinging 
        obscene amounts of money at them so that she could fly halfway across 
        the world in the middle of the night. Call it instinct, call it some soul-deep 
        bond with her sister. Call it ... too late.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As she landed from 
        the 'port, Trip was knocked to her knees by a wash of sensations. Hate. 
        Pain. Rage. Fear. Blind terror. A myriad of sensations and memories not 
        her own bombarded her as she struggled to her feet. Then the sensations 
        stopped abruptly.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A part of her knew 
        she was too late, but she ignored the inner voice and broke into a run. 
        She refused to believe there was nothing she could do. She refused to 
        believe it until she skidded into Theo's sleeping quarters and saw her 
        sister's lifeless form sprawled there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Nooooooooo!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She stared in frozen 
        horror for a long moment, awash in grief and regret. She'd been too late, 
        and Taenalie ... it must have been Taen's glee that she felt ... had killed 
        their sister.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Aware at last that 
        she was still in her sleeping robe, and unready for a magical confrontation, 
        should Taen return, Triptych gated back to Thurgadin to prepare herself. 
        It was past time to confront Taenalie.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">~~~~</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">An hour later, Trip 
        handed a note to Talem Tucter, proprietor of the gem shop in Thurgadin, 
        ignoring his odd looks at her current garb. Her father, Mith, was a good 
        customer of Talem's, and she knew the honest shopkeep would deliver her 
        note to Mith the moment that he returned from his current research trip 
        to Erudin's famous library.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Father, </i></font></p>
        <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I regret to 
          inform you that Taenalie has slain Theolandra. By the time you return 
          to read this, I will have found out if the curse can be broken with 
          only two of us still surviving, and if Taenalie has been driven too 
          far into madness to be redeemed. If the answer to the first is no, and/or 
          the answer to the second is yes, then it is likely that at least one 
          more, if not both, of your remaining daughters, will not survive the 
          confrontation. Know that I will expend every ounce of power and ability 
          that I have inherited from you to prevent such madness and evil from 
          continuing, even at the cost of my own life.</font></i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="right"><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">-Triptych</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She regretted the 
        stilted tone of the note, and knew there was more, much more, that she 
        wanted to say, that she should say. But there wasn't time. She didn't 
        have the time to grieve, much less time to bid farewell to a father she 
        might never see again. A father that may have never wanted the burden 
        of children, but who had, after his initial shock, attempted to treat 
        her with bemused civility.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was time to end 
        this. One way or another.</font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">War Paint - by Triptych</font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Trip stared at the 
        vision in the mirror for several long moments before a grim smile flitted 
        across her face. Something that many enchanters tended to forget, especially 
        as they grew in power, was that illusions were't the only way to change 
        one's appearance. Since Taenalie was likely expecting Trip to either storm 
        in looking like herself, or sneak in under the guise of illusion, Trip 
        was doing neither.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Carefully, Trip patted 
        the elaborate bun of silver-white hair atop her head, making sure that 
        the &quot;hair sticks&quot; holding it in place were adjusted just right. 
        The tapered velium sticks were on loan from a rogue friend of hers, who 
        said they were well-balanced for throwing, as well as close-in stabbing 
        work. She claimed that they were &quot;all the rage&quot; with female 
        rogues, who found a grim humor in wearing something elagantly ornamental 
        that could double as lethal weapons.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She moistened her 
        crimson lips with the tip of her tongue, careful not to muss the lipstick 
        coated upon them. Her violet eyes, looking bluer than normal due to carefully-chosen 
        eye shadow narrowed pensively. She'd always joked that makeup was &quot;war 
        paint&quot; for which she had no need, but she was glad she'd learned 
        the art of it's application. Today's war was not going to be one of the 
        sexes, but something that was likely to become far more deadly.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Slender, but strong, 
        arms smoothed the links of the near-black adamantite chain tunic and sleeves 
        that were becoming popular amongst teir'dal and half-elven rogues. The 
        amazingly light armor was flexible and quiet ... as well as highly revealing. 
        When Trip had smithed the armor, she had planned on gifting or selling 
        all the pieces that she made, but something had made her keep a few pieces 
        for modeling purposes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Trip's ears heated 
        slightly as an unexpected breeze caressed the exposed portions of her 
        rear end. The pants, with thier cut-out holes in the seat made her feel 
        wanton, and very vulnerable. They might be the height of fashion for many 
        teir'dal women, but Trip still preferred the concealing folds of the robes 
        left back in Thurgadin. However, for once, Triptych wanted to flaunt her 
        considerable cleavage, her firm rear, and her war-painted face. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Trip's crimson lips 
        curled into another smile, one filled with promises of death, not humor. 
        All in all, she looked like one of many of the female teir'dal rogues 
        that roamed around Neriak, looking for mischief ... and woe betide the 
        &quot;mischief&quot; that she found.</font></p>
