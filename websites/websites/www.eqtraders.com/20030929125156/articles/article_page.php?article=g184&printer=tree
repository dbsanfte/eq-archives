<p><b>BS</b> - ><a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1082&menustr=">Black Sapphire</a> (While this is commonly used in a rogue community to mean backstab, MOST of the time around here, you'll find that folks are talking about the gem, not the skill) </p>

<p><b>CE</b> - ><a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1190&menustr=">Celestial Essence</a></p>

<p><b>MQ</b> - medium quality or multiquest, depending on the context.(Multiquesting involves one player handing in one or more quest items to an NPC, followed by a second player handing in the final component(s) so that the second player may receive the reward. This is commonly used when one or more parts are no-drop, but it is not a procedure that is sanctioned by VI.) </p>

<p><b>MTP</b> - <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1139&menustr=">Misty Thicket Picnic</a>. A baked meal with stats that requires many, many sub-combines. It is also used in the "PoTC" quest mentioned below. </p>

<p><b>OS</b> - Old Sebilis (some servers refer to it as "Seb", others as "OS" </p> 

<p><b>PoTC</b> - Protection of the Cabbage. This can refer to either the quested level 59 druid spell, or to the more complex <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q34&menustr=120010000000">Xanthe's Earring Quest</a>.
