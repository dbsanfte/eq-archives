smithing and grime and sweat...by Janus Xanathis, Necrobane (Tunare server) </font></b> 
<P>

<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are books you can 

  read, and other documents to view that can tell you HOW to use the skill of 

  the hammer and the forge. I am not going to do that today. What I am going to 

  do is tell you WHAT to make when your body is layered in sweat and grime, and 

  the smoke of the bellows is against your face. If you follow this plan, you 

  shall have the skill to create the armor that everyone wants, in only as long 

  as your gold holds true. For once you start selling the armor... gold is not 

  something you need to want for again. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> First off, let me tell 

  you this. To walk on the road to become a master of this skill requires much 

  time, and a greater amount of gold. Unlike skills such as baking, or jewelcraft, 

  in which you can start to recoup some of your gold loss at a lower skill, you 

  cannot do that with the hammer and the forge. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> How many people do you 

  know of walking around town shouting for skewers, or metal bits? </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Exactly. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But as I said above, once 

  you get the skill to start creating the banded armor that sells so well, you 

  will start to gain your gold back, and you shall get many an order for more. 

  </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> With that said, what is 

  the quickest road to gaining the skill to become an armor-smith, you ask? Well, 

  I shall tell you. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The easiest jump, on the 

  road to creating glorious armor, is to save up your trainings for four levels. 

  Once you have all twenty trainings, dump them all into Smithing. Since you won't 

  have the skill to kill the monsters that have the loot that you can sell for 

  the amount of gold you'll need... until you are in the low teens... saving up 

  the trainings shouldn't be a problem. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But, if for some reason, 

  you need all of your trainings, there are other ways to get to the twentieth 

  level of skill. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Two to be exact. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> You sharpen the rusty 

  weapons that are taken from the dead hands of monsters that hold them... or 

  you make the metal bits that are needed for some of the later items. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I don't want to replace 

  the part of the book, but, some basics to know when you are doing anything with 

  the forge. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> NEVER stack anything in 

  it. If it calls for multiples of something that stacks, put them in different 

  slots. </font>

<P> 

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The last item you will 

  always be placing in the forge, is a flask of water. Hunting down madmen in 

  the desert of Ro is a good way to gain the huge amounts of water that you will 

  need for this skill. Whether you are making metal bits, or a banded helm... 

  each step of the way has a single flask of water as the last item to place in 

  the forge. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Also, not matter if you 

  succeed, or fail, when you are using the forge ... All items you place in it 

  will be lost. If you succeeded, you will have the item you were creating. If 

  you failed, you have nothing, but some more skill on the road to becoming a 

  hammer master. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Once you have been ranked 

  as having a skill of the twentieth level, you will see the message that making 

  the metal bits, or sharpening the weapons is beneath you. It's quite uppity 

  to tell you this, but what it means is that you will gain no more learning from 

  doing these tasks. So, you now switch over to making a different item.... </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> A metal sheet. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But can't you buy those, 

  you ask? Why yes, you can, and they are about the same price, if not lower, 

  to buy then they are to make. So when you are making the more difficult items 

  that require the sheets to make, simply buy the sheets, that way you don't have 

  to worry about the random failure in making them. BUT... they are the easiest 

  thing to make to get you up the ladder of skill at this point. Making metal 

  sheets will get you to rank fifty in smithy. Again, you will fail, more then 

  you succeed at first... and you will make a LOT of sheets by the time you get 

  to fifty. But a good note is that you can sell them back to the vendors that 

  you are buying the parts that you need to make them from. You won't get back 

  all of your money... maybe half... maybe three quarters... but it's still something 

  back. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Once you get to the level 

  in which the metal sheets are gaining you no skill... what should you make next? 

  </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Banded Armor? </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Sadly... not yet. You 

  can try... and you will fail... greatly. And you may be able to make a piece 

  every twenty or thirty tries. But your learning will not go up that fast, and 

  the money you will loose will be insane. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The next item that we 

  go to create is the skewer. This is another item in which you can sell it back 

  to the vendor and you will make some of your money back. At this point down 

  the road of the hammer and forge, you are spending quite a bit of money per 

  item to create. Skewers are not that bad, overall. Only a gold, or so, for each 

  mold, and then the amount it takes to make the metal bits you need, and a single 

  water. You don't get nearly that much back when you sell them, but every little 

  bit helps. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> How high can making skewers 

  get you? I, myself, don't quite know. As of this writing, I have been listed 

  as having a skill of eighty in smithy. It has yet to tell me that skewers are 

  below my skill, but I expect to see the message any time now. I shall update 

  this document when I find that information out. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> If you are at eighty... 

  NOW are you going to try to make the banded armor? </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Aye. You can. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I, so far, have been able 

  to make five banded helms, and two banded shirts. The shirts I did at with my 

  skill of eighty. Two tries per shirt. I know I was lucky to only have a single 

  failure per item. But it goes to show you that having the patience to walk the 

  long road will pay off. With the going rate being about forty plat for a shirt, 

  if not more... You can see that even with a few failures per item, you will 

  be making your gold back, and more. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Don't just worry about 

  getting to the skill to make banded, and stopping there. There are rumors around 

  that smiths shall soon have the ability to start to make plate, or a type of 

  plate armor. I have also heard that you are going to need a skill up around 

  one hundred and thirty, if not more, if you want to pull this off. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> All I can say is... start 

  making your banded wares... and continue to makethem. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Also... out of any of 

  the skills... none are as physically rewarding as this one. Having spent hours 

  over the hot coals, pounding away with your hammer... and creating an item that 

  will help save someone from those extra slices and blows... is also a very good 

  feeling to have. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Of course, so is feeling 

  the weight of your purse after you just sold off a full suit to someone. </font>

<p><a name="larien"></a><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What is smithing 

  all about?</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> - by <a href="mailto:smedis@noxware.se">Larien</a> 

  (Lanys T'Vyl server) </font></p>

<dl>

  <dt><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many months 

    ago, I started on a jewelry career with a dark elf Enchanter. It turned out 

    to be extremely expensive, so I decided to put all trading aside for a while 

    and concentrate on hunting with my friends instead. Then I started a new character 

    on the fairly new server Lanys T'Vyl, a troll shadowknight called Gorth. Before 

    The Age Of Gorth, I mainly played spell casting characters, but as Gorth grew 

    stronger and more potent, I got more and more aware of the potential for a 

    blacksmith. Well, Gorth is as stupid as he is strong, and I wanted a totally 

    different type of character for a smithing career. So, one late night around 

    New Years Eve, Larien was born in the distant island of Odus.<br>

    <br>

    Larien is a highly intelligent enchanter, which makes him learn quickly. His 

    skill level increased rapidly, and has now reached 142. Another important 

    factor for a smith is wisdom. The higher the wisdom, the less you fail. Larien 

    uses enhancing items such as a Black Iron Medallion that improves his intelligence 

    and wisdom by 3.<br>

    <br>

    As an Erudite, Larien soon discovered that the worst place to be in for a 

    smith is Erudin. So the first thing to do was to make the long journey to 

    Freeport. In Freeport you can find all components you need to become a Master 

    Smith. You find sharpening stones and ore in North Freeport, close to the 

    Bard's Guild. You can buy rusty weapons in a shop in East Freeport, and another 

    shop there has almost all the molds you need. To reach a skill level of 142, 

    Larien used the following stategy:<br>

    <br>

    1. <b>Train in the Guild until 21.</b> Easiest way. I often have a lot of 

    unused skill points on my characters, because I usually practice my skills 

    while I'm fishing. So I have a lot of skill points available for getting a 

    head start on trades.<br>

    <br>

    2. <b>Sharpen rusty weapons until 31.</b> I got sharpening stones from North 

    Freeport and went to East Freeport to buy rusty weapons there. Rusty 2H swords 

    will get you to skill level 31. To sharpen a rusty weapon, find a forge and 

    left click on it. Put a sharpening stone and a rusty weapon in the container 

    that shows up and click on 'Combine'. If you succeed, you will lose the stone 

    and the weapon and get a tarnished weapon instead. If you fail, you will only 

    lose the stone. Note that you can hold down the <i>CTRL</i> key while left 

    clicking on a stack of sharpening stones to pick only one at a time.<br>

    <br>

    3 <b>Made scalers until 41.</b> This is when you start making those millions 

    of metal bits you've probably heard other people curse about. To make metal 

    bits, you will need two small pieces of ore (which you find in North Freeport) 

    and a flask of water. <i><b>NEVER STACK ANYTHING</b></i> in the forge; always 

    put the two small pieces of ore in separate slots in the forge and the flask 

    in the third slot. Hit Combine. When you have made about one million of metal 

    bits, head over to East Freeport and buy scaler molds. Put one metal bit, 

    one scaler mold, and one flask of water in the forge to make the scalers.<br>

    <br>

    4. <b>Made lanterns until 68.</b> Same as for scalers, but the recipe is: 

    metal bit, lantern mold, bottle, and a flask of water. You can find bottles 

    in Trader's Holiday in East Freeport, the merchant next to the one who sells 

    the molds.<br>

    <br>

    5. <b>Made skewers until 115.</b> Metal bit, skewer mold, and a flask of water.<br>

    <br>

    6. <b>Made pots until 122.</b> Metal bit, pot mold, standing legs mold, and 

    a flask of water. When Larien reached a skill level around 120, he started 

    making banded armor to get more money for the practicing. He quickly got back 

    the 100pp (about) he first spent on practice.<br>

    <br>

    7. <b>Made small sewing kits until 135.</b> Metal bit, needle mold, thimble 

    mold, and a flask of water. You get the needle and thimble molds from North 

    Ro, at the Inn.<br>

    <br>

    8. <b>Made banded armor to 142.</b> No more metal bits! Instead, you buy metal 

    sheets in East Freeport. At this time, most banded armor are trivial to make 

    for you, except gauntlets, mantle, leggings and cloak. I have heard that cloaks 

    will get you to 168. After that, there is nothing more that can increase your 

    skill level. Because most items are trivial to you now, your intelligence 

    aren't as important as your wisdom, so start maxing out wisdom with magic 

    items! To make <i>MEDIUM</i> sized banded armor, you get the molds in East 

    Freeport. To make <i>SMALL</i> armor, you can go to Neriak or Rivervale to 

    get the molds. To make <i>LARGE</i> armor, you have to go to Ferrott or the 

    Karanas.<br>

    <br>

    Gorget (AC5) - Sheet of metal, flask of water, gorget mold<br>

    Bracers (AC6) - Sheet of metal, flask of water, bracer mold<br>

    Boots (AC6) - Sheet of metal, flask of water, boot mold<br>

    Mask (AC4) - Two sheets of metal, flask of water, mask mold<br>

    Sleeves (AC7) - Two sheets of metal, flask of water, sleeves mold<br>

    Helm (AC8) - Two sheets of metal, flask of water, helm mold<br>

    Belt (AC6) - Two sheets of metal, flask of water, belt mold<br>

    Mantle (AC6) - Two sheets of metal, flask of water, mantle mold<br>

    Gauntlets (AC7) - Two sheets of metal, flask of water, gauntlet mold<br>

    Cloak (AC7) - Two sheets of metal, flask of water, cloak mold<br>

    Tunic (AC15) - Three sheets of metal, flask of water, tunic mold<br>

    Leggings (AC8) - Three sheets of metal, flask of water, leggings mold<br>

    <br>

    You can also make three kinds of weapons:<br>

    <br>

    Morning star - Flask of water, metal sheet, hilt mold, spiked ball mold.<br>

    Bastard sword - Flask of water, metal sheet, hilt mold, pommel mold, dual 

    edge mold.<br>

    2H sword - Flask of water, metal sheet, hilt mold, pommel mold, heavy steel 

    blade mold.<br>

    <br>

    If you have any questions about smithing or maybe want to buy some banded 

    armor, just look up Larien on the Lanys T'Vyl server!</font><font  size=3 ptsize=10><br>
