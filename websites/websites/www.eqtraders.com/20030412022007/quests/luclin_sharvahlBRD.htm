            <h3> Vah Shir Bard Quests</h3>
            <p><i>As with many quests in Shar Vahl, this requires that you've 
              already completed the <a href="citizenship.htm">Vah Shir Citizenship 
              quest</a>. Also, as with all the class-specific quests in Shar Vahl, 
              it requires that a young Vah Shir focus on a specific tradeskill. 
              For bards, this tradeskill is pottery. You may wish to work on the 
              <a href="luclin_sharvahlpottery.htm">Vah Shir Progressive Pottery</a> 
              quest some in order to skill up for this, or use the <a href="../learn/learn_pottery2.htm">pottery 
              powerskilling guide</a>. Drop information for the Hollowshade Moor 
              drops <a href="hollowshade_dropinfo.htm">can be found here.</a></i></p>
            <p><i> Please post any additions/clarifications on the message boards. 
              Thanks go to Sirella Mae'sah for compiling the initial information, 
              and to Cramnar and Fyrevixen for additions.</i></p>
            <p>Once you have completed your Vah Shir Citizenship quest, and receive 
              your intiate's cloak, you will be told to seek out Gherik Alarhun. 
              <i>(Details on this step are not available, so make sure to read 
              the text at the completion of your citizenship quest carefully for 
              exact instructions.)</i></p>
            <p>Gherik Alarhun (loc p257, n511) can be found in the pottery store; 
              facing the Arena, the pottery store is the last store on the left 
              beside the Arena. He will not say anything when he is hailed, just 
              give him your personal acrylia slate (Don't forget to have a container 
              slot free in inventory!). He will charge you with a quest to find 
              three scorpion shells (no drop, not stackable). The scorpions can 
              be found in the Shar Vahl pit and the shells are uncommon. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Gherik Alarhun examines the shells, 'These will do fine. I will 
                fashion a buckler from these shells that will help to preserve 
                your life in combat. As I busy myself with its construction I 
                send you on your next task. As a disciple of the Jharin you will 
                become skilled in the art of pottery. </p>
              <p>Gherik Alarhun says 'Grind the femur bone of the four grimlings 
                in this container. Take the resulting powder and, in the same 
                container, combine water and xakra worm bile. The resulting clay 
                will yield a special bowl when spun with this sketch and a flask 
                of water on a pottery wheel. Bring the unfired bowl to me. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will give you a (no drop) four slot container to put the femur 
              bones in and a reusable sketch. The skeleton grimlings can be found 
              in the Shar Vahl pit and the femur bones (no drop, not stackable) 
              are uncommon. The xakra worm larvae can be found in the pit also 
              and the bile (no drop, stackable) is common. <i>(DenMother's note: 
              the trivial for this combine is reported as being between 81 and 
              85, so you may wish to powerskill your pottery skill a bit before 
              attempting this combine)</i></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Gherik Alarhun carefully inspects the bowl, 'Not bad for a beginner. 
                Fire it in a kiln with a flask of water and a quality firing sheet. 
                Broker Fahaar is in need of your help. It so happens that he can 
                help you as well. He can supply you with the materials to transform 
                your bowl into a drum that will enhance your percussion songs. 
                Show him your acrylia slate and return to me with the bowl of 
                the Jharin, your initiate's cloak, a stretched hopperhide and 
                a leather cord. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Broker Fahaar (loc p228, n24) can be found just before you enter 
              the surrounding walls of the palace to the right, under a merchant 
              awning. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Broker Fahaar says 'Excellent, I can always use someone eager 
                to work. I require young rockhopper hides to stretch for some 
                special tailoring projects. Combine in this sack the hides of 
                four young rockhoppers and return to me the full hopperhide sack, 
                I will give you a stretched hide in return. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will give you a four slot container to put the young rockhopper 
              hides in. The young rockhoppers can be found in the Shar Vahl pit 
              and the hides (no drop, not stackable) are uncommon. After you give 
              the combined hides to Broker Fahaar, he will give you the stretched 
              hopperhide and a leather cord. </p>
            <p>Give the bowl of the Jharin, your initiate's cloak (from the Vah 
              Shir Citizenship quest), the stretched hopperhide and the leather 
              cord to Gherik. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Gherik Alarhun binds the stretched hide to the bowl with the 
                leather cord, 'Wonderful! You have done well and are ready for 
                the next portion of your training. I have finished your buckler 
                and enhanced your cloak. They will both prove to be very valuable 
                to you in your service to the Vah Shir. Show your buckler to Hymnist 
                Gawfed for further instruction. May your deeds bring honor to 
                the Jharin! </p>
              <p>Gherik Alarhun shouts 'People of Shar Vahl, it is with great 
                pleasure that I announce the Jharin has accepted ______ as an 
                official recruit. This honorable citizen will henceforth be charged 
                with the duty of supporting and magnifying the spirit of our people 
                through song while always being eager to help any Vah Shir in 
                need. Please help me in celebrating coming of age! </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You gain experience, and receive the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7286" target="_new">Buckler 
              of the Jharin Recruit</a>, the Cloak 
              of the Jharin Recruit, and the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7287" target="_new">Drum 
              of the Jharin Recruit</a>.</p>
            <p>Hymnist Gawfed is at location -120, 90. As you look up the palace 
              steps, he's in the building to the left. Hand him the Buckler of 
              the Jharin Recruit to start the following dialogue:<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Hymnist Gawfed says 'Very well met, young friend. I assume that 
                Gherik has sent you to me for the purpose of training you. Unforunately, 
                I will not be doing any formal training for the several days. 
                I'm taking a bit of a holiday to celebrate my wife's birthday. 
                If you could take this receipt to the merchant for me before my 
                wife gets home, I'd appreciate it. I'll place you at the top of 
                my training list as well. </p>
              <p>You say, 'what merchant?' </p>
              <p>Hymnist Gawfed says 'Gah... I'm losing my wits. I didn't tell 
                you which merchant. Well, the fur is the first thing to go, and 
                the mind is a close second. My wife's birthday is usually quite 
                a large event in my household and I've been trying to make this 
                one extra special. I'm lucky I can still find my tail. Take the 
                note to Jihli Mahej. He's an importer who lives near the... gah! 
                I can't remember the address. I'm sure you'll find him though. 
                Good luck! </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Jihli Mahej is in the building to the left of the Registrar. </p>
            <p>After you talk to Jihli <i>(apparently the vase that had been ordered 
              was broken)</i>, he directs you to Chogar to repair the vase that 
              Gawfed bought, instead of refunding the money. Chogar is located 
              under a tent in the southern-most section of the town. (loc -483, 
              -313; Outside of Building #17 on EQAtlas's page).</p>
            <p>Chogar will give you a (no drop) sketch and will send you back 
              to the pottery wheel to complete this step. (The sketch is returned 
              on a failure) Combine a medium block of clay, water and sketch in 
              the pottery wheel to receive the unfired vase. Then fire it in the 
              kiln with a quality firing sheet. Trivial for the combine is between 
              85 and 95<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Take the vase back to Gawfed. <br>
              </p>
              <p>Hymnist Gawfed looks at the vase and nods his head in approval. 
                &quot;I know that she's going to love this vase. The craftsmenship 
                is amazing!&quot; He says as he admires the vase. I need to properly 
                thank you for retrieveing it for me and I think that I know just 
                the thing. If you gather some owlbear feathers I can have my brother 
                apply them to your cloak. He can make a cloak really stand out. 
                It will be a prize fit for any aspiring apprentice to wear. Take 
                this sack and fill it with seven feathers and your recruits cloak. 
                Then return it to me with your cloak. I'll have it all sent over 
                to my brother together in one bag.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You will receive a no drop sack (as always when questing, make 
              sure you have a container slot free in inventory before you trigger 
              the above part of the quest.)</p>
            <p>Owlbear feathers drop off owlbear cubs, fleshrenders and razorbeaks 
              in Hollowshade Moor, as well as off grimy owlbear cubs in Paludal 
              Caverns. </p>
            <p>Combine 7 of the feathers, and your Cloak of the Jharin Recruit 
              in the sack, and hand the result to Hymnist Gawfed.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><br>
                Hymnist Gawfed says 'It looks like you're all set. I'll have this 
                sent over to my brother at once. Thank you again for fetch the 
                vase for me. I can't wait to give it to the missus. I just know 
                that she's going to love it. I have another task for you. It shouldn't 
                take much time at all. Your cloak won't be done for a while, so 
                you can do this while you wait. Take this piece of parchment to 
                Jangle. He'll give you a bag of lute strings. I'm restringing 
                all of my instruments before the party. Please be quick. Thank 
                you again. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You receive experience, positive faction with the Jharin, and a 
              no drop piece of parchment.</p>
            <p>Jangle can be found at 237.85, -493.71<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Jangle says 'I would love to fill this order for you friend, 
                but the lad that we sent out into the moor to hunt up our last 
                batch of owlbear guts has not returned. No guts, no strings. I'm 
                afraid that I have neither. If your master will allow it, perhaps 
                you could go gather the guts for me. If you complete this task, 
                I will waive the fee for his next couple of orders. I'm sure that 
                he'll find that proposal pleasant enough. Here's a bag to gather 
                the guts in. Please fill it before you return to me. '<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You recieve an 8 slot bag to fill with the Owl bear guts. They 
              look like Fatty owl Bear Meat so it is best to look before you loot 
              as the bag will not combine if you mix and match. If you didn't 
              gather enough guts while collecting feathers, go back out to Hollowshade 
              Moor (yes, it's likely you're going to get tired of that zone, just 
              like every other Vah Shir) and chase more owlbear cubs. </p>
            <p>Combine the 8 guts in the bag, then return the result to Jangle. 
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Jangle says 'Thank you for gathering these materials for me. 
                This bag should last for some time. I'll need to clean this bag 
                and make the strings. While I'm doing that, please take this note 
                back to Gawfed and have him specify how many of each string he 
                wants. He only listed the sizes in his note, not the quantities.

                These strings should work nicely for him, and let's not mention 
                the fact that they are absolutely free. Take care and remember

                returned with your cloak. Please take it along with the title 
                of Jharin Apprentice. To further demonstrate my appreciation of 
                your work for me, please take this lute. '<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You recieve Cloak of the Jharin Apprentice (ac+6 sta+1 cha+2 hp+5 
              Pottery +2% Class Bard, Race Vah Shir only), and Lute of the Jharin 
              Apprentice (+2cha Class Bard, Race Vah Shir only) <i>(Note: The 
              lute sits in Primary slot, looks like a bag when equipped, and allows 
              you to equip a shield in secondary. It currently does NOT work towards 
              skill ups. i.e. had a mandolin equipped and skill started to go 
              up, changed to quest Lute and skill no longer goes up. This seems 
              to have been reported already and hopfully will be fixed)</i><br>

              <p>Hymnist Gawfed shouts 'Everyone, please welcome my student and 
                friend, _____, to the rank of Jharin Apprentice! '</p>
              <p>Hymnist Gawfed says 'Now, please meet with Aljuum Mohim. He will 
                be responsible for your training during my holiday. Please show 
                him the lute that I just gave you. He'll most likely be in a tavern 
                somewhere. I just hope that he is sober. Take care, friend! '<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You also gain experience, and faction with the Jharin.</p>
            <p>Aljuum Mohim can be found in a bar in the South &quot;Slums&quot; 
              section of town. (loc -465 by -229). Hail him, then hand him the 
              Lute of the Jharin Apprentice.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Aljuum Mohim says 'That is quite a lute. Gawfed has an incredible 
                gift in that area. I don't have the patience to build instruments. 
                I prefer to use my time for other things. I'm sure that Gawfed 
                will fill you in on the more delicate side of our craft when he 
                gets over his holiday. Until that time, I'll get you started on 
                the other part of being a Jharin. Here, take your lute and this 
                bag. Once you get that stowed away, buy me a drink. If you can 
                guess my favorite drink, I'll start you on your lesson</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You will receive the lute back, and you will also receive a 2-slot 
              Blue Cloth Bag.<i> (DenMom's note: He doesn't tell you directly 
              what drink is his favorite drink, so the first folks to complete 
              this did have to guess at this and try several drinks)</i></p>
            <p>Barkeep Rawlf behind the bar sells the Sonic Wolf Pale Ale (costs 
              about 8 silver). Buy one and give it to Aljuum Mohim.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Aljuum Mohim sips the drink and smiles. 'Very good! I guess I 
                should get you started.' He says as he finishes the drink that 
                you just purchased. 'Our kin have encountered a number of beasts 
                since the time of our arrival here. Your lesson today will center 
                around one such creature. Maybe that will give you a better understanding 
                of our role here. Bah, Taruun scouts... a real Jharin can do twice 
                as much in combat... well, I digress. You're here to learn about 
                wolves, not my petty animosities. '</p>
              <p>You say, 'What wolves'</p>
              <p>Aljuum Mohim says 'The wolves that I speak of have no need for 
                sight. They are products of the darkness that surrounds us. Their 
                ability to move in the darkness and attack in packs makes them 
                a serious threat to any Vah Shir that walks beyond our city's 
                gates. I fear them more than I fear the twisted little people 
                that live in the caves around here. It is the duty of each citizen 
                to help control the number of these creatures. Fill the bag that 
                I just handed you with the jawbones of two young sonic wolves 
                and I'll know that you have a real understanding of the ferocity 
                of those creatures. If you return, I'll have something that you 
                may find interesting. '<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Young Sonic Wolf Jawbones drop off of Sonic Wolf Pups and Sonic 
              Wolflings out in Hollowshade Moor.</p>
            <p>Give combined bag of jawbones to Aljuum Mohim.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Aljuum Mohim says 'How was your little encounter with those beasts? 
                Quite nasty in combat, eh? I told you as much. Well, now that 
                you've seen them firsthand, I'll tell you how to deal with them 
                like a true hunter. Take this hilt piece and show Hana Sulm. She'll 
                give you some sketches. Once you have those sketches, go to Arms 
                Historian Qua and purchase the tomes on Wolf Bane Lore or something 
                like that. He'll know what you mean. You can use those books and 
                the sketches to make a weapon that offers considerable power against 
                those wolves. Once you have the weapon, bring it to me with your 
                apprentice cloak. I'll have something for you. Now go away and 
                let me finish this drink. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You receive positive faction with Guardians of Shar Vahl, and a 
              Hilt Piece.</p>
            <p>Give Hilt Piece to Hana Sulm (loc approx. -463, -319)</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Hana Sulm says 'Well, you're going to need to practice for a 
                while to make these things. Take these sketches and read up on 
                the lore concerning sonic wolves. You'll learn how to use the 
                sketches. Practice all you can. I'm sure that you're going to 
                have a lot of people coming to you with requests. '</p>

            <p>Your faction standing with Guardians of Shar Vahl got better.</p>
            <p>Receive Hilt Piece and 2 pottery sketches (one for claw sleeves 
              and one for dagger sleeves). </p>
