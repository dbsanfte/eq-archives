<P>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jewelry making is not 
  for the faint of heart, or the empty of pocket. Rather, it is a skill that will 
  take a lot of time, training, patience and financial resources before you can 
  excel in it. However, once you excel in it, you will find that your wares will 
  command a high price indeed. </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> You might think, at first 
  glance, that jewelry is "just fluff". In many cases it is. However, this is 
  a role playing environment, and I'd be willing to bet that mooneyed fellow in 
  the corner would love an engagement ring to present to his beloved. &nbsp;And 
  what about wedding rings for that big ceremony if she says yes? &nbsp;And what 
  about a lovely gaudy show of wealth for that vain elf over there? </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> If that were all there 
  were to it, however, it would not be <I>that</I> popular a trade skill. Like 
  tailoring, greater skill and better materials allow you to make more valuable 
  items ... including enchanted jewelry. By enchanted jewelry, I mean jewelry 
  that will enhance stats when worn. (i.e., +5 mana, +4 save vs. poison, +4 strength, 
  to name a few.) &nbsp;You must use enchanted metals to make enchanted jewelry 
  (you will need to hire an enchanter that has the proper enchant spell, if you're 
  not an enchanter yourself). </font> 
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Now that I've got you 
  drooling and mentally counting the riches that could be yours, let me inject 
  more reality into the picture. There are 5 basic metals to use in jewelry making: 
  silver, electrum, gold, platinum and velium. These are listed in order of cost 
  <B>and</B> in order of difficulty. If you have problems making a simple silver 
  bar and a cheap piece of malachite combine into a ring, don't even think of 
  trying out electrum or the others. Cheap gems are also easier to work with than 
  the really expensive ones. </font> 
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> However, with a <B>lot 
  </B>of training in the skill before you start trying to make anything, and a 
  careful squirreling away of any pretty stones you find along the way, you should 
  be able to progress well. </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> By the time I had a jewelry 
  skill of 30, I was able to make a (very)&nbsp;few different electrum pieces, 
  and a good chunk of silver and gem combinations. I'd made some very lovely pieces 
  of jewelry that took my breath away, and whimpered when I destroyed a gem that 
  cost over a platinum&nbsp;on a failure. </font> 
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> How did I do it? &nbsp;Start 
  small, with silver and lesser stones, and work your way up to more expensive 
  stones before you try the same thing with electrum. Keep good notes of what 
  combinations of stone and metal bar make what. My recommendation is to just 
  work with plain silver and gems for the first little while, to get your skill 
  up. Once you have relative ease with making a certain item, then get a piece 
  of enchanted silver and try the magical verion of the item. Find other folks 
  working in jewelry and compare notes. &nbsp;You can both save yourselves some 
  costly experiments if you share your knowledge. </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>The basics: </B>You 
  need a jeweler's kit (sold where the silver/electrum/gold/platinum metal bars 
  are sold -- it looks like a small sack), a metal bar (start with silver) and 
  a gemstone (start with the cheapest - malachite). Put the single metal bar, 
  and a single stone, in your jeweler's kit, close your eyes, pray to your chosen 
  deity, and press combine. I'd recommend training yourself up to 20 ranks in 
  the skill, or as close as you can, before you start trying anything (to save 
  yourself coin). Malachite and silver will become trivial at skill rank 21, at 
  which time you start using another cheap gem, such as lapis or turquoise for 
  practice. </font>
