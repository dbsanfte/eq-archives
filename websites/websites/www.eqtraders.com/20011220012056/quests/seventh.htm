            <h3> #7: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl </h3>
            <p> Take a deep breath. One more shawl...four more trade skills...yikes! 
              That's right, now you'll need to get brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, 
              and pottery all at least over 150. Here again, remember that just 
              because an item is trivial does not mean you can't fail. I just 
              failed at one of the pottery steps here and my pottery skill is 
              188. Based on the difficulty in acquiring some of these ingredients, 
              it is probably well worth the time to get your skills plenty high...but 
              you still have a decent chance of success if your skill is not yet 
              to where the item is trivial. Good luck, young sprout.

              is nearly impossible for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. 
              You should be exceedingly proud. Many have attempted this feat and 
              nearly all have lacked the skill, faith, patience and persistence

            <h4> <a name="inst">Detailed Instructions</a><br>
            </h4>
            <p> <i> <a name="skill">Skill Info</a> </i> 
            <p> <b> Brewing: </b> Ahhh, near and dear to my heart, my very first 
              trade skill! Brewing is quite simple. There are no portable containers, 
              you must use the brew barrels located in or around pubs in cities. 
              You get the ingredients for your recipe, put the required amount 
              of each into the brew barrel, and combine. Some recipes require 
              foraged items, but it is possible to go all the way through brewing 
              strictly on store bought ingredients. Just check your <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">Recipes 
              and Trivials</a> and <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/brewing.htm">Supply 
              Locations</a> and have at it. 
            <p> Note that there are a few varieties of liquids that can be brewed. 
              The originals are the alcoholic brews. These must be placed in an 
              open main inventory slot and right clicked to drink. These are intoxicating 
              and will affect your stats, your speech, and your vision. Drinking 
              them will build your alcohol intolerance, which moderates their 
              effects. Then there are the non-alcoholic drinks. Some of these 
              will be automatically imbibed and fill your need for drink just 
              like water or milk do, while others cannot be drunk at all and are 
              instead used in tailoring or quests. There are also some brewing 
              recipes for tempers, which are used by some races to make their 
              racial armor. Those cannot be drunk either, which is a good thing 
              if you look at the ingredients that go into them. Ick. Because the 
              temper ingredients are much harder to obtain than most of the regular 
              brews, don't worry about them for the sake of raising your skill 
              for the shawls. Focus on the other drinks with ingredients that 
              are easy to get. 
            <p> <b> Fletching: </b> Fletching is one of the easiest skills to 
              raise because it's relatively cheap and you can go from 0 to over 
              200 in front of a single vendor. There are two purposes to fletching: 
              making bows and making arrows. Bows are much more difficult and 
              expensive and totally unnecessary to skill for the shawl, so don't 
              worry about them. Look at the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/fletching.htm">Fletching 
              Supplies</a> page for a vendor that has "arrowheads (3), shafts 
              (4), fletch (3), vane (3), groove nock (3)" and a fletching kit. 
              Be careful, as many vendors have all of the components but no kit. 
              For which recipes to use, many recommend <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/%7Eewj/fletchguide/index.htm#The%20Cheapest%20Way%20To%20Fletch">Aoenla's 
              Cheapest Way to Fletch</a>. However, it seems to me that there are 
              cheaper recipes that could be used to bridge some of the levels 
              of skill, so if you want to check for yourself, see her <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/%7Eewj/fletchguide/index.htm#The%20Arrow%20Table">Arrow 
              Table</a> and look over the trivials for yourself. You might want 
              to consult a vendor for basic pricing information for each ingredient 
              for yourself. Basically, there are four parts to an arrow: point, 
              fletch, shaft, and nock. Don't be confused by vanes, they are just 
              another kind of fletch. You just put one of each of the four ingredients 
              into your kit and combine them, to make a batch of arrows. Each 
              of the four components come in varying qualities. The higher quality 
              (and therefore more expensive) the components, the better the arrow 
              will be. The progression of trivials is messier than in some skills 
              because there are so many variables, so just watch your charts. 
            <p> <b> Jewelcraft: </b> Yes, the much maligned jewelcraft. It's more 
              expensive than many skills, but not as bad as some might claim. 
              I went from 0 to 185 in about 2kpp. Everything you need for shawl 
              skill can be found on merchants in many cities, although most ingredients 
              are also drops. Only the most valuable gems are drops only. There 
              are two basic "kinds" of jewelry merchants and they are usually 
              found right next to each other in the jewelry shop or casters guild 
              of a city. See the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/jewelry.htm">Jewelcraft 
              Supplies</a> page for specifics. Typically one vendor has 18 gems, 
              starting with malachite, the cheapest and easiest, and running up 
              through rubies. These are the ones you will want to focus on while 
              practicing. All of these also drop from various mobs throughout 
              Norrath. The other standard vendor has the very important Jeweler's 
              Kit and the four old world metals: silver, electrum, gold, and platinum. 
              I believe one or more of these metals are also extremely rare drops 
              off of the muddites in Beholder. In a few levels of hunting there 
              I got one electrum bar once. But it is definitely not an adequate 
              way to acquire your metal for our purposes here. The jewelry merchant 
              in Thurgadin is the only source of velium bars for jewelcraft, but 
              you won't have to go anywhere near that stuff for the shawl quest. 
            <p> To actually make jewelry, all you do is put one bar of your chosen 
              metal and one of your chosen gems in the Jeweler's Kit and combine 
              them. In order to make jewelry with stats, you must first have an 
              enchanter magically enchant the metal via their line of spells for 
              that purpose. Jewelry that is made with plain metal that has not 
              been enchanted has absolutely no stats and is only worth anything 
              to a vendor, who will usually pay just a smidgen less than the ingredients. 
              Unenchanted metal is just as good, however, if you are just practicing 
              to increase your skill and intend to sell your successes back. 
            <p> The jewelry kit has four slots but you will never have more than 
              two ingredients, at least not for existing recipes. Items get progressively 
              harder by the metal you are working with. Within the recipes for 
              a metal, they also get progressively harder by the gem. Silver is 
              the easiest metal, then electrum, gold, platinum, and velium, in 
              that order. Gems increase in difficulty according to the price of 
              the gem. So, the cheapest gem (malachite) plus the cheapest metal 
              (silver) is the easiest thing you can make. The most expensive gem 
              (blue diamond, not sold on vendors) plus the cheapest metal (silver) 
              is only slightly easier than the cheapest gem (malachite) plus the 
              next metal (electrum). If I've confused you, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/jewelry/The_Art_of_Jewelcraft.htm#TrivialChart">Jewelcraft 
              Trivial Chart</a> for a more obvious visual display. You will probably 
              also want to print this chart to refer to while working, as it is 
              one of the best available for printing purposes. 
            <p> Just in case you're wondering, <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">Imbued 
              Jewelry</a> works along the same principles as regular jewelry except 
              that only certain gems can be used. Each Norrathian diety has a 
              specific gem which can be imbued by one of their followers of the 
              right class, and which then gives unique stats. As it is more complicated 
              than regular jewelcraft and does not fill any particular gap in 
              trivials, however, you won't need to deal with it for the purposes 
              of the shawl. 
            <p> <i> <a name="drops">Item and Recipe Details</a> </i> 
            <p> Because I haven't completed this shawl or obtained all of the 
              items for myself, this shawl's guide is still being steadily updated as I learn more.  Any information is welcome!
<p>
<b> Runed Sea Shell: </b>  The shell that you need only drops off of sirens in Siren's Grotto and has one charge of Enduring Breath.  There is a necklace that drops in Cobalt Scar and maybe also in SG that has multiple charges of EB, but it will not work.  Likewise there is a shell also called a Runed Sea Shell that drops in CS that has charges of Cloud.  That also will not work.  You need the item called a Runed Sea Shell that has one charge of Enduring Breath.  They are not no drop, so buying them might be a good option if you cannot get a group sufficient to tackle the sirens in SG.  They're not easy.  Because I was given my shell, I did not have to fight the sirens so I cannot give any firsthand info on how to find and fight them.  I do know that they are at the bottom of the well and cannot be pulled out of the water to the area above the well.  You must go down to them to fight them, although I believe it is possible for a sufficiently high level person to single pull them away from their spawn locations.  They are tough and the shell is a somewhat rare drop.  If you have trouble getting one to drop or getting a group together to attempt them, try auctioning in the zone.  At least they have no use outside this quest, so you have a reasonable chance of getting one from others in the zone who get one and don't need it.
<p>
<b> Small Pieces and Small Brick of Velium: </b> See the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/fourth.htm#inst">Fourth Shawl Details</a> for suggestions on how to get these.
<p> 
<b> Swordfish Tooth: </b> These only drop from the swordfish in Siren's Grotto.  They are found in a few different places, but are often in the company of the seahorses.  Seahorses are are quite a handful because of their nasty stuns, so I recommend going for the spawns up top where it is possible to single pull one swordfish.  Using invis, from the West Wastes zone follow the tunnel turning right when it branches.  When you reach the open area, hug the right wall and move up to the edge of the water.  The little corner of land against the wall next to the water is reported to be a safe spot if you sit all the way back.  There may be more critters in the water than just the one swordfish, so plan accordingly.  You'll probably have to move out into the middle of the pool to get close enough to pull, so be careful to watch the wanderers that come near the water out there.  Also while pulling and fighting, be careful not to get too close to the two static spawns on the far side of the pool opposite our little ledge.  My group of three 54+ took out the fish but it was a tough fight.  We fought on the underwater ledge at the base of the little waterfall, but tried to stay away from the far side of it to avoid agroing the static spawns just across the water.  The tooth does not drop every time, but they are reasonably common.
<p>
<b> Ulthork Tusk: </b> Ulthorks are found in East Wastes and in Siren's Grotto.  The tusks are tradeable but fairly valuable because they can also be turned in to one of the Othmir in Cobalt Scar for a quest that sometimes results in a high end gem reward.  This is good because it means people might hang onto them and not just destroy em immediately, but it also means that they might cost you a bit if you try to buy.  Ulthorks are very common in Siren's Grotto, but are also much tougher.  So, if you're in no particular hurry and want some exp, that's a great place to try.  The ulthorks in East Wastes are equally common and much easier, so that's a faster source.  I was given my tusk so I never had to actually hunt for it, but my understanding is that while they're not common, you shouldn't have to kill hundreds.  I believe they are most common in the northeast portion of East Wastes.  Just follow along the water north from the bridge.  
<p>
<b> Molkor Hide: </b> Here again I was given my hide so I don't have any first-hand experience with getting one.  As far as I know, molkor are only found in Siren's Grotto where they are very common.  The hides are tradeable and not good for much else, so you could probably get one from other folks if you can't round up enough troops to do them yourself.  I don't know how exactly how common they are, but the friend who gave me mine gave me five all at once, so I'm guessing they're not terribly rare.
<p> 
<b> Iceclad Cutlass Fish: </b> These must be fished out of the water in the Iceclad Ocean but can be fished even if you start with 0 skill.  In order to fish, you must buy a fishing pole and some bait from one of the many vendors in any given city that have them.  You have to use a skill hotkey out of the banks of hotkeys that come premade, same as the ones for kick or hide or forage.  Equip your fishing pole in your primary hand, stand in front of water, hit your hotkey, and if you have any bait on you, you will swing your pole.  After a pause of maybe 20 seconds or so, you will get a message saying whether or not you caught anything, and if you did catch something it will appear on your cursor.  In addition to fresh fish, you will also sometimes get tattered sandals, rusty daggers, or fish scales from fishing in any zone.  Some zones also have other special things that you can fish up.  For our purposes, in Iceclad the only special thing will be the Cutlass Fish.  You may get a lot of junk and fresh fish before you get the ones you need, so just keep trying and eventually you'll get them.  In Norrath as in anywhere else, fishing is a hobby best suited to the patient.  So sit back, pop open a short beer, and contemplate the waves.  Of course, you might first want to find somewhere relatively out of the way from wandering mobs to avoid any unpleasant interruptions.  Sometimes you might lose your bait, and each time you get a fish you will use up one bait, so be sure to bring along at least a few stacks, maybe even a whole bag full.
<p>
<b> Royal Kromrif Blood: </b> Get thee to Kael, and bring along some help.  The blood only drops off of either of the two Iceshards, Klaggan Iceshard or Vorken Iceshard. I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting either of them, but I am told they spawn in the "Keep area".  Klaggan is on the throne and Vorken is to his right.  They apparently have long respawn times compared to the other giants in the area, and both sometimes have placeholders up.  They do not always drop the blood but it is quite common.  If the giant has any on him, it can be pickpocketed by a non-kos rogue with very high skill.  Pickpocketing always runs the risk of creating agro, however, so make sure your rogue is aware of the danger and prepared to flee.  I am told that if it is successfully pickpocketed the giant's loot table will eventually reset after an unknown period of time, perhaps half an hour or more.  It seems that a sufficiently talented single group of level 55-60 can crawl their way to the area and kill these giants.  A 60 wiz friend of mine also had a 60 shadowknight feign-pull one of them to the zone where the two of them killed it.  So it seems that the giants themselves are not as much of a problem as getting to them.  The blood, however, is not no drop.  So, if you cannot find a way to get it off the giants yourself, you can always try to buy.  I am told that the going rate is 5k though, so that won't be an option for everyone.  This is the ingredient that holds up the seventh shawl for most folks.
<p>
<b> Rubbing Alcohol: </b> The only source of rubbing alcohol in all of Norrath is the Mortician, a necromancer in Cabilis.  Yes...Cabilis.  I'm not entirely sure what special relationship the coldain have with the iksar, that an ingredient for their sacred rune is only available in Cabilis.  *shrugs* Directions paraphrased from Scirocco on the message boards: "West Cabilis, near the Temple of Death in the NW. If you approach from the south, switch to the east side of the canal as you enter the large area with the temple. On the right side as you head north is a two story shop. The Mortician is on the second floor."  Easy enough, right?  If you're not an iksar, go put an iksar friend to work...or make some little newbie's day with a tip for some quick fetching.
