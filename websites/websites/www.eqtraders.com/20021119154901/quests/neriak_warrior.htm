            <h3> Neriak Warrior Armor Quests</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new tradeskill quests for younglings. 
              Armor pieces are DEF/WAR only and are lore (other than the bracer) 
              and no drop. Stats for the various pieces are not yet available, 
              but the resulting armor is silver in color. Please note that while 
              the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make 
              your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Jarrex N`Ryt' </p>
            <p>Jarrex N`Ryt says 'What have we here? A new weakling that wishes 
              to reap some sort of self-value and renown through service to the 
              Indigo Brotherhood perhaps? Well speak up whelp!! Have you come 
              to [destroy the enemies of Neriak] or are you a coward better suited 
              to mop the filth from the back rooms of the Maidens Fancy. ' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I have come to destroy the enemies of Neriak' </p>
            <p>Jarrex N`Ryt says 'If you are going to be of any value to the Indigo 
              Brotherhood you will need to outfit yourself in a suit of armor 
              that will turn aside the blades of enemy forces. From the looks 
              of you even the tiny fangs of a moss snake could bring you death. 
              Take this request form to Issva H'Rugla to get yourself started 
              on the assembly of your armor. When you have procured some protection 
              for your weakling body return to me for [further instruction]. ' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'what further instruction?' </p>
            <p>Jarrex N`Ryt says 'Ah, you are eager to advance further within 
              the Indigo Brotherhood. Although it is my duty to aid your training, 
              do not allow your arrogance to blind you to your lowly position 
              amongst the Kings most loyal subjects. Your next task is to assist 
              the construction of a [weapon] and [shield] worthy of being wielded 
              by a Warrior of the Indigo Brotherhood. ' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what weapon?' </p>
            <p>Jarrex N`Ryt says 'Beyond the mouth of Neriak lies the Nektulos 
              Forest. There the Deathfist Clan of Orcs has set up camps in an 
              attempt to invade and claim the Nektulos Forest. Slay these invaders 
              and bring to me an Orc Templar Scalp, an Orc Fibula bone, and an 
              Orc Clavicle bone. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what shield?' </p>
            <p>Jarrex N`Ryt says 'Young Kodiak Bears often wander into the Nektulos 
              Forest from the Commonlands searching for food. You do not appear 
              to have the strength to arm wrestle a pixie. If you prove me wrong 
              by slaying Young Kodiaks and bringing me four Young Kodiak Femurs 
              I will guide you in the construction of a shield worthy of a warrior 
              of the Indigo Brotherhood. '</p>
            <p>Issva H`Rugla says 'So you are one of Jarrex's new recruits. You 
              are to assist in the construction of the armor you will don as a 
              new Warrior of the Indigo Brotherhood. I have assembled a kit that 
              is used in the crafting of Orc Slayer Mail. You must travel beyond 
              Neriak into the Nektulos Forest for the [materials] that compose 
              the armor. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what materials?' </p>
            <p>Issva H`Rugla says 'Many species of dangerous creatures, the walking 
              dead, and invading Deathfist Orcs inhabit the Nektulos Forest. You 
              must defeat these creatures and undead in order to obtain the materials. 
              The materials you seek depend on the piece of armor you desire. 
              Do you desire to craft [gauntlets], [boots], a [bracer], a [helm], 
              [greaves], [vambraces], or a [breastplate]? ' </p>
