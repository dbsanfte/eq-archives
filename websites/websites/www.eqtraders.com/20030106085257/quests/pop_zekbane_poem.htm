            <h3> Cleaving the Warlord - A Poem by Nherko E. Llafsnot </h3>
            <p>If ye have bested Tallon, <br>
              and Vallon, too (or not?), <br>
              then get thee down to Eriak, <br>
              and there ask him, &quot;What blood?&quot; </p>
            <p>He'll draw his blade and cut himself, <br>
              and spill for you his own, <br>
              now take this vial, mount your steed, <br>
              and ride to Saryrn's zone. </p>
            <p>Find you there her constructs, <br>
              of which there are four breeds, <br>
              Insanity Fangs they'll drop for you-- <br>
              these stasify your needs. </p>
            <p>Into the barrel--fangs and blood, <br>
              celestial solvent, too, <br>
              to get one of the tempers, <br>
              proceed you now to brew. </p>
            <p>Now off to Valor go with haste, <br>
              and ride up to the swamp, <br>
              o'er everything that spawns up there, <br>
              shall you proceed to romp. </p>
            <p>Valorium shards, no drop, take these! <br>
              but whatever you do, <br>
              be sure the one that takes 'em, <br>
              is someone who can brew. </p>
            <p>Then ride again to Knowledge, <br>
              and then much like before, <br>
              except without the blood, of course, <br>
              brew up one temper more. </p>
            <p>Now head on back to Tactics, <br>
              and take a bunch of friends, <br>
              for in its depths drops ore with which, <br>
              this Zek-Bane quest will end. </p>
            <p>Tagrin Maldric spawns down there, <br>
              a troll both big and bad, <br>
              kill him there--but not too fast! <br>
              because you'll need his adds. </p>
            <p>Smiths will loot his guardians, <br>
              these flying swords--Decorins, <br>
              then (with water) find a forge, <br>
              to put Decorin ore in. </p>
            <p>Drunder's Steel--that's the thing, <br>
              with which you'll end this trial-- <br>
              into the forge with proper molds, <br>
              and aforebrewed blue vial. </p>
            <p>Almost done! It's good so far, <br>
              but there is more to do! <br>
              forge it now with your black vial, <br>
              and so your quest concludes. <br>
            </p>
