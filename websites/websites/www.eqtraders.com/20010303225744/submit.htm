            <p>You'll find several areas of this site that have large gaps in 
              the information. I can't do/learn everything at once, so I'm asking 
              for help. The more folks who help, the more useful this site is 
              for everyone.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Basic trade skill information:</b> Articles on any trade 
                skill are welcome, but I'm especially looking for articles on 
                alchemy and tinkering at the moment.. Please <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">send 
                email</a> that contains the submission, as well as your character 
                name and server, and email address. (Please let me know if you'd 
                rather I didn't link in your email address-- I'll be happy to 
                oblige). Additionally, please send me any corrections/additions 
                you may have to posted information on the other trade skills. 
                Currently (Jan. 2001), there's a large backlog of trade guides, 
                to be posted. I hope to get to these soon.</li>
              <li><b>Locations for trade materials in each city and zone:</b> 
                If your favorite zone is missing items in my listings, and you'd 
                be willing to explore/document for me, please <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">send 
                email</a>. I'd like to have up-to-date lists for all zones that 
                have merchants, and this has already been a huge undertaking. 
                Even if you can only list information for a couple shops, every 
                little bit helps! However, please make sure you include <i>complete</i> 
                details. (zone name, merchant name, location and items sold)</li>
              <li><b>Merchants wanted!</b> You want to make money, I want to help 
                you hook up with players who need your goods. If you've got trade 
                items to sell, or a skill to offer (i.e., wedding services, weapon 
                sharpening, guide services) go to the message boards with your 
                ad. Please be sure to post in the relevant server folder and include 
                all relevant information, specifically what you are offering (i.e., 
                not just "I'm a tailor", but what types of tailored items you 
                can/will make), and your in-game name. And if you wish, include 
                your contact information in the post. (Please do not submit merchant 
                listings via email.)</li>
