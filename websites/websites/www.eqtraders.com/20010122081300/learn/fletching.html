<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I classify the trade skills 

  into two groups; moneymakers and RP skills. The moneymakers are the skills like 

  smithing and tailoring which have a high potential for turning a profit. The 

  RP skills are ones like baking and brewing which don&#146;t seem to have a whole 

  lot of effect on game play and, consequently, tend to be mainly practiced by 

  RPers. I place fletching firmly in the middle of the two groups. If you really 

  hustle, you can probably turn a profit with fletching but, in all probability, 

  it&#146;s really only worth working on if your character is big on archery.

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> That said, here are some 

  tips on becoming a master fletcher. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The nice thing about fletching 

  is that you&#146;re basically making two objects, &nbsp;bows and arrows, over 

  and over again. That makes it very easy to figure out the relative difficulty 

  of making a particular item. Basically, the higher the quality of your supplies, 

  i.e. the more expensive they are, the more difficult they are to work with. 

  If you seem to be getting a lot of failures with a particular type of arrow 

  or bow, try downgrading one or more of your components to something cheaper. 

  Please note that there isn&#146;t a direct correspondence between the cost of 

  arrows and bows and their relative difficulty. Rough hickory bows will be trivial 

  to make long before you&#146;re able to manufacture arrows costing several gp 

  apiece. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> How do you make bows and 

  arrows? The first thing you&#146;re going to need is a fletching kit. Then for 

  bows you&#146;ll need a bow staff, string, and, optionally, whittling knife, 

  planing tool, and/or cams. For arrows you&#146;ll need arrowheads, shafts, feathers, 

  and nocks. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When making bows, the 

  bow staff determines base damage, range, and delay. Your string modifies this. 

  The better quality the string, the less damage the bow does but the shorter 

  the delay. This means that a hickory bow with a linen string will do more damage 

  than a hickory bow with a silk string, but the bow with the silk string will 

  be faster. Whittling knives and planing tools decrease delay even more but reduce 

  damage as well. I&#146;m not sure what effect cams since I&#146;m not yet good 

  enough to make a bow that uses one but I imagine it&#146;s similar to strings, 

  whittling knives, and planing tools. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As for arrows, the better 

  the arrowhead, the more damage the arrow will do. Same for shafts, the better 

  quality the shaft is, the more damage the arrow does. Feathers modify range 

  and damage. Round cut feathers will give your arrow a base range of 50. Parabolic 

  cut feathers will increase the base range to 100. Shield cut feathers will reduce 

  base range to 0 but increase the base damage of the arrow. Nocks modify the 

  base range of the arrow so that the smaller, i.e. better, the nock the greater 

  the range of the arrow. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Making arrows is a tedious 

  process and at some point you will be tempted to try putting all of your arrowheads, 

  all of your shafts, all of your feathers, and all of your nocks into your fletching 

  kit at one time and pressing combine. Do NOT do this! No matter what quantity 

  you put in, you will only get one arrow out which means that all of your extra 

  material will be wasted. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Finally, when practicing 

  to raise your skill level, always work on arrows instead of bows. This is just 

  common sense. Arrows are far cheaper to make than bows so your mistakes will 

  be far less costly and you can make more attempts for the same amount of money. 

  Try to make bows every so often just to get an idea of how good you are with 

  them but for the most part, practice on arrows. </font>
