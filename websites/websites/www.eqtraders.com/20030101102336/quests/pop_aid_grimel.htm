            <h3> PoP: Aid Grimel Quest - For multi-GM tradeskillers<br>
            </h3>
            <p><i>This quest originates in the top of the Plane of Knowledge Library, 
              with Aid Grimel. It requires advanced planar flags for PoP zones, 
              multiple tradeskills over 200 (exact requirements listed below) 
              and, of course, the Planes of Power expansion. At this time, the 
              quest has not been fully completed, so additional details will be 
              added to this page as they become available. Discussion of this 
              quest can be found <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=76">on 
              the new message boards</a>.</i>

            <p>After Hailing Aid Grimel, he will mention that he needs someone 
              willing to help him who is a master of trades AND has travelled 
              the planes. In other words, you will need to meet a certain minimum 
              skill level in a tradeskill AND have been flagged for a certain 
              plane or two for each tradeskill quest he gives you. If you do not 
              have the appropriate planar flag yet, he will reply to you with:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Aid Grimel says 'I am sorry but one who has such limited knowledge 
                of the Planes would not be able to assist me.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If your skill does not meet the requirement, he will insult your 
              ability in the skill. It is unknown which response has priority. 
            </p>
            <p>This assumes that all combines are done in either a Planar kit 
              of some sort (i.e. Planar Fletching Kit, Planar Sewing Kit, etc) 
              or in a stationary container IN the Plane of Knowledge. </p>

                For some time afterwards my hand was crippled but Brell saw to 
                it I regained full use of it. The ring I used to wear was damaged 
                beyond repair and my hand was never steady enough to etch a new 
                one. If you would make me a new one by combing a mounted blue 
                diamond, the etching dust and etching tools in a jewelry kit. 
                Then take the faceted gem and combine it with a bar of pure enchanted

                velium bars are made by combing three enchanted velium bars in

                gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old 
                set of mine. If you are working with Royal Velium and want to 
                give it to someone else, you can use these etching tools and your 
                jewelers kit to engrave the piece for them. Be careful though, 
                because once the armor is engraved you cannot remove it and it 
                will be useless to the Dain. There is no need to return the tools,
