&nbsp;
<P>
T'was the night before Christmas, when all through the house<BR>
I shut off my PCs, stopped moving the mouse<BR>
My character was logged for the evening with care<BR>
In hopes that tomorrow, EQ would be there<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
The children were nestled all snug in their beds<BR>
As visions of Norrath danced in their heads<BR>
And mamma in her 'kerchief and I in my cap<BR>
Had just settled down for a long lag-free nap<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter<BR>
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter<BR>
With SOW to the window I flew like a flash<BR>
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow<BR>
Reminded me of Everfrost three days ago<BR>
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear<BR>
But a Everquest programmer and 8 guides in nice gear!<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
They morphed so fast I could barely even tell<BR>
But "an Aradune" came running at me like a bat outta hell<BR>
The others followed quickly, right by his side<BR>
As if they had tied on a rope and hitched for a ride<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
"Now LAG, and PACKETLOSS, and LINKDEAD, and WARPING<BR>
On BAD PATHING, on SEE THROUGH WALLS, on ZONE BUGS, and NERFING!<BR>
To the top of the porch to the tops of the walls!<BR>
Leave no one left standing and block off the halls!"<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly<BR>
The GM event started with Aradune's cry<BR>
Terror welled inside as he called out those names<BR>
For they meant certain death, and hours of pain<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof<BR>
An ice comet crash through and half my inventory went "poof"<BR>
My skin ignited, Ma writhed in pain<BR>
and my children all woke from "the sound of the game"<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Quickly we gathered and quickly we grouped<BR>
then buffed in a corner in a safe zone we knew<BR>
The children all readied their K00L DeWd SpellZ<BR>
Cuz everyone knew they were powergamers from hell<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
I readied my SOW and I readied my DOT<BR>
Ma readied her debuffs, drank a potion she bought<BR>
I happened to notice we were not ready yet<BR>
So in a brief moment I charmed our dog for a pet<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Waiting and ready to slay the new foes<BR>
(and maybe get some nice wisdom boots to wear on my toes)<BR>
We charged outside not risking the hall<BR>
And noticed that Lag was the slowest of all<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
We laughed at the victim of his own design<BR>
And quickly dispatched him, he could not react in time<BR>
Packetloss was next and fell with ease<BR>
Hopping around and jerking then falling to his knees<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Warping came at us, a mighty foe!<BR>
He would drop on top of us wherever we would go!<BR>
My thorns on the children helped with the blows<BR>
and their channeling helped them fell Warping in the snow<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Bad Pathing came at us, but funny to say<BR>
Stood running in circles 10 feet away<BR>
Ma whipped out her burns and I sent in the dog<BR>
And Bad Pathing disappeared as in rolled the fog<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
INTO THE HOUSE! I cried as we all ran inside<BR>
But See Through Walls was ready and caught us from behind!<BR>
I snared him "Resist" even though he was green<BR>
He punched me for two, he wasn't too mean<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
I spun to meet him and laughed in his face,<BR>
Put away my paw and whipped out my mace<BR>
Ma made him whirl and mesmerized his butt<BR>
Then I finished him off with the family mutt<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Zone Bugs was next but we could not find....<BR>
Probably crashed to desktop when crossing that line<BR>
We bravely waited for the last of them to show....<BR>
When push came to shove the most terrible foe<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Nerfing came at us with some kind of spell<BR>
And I was told all my magic had now gone to hell!<BR>
My snare was resisted, mana cost doubled!<BR>
Now that my DOT's did half I knew I was in trouble!<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Ma couldn't mesmerize and her pet had been weakened<BR>
her buffs didn't stack and our trouble now deepened<BR>
The children's armor from all of the planes<BR>
Had their stats changed to things just insane!<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
A wizard robe that adds 15 CHA<BR>
and Magician's cap that adds 15 STA?<BR>
Their Jboots were gone and mana stones too<BR>
Without these items, what were they to do?<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
I desperately tried to hit Nerf with my mace<BR>
He laughed and shot lightning right in my face<BR>
Ma got off a mes and I blinded him good<BR>
and the children started blasting as hard as they could<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Ma had used tashania and I'll be willing to bet<BR>
That was one thing Nerf hadn't gotten to yet<BR>
He lost all control and then nerfed himself<BR>
slashing for 32,000 after running for help<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
We all gazed in awe as "an Aradune" stood there<BR>
staring at us with a bone chilling stare<BR>
"You've ruined my minions! You've tarnished these lands!<BR>
but EQ will be better from the work of your hands!"<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
With a flick of his hand the GMs appeared<BR>
No longer posing as the foes that for months we had feared<BR>
Gifts were given, as reward for helping<BR>
A fine steel short sword and some ridiculous elf thing<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Spare shields from Hate Plane were all passed around<BR>
Since Erudite Paladins can never be found<BR>
And the only one who got anything nifty?<BR>
My level 3 daughter... A Butcherblock hammer that wont work 'till 50!<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Aradune then donned spirit of Norrath and gave his team a whistle<BR>
And away he flew like a SOW'ed missile<BR>
But I heard him exclaim as he ran out of sight<BR>
"MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!"
