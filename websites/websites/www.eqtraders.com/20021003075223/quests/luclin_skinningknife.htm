              from the pit surrounding Shar Vahl) and return the filled bag to 
              Broker Fahaar to receive a leather cord (no drop) and a stretched 
              hopperhide. Repeat. Return 4 cords to and receive a <b>Vah Shir

                ____. Merchant Fahaar told me you were quite the prodigy, but 
                don't tell him I told you that. Take this receipt and show it 
                to Fahaar and tell him the king is quite pleased with both your 
                work, and his teaching! ' </p>

                and the king is pleased. You have been a great help to me filling 
                that order for the king. Here, take this jerkin and wear it with 
                pride. All who see it will know that you are an accomplished tailor 
                and a friend of Fareen! ' </p>
