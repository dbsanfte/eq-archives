            <h3> Shar Vahl - Progressive Smithing Quest</h3>
            <p>Purchase a carapace shield frame from Master Barkhem in Shar Vahl. 
              Fill it with 8 small bloodling carapaces and combine. Hand the result 
              to Master Barkhem and he gives you a bloodling carapace plate. Repeat 
              the quest a second time. Then combine two bloodling carapace plates 
              with nepeta oil extract (<a href="../location/shar_vahl.htm">merchant 
              sold</a>) and a (medium) sectional mail mold in the forge. Hand 
              the completed <i>Bloodling Plate Mail</i> tunic to Master Barkhem. 
              He will return the tunic and give you a <b>Vah Shir apprentice mallet 
              </b>(no drop, lore)<b>.</b> (Bloodling Plate Mail: AC 13, sv disease 
              1, wt 7.5; WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD BRD ROG SHM; HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE 
              DEF HEF IKS VAH) Should you ever lose your apprentice mallet, you 
              may hand in the tunic again to receive another one.</p>
            <p>Then ask Master Barkhem &quot;what repair order?&quot; He will 
              give you a (lore) work order to repair the shields of the 4 bridge 
              guards (the two guards on the far end of the North and South Bridges). 
              Hand the note to one of the proper guards. (Make <i>absolutely sure</i> 
              before you hand in the note to the guard, that the guard's shield 
              is visible. If you cannot see their shield, then someone else is 
              running the quest with that guard, and handing in the note to that 
              guard will cause him/her to despawn.) The guard will give you a 
              dented shield, which starts the timed portion of this quest. Combine 
              the dented shield and the Vah Shir apprentice mallet in the forge. 
              (If you fail the combine, you must let the timer run out before 
              you try to repair another shield for him, as he'll think you already 
              have his shield, and will depop on you if you try to hand him another 
              note.) A successful combine will return an Immaculate Shield, and 
              lists the guard's name in the description, so that you remember 
              your delivery target. Return the shield to the guard to receive 
              a completed repair order. If the guard already has a shield on him, 
              you either took too long, or something caused the guard to respawn. 
              You will need to have someone else hand in a work order to that 
              guard so that you may then give the guard the Immaculate Shield. 
              <i>(Note: while the despawning problem has been reported as &quot;fixed&quot;, 
              there are apparently still issues with guards despawning, respawning.)</i> 
              Trivials are as follows: Bohk's Immaculate Shield -- triv 31; Koby's 
              Immaculate Shield -- triv 31; Jasir's Immaculate Shield -- triv 
              31; Aihjin's Immaculate Shield -- triv 34 </p>
            <p>Repeat the above paragraph four times, one for each of the four 
              guards, until you have completed work orders for all four guards. 
              Then give the 4 completed work orders back to the Master Barkhem 
              and he will give you a spirit anchor anvil, called a <b>Vah Shir 
              Anvil</b> (no drop, lore).</p>
            <p>After a bit more conversation with Master Barkhem, you can learn 
              about making <b>shadow disks</b>. He will give you an 8-slot &quot;Barkhem's 
              Box&quot; in which to combine 8 shadow disks. The disks are made 
              by combining the following in a forge: swirling shadows <em>(drop 
              off shades in Shadeweaver's Thicket; greater/lesser shadows in Twilight 
              Sea and Xi Xau in Maiden's Eye and Akheva)</em>, metal bits, your 
              Vah Shir Anvil and your Vah Shir Apprentice Mallet. (You receive 
              the anvil and hammer back during the forging.) Trivial for this 
              combine is 108. </p>
            <p>Return the filled and combined box back to Master Barkhem along 
              with your Apprentice Mallet and receive a <b>luclinite hammer</b> 
              (no drop, just like pretty much every other quest tool for these 
              quests). Then make 3 <b>humming orb</b>s using the following recipe: 
              wailing substance (from grimy owlbears in Paludal Caverns), shrieking 
              substance (from sonic wolves), metal rings, Vah Shir Anvil, Luclinite 
              Mallet. (Again, you receive the anvil and mallet back during the 
              forging.) </p>
            <p>Return 3 humming orbs and your luclinite hammer to Master Barkhem 
              for a <b>humming luclinite mallet</b> (no drop), with which you 
              can make shadowscream steel armor. </p>
            <p>If you are a glutton for punishment and are willing to loop this 
              ad nauseum, ask Master Barkhem &quot;what boots&quot; and he will 
              task you with delivering a pair of boots to Rakutah (leader of the 
              rogue guild in Shar Vahl). Giving the boots to Ratukah will cause 
              him to give you a 6-slot quest container and the boots. He asks 
              you to fill the box with 6 pairs of shadowscream steel boots. Boots 
              are made with the following recipe (in a forge): 2 swirling shadows, 
              humming luclinite hammer, vah shir anvil, humming orb, (medium) 
              banded boot mold, water flask (Trivial &gt;239). Completion of this 
              quest gives you postive faction with the Guardians of Shar Vahl, 
              as well as <b>Ratukah's Seal</b> (lore, no drop).</p>
            <p>Return the seal to Master Barkhem and he gives you a pair of <b>Barkhem's 
              Fancy Pantaloons</b> (lore, no orop) STR 4, STA 2, WIS 2, SvMagic 
              10, Wt 4.0 WAR ROG SHM BST; VAH, BAR, TRL, OGR, IKS (note there 
              is no AC to them). While Barkhem seems to indicate that there may 
              be other things he may teach you in the future, there did not appear 
              to be a continuation to this quest at this time.</p>
