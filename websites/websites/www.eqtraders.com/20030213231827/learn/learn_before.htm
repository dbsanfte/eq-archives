            <p class="headers"> <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20001101"><img src="../pics/gu_11012000.jpg" width="200" height="300" border="0" align="left"></a>Before 
              you start ... <span class="headers">A few words from Niami </span></p>
            <p>If you've never tried a trade skill before, there are a several 
              things that you should know.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The standard, or &quot;main&quot; tradeskills are: Baking, Brewing, 
                Fletching, Jewelcraft, Tailoring and Smithing. All other tradeskills 
                are restricted to certain races (tinkering), certain classes (alchemy, 
                make poison, research), or are level capped (fishing). The standard 
                skills could, theoretically, be raised to 250 by a level 1 character, 
                but we don't recommend it. ;)</li>
              <li>Remember that training points can <i>only</i> be spent on trade 
                skills early on. Once you hit a skill of 21 in the standard trade 
                skills, you MUST gain skill increases through hands-on-practice.</li>
              <li>While your skill in the various tradeskills in EQ increase with 
                practice, they can cost you quite a bit of money (in supplies), 
                regardless of success or failure. For the more expensive skills 
                (such as jewelcraft), it's wise to not only stockpile some money 
                in advance, but also spend the training points to get to skill 
                20 before trying the skill. </li>
              <li>Low-level players: Before you even train in a trade skill, you 
                should check to be sure that the materials you will need to practice 
                your skill <a href="../supplies.htm">are available nearby</a>. 
                If they are not easily available, you have to make a hard decision 
                -- do you want to try the skill anyway or do you want to try another 
                trade skill? For example, if you want to bake, and the only baking 
                supplies within the nearest several zones are batwings, you'll 
                realize you're going to be running through a lot of zones to get 
                some of your more basic supplies. This isn't meant to discourage 
                you, but to make sure you don't spend a lot of training points 
                before you realize the scope of the task ahead of you. (Higher 
                level players tend to move around a lot, so this isn't as much 
                of an issue for them.) </li>
              <li>When you see mention of a "trivial" on a chart, it means that 
                at that skill level, you will no longer gain skill increases from 
                making the item. You will, however, still continue to fail quite 
                a bit when making the item. Just because something is trivial 
                does not mean you can do it in your sleep. Eventually, as your 
                skill improves, your chance of failing at making the item will 
                decrease, but there's generally <b>always</b> a chance of failure. 
                <i>(silk swatches and silk thread are an exception to this)</i>. 
                In addition, there are many spots on the recipes pages where items 
                are listed as &lt;=X or &gt;Y (or a combination of the two). Please 
                remember that: &quot;&lt;=&quot; means <b>less than or equal to</b> 
                -- all we know about the trivial is that someone of <i>X</i> skill 
                attempted the item and it was already trivial. It may be that 
                the trivial is 1 point below it, or it may be 100 points below. 
                The only way we find such trivials is by folks reporting in their 
                skill levels and trivial status after they make combine attempts. 
                Similarly, if you see &quot;&gt;&quot;, it means<b> greater than</b> 
                -- someone at <i>Y</i> skill attempted the combine, and it was 
                not trivial. Again, there's no way to easily tell if the trivial 
                is 1 point or 100 points above that in trivial unless folks actually 
                report in their results.</li>
              <li>If you fail to make an item, <i>regardless of your skill level</i>, 
                you will receive a message &quot;You lack the skill to fashion 
                these items together&quot; (or something to that effect). ALL 
                this message means is that you failed to make the item <i>(see 
                the mention above about trivials and the fact that things can 
                always fail, regardless of skill)</i>. <b>Failure to make an item 
                does NOT indicate whether an item is trivial or not.</b></li>
              <li>If you're getting a failure rate that will rapidly bankrupt 
                you, find something that trivials closer to your current skill 
                to practice on. (i.e., don't try to make a silver sapphire necklace 
                the first time you try jewelcraft). </li>
              <li>For everything but fishing, sell your goods to other players 
                as opposed to NPC merchants where possible. If you sell to NPCs, 
                you rarely will be paid what the raw materials cost you, much 
                less the value of the item. For example, you'd get slightly over 
                1 gold for a piece of patchwork armor, when sold to an NPC merchant. 
                The going rate when selling directly to players is generally 2 
                gold or so, depending on supply/demand and individual whimsy. 
              </li>
              <li>When a recipe calls for two or more of a single item,<b> DO 
                NOT STACK the items</b>. Have two (or more) single pieces of the 
                item in your forge, brew barrel, etc., not one pile of two. Regardless 
                of recent patch messages, many stacked items count as a single 
                item! If you put a stack of 20 of an item in the tradeskill container 
                during a combine, the container can count them as a single item, 
                and &quot;eat&quot; the extra.</li>
              <li>The main trade skills are not level-capped, meaning that with 
                enough time and raw materials, you could master the tradeskill 
                at level 1. Other special skills, such as fishing, make poison, 
                and alchemy are limited based on your level, just like your combat 
                and other skills. </li>
              <li><b>Grandmaster: </b>Grandmaster (GM) in a tradeskill is <i>generally</i> 
                considered someone with a skill of 200+ in a specific tradeskill. 
                Of the 7 <u>main</u> tradeskills (baking, brewing, fletching, 
                jewelcraft, pottery, smithing, tailoring) you may <b>only</b> 
                have one of them above 200 (up to 250), while the rest are capped 
                at 200. Some folks reserve the grandmaster title only for folks 
                who have obtained skill 250 in their tradeskill of choice</li>
              <li>Specialized tradeskills are capped separately. Regardless of 
                whether another skill is above 200 or not, other specialized tradeskills 
                are as follows: Alchemy 130 before level 51, 180 at 51+; Poison 
                Making 200 pre-51, 250 post-51; Tinkering 250, Fishing 200</li>
            </ul>
