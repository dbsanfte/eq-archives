            <h5><i>by Verdandi Snowblood</i></h5>
            This 
              is not a complete list of every single being in Norrath who drops 
              racial meat. It is intended rather as a guide to some of the best 
              places where racial meats can be found. Keep in mind that most of 
              the named folk listed are not necessarily up all the time. Some 
              of the parts listed here cannot yet be baked into anything but are 
              included here in case they should ever be added. Other races, like 
              barbarians, fight far to fiercely to ever get anything usable in 
              the unlikely event that they should succumb. So, if a race is not 
              listed here at all, you can safely assume that you'll never get 
              meat off of them. There may also be some inconsistencies in the 
              name of the parts. For some races it may be called meat or flesh. 
              I tried to use the right name here but could not verify all of them 
              first, so do not be alarmed if you find yourself looting Gnome Meat 
              or some such. Whether flesh, meat, or parts, it should still work. 
            <p> If you have corrections or know of additional drop locations, 
              please report them in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=10">Baking 
              Forum</a>. <b> Please only report drops that you can personally 
              confirm </b> because not every creature of a given race will drop 
              parts. For example, the halflings in Nektulos Forest do NOT drop 
              halfling parts. Also, this list does not include brownie parts (or 
              frost giant or siren, etc.) because they are not one of the playable 
              races and therefore don't make you a cannibal. You can still discuss 
              how to find them in the Baking Forum. Be sure to scan the last few 
              pages of posts first, however, as you're probably not the first 
              person who wants to know. 
            <p> As a last tip, just because they taste good doesn't mean that 
              they might not be generally nice and useful people, right? So if 
              you want to stay in the good graces of the race that's on your menu, 
              it is important to be selective in which of their kin you go after. 
              Do a little research, you can often find rebels and bandits who 
              have been outcast by their home city. Sometimes you will even become 
              better liked in their home city for having taken out these embarrassments 
              to society. Likewise, if you have no desire to enter the city but 
              would like to be able to associate freely with the outcasts, center 
              your hunting efforts on the more respectable members of that race. 
              And of course, don't forget to check vendors in the area of the 
              creatures that drop the meat you want in case another hunter sold 
              some. For example, vendors in East Karana almost always have some 
              halfling parts off of the spiders, while wood elf vendors in Kelethin 
              often have wood elf parts from the bandits nearby.
