            <h3>Shar Vahl - Progressive Fletching Quest</h3>
            <p>The Shar Vahl fletching quests start with merchant Rytan (in the 
              southwest corner of Shar Vahl at loc -403, 410). Hail him and he 
	      says, </p>
            <blockquote>Hello ____, I trust all is well with you today. Come in 
              and have a look around, just let me know if you see anything you like. 
              By the way, I am in need of the assistance of an official Shar Vahl 
              citizen. If you know of any please send them my way.</blockquote>
            <p>Say "I am a citizen.", and he responds, </p>
            <blockquote>Wonderful! Please, show me your acrylia slate and I'll 
              disclose my errand.</blockquote>
            <p>Be sure you have a main inventory slot open, give him your acrylia 
              slate, and he tells you, </p>
            <blockquote>Here's my dilemma, I am low on darts to sell and I need to 
              replenish my supply. I simply cannot break away from the store so I 
              require your help. Fill this bag with xakra teeth and return the sealed 
              bag to me. With those teeth I can make six darts and I'll give you 
              three.</blockquote>
            <p>Go into the pit and kill xakra larvae for their teeth (NO DROP), an 
              uncommon drop.  Fill the bag with six of these teeth, press the combine 
              button, and it turns into the sealed bag. Return this to Rytan and he 
              says, </p>
            <blockquote>Here are the three darts I promised you and a seal of mine. 
              I need more darts desperately, so show me your acrylia slate to take 
              another bag and fill it as you are able. Collect four of my seals and 
              show them to me. I will reward you by revealing my method of dart 
              construction. <br>You gain experience!!</blockquote>
            <p>and he gives you his sea, three Xakra tooth darts, and a small 
              amount of experience. Do this three more times, and then give him 
              the four seals that he has given you. 
            <p>
            <blockquote>'I thank you for your continued assistance, ____. Here is 
              a fletching tool that will enable you to fashion xakra tooth darts. 
              You will first need to acquire a grimling skeletal femur and place it 
              in a fletching kit with the tool. This will result in three bone shafts. 
              Place a bone shaft, a xakra tooth and this tool in the fletching kit to 
              make a dart. When your fletching skill no longer increases by making 
              these darts you may give me your crafting tool and I will help you to 
              upgrade it. '<br>
              You gain experience!!</blockquote>
            <p>and you receive a <b>Xakra Dart Crafting Tool</b> (LORE, NO DROP). 
              This is used for making both the Grimling Bone Shafts and Xakra 
              tooth darts. Trivial for this tool is &lt;=46.</p>
            <p>Combine it in your fletching kit with a Skeletal Grimling Femur 
              (NO DROP, from grimling skeletons) to get 3 Grimling Bone Shafts 
              (NO DROP). Combine it with one of these Grimling Bone Shafts and 
              a Xakra tooth (NO DROP) to get a <b><a 
              href="../secrets/recipes_fletching.htm#luclin">Xakra tooth dart</a></b> 
              (Dmg: 4, Dly: 26, Range: 75, Class: ALL, Race: BAR TRL OGR IKS VAH). 
            </p>
            <p>When you're satisfied that you have enough Xakra tooth darts, or they 
              become trivial for you to make, hand the Xakra Dart Crafting Tool to 
              merchant Rytan and he tells you, </p>
            <blockquote>'I assume you are ready to make more challenging darts. Very 
              well, attach this shaft to your crafting tool in a fletching kit and 
              you will be able to make grimling fang darts. Keep in mind that once 
              this is done you will lose the ability to craft xakra tooth darts. When 
              the grimling fang darts become trivial you may wish to upgrade your 
              tool again by giving me the grimling dart crafting tool. '<br>
              You say, 'What grimling fang darts?'<br>
              Rytan says 'A grimling fang combined with a bone shard will make a dart 
              slightly better than the xakra tooth dart, which will also sell for 
              slightly more <i>(odd, since they're NO DROP)</i>. '</blockquote>
            <p>and he returns your Xakra Dart Crafting Tool and gives you a Crafting 
              Tool Hook Attachment (LORE, NO DROP) along with it. Combine these 
              in your fletching kit, and if you succeed, you get the <b><a 
              href="../secrets/recipes_fletching.htm#luclin">Grimling Dart Crafting 
              Tool</a></b> (LORE, NO DROP). Trivial for the combine is &lt;=46 
              <i>(I assume that if you fail, you get the Xakra Dart Crafting Tool 
              back, and can get another attachment to combine with it.) </i></p>
            <p>This tool can make Grimling Bone Shafts just like the Xakra tool 
              could, but can not be used to make Xakra tooth darts. Instead, combine 
              the Grimling Bone Shaft with this tool and a Grimling fang (NO DROP, 
              from grimling runts to receive a <b><a href="../secrets/recipes_fletching.htm#luclin">Grimling 
              Fang Dart</a></b> (NO DROP, Skill: Archery, Dmg: 7, Dly: 0, Range: 
              85, Class: ALL, Race: BAR TRL OGR IKS VAH). </p>
            <p>When you're ready to move on from making Grimling Fang Darts, hand 
              your Grimling Dart Crafting Tool to Rytan and he says, </p>
            <blockquote>Your skill is increasing rapidly, ____. Here is a hook to 
              place on the end of your crafting tool that will enable you to fashion 
              rockhopper talon darts. Once the tool is modified it will not be able to 
              make other types of darts. When creating rockhopper talon darts becomes 
              trivial to you, feel free to give it to me for another upgrade. '<br>
              You say, 'What rockhopper talon darts?'<br>
              Rytan says 'Rockhopper talon darts are slightly better than grimling 
              fang darts and will sell for a little more <i>(There he goes with the 
              price again.)</i>. The hooked dart crafting tool and a rockhopper foot 
              will yield three of these darts. '</blockquote>
            <p>and you get your Grimling Dart Crafting Tool back, and a Crafting 
              Tool Hook Attachment (LORE, NO DROP). Combine these (trivial &lt;=46), 
              and upon success, you get a <b><a href="../secrets/recipes_fletching.htm#luclin"> 
              Rockhopper Dart Crafting Tool</a></b> (LORE, NO DROP). </p>
            <p>To make a <b><a 
              href="../secrets/recipes_fletching.htm#luclin">Rockhopper Talon 
              Dart</a></b> (NO DROP, Dmg: 10, Dly: 0, Range: 95), combine this 
              tool in your fletching kit with a rockhopper foot (LORE, NO DROP, 
              so make your dart before hunting more rockhoppers) (these drop from 
              rockhoppers in Hollowshade Moore, not to be confused with the rockhopper 
              claw from the ones in the Pit). </p>
            <p>When you are done making Rockhopper Talon Darts, give the tool to 
              Rytan again, and he says </p>
            <blockquote>'Here is a special handle to attach to your crafting tool. 
              This is the final improvement to your tool and will enable you to craft 
              owlbear feather darts. These darts are superior to even the rockhopper 
              darts and are magical. Take your modified tool and combine it with an 
              owlbear feather in your fletching kit. May your new skill serve you 
              well, ____. '</blockquote>
            <p>and you get back your Rockhopper Dart Crafting Tool and a Crafting 
              Tool Handle Attachment (LORE, NO DROP). Combine these in the fletching 
              kit to make your Owlbear Dart Crafting Tool (guess what? LORE, NO 
              DROP. And it says "Deity: Bertoxxulous"?!?). Trivial &lt;=48. Use 
              this in your fletching kit with an Owlbear Feather (neither LORE 
              nor NO DROP, and they stack!) to make an Owlbear Feather Dart (Dmg: 
              12, Dly: 0, Range: 120, trivial &gt;120 &lt;=139). As Rytan said, 
              there are no further improvements; the quest stops here. </p>
