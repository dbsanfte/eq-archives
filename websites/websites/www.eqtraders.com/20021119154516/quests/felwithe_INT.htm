            <h3>Art Keepers Armor - Felwithe INT Quest</h3>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Felwithe. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, HIE,WIZ/MAG/ENC 
              only. They are no-fail tailoring combines. The armor is green (varying 
              shades) in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, 
              the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before 
              you get the parts for a second one</i></p>

              Although much can be learned within these halls there is no substitute 
              for experiences gained in the world outside Felwithe. The Koada'Dal

              them. If you are new to the Keepers of the Art I will assist you

            <P>You say, 'what another task'<BR>
              Yuin Starchaser says 'One of the responsibilities of the Keepers 
              of the Art is to weave and maintain powerful magic wards that help 
              protect Felwithe from enemy magic. An understanding of the magic 
              wielded by Felwithes many foes is vital to the success of our protective 
              wards. With the help of the paladins of the Koada'Vie we have discovered 
              many of the secrets of the orcish shaman that reside in the citadel 
              of Clan Crushbone to the north of the Faydarks but there is still 
              much to learn. The task I have to present you will take you into 
              the [Crushbone Citadel] itself.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'what crushbone citadel'<BR>
              Yuin Starchaser says 'The entrance to the Citadel can be found on 
              the northern edge of the Greater Faydark. Once within the citadel 
              seek out the Orc Thaumaturgist and obtain his book of spells. Once 
              you are in possession of the Orc Thaumaturgists Spell Book return 
              it to me so that the masters of the Keepers of the Art may study 
              its contents.' 
            <P>Return the spellbook to receive a &quot;Rough Art Keepers Initiate 
              Staff&quot; which has no stats and is not a weapon (and is a small 
              item). He then asks you to return to him once you've found a pristine 
              forest drakeling scale and an arborean amber. Hand in the staff, 
              the pristine forest drakling scale and the arborean amber to recieve 
              the following reward:
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Art Keeper Initiate Staff, 8 dmg, 34 dly, +2 int, +1 cha, Magic 
                2hb</p>
