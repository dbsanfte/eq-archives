  17:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The front 
  page has most of the news, but for those of you who wandered here as well, I'm 
  still here, I'm still alive, but I'm beyond burnt out, and a bit overwhelmed 
  by the sheer volume of email and posts to be handled each week. Please have 
  patience as I try to catch up on things and I figure out what, if anything, 
  can be delegated.</font>
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#400000">December 
  10:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Velious is 
  here, and I'm ready to pull my hair out. There's a TON of places to explore 
  for new merchants, I was backlogged badly before the new zones opened, and I 
  am falling further behind. Please a) have patience if things don't go up quickly, 
  and b) remember to provide full details when you find new merchants or ground 
  spawns. I'm trying to get my level 35 enchantress safely over to some of the 
  new merchants in out-of-the-way places, but anyone who's been to Velious knows 
  how agro everything is over there, so it's a risky proposition. (My 51 shammie 
  is much safer on the exploration, but in places like the crystal caves, she's 
  dubious, with no <i>quick</i> way to raise her faction.)</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I also need 
  to find, in the next few weeks (in between houseguests, and more holiday travel) 
  a new web hosting provider, and it sounds like I'm going to need a passable 
  amount of space if I'm going to consider doing screen shots of a fashion archive. 
  The site redesign will likely be implemented during the server move, once I've 
  got a new hosting provider, and I am looking for advertisers as well. (Yep, 
  after not quite 2 years of funding this site out of my own pocket as a one-person 
  operation, I'm going to *try* to expand to meet demand, which means I need to 
  start having the site pay for itself.)</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On the plus 
  side of things however, Niami finally hit 49 in the midst of all this chaos, 
  and is cradling her brand-new ressurrection spell gleefully. Woot.</font>

  15:</font></b> The harder I work, the behinder I get. {gibber} I'm definitely 
  hitting tradeskill burnout, and I'm not as fast on processing email and message 
  board posts as I used to be ... so of course, this patch added still more to 
  update and change.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As of about 
  an hour after the servers came back up today, I can tell you that: a) wood elves 
  have mithril leather recipes now, but not only is the book bugged on the servers 
  (Yakatizma provided the details until that can be fixed), but also the recipe 
  for the fier'dal sewing kit is also bugged; b) halflings have cultural leathers 
  as well, but we've not figured out all parts of the recipes yet; c) trivials 
  for fine steel have changed and we don't know new numbers yet (there was a difference 
  in trivials for the various sizes before this patch); d) I've heard nothing 
  on any of the reported new ring combinations or the ornate chain. Updates will 
  be provided as we get them.</font>

  30:</font></b> It's been a busy several weeks, and while the insanity has slowed 
  down to a dull roar, I expect there to be more changes to things after tomorrow's 
  patch. I'm still a bit behind on some of the nigglies, and we're still working 
  on redesign ideas, but we'll get there.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We've got 
  a lovely new <a href="learn/poison.html">poison guide</a> in place at long last. 
  I've also got a jewelcraft and pottery submission that I still need to process, 
  and hope to get them up soon.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A couple folks 
  have responded to our logo contest, but we've not found anything that leaps 
  out and grabs us yet. My hubby has joined Brynne in working on reworking the 
  navigation (buttons, etc.) and other basic content style changes while I'm still 
  scrambling to keep all the information current. Once we're ready to release 
  that portion of the redesign, I'll be banned from site updates for a couple 
  days while they work their magic. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the meantime, 
  however, <b><font color="#400000">some recipe/location pages are changing daily</font></b>, 
  so if your printouts are more than a week old, they may not have all the current 
  information. That's the price of progress, I fear.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The ornate 
  chain book for the &quot;anysmith&quot; chain has been found, but it's still 
  got us stumped. Folks on the test server report a LOT of ring recipes that don't 
  currently work on the live servers, but they're still stumped on finding a working 
  recipe. We don't know how much tomorrow's patch will help, but one can always 
  hope. Discussion/debate/moans/wails and whimpers, plus probably a few primal 
  screams here and there, can be found on the message boards. I've pulled all 
  the ornate chain threads into their own forum to make it easier to sort through.</font>

  13:</b> <a href="secrets/fishing.html">Fishing lure</a> recipes were put in 
  place a few days ago, thanks to feedback from many intrepid fishermen. We're 
  still trying to figure out if the lures grant any advantages in fishing, so 
  keep an eye on the DenMother's Corner section of the message board for details. 
  After a bad insomnia night, I decided to tackle splitting the new <a href="secrets/armorstats.html">smithed 
  armor stats</a> and <a href="secrets/weaponstats.html">smithed weapon stats</a> 
  off onto their own pages. Not all info is there yet, but it's a definite step 
  in the right direction. Anyone out there want to compile a similar list of stats 
  for the various tailored armors? :)</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Brynne is 
  back! After many months of silence as she's been busy with other projects, my 
  web designer has come out of hiding and is working on a totally new redesign 
  for this site (we all agree it's kind of ... blah ... after a while.) While 
  I've asked her to make sure that things still print nicely (a necessity with 
  many of the recipes and trade supply lists), I've basically turned her loose 
  to see what my evil twin will come up with for ideas. She's asked for help in 
  coming up with a new logo for the site, and while we can't promise anything 
  more than our eternal thanks, it may give some budding graphics designer a nice 
  resume builder. <a href="logorules.html">Contest rules can be found here</a>.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Please be 
  aware that I'm generally spending a couple hours per day, on average, just processing 
  email and posts from the site. This not only cuts down on my testing time, and 
  my play time, but means I have a lot less &quot;oomph&quot; to personally answer 
  every single email and post. Thanks for your understanding on this if your email 
  is one that didn't get a personal (or timely) response.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've received 
  a couple lovely trade skill guides recently, and hope to have them on the site 
  next week. I still need an hour or so of quite time to read them all thoroughly, 
  and then time to format them, etc.</font>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">September 
  30:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> New non-alcoholic 
  brewing recipes have been found in a newly-added recipe book.(Thanks, Ikipu!) 
  Experimentation has already verified several more recipes, based on the guidelines 
  provided within it. As more recipes are verified, the <a href="secrets/brewing.html" target="mainright">brewing 
  recipes</a> page will grow. Wood elves now have a cultural forge and a few recipes 
  for <a href="secrets/woodelf.html" target="mainright">mithril weapons</a> have 
  been determined (thanks, Snowscale!) Slowly, we're getting information on various 
  cultural smithing items (stats, recipe verifications, etc.) Sometimes the recipes 
  pages will change hourly, as I try to get you the most up-to-date information. 
  A good rule of thumb before you're about to sign on for a trade skill session 
  is to check the recipes page first, then quickly browse through the message 
  boards, in case there's something on there I've not had a chance to web yet.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My mailbox 
  and the message board are still very active with recipe corrections and additions. 
  However, I'm starting to notice a disturbing trend. I've received several emails 
  and seen several posts announcing something &quot;new&quot; or something &quot;broken&quot;, 
  when they *correct* information has been on my site for several days (or longer). 
  I can't control what other sites put up for recipes &lt;grin&gt;, so if you 
  find something that doesn't work, be sure you got the information from my site 
  before you report it to me. If my site has it wrong, by all means, <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">let 
  me know</a> so I can fix it! :)</font>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  27:</b> The patch was finally completed, and yours truly went on a sleep deprivation 
  binge in order to get new, correct, information onto the site. There are still 
  missing recipes, the cultural recipes section needs cleaning up, etc., but a 
  LOT of information is now available. We now have fully verified temper recipes 
  from numerous sources, we know which dye extracts are currently not working, 
  other recipes and rumors are being chased down, and the dust is finally settling. 
  I'm working on a page that will show what the <a href="secrets/dysample.html" target="mainright">various 
  dyes look like</a>, and will be starting housekeeping on the <a href="secrets/culture.html" target="mainright">cultural 
  recipes</a>, so that the individual pages are easier to read. Any new smithing 
  recipes that are not cultural in origin (limited to being made by a specific 
  race), will be on the <a href="secrets/advanced_smith.html" target="mainright">advanced smithing</a> 
  page. A LOT of active discussion is going on in the message boards, including 
  talk of fishing and possible uses for the tacklebox, a discussion of Cabilis 
  hints on some unique recipes over there, folks trying to sort out the entire 
  enchant/imbue concept as it applies to armor, etc., etc. Stop on over, ask a 
  question, share your knowledge ... the more we share, the more we all can learn 
  about new recipes that are being discovered almost daily. </font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My many, many, 
  thanks to all who have helped make this huge patch more manageable. From adopting 
  zones and checking merchants, to posting recipes, to providing feedback on trivials 
  and broken recipes and more, your help is making this site a truly useful resource 
  to folks working on tradeskills. Keep up the lovely work!</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  13:</b> The patch has been delayed until Friday, but I am beyond heartened at 
  the folks who have been stepping forward to help verify merchant offerings after 
  the patch. It will save me a lot of time and effort.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I'm going 
  to sit back and try to breathe for a day or two before the patch now that I'm 
  done with my RL scramble to get things ready. Over the weekend, my hubby and 
  a guildmate scrambled to get me more ready for the post-patch site mayhem. Since 
  our cablemodem ISP only allows us a limited number of IP addy's, and all three 
  were in use, they got me set up behind a router so that I could add a second 
  machine in my &quot;office&quot;. (My old PC, with a total brainwipe/reformat). 
  Now, I can finally be exploring in EQ, and be able to not only call up the site 
  to verify things, but be able to edit on-the-fly while still in-game. This should 
  save a tree or two a year, as it means I'll not be having to scribble on the 
  nearest slip of paper every time I find a new merchant that needs to be added 
  to the site. :) ... and I type MUCH faster than I write, too. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Anyway, we 
  seem to be in good shape for the merchant listing end of the post-patch mayhem. 
  The recipes section is going to be in upheaval for a while, as there are a LOT 
  of new recipes, and cross-skill recipes that need to go in. As always, I'm not 
  even thinking of touching them until we're sure they've gone live.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Thought 
  for the day: You know you're an EQ junkie when you schedule your chiropractor's 
  appointment to coincide with patch time, so that it doesn't interrupt your questing.

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  5:</b> While we're waiting for the big smithing patch to be implemented, other 
  little discoveries have been trickling through. Thanks to folks active on the 
  message boards, we now have verified recipes for sliced cake, and pound cake, 
  and hopefully we'll have more discoveries in the days to come. Once the smithing 
  changes are in place, I'll be posting on the message board asking folks to &quot;adopt&quot; 
  a zone to re-explore and verify merchant offerings. I'll also be asking folks 
  to post new recipe verifications, so we can pool the information quickly for 
  this.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Keep up the 
  good work, gang ... it's thanks to all my &quot;regulars&quot; that this site

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">August 
  24:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It looks 
  like some, but not all of the smithing (and resulting tailoring) changes are 
  live on production. I'm not going to get frantic about verifying new recipes 
  and re-verify every merchant until after the rest of the changes are in place 
  -- it's just too time-consuming for a single person to do. Known new stuff working 
  on the live servers includes silk thread, silk bandages, silk cord, and hooked 
  arrowheads (possibly some of the other arrowheads as well, but I've not tested 
  other stuff yet). I've seen copies of *other* smithing and tailoring recipes 
  that are currently functioning on test, but since there's never a guarantee 
  that what is on test will stay that way from day to day, I'm not worrying about 
  posting them right yet.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When the smithing 
  changes are implemented, I will need help! A lot of the new smithing recipes 
  are going to use materials not currently on the live servers. When they go live, 
  merchant inventories will also change ... across the entire world. Anyone who 
  wants to &quot;adopt&quot; a zone to re-explore, please remember the following. 
  If you do NOT give me all the correct information, then it will take me even 
  longer than normal to run around and re-verify stuff -- which means it takes 
  longer to be posted on this site. For ANY report of new merchants, new items 
  on merchants, etc., I need 1) zone name, 2) merchant name, 3) merchant /loc, 
  as well as any landmarks, 4) exact item names. Sending me something that says: 
  &quot;The windmill in the Lake of Ill Omen has poison stuff&quot; just means 
  that I have to spend time to get one of my personas over to that zone and then 
  figure out where this doggone windmill is located. ;) It's still nice to get 
  the head's up, but it adds a couple days of delay onto anything being posted, 
  as I have to add it to the pile of things &quot;to do&quot; for the site ... 
  and for those not familiar with the force behind this site, it's a single-person 
  operation that costs me a lot of my personal time and pp to maintain. If you 
  find the info on this site useful, and you want to contribute, jotting down 
  that extra information requested above and sending it to me means that I can 
  free up more of my time on some of the more difficult or more expensive information 
  to verify.</font>

  Hopefully the servers are stable now, and the patches of the patches are done 
  for now. Reports are trickling in that the tailoring fixes are fixed, though 
  no mention was made of the studded tunic. A bit of research has shown reports 
  of the tailored quiver now being in-game, and while the quiver itself is nothing 
  to get excited about using, it is being reported as a way to increase your tailoring

  the wizzie up in brewing when we noticed it). When my hubby and I have some

  Thanks to the suggestion of one of this site's visitors, the Marketplace will 
  now accept listings for a &quot;Wanted&quot; section, for those folks who are 
  looking for someone to make trade items for them, but have not found anyone 
  able/willing to make things for them. Of course, no listings will appear until 
  we get submissions, but at least I'm willing to put some up if I get any. &lt;g&gt;</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font color="#400000">Please

  Anyone who gripes before the end of the month because I've not got trade supplies 
  listings up for the new zones will be happily ignored, or forced to live on 
  edible goo and bog juice for a few weeks.</font> :)

  I've been working more on trivial listings for some of the trade skills. A lot 
  of this has been taken from other sources, as many of my personas are too high 
  a skill level to provide proper input. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">email 
  me</a> additions and corrections.</font>

  initial information on some Kunark zones, please remember to include: zone name, 
  merchant name, items sold, /loc info, and any other info that will make it easier 
  to find this merchant again. (Building name, landmarks, etc.) Also, please include

  I've done some updates to the brewing recipes listing (fixed the honey mead 
  recipe, added some trivials, added some yields). Please keep that feedback coming!</font>

  As Isolde mentioned in a message board post, someone has discovered the recipe 
  for at least two of the clay deities that have stumped potters since the beginning 
  of the lands. While the deities are not equippable (i.e., they're broken still), 
  it gives some hope that we'll eventually see these items in the lands. Experimentation 
  continues, and details can be found on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000998.html" target="_new">Sony 
  Station Everquest boards</a>.</font>
