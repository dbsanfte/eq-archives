        <br>
        Sanu rested for the moment, leaning back against the tree, letting her 
        mind wander slightly as she recovered from the rigors of slaying one of 
        the Giant Undead that constantly plagued that area. Beside her, her spirit 
        companion waited. She could not keep from smiling at the honor bestowed 
        upon her now that the spirits thought her worthy enough to send one of 
        their own to help her in her duties.<br>
        <br>
        Her eyes closed as she meditated, confident that her companion would warn 
        her of any danger that approached. While her companion had not given a 
        name, the name "Rex" had popped to mind when she thought of him and was 
        appropriate somehow. He had not shown displeasure when she had called 
        him that and she had been fairly certain there was a glint of amusement 
        in those wolf eyes of his.<br>
        <br>
        Her mind roamed as she sought the mana flows of the world to recharge 
        her own. Calling on the Spirits for their help was tiring though not in 
        the same manner as that of a warrior. It was in that semi-trance state 
        that she heard the call of the spirit world.<br>
        <br>
        She stood up and faced north, still attuned to the call. There was no 
        urgency to the call, just an insistence that she answer it. Yes, she thought, 
        I will answer it from my beloved home. With a ruffling of his fur, she 
        said goodbye to Rex and told him he could leave, thanking him for his 
        help. He licked her face before disappearing back into the spirit world. 
        Sanu had to smile as she gathered the spirits to aid in her journey back 
        home.<br>
        <br>
        She closed her eyes and envisioned her destination, the Stone Bridge in 
        North Karana. The trip by foot the rest of the way would give her the 
        time she needed to ready herself for her trip to the spirit world. The 
        spirits gathered around her, things went black, and then she was there, 
        standing on the firm rock of the bridge.<br>
        <br>
        With a wave to the Captain of the Guard, she set out for home. At least 
        some of the Guards of Qeynos were friendly to her Clan once you had overcome 
        their suspicion. There were others, however, that were in need of a hefty 
        dose of Justice in her opinion. But that was a matter for another day 
        and a matter for the Clan as well.<br>
        <br>
        Her journey was uneventful and she soon found herself in the Frozen North, 
        Everfrost. As always, the sight of her majestic beauty took her breath 
        away. The ice cliffs never failed to fill her heart with beauty and love. 
        This was home to her, this is where her heart lay.<br>
        <br>
        Sanu found a quiet spot on the tundra, summoning her spirit companion 
        to guard her mortal form while she traveled to the Spirit World. Rex smiled 
        that wolf grin at her as she settled down. One by one, she forced the 
        thoughts of the mortal world from her mind. And then, when the moment 
        was right, she loosened her hold on the mortal realm and slipped into 
        the Spirit World.<br>
        <br>
        It took her a few moments to orient herself as a wave of freshness greeted 
        her. Everfrost as seen from the Spirit World took her breath away. The 
        colors were sharper, fresher and the air seemed even more alive. Sanu 
        looked around, invigorated by the sense of life.<br>
        <br>
        Out of the mist came a wolf, similar to her companion Rex and Sanu knew 
        to follow him. Silently she followed into the mists, keeping the spirit 
        within sight. Was this the spirit's true form? Or did it take that form 
        because that is what she expected? Questions she had heard the elder Shaman 
        discussing in the Hall. She had paid little mind to their answers, thinking 
        them unimportant to the everyday duties of a Shaman. Now she wished she 
        had listened a bit harder for there might have been a bit of wisdom that 
        would prove useful on this journey.<br>
        <br>
        Her prior journey to the Spirit World had been an emergency measure and 
        the Spirit World surrounding the Arena had not been friendly. By instinct, 
        Sanu had conducted her hunt, forcing her will upon the Spirit World to 
        take her where she wanted. And when her will had not been sufficient, 
        she had gathered the will of her Clan and succeeded.<br>
        <br>
        Though she found Ruldari's soul, Sanu shivered still at the memory of 
        the chill. It was Lord Spyke who had brought them back. Every now and 
        then, Sanu wondered if she had missed something in her training that would 
        have enabled her to bring them both back.<br>
        <br>
        Alone with her spirit guide and her thoughts, Sanu journeyed deeper into 
        the mists. The mists swirled about her and if one looked closely, one 
        could discern shapes. This was one of the dangers of the Spirit World, 
        summoning that which you are not looking for. She remembered the fierce 
        eyes of her teacher when she drilled into her head, "When you are in the 
        Spirit World, keep your mind on what you are there for or keep it blank. 
        One or the other. Anything else and you will never return."<br>
        <br>
        Yes, Sanu thought to herself, this is definitely the case. The Spirit 
        World was ever changing. Though the mists she saw different sceneries 
        and often caught glimpses of other people, of animals moving about. But 
        she did not stay from the trail her spirit guide created through the mists. 
        She still had many things to do before coming to the Spirit World permanently.<br>
        <br>
        Suddenly out of the mists a form erupted. Sanu had to stifle a giggle 
        at the large white rabbit in a waist coat. The rabbit stopped in front 
        of her and took out a large pocket watch to glance at the time. "Zoinks!" 
        the rabbit exclaimed, "Late again! She'll have my head for sure!" <br>
        <br>
        He stopped, as if seeing Sanu for the first time and looked at her, "Mighty 
        things will be a happenin' soon, lady. Ya better git while you ken." And 
        before Sanu had a chance to question or respond, the rabbit had scampered 
        off into the mists.<br>
        <br>
        Her guide waited ahead. With a shrug, she motioned for him to continue. 
        The spirits had something they wanted to show her, otherwise they would 
        not have called her. She wasn't about to waste their time by leaving now.<br>
        <br>
        Sanu continued walking and slowly the mists thinned until they were gone. 
        And Sanu stopped in her tracks at what she saw. Before her, great basalt 
        walls reached for the sky. Never had she seen a construction like this 
        one, not even in dreams... or nightmares. While the sheer, black walls 
        seemed to go up forever, she could somehow make out the tops and the battlements. 
        Lights seemed to flicker on the wall, but she could see no movement.<br>
        <br>
        She dropped her gaze to the large gates before her. That they would dwarf 
        a giant she was sure. They looked to be made of wood, but had an unearthly 
        glow about them. In stillness, she realized where she was, the boundary 
        between the Void and the Spirit World. A quick glance around revealed 
        that her spirit guide had slipped away, leaving her to her own decision.<br>
        <br>
        The spirit guide had shown her the way to Lord Spyke's domain, that of 
        the Void. They were calling her bluff on her debt. The debt she was not 
        even sure Lord Spyke would acknowledge as a debt. A debt she truly had 
        no idea how to go about repaying. If she entered the Void, her powers 
        would be those limited to any mortal. The Void was his domain and his 
        will ruled.<br>
        <br>
        An idle question crossed her mind of what the Ruler of the Void must do 
        for entertainment. For beyond the walls there was nothing. Sanu trembled 
        as the importance of what she was seeing impacted her. Nothing. No light. 
        No dark. Just... nothing.<br>
        <br>
        With a sudden burst of will, she tore her gaze away to stare at the gates 
        before her. She reminded herself of her decision to be unimpressed with 
        such things. Her decision, easy to make back in the mortal realm, was 
        not as easy when staring at the reality of the Void.<br>
        <br>
        For a second... an eternity... it was impossible to say, Sanu stood before 
        the gates, thoughts running chaotically though her head, trying to make 
        a decision, to step forward to the gates, or to step back into the Spirit 
        World and then back to the mortal realm. And as she stood, those gates 
        remained closed and silent, as if mocking her.<br>
        <br>
        She had heard no stories of a Shaman going into the Void willingly. There 
        existed no lore concerning one Great Lord of the Void, Lord Spyke Pha'al. 
        It was fitting, Sanu thought. Most concentrated on what was real, what 
        they could touch, see, hear and taste. And yet, the universe was created 
        with balance in mind. For every "something" there had to be a "nothing". 
        She had heard such arguments before, but none had named the "nothing" 
        or assigned a ruler to it.<br>
        <br>
        She was on her own, the decision was hers. To enter? And perhaps get lost 
        in the Void, powerless to return. To enter? And be destroyed by Lord Spyke 
        for entering without an invitation. To enter? And be welcomed. Or, to 
        leave? And lose a chance to repay her debt. Sanu took her debts seriously 
        and knew that if she died and entered the Spirit World with debts, that 
        peace would not be hers until they were paid.<br>
        <br>
        As she thought and tried to come up with a plan of action, she suddenly 
        became aware of a change. A new tension was in the air. One that seemed 
        to radiate over the walls. A tension of power. The power of creation and 
        destruction. Her eyes were drawn to the top of the wall and there she 
        saw a glow. And with a glow, there came a voice. A voice that rang with 
        unstoppable force. <br>
        <br>
        Sanu froze as the voice flowed over her, stilling her thoughts, the sudden 
        fear of a child about to be caught eavesdropping seizing her.<br>
        <br>
        "Pha'al! You have overstepped your bounds too far this time. Your facination 
        with the mortals has clouded your mind."<br>
        <br>
        Sanu froze even more as a small part of her mind worked figuring out who 
        or what the voice had to belong to. The Tribunal had asked Lord Spyke 
        to deliver its Judgement to Unkle. This voice was taking Lord Spyke to 
        task. Before she could put a label to the voice, she suddenly knew. Knew 
        what power could silence the Spirit World. Like a frozen rabbit, her mind 
        screamed to run before she was detected. But she was unable to move, caught 
        by the power that radiated over the walls.<br>
        <br>
        There was a pause in which she assumed Lord Spyke was answering, but she 
        heard nothing.<br>
        <br>
        "Silence, Void Master! You know that I am not here about that. The Tribunal 
        did as its wont with those that worshiped it. You were simply acting as 
        their Voice in the situation. You tipped the scales out of balance with 
        what you did outside of acting as their Voice."<br>
        <br>
        The walls trembled with the command, and had Sanu been able to shrink 
        herself then and there, she would have. But somehow, she knew that flight 
        was impossible now. Where she to move, she would be destroyed.<br>
        <br>
        Again, a pause and then the voice sounded, "I shall enjoy this today. 
        You have always been one to cause me the most trouble. No, you fool! I 
        am speaking of your action of spirit linking with a mortal! Raising the 
        others was an abuse of power, but that was <i>FAR</i> worse."<br>
        <br>
        "You have tipped the scales so far out of balance, that if Innouuk or 
        Cazic wanted to leave their home planes, and head to Norrath. <i>NOT</i> 
        in Avatar form... They could!"<br>
        <br>
        With even wider eyes, Sanu watched as the great walls of basalt started 
        to shake. She could see the solid gates start to quiver, like cloth in 
        the wind. Looking up, she could see the glowing clouds of power start 
        to gather above the castle.<br>
        <br>
        "To correct your error, and to balance the scales again. I shall now make 
        judgement."<br>
        <br>
        Even though she knew the judgement was not directed at her, her soul quailed 
        and she tried to shrink in on herself.<br>
        <br>
        The voice grew in intensity, to bore through her mind, to be heard by 
        every fiber of her being.<br>
        <br>
        "To all those in the Realms that can hear me, listen to my decree..."<br>
        <br>
        She fell to her knees, hands clasped over her ears did nothing to deaden 
        the sound. The volume increased as she saw cracks appear in the wall before 
        her. The Nameless was destroying the Castle before her as he proclaimed 
        his judgement.<br>
        <br>
        "I give judgement to the one known as Spyke Pha'al, Lord of the Void!"<br>
        <br>
        "A fraction of your Spirit be linked with a mortal. So shall the rest 
        of you be!"<br>
        <br>
        And with that, the roar and rumble let loose and the walls started to 
        crumble before her very eyes. Chunks of basalt, harder than any rock she 
        had ever seen, started to fall from the top. The earth shattered as they 
        fell. The great gates before her blew asunder, knocking her over with 
        their blast.<br>
        <br>
        "May you find what likened you to the mortals now, Pha'al."<br>
        <br>
        Sanu scrambled to her hands and knees, feeling something tugging at her 
        tunic. Looking down she saw her spirit guide, urging her to follow him. 
        Awkwardly, she scrabbled to her feet, glancing back to see the walls begin 
        to collapse into piles of rubble. What of Lord Sypke? None could have 
        withstood the Nameless' power. As the walls collapsed, she thought she 
        heard... no felt... a scream of something being ripped away. And then 
        she had to flee or be destroyed, for the ruins were being consumed and 
        if she remained, she would be consumed with them.<br>
        <br>
        Fleeing as quickly as she could, she fled , running until she finally 
        dropped from exhaustion, her face dirty, clothes ripped and torn. Unsuccessfully 
        she tried to get her breathing under control, tried to wrestle with the 
        implications of what she had just seen. The border between the Void and 
        the Spirit World had been destroyed, now there was no divider. Would another 
        be appointed as Lord of the Void?<br>
        <br>
        But her mind refused to deal with it. She was still in shock. And then, 
        a call penetrated her stupor. Someone was in trouble in Everfrost near 
        where her body lay in rest. Her duties returned to her, protect the Clan 
        and even the Southerners who were brave enough to test their spirits in 
        Everfrost. It took a slight bit longer than usual, but soon she had calmed 
        her mind enough to rejoin her mortal form.<br>
        <br>
        It was a spiritually drained Shaman whose eyes awoke to the trouble around 
        her. Rex let her know from where the trouble came. Grasping her staff, 
        she trotted towards a well-known grove just over the hill. Just beyond 
        that grove, her parents had been killed.<br>
        <br>
        Her grip tightened on the staff, drawing strength from that old feud with 
        the orcs. Her mind cleared as if spider webs were being brushed away. 
        If the orcs thought to take another there, they would be sadly mistaken. 
        If there was one thing Sanu had learned over the years, it was to fight 
        orcs.<br>
        <br>
        As she neared the edge of the grove, she saw a group of orcs surrounding 
        a limp body. Smallish in form, but then, most of Norrath's races Sanu 
        thought of as small, and exotically dressed, her first impression was 
        that of an elf. <br>
        <br>
        One of the orc mountaineers drew a knife to the raucous laughter and encouragement 
        of his fellows. That was enough for Sanu. She charged the group of 5 orcs, 
        swirling her staff above her head as she wielded the frost power of the 
        spirits. Her command had grown and the spirits struck with much force. 
        Within minutes, the orcs were either dead or fleeing. Sanu knew they would 
        return in greater numbers, perhaps even more than she could handle. <br>
        <br>
        Therefore it was imperative that she and whoever she had rescued leave 
        this place immediately. She froze in astonishment as she gently turned 
        the still form on the ground over. Lord Spyke! With a practiced eye, she 
        looked for any physical damage, directing the spirits in its healing when 
        she found it. But still, he did not awake.<br>
        <br>
        Fragments of what she had witnessed in the Spirit World returned to her 
        and she gasped with shock as she realized the extent of The Nameless' 
        judgement. Lord Spyke was now mortal, stripped of his powers of the Void. 
        And what of his reaction when he awoke? When he realizes the magnitude 
        of the price he has paid for his actions.<br>
        <br>
        Sanu's brain thought furiously, who best for him to see when he awoke? 
        For she would not allow him to awaken alone and she could not leave him 
        on the frozen tundra. Tense moments passed, moments she knew the orcs 
        would be regrouping, if nothing else to reclaim their dead. And then it 
        came to her, Ruldari.<br>
        <br>
        Gathering Spyke's unconscious form in her arms, she was amazed at the 
        lightness. She mourned the loss of his immortality and wondered if he 
        would ever learn the ways of mortals. Her own debt took on new dimensions 
        now, perhaps becoming an even bigger debt that the whole Clan owed.<br>
        <br>
        For the sake of the Clan, Lord Spyke had risked his being to recover Ruldari 
        from the Spirit World. To fulfill an oath he had given to mortals. And 
        now, he had paid the price of his choice and been thrown down to join 
        those very mortals. The Spiritwalker Clan takes care of its own, and unknowingly, 
        Lord Spyke had become a member. It was now time for the Clan to take up

        But first, he must be nursed back to health. Slowly she stood, cradling 
        his still form. He did not move nor make a sound. She feared the return 
        to consciousness would be slow, his fall had been a mighty one, from the 
        Great Lord of the Void to a mortal. While she was certain he would still 
        have great power, it would not be beyond the scope of mortals any longer. 
        She gathered the spirits and bade them take her to Ruldari. Ruldari was 
        the first step, the first step to being a mortal and hopefully the first 
        step to healing a wounded soul.<br>

      <p><i><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        Storyteller's voice grew silent as the smoke started to blur the image 
        of a tall Shaman cradling a smaller form she held as a child as the spirits 
        gathered to whisk her away. For a long stretch of time, the only sounds 
        to be heard were those of the fire crackling and the wind blowing through 
        the leaves of autumn. As always, the children were the first to ask for 
        more, wanting to know what became of Spyke Pha'al, the Great Lord of the 
        Void, now that he was mortal. And as always, with a pleased but weary 
        grin, the Storyteller promised more next time it was right to Weave a 
        Story. Thoughtful adults left the campfire to seek their own shelters, 
        leaving the Storyteller gazing into the flames, each thinking of the lessons 
        the story offered. The Storyteller grinned to himself. Yes, he thought, 
        stories of real people were often just as exciting at those invented on 
        the spur of the moment. With an irreverent grin that would have shocked 
        the other Elders of the Tribe, he wondered if Sanu's people told stories 
        of him, thinking them fiction. Dismissing his thought with a chuckle, 
        he too retired, leaving the fire to burn on its own, knowing the fire 
        would answer his call when the time was right. He, too, was interested

      <p><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The entity 
        known to those on Norrath as Spyke, Lord of the Void, sat on his Throne. 
        Something had been bothering him as of late, but he could not put his 
        finger on it. He sat on his Throne when he had heavy choices to ponder, 
        its obsidian face was unforgiving and very cold. Just as he was supposed 
        to be. His gaze went out towards the border of the two realms that his 
        castle straddled. From his Throne, he could peer into both the Realm of 
        the Void and the Realm of the Spirits equally.<br>
        <br>
        Of the two Realms, the Void was his and his alone to control. It was an 
        expansion of complete nothingness. No sound, color nor shape could be 
        discerned there. For whenever you have a Universal equation that contains 
        something, there always needs to be its opposite, nothing. Without his 
        realm, the natural order of life would not work properly. Plants and creatures 
        would never die. There would never be decay. One half of the wheel, that 
        is required for things to grow, to live, would simply not be. He pondered 
        on how many a mortal would relish the thought of not being able to die, 
        but he simply knew, that eventually they would find out what a curse it 
        would be.<br>
        <br>
        His gaze shifted slightly to look on the other side of the border. Of 
        the Realm of Spirits his knowledge was also absolute, but his power was 
        minimal. It also was a needed place. Without it, the spirits, of those 
        enlightened enough to have them, would have no place to go for their final 
        rest. As his Realm is one of never changing attributes, the Spirit Realm 
        is its polar opposite, a constantly changing quagmire of sound, and color, 
        and shape. It had a certain beauty to its chaoticness, he thought.<br>
        <br>
        He sat up a bit more in his throne. "There it is again," he said out loud. 
        The concept of beauty was one that, until recently, he had never pondered. 
        He never had a reason to. It was simply something that did not matter. 
        He was sure that it was due to the link that he had now with the mortal 
        known as "Ruldari".<br>
        <br>
        He shifted his sight into a range that no moral creature could ever see, 
        nor would they be able to understand what they were seeing, even if they 
        could. His gaze fell across the border and the two Realms again. His perception 
        had shifted to allow him to see the tendrils that represented the links 
        between all living creatures and the Spirit Realm. He sat and watched 
        as some of them went from being linked to the Realm of Mortals to his 
        Realm and then to stop in the Realm of Spirits once and for all. He focused 
        on one Link in particular, the one that went from himself through the 
        Spirit Realm into the Realm of the Mortals.<br>
        <br>
        Before he had a chance to continue his thought, he felt that someone was 
        there, in his throne room, with him. There was but one entity that could 
        enter his domain without his knowledge... The Nameless, the One above 
        All. He simply waited, still seated on his Throne, as he knew what this 
        visit was about.<br>
        <br>
        "Pha'al! You have overstepped your bounds too far this time. Your fascination 
        with the mortals has clouded your mind."<br>
        <br>
        He did not bother to look around, as he knew that he would not see anything. 
        The Nameless had never taken a form in all of time, he would not now. 
        "If you are speaking of my charging a mortal with his penance, that was 
        a task requested of me by The Tribunal themselves. Speak to them about 
        your grievances."<br>
        <br>
        "Silence, Void Master! You know that I am not here about that. The Tribunal 
        did as its wont with those that worship it. You were simply acting as 
        their Voice in the situation. You tipped the scales out of balance with 
        your actions outside of acting as their Voice."<br>
        <br>
        "You are speaking of my actions to resurrect those of the mortals that 
        had died at the Demon's hands?" He took a deep breath. One such as he 
        never needed to breath, but he felt that it helped him think clearer when 
        he did. He could perceive a growing thickness in the environment around 
        him. This was not a good sign.<br>
        <br>
        "I shall enjoy this today. You have always been one to cause me the most 
        trouble. No, you fool! I am speaking of your action of spirit linking 
        with a mortal! Raising the others was an abuse of power, but that was 
        FAR worse."<br>
        <br>
        He noticed his castle begin to shake as The Nameless's disembodied voice 
        grew in volume and power. He also realized that now was not a time to 
        speak.<br>
        <br>
        "You have tipped the scales so far out of balance, that if Innoruuk or 
        Cazic wanted to leave their home planes and head to Norrath.. NOT in Avatar 
        form... they could!"<br>
        <br>
        He noticed that the violence his castle was feeling was growing in intensity. 
        He was almost thrown from his Throne as if to be force to stand.<br>
        <br>
        "To correct your error and to balance the scales again, I shall now make 
        judgement."<br>
        <br>
        He actually felt fear.<br>
        <br>
        "To all those in the Realms that can hear me, listen to my decree...."<br>
        <br>
        The Nameless' voice had risen to such a volume, that the Throne was beginning 
        to fracture.<br>
        <br>
        "I give judgement to the one known as Spyke Pha'al, Lord of the Void!"<br>
        <br>
        He felt eyes burrow into him, even though there were none.<br>
        <br>
        "A fraction of your Spirit be linked with a mortal. So shall the rest 
        of you be!"<br>
        <br>
        With that, he heard an immense cracking sound, as the floor under he feet 
        began to shatter. He noticed his castle was being destroyed around him 
        as he started to feel the slight tugging force. He began to fight against 
        it.<br>
        <br>
        "May you find what likened you to the mortals now, Pha'al."<br>
        <br>
        With that, the tugging force grew in power and strength. The last thought 
        that he had before his head snapped to one side forcing him unconscious, 
        was that he was correct in not liking this at all.</font><font  size=3 ptsize=10><br>

      <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">by Ruldari</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ruldari was wallowing 
        in self-pity. Perhaps this would have been a common occurrence when she 
        was a child, being told repeatedly how useless she was by her drunken 
        mother, but it was not at all common anymore. Not since she was accepted 
        into the Spiritwalkers. Not since she met Joril.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yet, here she was, 
        stomping through snowdrifts in Everfrost, muttering to herself in a most 
        un-Ru-like manner, and feeling quite sorry for herself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It seemed that everything 
        had been unraveling and going awry lately, and she'd just about reached 
        her limits. If something didn't happen soon, she felt like she was going 
        to explode from it all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As a ranger, she 
        <i>knew</i> she'd chosen a difficult path, as a not-quite fighter and 
        a mediocre at best spellcaster. Her tracking and foraging skills were 
        unrivaled, but it seemed lately that her other skills were not enough 
        to keep her skin intact in situations where folks several trainings her 
        junior could breeze right through. To add insult to injury, no matter 
        how much she was positive she'd progressed enough to please her trainers, 
        they refused to teach her new spells -- spells that a druid a third of 
        her training could easily master. Did they think she <i>liked</i> sitting 
        at her 29th rank of training forever? Did they think she wasn't trying 
        hard enough? She certainly had the wounds to prove otherwise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then there was her 
        fletching. For some reason, she was more fumblefingered than usual lately. 
        Not only were theoretically simple arrows being botched on a regular basis, 
        but instead of attaining the coveted rank of &quot;master fletcher&quot;, 
        she feared her trainers were going to downgrade her to &quot;rank apprentice&quot; 
        if she didn't start showing some improvement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Her debt to the Lord 
        of the Void also weighed heavily on her mind, the moreso because she seemed 
        unable to repay that debt. She'd gone on an extended journey to try to 
        speak with him and repay her debt, but had been unable to find him. Ru, 
        tracker extraordinaire, had gotten herself hopelessly lost in the realms 
        leading to Spyke's home in the Void, and had to return home with nothing 
        to show for her efforts but a wasted month of fruitless searching. You 
        would think that after he had sacrificed part of his soul to save her 
        soul from total destruction by a demon, that she'd be able to track him 
        anywhere, but she was blocked at every turn and the way was lost to her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If that wasn't enough, 
        there was trouble awating her when she returned home. The Spiritwalkers 
        had been family to her, giving her the love and support her unlamented 
        mother had not seen fit to shower upon her. Recently, however, the clan 
        had grown too much, too quickly, and personality clashes and differences 
        of opinion degenerated into outright nastiness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many had left the 
        clan for varying reasons, unable or unwilling to handle the strife. Her 
        beloved Joril had also left, feeling the need to prove himself on his 
        own, unsheltered by his loving family. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ru was torn, but 
        so far had stayed firm by Unkle's side. She owed and loved him too much 
        to let anyone think she was &quot;deserting&quot; him while the clan was 
        so beleaugured from within. But soon the time would come for her to leave, 
        as her place was truly at her husband's side. Joril had been supportive 
        of her decision, but still, it tore at them both.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So, here she was, 
        the tips of her upswept ears half-frozen from the biting wind, returning 
        from yet another fruitless visit to Surefall Glade.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Refuse to train 
        me, will they? Not ready, am I? Too dependent on others? Hah! Well how 
        on earth am I supposed to improve if they won't give me the skills I so 
        badly need if I am going to hunt solo at all?!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Her litany of grumbling 
        stopped short as a gray streak leapt over a nearby snowbank and into her 
        path. She peered at the wolf, recognizing it as Sanu's companion spirit, 
        Rex. &quot;What is it, boy? Does Sanu need me?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Rex yipped once, 
        and turned to face Halas, looking over his furry shoulder to be sure that 
        she was following.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Aye, Fuzzface, 
        I'll follow you. I'm warning you, though, I'm not going to be very good 
        company for you or for Sanu right now.&quot; Ru's voice was tiredly apologetic, 
        as if to take any sting out of the words.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Rex responded 
        with a low growling whine, Ru's violet eyes narrowed, even as she broke 
        into a run. Whatever was going on, it wasn't a social call. Her mind a-whirl 
        with worry that something drastic had happened to Joril or Unkle, she 
        pushed her tired legs to their limit as she followed Rex, wishing once 
        again she was able to enhance her travel speed as her sister-in-law Sanu 
        could.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Rex stopped 
        in front of Ru and Joril's Halas home, Ru burst through the door in a 
        flurry of snow and concern. &quot;Sanu, what is ... &quot; All thought 
        fled for a moment as she took in the scene before her. Lying in a pile 
        of sleeping furs was a very battered high elf that looked amazingly like 
        the Lord of the Void.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A worried looking 
        Sanu turned to face her, one hand resting on Rex's ruff. The shamaness, 
        often one of very few words, seemed even more terse than usual: "Yes, 
        it is Spyke, yes, he is mortal, sorry, duty calls me elsewhere, I have 
        stayed too long." With a muttered phrase and a quick gesture, Sanu and 
        Rex were gone, gated to goodness-knows where.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ru's silver-white 
        eyebrows rose in startlement as her mouth dropped open. Numbly, still 
        covered in snow, Ru sat on the floor beside the sleeping pallet and took 
        a closer look at the one lying there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He looked like he'd 
        been run over by a whole pack of orcs .. riding wooly mammoths ... with 
        snow leopards as their honor guard. Given the extent of the injuries, 
        Ru would guess that he'd been almost dead before Sanu treated the worst 
        of his wounds and brought him here.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mortal. Blessed Karana, 
        please let it not be because of the sacrifice he made for her. Best not 
        to dwell on that much, else she'd run gibbering into the night, and be 
        unable to repay the great debt she owed him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His physical healing 
        would only be the first step in a very difficult journey for him, and 
        Ru was momentarily overwhelmed at all the things he'd need to learn about. 
        Eating and drinking. Sleeping. Self-defense. Emotions of any sort. The 
        list went on and on. Of course, until he woke up or Sanu returned to explain 
        what had happened, she didn't know if the change was permanent, but she'd 
        better plan for the worst.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For the first little 
        while she could nurse him along on her own, but then he was going to have 
        to learn to interact with others on a mortal-to-mortal basis, instead 
        of his normal avatar aloofness. And, oh, what aloofness it was. Momentarily, 
        she considered mobilizing all of the Spiritwalkers, but then came to the 
        stunning realization that it would <i>not</i> be good to dump him into 
        the middle of them right off. He would be too overwhelmed by the close 
        sense of &quot;family&quot; that was normally felt among the Spiritwalkers, 
        and the current fueding would only confuse him more. Best to deal only 
        with a few select friends first, especially ones who had dealings with 
        him in the past.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Keeping a close eye 
        on her &quot;patient&quot;, Ru started making a list of friends who could 
        help give Spyke lessons on being mortal. A wry grin twisted her lips momentarily. 
        There was nothing like a now-mortal avatar lying in your bed to make you 
        realize that perhaps your life wasn't so unraveled after all, compared 
        to the plight of others ...</font></p>
