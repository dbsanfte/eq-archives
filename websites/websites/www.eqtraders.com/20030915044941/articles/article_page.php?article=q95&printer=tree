<span class="headers">Ak'Anon Bertoxx Rogue (Plague Rust) Armor </span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of several armor quests for young gnomes. This specific one is for gnome rogues that follow Bertoxx. Less naughty gnome rogues need to go to <a href="akanon_ROG.htm">this link</a> instead for their armor. All pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, GNM/ROG only. The graphic is "blood red chain" for this armor. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests - you get a note from the quest giver (Kaxon Frennor) which you have to give to a secondary NPC (Rebbie Romblerum), who will then give you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit, exactly the same one as the evil warrior and cleric kits I think, and probably the same one as the shadowknight kit, and LORE so you can't get one of each). Rebbie will then tell you the recipe for each item and give you a pattern (Tattered [xxx] Pattern) when prompted. These patterns appear to be the same items as the evil INT-caster Tattered [xxx] Patterns (i.e. they're interchangeable). The primary quest giver gives out the class-specific weapon quest.

</p>
<p>
 Kaxon Frennor says 'Hail Genumkin. I am Kaxon Frennor, master assassin of the Dark Reflection. I train talented gnomes that feel the calling of the Plaguelord, Bertoxxulous, and wish to [serve as a rogue] of the Dark Reflection. Disease and decay are powerful forces in Norrath that crumble kingdoms and silently kill even the mightiest of heros. It is the calling of the Dark Reflection to sow the seeds of destruction as a catalyst to change. What progress would there be if rulers did not die and clockworks did not malfunction, giving way to greater rulers and better clockworks.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i serve as a rogue'
</p>
<p>
 Kaxon Frennor says 'We are the spreaders of disease, the masters of poison, the death that comes silently from the shadows. You must outfit yourself with the tools of a rogue, crafted from the disassembled remains of clockworks that are finished serving the purpose for which they were built. Take this parchment to Rebbie Romblerum, he will assist you in the construction of a suit of armor. When you have been properly outfitted return to me for your [next task].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what next task?'
</p>
<p>
 Kaxon Frennor says 'There are many of our kind that do not understand the necessity of the Dark Reflection. The Eldrich Collective and The Deep Muses seek to root us out and have us put to death or exiled from Ak'Anon. In the Steamfont Mountains a Rogue of the Deep Muses, Jibble Blexnik, has been hunting and killing young members of the Dark Reflection that venture from Ak'Anon. Find this self-righteous rogue and eliminate him. When you have accomplished this task bring me Jibble's Stiletto.'

<p>
Rebbie Romblerum says 'Hail Genumkin! You must be one of Kaxon's new trainees. Kaxon has asked me to help get you outfitted in a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our foes. I have assembled a kit for you that will allow you to construct the armor pieces once you have gathered the necessary components.
