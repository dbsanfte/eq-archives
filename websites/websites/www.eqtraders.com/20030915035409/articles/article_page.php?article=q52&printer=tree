<span class="headers">Kaladim Cleric Quests (Brells Blessed Platemail) Armor </span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Kaladim. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, DWF/CLE only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Armor has a gold plate graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
