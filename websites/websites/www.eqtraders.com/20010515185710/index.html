              to learn a trade skill? Do you want to sell the fruits of your labor 
              to other players? Are you trying to find specific items to pratice 
              your craft? Or are you just trying to find someone who sells player-crafted 
              items for a reasonable price on your server? If the answer to any 
              of these questions is "yes", then I hope this site will be of assistance 
              to you. If you can't find the information you need on the main part 
              of the website, it's likely that you can find the answers you need 
              on the message board.</p>

                <b>What's New?</b> New baking recipes are still pouring in from 
                a horde of happy cooks, and I'm sure it will take a while before 
                we figure out all the new fish dishes. Expect some shuffling to 
                be done on the baking recipes page in a few days to try to better 
                organize the new recipes, but for now, I'm just trying to make 
                sure they all get listed as we find them. Smiths are reacting 
                with a mixture of pleasure and frustration. Enchanted chain jointing 
                is now working for high elves and dark elves, as are their racial 
                chain boots, and stats are starting to come in for many of these 
                armor items. However, human cultural smithing recipes for imbued 
                field plate boots and the enchanted antonian longsword still appear 
                to be nonfunctional. Tailors are still pulling their hair out, 
                as they're trying to find the hinted-at new recipes, and not having 
                much success, as the only new &quot;recipes&quot; that have been 
                found are for the 5th Thurgadin Shawl quest.</p>
              <p>Please visit the message boards for the most current information 
                on any of the above topics.</p>

                <b>Patch Day!</b> Most folks know the drill - it's going to take 
                time to process everything that went in during this patch to see 
                what affects us. Please be sure to check message board threads 
                before you start yet another totally new thread on a topic that's 
                covered in 6 other places - it makes it really hard for folks 
                to follow what's going on with all the repetition. :) The below 
                information will be updated later today, once we know for sure 
                how things are going on the live servers.</p>
              <p>Here's what I know about today's patch and how it will affect 
                tradesfolk:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a problem making it hard to loot really large NPCs - if 
                this works as stated, it should make it easier to loot Terrorantula 
                for silk.</li>
              <li>Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows - the details are 
                VERY vague on this, and I'm sure everyone will have their own 
                pet theories or ideas on how this &quot;should&quot; work in the 
                forums. Only time will tell how significant a change this truly 
                is.</li>
              <li>Not only the party, but the person looting, will now see a text 
                message saying what the person looted - at the least, this will 
                make those folks hunting cat pelts in the Karanas happier, as 
                you can tell which quality pelt you looted without having to peer 
                at each pelt as you're looting.</li>
              <li>You can move items in and out of containers in your bank without 
                having to remove the containers from the bank - a great boon to 
                space-impaired tradesfolk!</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Other things not in the patch message that are expected in this 
                patch. (We won't be able to check any of it out until things are 
                up and running again, of course)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>&quot;Some&quot; new tailoring recipes. No word yet on what 
                form these will take, but this message will be updated accordingly 
                as we know more.</li>
              <li>New baking recipes, mainly for the seafood lovers amongst us. 
                Unfortunately, the text for these recipes didn't make it in this 
                patch, though, so unless we succeed with some creative experiments, 
                we may not actually see these until the next patch.</li>
              <li>Several fixes were made to bugged recipes (enchanted adamantite 
                chain, enchanted/imbued adamantite leggings, stats on the velium 
                hound moccasins, etc.), but we don't know if they managed to get 
                added to today's patch, or if they're waiting on the next patch.</li>

                guide</a> for all the non-tailors out there who want some of the 
                Velious tailored armor, giving information on the relatively difficulty 
                of obtaining the needed items for your local tailor. It will hopefully 
                raise a bit of awareness amongst non-tailors in just why it's 
                so difficult to get a tailor to &quot;just&quot; make and sell

                guide editor went awry for a while, but they're fixed now. </p>
              <p>It's a quiet week on the tradeskill front since there's no patch, 
                but experimentation and discussion continue on the boards. Slowly, 
                we're getting more <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">stats 
                for various cultural smithing items</a>, as more folks try out 
                various enchanted variations.</p>

                <b>We're back!</b> It was a rollercoaster day for the site, with 
                a lot of ups and downs, but things look stable now. I'll keep 
                my fingers crossed that the hard-working folks at Refplace have 
                got things well in hand now.</p>
              <p>I'll get more up tomorrow, as I'm sort of busy in Hate right 
                now, but a quick note to let folks know that while the tier'dal 
                version of enchanted adamantite chain jointing is misbehaving 
                (Yakatizma's looking into it), enchanted tier'dal plate works! 
                I'll get the appropriate recipes onto the dark elven smithing 
                page tomorrow . For now, you'll find out how I did it on <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=2160.topic">this 
                message board thread</a>, plus stats of the piece I made.</p>

              <p>A few quick notes in the meantime. <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">Baking 
                recipes</a> have been updated with several new recipes, as well 
                as food type information and know stat information. Once the boards 
                are back up, I'll ask folks to scan the recipes page and see what 
                I've missed. Since this <i>is</i> a tradeskill site, you'll only 
                find information on there for player-made food, not for any of 
                the purchased stuff. It's also been officially confirmed that 
                right-clicking on foods will NOT give any of the listed stat changes 
                for that food, and will only last half-duration.</p>
              <p>A few pieces of <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">steelsilk 
                armor</a> (erudite cultural tailoring) have been made. Due to 
                the rarity of the spawn, and the extreme expense involved, we 
                don't expect to quickly have complete stats for this tailored 
                plate-class armor.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the changes in enchanting metals for smithing, we're 
                gradually learning more about the various enchanted cultural armors. 
                The <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">armor stats 
                page</a> has been updated and slightly revamped to make it easier

                <b>Message board downtime. </b>All EZBoards, including the EQTraders 
                Corner boards, will be down tomorrow (Tuesday) from approximately 
                9am to 6pm, PST while they move to a new facility.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">04/17/01</span> <i><b>(Updated)</b></i><br>
                <b>Patch Day!</b> It's that time again, and there are several 
                known tradeskill changes in it:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Durations on food items have changed. We've got a thread on 
                the baking message boards tracking meal/snack status on various 
                goodies. Some foods also have stat bonuses listed, however, these 
                bonuses are NOT actually showing up when you right-click to eat 
                the food.</li>
              <li>Ovens have been added to Grobb. I'll get info on where, and 
                put it on the proper Trade Supplies pages.</li>
              <li>Buying stacks of items off merchants has been implemented. This, 
                of course, only works if the item is stackable. Also, merchants 
                have improved their inventory retention program, and fully count 
                stacks of items that are sold to them, so that they can sell all 
                the items back to someone else. (Before, if you sold a stack of 
                items to a merchant, the merchant paid for them all, but would 
                then only think he/she had one of the item to sell back.)</li>
              <li>World (stationary) trade containers have been fixed. This <i>should</i> 
                fix the crash to desktop problem folks were having on a combine, 
                and solve the confusion generated when folks thought their ingredients 
                were disappearing after an incorrect combine (from a wrong recipe). 
                This likely does NOT address the tailoring issues we're seeing, 
                and once the dust has settled, we'll need to start getting in 
                feedback if the DNC problems are still continuing for portable 
                trade containers such as sewing kits.</li>
              <li><b><i>Cooking spits have had their weight increased to 3. Contrary 
                to the patch message, skewers are still weight 0.1</i></b></li>
              <li>Last, but <i>definitely</i> not least, enchanting metals for 
                cultural smithing no longer requires gems during the enchanting 
                process. This is a great boon to cultural smiths, and should allow 
                us to experiment a bit more easily with some of the enchanted 
                armors and weapons. There's already been much rejoicing over the 
                news that this was on Test, and I expect we'll see a lot of the 
                &quot;gaps&quot; in our enchanted cultural armor stats information 
                filled in over the next week or two.</li>
            </ul>

              <p><span class="dates">04/13/01</span><br>
                <b>Thanks folks!</b> Thanks to feedback from various folks who 
                follow these boards, the QA folks may have nailed down the crash 
                to desktop problem with tradeskill containers. I'm still not sure 
                if the DNC message folks have been getting on valid recipes are 
                linked (i.e., &quot;phantom&quot; items still in the container 
                from a failed combine) or not, but they've at least found part 
                of the problem, and are working to resolve it. For those of you 
                unaware of what I'm talking about, here's a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000032.html">link 
                to the thread over on the SONY boards</a>. </p>
              <p><span class="dates">04/11/01</span><br>
                <b>One Million ... Plus!</b> Thanks to Ragefire not showing up 
                for a few days on my server (just when I'm one of the prime people 
                &quot;camping&quot; for hours on end to try to get him for a guildmate), 
                I'm even more behind on things than normal. However, since today's 
                a banner day, of sorts, it deserves some sort of post. The message 
                boards topped the 1 million hit mark today, since their rebirth 
                a year ago January. (That's a half a million hits just since this 
                January.) I wish I had better stats for the main website, which 
                is tracked separately from the boards, but we only have stats 
                for the last couple of months since I moved hosting providers. 
                If March's traffic is any indication, I'd expect that the main 
                site will get over a million hits this month, on top of all the 
                heavy volume on the message boards. Welcome to the mainstream, 
                folks! It's only going to get busier from here, with all the changes/additions 
                to tradeskills that have been happening.</p>
              <p>Other mini-updates. Thanks to Khrolan and his raids, I was able 
                to test out two more pieces of the ice burrower silk (&quot;ice 
                silk&quot;) armor this week, as well as verify stats on two more 
                pieces of haze panther armor. As soon as I get more haze panther 
                pelts, I'll try to get stat verification for the final piece of 
                that set, then will be trying to avoid my sewing kit except for 
                testing the rest of the ice silk and the velium hound armor as 
                parts are available. It's STILL taking folks about 10 tell bombs 
                to get it to sink in that I'm not tailoring for other folks anymore, 
                but eventually folks will either accept that no means NO, or I'll 
                be clearing out and refilling my /ignore list every half an hour 
                because of all the folks who think I &quot;owe&quot; them civil 
                conversation on tradeskills in the middle of a raid. ;)</p>

                eggs</a>. I'll get them onto the recipe pages later. Sleep is 
                my friend. Meanwhile, the message board links are included for 
                folks. I also added a comment in the huge thread about <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=215.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100">tradeskill 
                containers</a> with an idea that has been brought up to Yakatizma. 
                There are NO promises it will go anywhere, but at least the idea 
                has been aired. There are also <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=446.topic">changes 
                afoot in baking sometime soon</a>, and I'll talk about that, and 
                other experiences from the FanFest (including my interview for 
                the <i>Avatars Offline</i> documentary) ... but likely not until 
                Monday. The same goes for the multitude of posts with trivials 
                and other site updates that I've not dealt with - it likely will 
                be Monday before I tackle much more. Sleeeeeeeeep <i>&lt;thuddddd&gt;</i></p>

                Tradeskill experimenters rejoice! One of the things that has always 
                hindered significant experimentation with the myriad of recipes 
                that we've been told are &quot;out there somewhere&quot; but that 
                have been undiscovered has been resources. It's painfully hard 
                to throw what can be hundreds of platinum pieces' worth of items 
                and/or hours worth of collection time, into a tradeskill container 
                on an &quot;experiment&quot; that will fail and destroy the items. 
                Currently live only on the test server is a change that will make 
                tradeskill containers NOT destroy items that &quot;do not combine&quot; 
                (DNC), making the lives of curious experimenters a lot easier. 
                On the downside, many portable tradeskill containers will given 
                a weight increase, making it harder for packrats like myself to 
                lug about multiple different containers for tradeskilling in the 
                field. (My worst packrat is my shamaness, who regularly carries 
                around a spirit pouch, bearskin potion bag, Coldain Tanners Kit 
                *and* a cooking spit.) Message board threads were popping up all 
                over regarding this change, and I'm trying to get them funneled 
                into <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=215.topic" target="_new">one 
                message board thread</a> that contains the announcement from Verant 
                about this change.</p>
