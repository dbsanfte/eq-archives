            <h3> #1 & 2: Burlap and Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawls </h3>
            <p> I lump these two shawls together because they both involve killing 
              the exact same creatures and are therefore most easily done at the 
              same time. They are both also extremely simple, by far the easiest 
              quests in the entire Shawl Quest series. They are also the only 
              ones that do not require any form of tradeskills, which may be part 
              of what lures in unsuspecting folks who think that the whole thing 
              is a breeze just because the first two steps are easy peasy. These 
              aren't just the appetizers to the main course quests to come...these 
              are the glass of water that's already on the table when you get 
              there. Enjoy it while it's easy!

Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl: +1 AC +1 Wis +1 Int +1 Save vs Cold <br>
Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl: +2 AC +2 Wis +2 Int +2 Save vs Cold 
</i>
            <p> <b> First Shawl: Frost Giant Toes </b> <br>
              Go to Loremaster Borannin, located in the Temple of Lore in Thurgadin. 
              The temple is at -320, 720. To get there, when you enter Thurgadin 
              and come in past the guarded walls and reach the city itself, turn 
              left. Go past the bank, and when the path forks take the left branch 
              down the slope. The impressive building with pillars all the way 
              at the back is the Temple. Borannin is inside up on the stage off 
              to one side. <br>
              You say, "I wish to perform duties for the crown." <br>
              Loremaster Borannin says "Those eager to prove their loyalty to 
              the Dain may do so by completing tasks that I have been commissioned 
              to assign. If you wish to begin your service, return to me with 
              four toes of our enemy, the Kromrif." <br>
              [Give Loremaster Borannin: 4 Frost Giant Toes] <br>
              Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh, well done! On behalf of the Dain 
              I thank you for making a dent in the number of our sworn enemy. 
              Please accept this as a token of our appreciation. It is trivial, 
              I know, but if you are as loyal as you claim to be, it will increase 
              in power over time. It just so happens I have a [task] to further 
              demonstrate your loyalty, Verdandi." <br>
              [Receive: Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl] <br>
              Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
              Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
              Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
              Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
              You gain experience!! <br>
            <p> The toes drop off of any Frost Giants in Iceclad, East Wastes, 
              Kael Drakkel, or Great Divide. However, some say that they drop 
              much more often in Kael. That's a pretty nasty zone compared to 
              the others, so if you are trying this at a level where you get experience 
              from the giants in other zones you might want to consider staying 
              there and enjoy getting some experience and faction in the process. 
              Or, to bypass all of the actual work (and the faction hits if you 
              wish to align with the giants), you could try auctioning all over 
              the place to buy them, since they are not No Drop. People frequently 
              save them to sell to folks doing this quest, so this may be the 
              fastest route for you if you can afford it. 
            <p> <b> Second Shawl: Kromrif Heads </b> <br>
              Return to our friend Borannin and... <br>
              You say, "what task?" <br>
              Loremaster Borannin says, "Every year the Dain replaces the trophies 
              in his trophy room. There is a reward given for the best new trophy 
              obtained. I intend to win this year and I will upgrade your prayer 
              shawl for assisting me. Fill this box with ten Kromrif heads and 
              bring me the combined contents along with the burlap shawl. I will 
              submit the best one for the Dain's consideration." <br>
              [Receive: Preservationist's Box] <br>
              Go get ten heads and put them in the box. Hit the combine button 
              to make it into a "Preserved Kromrif Heads" and give it to Borannin. 
            <p> <b> WARNING: The combined box of Preserved Kromrif Heads is NO 
              RENT! If you combine the heads in the box and then camp (or go LD 
              for more than half an hour) you will LOSE it. I recommend waiting 
              to do the combine until you are standing right in front of Borannin, 
              and *immediately* handing it to him. </b> 
            <p> [Give to Borannin: Preserved Kromrif Heads & Burlap Coldain Prayer 
              Shawl] <br>
              "Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh, some fine specimens indeed, Verdandi. 
              I will have the best of these mounted at once, wish me luck in the 
              contest! Here is the Cloth Prayer Shawl of our people. Before I 
              forget, the council has issued yet another [chore] for you to complete." 
              <br>
              [Receive: Cloth Coldain Prayer Shawl] <br>
              Your faction standing with Coldain got better <br>
              Your faction standing with DainFrostreaverIV got better <br>
              Your faction standing with Kromzek got worse <br>
              Your faction standing with Kromrif got worse <br>
              You gain experience!! 
            <p> The heads drop off of the same giants that drop the toes. These 
              are not No Drop either, so you can also buy them from people. As 
              noted above, the combined box of heads is No Rent, so be extremely 
              careful not to camp out with it on you! The Preservationist's Box 
              that you collect the heads in will stay around until you do something 
              with it, however. As both the box and the heads themselves are pretty 
              heavy, you might want to consider having room for the box in the 
              bank and storing it and your heads there until you have them all 
              to turn in. Or, you could destroy the box when Borannin gives it 
              to you and then prompt him with "what task?" to get another box 
              when you are ready to turn them in.
