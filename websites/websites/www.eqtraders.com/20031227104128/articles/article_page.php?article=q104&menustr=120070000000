<p>
This is one of many youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and restricted to BRD/HUM, HEF only. This quest originates in the bard guild in South Qeynos. The color on this armor is an icy pale green. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>.
