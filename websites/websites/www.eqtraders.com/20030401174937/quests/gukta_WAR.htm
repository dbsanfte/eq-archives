            <p>This is one of several quests for young frogloks in Gukta. The 
              no-fail combines provide some minor smithing skillups. The armor 
              pieces should all be lore (other than the bracer), no drop, and 
              restricted to FRG/WAR.</p>
            <p>The quest begins with your paladin trainer, Dar Master Griblok</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Dar Master Griblok' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok says 'Welcome back, young Dar. I hope your 
                training is going well. Unfortunately, I have been unable to keep 
                up to date on your progress, but should you need advanced training 
                in any individual skills, I am here to help you with that. Also, 
                though you've chosen a life of adventure, remember that you may 
                still be called upon to defend your homeland. To do this, you 
                must be well prepared for war. Let me tell you what little I know 
                of this land and aid you in your [first steps].' <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'what first steps' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok looks somewhat startled at the sight of the 
                figure standing nearby, however, continues in conversation with 
                ____. <br>
                Dar Master Griblok says 'The city is a place of sanctuary for 
                all Frogloks. We count many friends among the good races of the 
                land, but we have few true allies yet. We are bordered by the 
                evil Feerrott to the south and the desolate Southern Desert of 
                Ro to the north. Even Guk, the city-dungeon whose entrance you 
                will see as you wander the swamp, has its darker aspects. We will 
                need to build our might if we are to survive. Are you by chance 
                a [new warrior]? <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I am a new warrior' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok looks somewhat startled at the sight of the 
                figure standing nearby, however, continues in conversation with 
                ____. <br>
                Dar Master Griblok says 'Ah, good. The Army and its reserve are 
                always in need of fresh courage. Every new warrior must attempt 
                the training I personally oversee. I say attempt because these 
                exercises will test you to the very limit. Now, if you have enough 
                of the courage we seek, we [may begin]. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'we may begin' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok seems to be in deep contemplation of the matters 
                at hand, but then sighs and speaks with ____. <br>
                Dar Master Griblok says 'Good. Take this Field Armorer Kit. It 
                will allow you to use the [looted valuables] and even bodies of 
                your enemies to form basic armor materials. These basic materials 
                will prove quite valuable. When placed into a forge along with 
                the proper mold, it will allow you to craft your own Armor of 
                the Dar Initiate. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'what looted valuables' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok appears to be in silent prayer to Lord Marr, 
                only speaking to ____ after concluding the reverent petition. 
                <br>
                Dar Master Griblok says 'As I said, spoils of war and bodies will 
                provide the supplies you need. Innothule Swamp, the murky land 
                just beyond the city gates, holds some of the items you seek. 
                You may also have to talk to local merchants to locate the odd 
                piece. When you are ready to attempt these quests, you need only 
                tell me what you [want] and I will provide further instruction. 
                I can teach you the recipes and give you the armor molds for the 
                Armor of the Dar Initiate [Helm], [Breastplate], [Armplates], 
                [Bracer], [Gauntlets], [Leggings], and [Boots]. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a helm' <br>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok engages in a conversation with ___ on how 
                to craft the initiates helm, and what materials are needed. <br>
                Dar Master Griblok says 'A warrior's second skull, I always say. 
                You'll need an Alligator Hide, a Ball of Pulpy Fungus, a Cracked 
                Skeleton Skull and a Giant Moccasin Fang. Combine these ingredients 
                in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, 
                take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Helm of 
                the Dar Initiate. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a breastplate' <br>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok says 'The final shield. Yes. But its construction 
                will not be easy. Go and seek some Pristine Moccasin Scales, Burly 
                Kobold Ears, a Pristine Alligator Hide and some Moccasin Poison. 
                Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper 
                basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold 
                to finish your Breastplate of the Dar Initiate. Once so armored, 
                you'll be well prepared for a [greater task]. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft armplates' <br>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dar Master Griblok says 'To make your armplates, you'll need 
                some Moccassin Eggs, Bleeder Wings, Moccasin Scales and a Kobold 
                Talisman. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have 
                the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with

                to craft the initiates bracer, and what materials are needed. 
                <br>
                Dar Master Griblok says 'Ah, the quick defense against bloodthirsty 
                blades. You'll need a Crab Spider's Carapace, two Spiderling Silks 
                and a Malleable Bleeder Skin. Combine these ingredients in your 
                kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it

                breakfast, finding the breath to reply to ____s inquiry. <br>
                Dar Master Griblok says 'War often brings out the worst, it is 
                said. Sadly one of our very own grew greedy when he saw the trolls' 
                treasure. Sergeant Herptol fell to temptation, ignoring the voice 
                of our Lord that had commanded us to ignore the tainted loot. 
                He fled the city and his rightful punishment. I've learned he's 
                hiding out in the northern reaches of the Innothule. Go. Find 
                him. Slay him and recover what he stole. Bring me a Larvae Skin 
                and some Bull Alligator Spines. When you return the recovered 
                loot and these items, I shall craft you a sword. <br>
