            <h3> Steel Warrior Armor - Freeport Warrior Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Freeport. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer) and no drop. <i>Please 
              note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often 
              are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i> 
            <p> 
            <p>Go to the platform overlooking the arena in West Freeport, and 
              speak with Arinna Trueblade. (loc -240, -225)</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Arinna Trueblade'</p>
            <p>Arinna Trueblade says 'Well met Paeonia. I am Arianna Trueblade, 
              Warlord of the Steel Warriors. I am personally in charge of all 
              the training that our young warriors receive. I take pride in knowing 
              that my teaching can help make the foundation of a Freeport Champion. 
              If you are a [warrior] then we might just have something to talk 
              about.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a warrior'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'So you think you have what it takes to become 
              one of Freeport's finest? I will warn you now that we expect every 
              single warrior that is brought into our ranks to go through a series 
              of exercises. Rest assured you will be rewarded for your hard work 
              with a set of armor that I will walk you though the process of making. 
              Are you [ready to begin your testing]?'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am ready to begin my testing'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'Very well Paeonia, Here is your Steel Warriors 
              Mail Kit. This kit will be your main tool in creating your own armor. 
              You will gather various items from all areas of Freeport from monsters 
              and stores alike. You will use specific item combinations in this 
              kit to fashion together armor materials that you will combine in 
              a forge with the appropriate mold to make an armor piece. Once you 
              are ready to attempt a piece of armor simply tell me what piece 
              you [want] to craft. I will then present you with the recipe and 
              mold for Steel Warrior [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], 
              [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft Helms'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'Any Steel Warrior that is caught not wearing 
              a helm is usually placed on probation. We feel it is necessary sometimes 
              to do this so that our younger ones in training will understand 
              the importance of keeping your head well protected. To create your 
              helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 
              1 Rat Ear, 1 Meat Pie and 1 Barley in your assembly kit. Once you 
              have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this 
              mold to fashion your very own Steel Warriors Helm.'</p>

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft Bracers'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'As you progress further through your training 
              you will find yourself in heavy battle more and more often. Bracers 
              will ensure that you are able to fend off your opponents blows with 
              minimum injury. To create your bracer material you will need to 
              combine 1 Brick of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Rotting Zombie Skull, 1 Snake 
              Bile and 1 Tiny Dagger in your assembly kit. Once you have created 
              the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft Armguards'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'A slash or gash to the arms can greatly hinder 
              a warriors combat abilities. Wearing these armguards will ensure 
              that this does not happen. To create your helm material you will 
              need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Young Kodiak Paws, 
              1 Young Plains Cat Scalp and 1 Freeport Stout in your assembly kit. 
              Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft Boots'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'Boots are very necessary for any warrior 
              especially when you will usually be the one leading most combat 
              units. Being on the front line and treading across terrains first 
              make good boots a must. To create your boots material you will need 
              to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Shadow Wolf Tibia and 2 
              Spiderling Eyes in your assembly kit. Once you have created the 
              proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft Greaves'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'While most armor pieces are very vital to 
              a young warriors survival, greaves are one of the most important 
              armor pieces you will craft. To create your greaves material you 
              will need to combine 4 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Giant Fire Beetle 
              Brain, 1 Lion Tail, 1 Bottle and 1 Young Puma Skin in your assembly 
              kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft Gauntlets'<br>
              Arinna Trueblade says 'Keeping your hands well guarded is without 
              question the most important thing a warrior will do. Suffering a 
              blow to the hands that would prevent you from defending yourself 
              would most certainly mean death. To create your gauntlet material 
              you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Armadillo 
              Tail, 1 Severed Orc Foot, and 2 Spider Legs in your assembly kit.

              Arinna Trueblade says 'Your dedication to learning everything about 
              your class is impressive Paeonia. I have no doubt that you are ready 
              to collect the pieces for your Steel Warriors Breastplate. To create 
              your helm material you will need to combine 5 Bricks of Crude Iron 
              Ore, 1 Deathfist Orc Skull, 1 Woven Spider Silk, 1 Armadillo Carapace, 
              1 Matted Lion Pelt and 1 Rusty Short Sword in your assembly kit.

              training like yourself with. However, I don&#146;t have all the
