            <h3> Shar Vahl: Sonic Wolf Bane Weapons</h3>
            <p><i>This quest requires the cooperation of all five Vah Shir classes, 
              and requires that they have first completed their class-specific 
              quests. It results in the creation of a weapon, and then sends you 
              back to your guild for further questing. </i></p>
            <p><i>A question that has been often raised is: &quot;Can one character 
              do all the parts to the quest themselves?&quot; No. You must be 
              of the proper class in order to complete the class-specific quests 
              leading up to this quest. Additionally, non Vah Shir can multiquest 
              the citizenship quest and loop until they have enough faction to 
              attempt various Shar Vahl quests, but for the class-specific quests, 
              they may only complete the one for their own character class. (The 
              other guilds will not allow them to complete their quests.)</i></p>
            <p><i>You'll also find several spots where details are sketchy. If 
              you can help fill in the gaps, please <a href="http://go.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11?page=1">post 
              details to the message boards</a>.</i></p>
            <p>After each young Vah Shir completes their <a href="citizenship.htm">citizenship 
              quest</a>, their guild master starts them on a progressive set of 
              tradeskill quests. Each class is directed toward a different tradeskill. 
              Beastlords are assigned <a href="luclin_sharvahlBST.htm">tailoring 
              tasks</a>, rogues are assigned <a href="luclin_sharvahlROG.htm">baking 
              tasks</a>, shamen are given <a href="luclin_sharvahlSHM.htm">brewing 
              tasks</a>, warriors are set to smithing, and bards <a href="luclin_sharvahlBRD.htm">create 
              pottery</a>. </p>
            <p>When each class completes all their assigned tasks, they are given 
              a special no drop hilt (or claw for Beastlords) and sent to create 
              their sonic wolf bane weapon (and, presumably, help those who help 
              them to create their own weapons as well). This requires the assistance 
              of Vah Shir from all other character classes, as each has to create 
              an item that goes into the final weapon combine.</p>
            <p>The final combine of hilt/claw with the other needed parts is made 
              in a purchased Weapons Assembly Kit (sold by Arms Historian Qua). 
              There is no skill check on the final combine, but there are skill 
              checks for each of the class-specific combines listed below.</p>
            <p>All the drop items are found in Hollowshade Moor. Unless noted 
              otherwise the owlbear items drop off owlbear cubs and grapplers 
              (not owlbears in the caves) and the sonic wolf items drop off wandering 
              sonic wolves (not off the sonic wolves in the caves).</p>
            <p>It appears that the combines for each of the items listed below 
              is trivial in between 130 and 140 in the appropriate tradeskill. 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Beastlords must create <b>toughened sinew lashings</b>. First 
                ask Jhimis &quot;what about stretching dowels?&quot;, and he will 
                ask for 2 owlbear claws and your apprentice cloak. Give him the 
                claws and the cloak, and he will return your cloak, and give you 
                the no drop stretching dowel. Combine stretching dowel, owlbear 
                tendons, sonic wolf tendons, kelp salts and fish oil soaked rags 
                in any sewing kit to create toughened sinew lashings. Trivial 
                for the combine is 135 tailoring. Owlbear tendons drop in Hollowshade 
                Moor off the owlbear cubs and grapplers. Sonic wolf tendons appear 
                to drop off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. Kelp 
                salts drop off the moor tortoises in Hollowshade Moor. Fish oil 
                soaked rags are dropped off the grimling fisherman (and their 
                chief), also in Hollowshade Moor. </li>
              <li>Rogues must bake the <b>sonic wolf bane poison</b>. This requires: 
                salass moss, tortoise saliva, sonic wolf blood, poison dart felt. 
                Mix in these items in a no drop acrylia mortar &amp; pestle. Combine 
                the results with a posion vial and water in an oven<i>. </i>The 
                digested salass moss is dropped off owlbear cubs and grapplers 
                in Hollowshade Moor. The sonic wolf blood can drop off any wandering 
                sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. The poison dart felts are dropped 
                off the grimling spiritists in Hollowshade Moor. Toroise saliva 
                is dropped off moor tortoises in, yep, you guessed it, Hollowshade 
                Moor!</li>
              <li>Shaman must brew a <b>reactive sealant soak</b>. This is done 
                by combining blackened salt crystals, sonic wolf brain, crystalized 
                ygri root, digested night palm, a water flask, and a <a href="luclin_sharvahlSHM.htm">ceremonial 
                strainer</a> (no drop) in a brew barrel. The blackened salt crystals 
                are dropped off grimling mystics in Hollowshade Moor. Sonic wolf 
                brain can be dropped by any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade 
                Moor. Crystalized ygri root is a ground spawn near the sonic wolf 
                caves in Hollowshade Moor. Digested night palm drops off the owlbear 
                cubs in Hollowshade Moor.</li>
              <li>Warriors must smith a <b>porous dagger or claw blade</b> (based 
                upon which class is receiving the final weapon). This requires 
                bag of white sand (no drop), powered wolf claws (no drop), sonic 
                wolf blood (no drop), chunk of porous ore, water flask, and either 
                a blade mold or a claw mold, depending on which item you are making. 
                The chunk of porous ore is a ground spawn in Hollowshade Moor, 
                reported to be &quot;just before the bridge&quot; in Hollowshade 
                Moor, &quot;left over the hill&quot;. The white sand drops off 
                grimling fishermen and grimling mystics in Hollowshade Moor. Powered 
                wolf claws drop off wandering sonic wolves in Hollowshade, as 
                does the sonic wolf blood. The molds are apparently given by an 
                NPC, and further details are needed.</li>
              <li>Bards mush create the <b>ceramic sleeves</b> using pottery. 
                The ingredients are: ashes of dark ritual, flask of water, vial 
                of owlbear bile, sonic wolf blood, black silt clay, sketch (NPC 
                provided). Then fire with a quality firing sheet. <i>(Many more 
                details are needed.)</i> The ashes of dark ritual drop off grimling 
                spiritists in Hollowshade Moor. Owlbear bile is dropped off owlbear 
                cubs and grapplers in Hollowshade. The sonic wolf blood can drop 
                off any wandering sonic wolf in Hollowshade Moor. The black silt 
                clay is an underwater ground spawn in Hollowshade Moor. The sketch 
                is NPC provided, and details are not available on how to obtain 
                it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you have combined the appropriate claw/hilt and the 5 other 
              items in the Weapons Assembly Kit, you must bring the resulting 
              weapon and your Apprentice cloak (given during your class-specific 
              questing), to the person who gave you the quest (this varies based 
              on class). A more printable recipe, as well as the stats of the 
              sonic wolf bane weapons <a href="../secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">can 
              be found here.</a> You are then promoted to Journeyman status, given 
              a new Journeyman's cloak and instructed to bring your cloak to Ahom 
              Guzhin. Details on the continuation of this quest <a href="luclin_beyondsonicwolfbane.htm">can 
              be found here</a>.</p>
