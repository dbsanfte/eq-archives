<hr>
<h4>Planar Combat: Brewing:<a name="brewing"></a></h4> 
<p>
Hail Zauvuud Gigoth (n660, p910) once you have received your Planar Travelers Manual. You will find him in the evil section of town 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Zauvudd Gigoth'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Zauvudd Gigoth says 'Hello, ____. I see you have obtained a manual on planar travel. It is good to see your determination has taken its first step to true glory. I think you may finally be ready to learn the basics of planar combat, that is if you are [willing to learn]. Remember, courage is imperial. It underlies true achievement. With your courage you shall achieve many great things.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I am willing to learn'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Zauvudd Gigoth says 'This is good. One of the most important aspects to your battle readiness is your strong willpower and bravery. Years ago I discovered a particular concoction that will very readily put your willpower to the test. Unfortunately I ran out not too long ago and I am in need of some more [Planar Blood Brew]. If you can make some more for my students, it would certainly look favorably upon you in your future teachings. Bring me some along with your Planar Traveler's Manual.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'What Planar Blood Brew?'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Zauvudd Gigoth says 'To make the infamous Planar Blood Brew, you must attain some Nightmare Mephit Blood, Slarghilug Blood, Bubonian Blood, Soda Water, Grapes, a Cask, a Cork, and a Corking Device. Mix them in a Brew Barrel, and if you are skilled enough, the resulting swill should curl the hairs on even the hardiest of traveler's heads!'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Make some of this brew, and hand it in to him.
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Zauvudd Gigoth says 'Wow, this is great! Wow! This is maybe the best Planar Blood Brew I have ever tasted! You have passed the first test with flying colors. Here, you take this book and learn well from it. When you are ready for your next lesson, speak to Xasri Virek.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You will receive xp, as well as:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Beginner Combat Manual<br>
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br>
Slot: RANGE SECONDARY<br>
AC: 7<br>
STR: +6 STA: +6 HP: +15 MANA: +15<br>
Recommended level of 45.<br>
WT: 1.0 Size: SMALL<br>
Class: ALL<br>
Race: ALL
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Xasri Virek'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Xasri Virek says 'Welcome my student. I see you have brought with you the Beginner's Manual. If you are ready for your next lesson, the task is simple. A vicious terror has awoken somewhere in the Plane of Innovation. You must seek out the Junk Beast and bring me its power source along with your Beginner Combat Manual. Doing this will prove your battle courage above all else. Remember, the gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man or lizard perfected without trials. I wish you luck.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While the next batch of hail text is not yet available, turning in the power source from the junk beast and your Beginner Combat Manual results in:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Intermediate Combat Manual<br>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Next, you hail Gwiraba Gelrid, who should be right near the other two 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Gwiraba Gelrid'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Gwiraba Gelrid says 'Good day to you, Furioso. By the looks of things you have learned quite a bit about planar combat already, but if you wish to be truly knowledgeable on the subject, there is one last course you must undertake. Using your newfound courage and bravery, you must collect for me a Sandstorm Gem, a Rage Filled Gem, and a Blue Diamond. Bring me these items along with your Intermediate Combat Manual. And remember, unless you have the moral nerve to live out your convictions, they are of little account.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Rage filled gems drop in Drunder, Fortress of Zek randomly and are droppable. Sandstorm gems drop in Bastion of Thunder, off random first floor desert giants (south wing) and are no-drop.  Blue diamonds for this quest are the usual blue diamonds that drop in various high level zones.  After turning in the items:
<blockquote> 
<p>
Gwiraba Gelrid says 'I must say, this is a surprise. I was beginning to wonder if you would ever return with these. I'm glad you see you have though. Take this new book and use it well in your future journeys. You may also be interested to know that Tenada Jeried also has a few lesson plans for very advanced students. If you should see him, be sure to tell him you are interested in learning from him. Good luck to you, _____!' 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And you are now the proud new owner of:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>

<h4>Planar Magic: Baking:<a name="baking"></a></h4>
<p>
Hail Acomar Lothwol, while wielding your Planar Traveler's Manual, and he goes into a short speech, that basically asks if you're willing to learn more. You can find him in plane of Knowledge at (p675, p810).
</p>
<p>
You say 'I am willing to learn'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
'The use of magic can be a taxing ordeal on the body, and quite often may leave you in a weakened state. Fortunately, I happen to know of a rather rejuvenating meal that will grant new power to your condition. If you are not familiar with the recipe for [Hobgoblin Surprise], I can tell you. What you must do is bring me some as well as your Planar Traveler's Manual. I hope you won't be long, for I am beginning to get quite hungry.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p> You say 'What hobgoblin surprise?".
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
"Don't be put off by the name, it's actually quite tasty. To make Hobgoblin Surprise, get a pie tin, some bread, add some hobgoblin meat and brown gravy. Cook it in the oven and enjoy the results. Mmm mmm, it waters my mouth just thinking about it."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You must hand in <i><b>both</b></i> the hobgoblin surprise and your planar travelers manual to him. <i><b>(Note: the manual is NOT returned)</b></i>. 
<blockquote> 
<p>
Acomar Lothwol says 'How delicious! You have done well here, I can't remember how long it's been since I've tasted a meal so fine. Take this book, it will certainly help you in your use of the magical arts. When you are ready, Cadelid Etord will give you your next lesson, so be sure to speak to him. Do not lose your book or else he may not appreciate you coming to class unprepared.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He hands you:</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Beginner's Magic Manual, <br>
magic, lore, no drop, <br>
range, secondary, <br>
AC 7, WIS 6, INT 6, HP 15, mana 15<br>
wt 1.0, small, all/all.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Next, hail Cadelid Etord, who stands beside Acomar Lothwol. Hail him and recieve the following text:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Cadelid Etord says 'I see by the beginner manual you carry that you are on the right track. Let us continue your lessons, shall we? Magic can be a susceptible, yet volatile force sometimes, especially when wielded in the hands of dark beings. I fear there is one such being in particular that seeks to damage the very foundation of our mystic abilities, an ugly warrior by the name of Vhaksiz the Shade. He calls the Plane of Nightmares his home. You must seek this foul creature out and acquire proof of his demise: his dark, sinister heart. Bring it to me along with your Beginner's Magic Manual.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
His heart is no drop, but it can be MQed if you have the person who has the heart hand in the heart before you hand in the manual. Once you give it to him, he gives you the Intermediate Magic Manual.
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Intermediate Magic Manual<br>
MAGIC LORE NO DROP <br>
AC 10 <br>
WIS +9 INT +9 HP +25 MANA +25 <br>
RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF 50 <br>
WT: 1.0 Size: SMALL <br>
ALL/ALL
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He then tells you to speak to Zalil Nyvin.
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Zalil Nyvin says 'How do you do, ____? So you think you're skilled in the art of magic, do you? Pay close attention for this course I have for you will test your magical prowess like none before. In order to continue my work I will need for you to bring back a few things for me. When you can locate a Tornado Gem, a Battle Worn Trinket, and a Blue Diamond, return and hand them to me along with your Intermediate Magic Manual. If you can do this, then perhaps maybe there is a shred of hope left for you after all! Be off now and good luck!'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tornado gems are no drop and drop off giants in the north wing (vind giants) of Bastion of Thunder. The trinket is dropped off various guards in Plane of Tactics. Hand them in along with a blue diamond and your intermediate magic manual for the following:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Advanced Magic Manual<br>
Slot: RANGE SECONDARY<br>
AC: 15<br>
WIS: 12 INT 12 HP 35 MANA 35<br>
recc 55<br>

all/all
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You are then sent to speak with Tenada Jeried.
</p>
<p>
When spoken to, Tenada Jeried asks you to bring him all three advanced manuals and a "Hope Stone" which "currently lies somewhere in the elemental planes."
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Planar Stealth: Pottery:</b> <a name="pottery"></h4>
<p>
Find Winon Glahar in a building at -119. 58. You say, 'Hail, Winon Glahar'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Winon Glahar says 'Good day, ___. I see your curiosity of the planes is growing, as you have obtained a manual on planar travel. It is good to see young adventurers interested in planar exploration, but there is one aspect of discovery you must always be prepared for, the struggle for survival. There are very dangerous places to be seen and experienced out there, and it would behoove you to be ready to face what challenges may come. With my help, I can teach you the basics of planar stealth and reflexes if you are [willing to learn].
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I am willing to learn'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Winon Glahar says 'This is good. Through your trials of planar travel shall your knowledge of stealth techniques grow, and the more you learn, the more you shall produce. In order to prove your newfound knowledge, your first lesson will be to create a special [planar stein] of particular design. Once you have acquired this stein, you must give it to me along with your Planar Traveler's Manual. Once done, new lessons may be opened up to you.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what planar stein'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Winon Glahar says 'To fashion the stein I seek, you must acquire a Block of Tanaan Clay, a Ceramic Lining Sketch, Tainted Planar Essence, a Water Flask, and some Sculpting Tools. Use these items in a pottery wheel to create your base model to work from. Crush some Valor Crystals together with some Glaze Lacquer in a glaze mortar to make Crystalline Valor Glaze. You must then take a Lacquered Peridot, the Crystalline Valor Glaze, a High Quality Firing Sheet, and the base model stein and merge them in a kiln to put the finishing touches on your work. I hope to see you bring me a handsome-looking stein soon. Good luck!'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hand in the stein and:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Winon Glahar says 'Marvelous! You certainly have shown to be a skilled craftsman, and I thank you for such a lovely beverage conveyance. Take this book and use it to learn from. When you are ready, speak with Leramas Feston for your next lesson. Do not lose this manual or else he will not be able to train you.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He gives you a small amount of xp, a small amount of coin, and the:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Beginner Stealth Manual<br>
magic, lore, no drop<br>
secondary, range<br>
AC 7, DEX 6, AGI 6, HP 15, mana 15<br>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hail Leramas Feston and recieve the following text:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Leramas Feston says 'I hope your first teachings have taught you well, ____. It is time for your next lesson. The accumulation of knowledge requires exploration and study. If you explore the cave system in the Plane of Disease, you may eventually discover a foul being by the name of Rallius Rattican. You are to bring me his head, along with your Beginner Stealth Manual. Once done, we may proceed with your next lesson.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hand him the Beginner Stealth Manual, as well as the head of Rallicus Rattican, and he will give you the Intermediate Stealth Manual
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Leramas Feston says 'Good work, _______. I must say I am quite impressed with your recovery of this. Clearly you have shown you are ready to begin your next lesson. Take this new book and when you are ready, speak to Ethoach Trokith. And remember, difficult tasks are put in our way not to stop us, but to call out our strength and resolve.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Ethoach Trokith'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ethoach Trokith says 'Good day, Kati. It would appear you have learned much about the art of stealth already, and this is good. Are you ready to learn more? If so, listen closely. To graduate to the next level of precision and cunning, you need to discover a few items. Bring forth a Blizzard Gem, a Symbol of the Daiku, a Blue Diamond, and your Intermediate Stealth Manual. I feel this will be an adequate test of your skill at this stage in your development. Good luck!'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Turn in the blizzard gem, a symbol of the daiku, a blue diamond and your intermediate stealth manual and:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ethoach Trokith says 'Astounding! This certainly proves you are worth far more than you appear. Take this book, it can teach you many new things. Also know this, Tenada Jeried is available for further study, and only for advanced students such as yourself. Be sure to visit him and tell him you are interested in learning from him. Take care, _____.'

<hr> 
<h4><a name="final"></a>The Final Step</h4>
<p>
Once you complete any of the three above advanced manuals, you are sent to speak with Tenada Jeried:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
You say, 'I am interested in learning from you'
</p>
<p>
Tanada Jeried considers for a moment and continues, 'Very well, but first you must prove that you are student of the advanced arts. In order to do this, you will need to collect each of the advanced manuals in combat, stealth, and magic. You will also need to seek out a prized possession known as a Hope Stone. I believe it currently lies somewhere in the elemental planes. Return to me with these four tools of learning, and only then will you be truly worthy of what secrets the planes have to offer.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Hope Stone has been reported as dropping off various mobs in the elemental planes (fire, air, earth). Hand in the 3 advanced manuals, and the Hope Stone:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Tanada Jeried's eyes go wide. This is incredible! You have proven yourself to be truly worthy of these planar secrets, ______. May its knowledge contained within guide you safely wherever you travel.
