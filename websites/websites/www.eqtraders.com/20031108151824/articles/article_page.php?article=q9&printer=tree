<span class="headers">Rivervale Paladin (Bravefoot) Armor</span>
<p>
<p><i>This is one of many new youngling armor quests in Rivervale. The resulting
armor is lore (other than bracer), no drop, HFL/PAL only. The combines are
no-fail, and can grant skill increases. (Smithing trivial <=22). Armor is
yellow in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer
materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a
second one</i></p>

<p>Kaya Cloudfoot says 'A pleasure to make your acquaintance _____. I am Kaya
Cloudfoot, first Paladin of the Storm Reapers. I traveled long ago when I was
just a wee sprout to the city of Qeynos far to the west. It was there I grew
under the tutelage of the Knights of Thunder, a noble order of paladins loyal to
Karana, the Storm Lord. I have returned now to Rivervale to teach interested
young halflings the ways of a Knight of the Storm Reapers so that we may defend
Karanas people and lands from the [evil forces] that would see it destroyed. '</p>

<p>Kaya Cloudfoot says 'The Teir'Dal, or Dark Elves that reside in the
underground city of Neriak to the east beyond the Commonlands have long been a
bane to us Storm Reapers. Many of our Druids have fallen attempting to hold back
the tide of hate and destruction that has taken hold on the Nektulos Forest and
threatens the surrounding lands. It was also the Teir`Dals patron God, Innorruuk,
who caused the [Curse of Bloody Kithicor]. Are you ready to [face the Teir'Dal]
and bloody your hands for the protection of your Shire and our commoners humble
way of life? '</p>
<p>You say, 'what Curse of Bloody Kithicor'</p>
<p>Kaya Cloudfoot says 'There was a great war that was fought not long ago
between the Teir'Dal, and their evil minions, and the armies of Felwithe, Qeynos,
Freeport, and Kaladim. In the Kithicor Woods the Daughter of Innoruuk, Lanys
T'Vyl, and her minions fought against the chosen of Tunare, Firiona Vie, and her
most loyal allies. The evil God of Hate, Innoruuk, intervened every living
creature in the Kithicor Woods instantly fell dead as a great rift to the Plane
of Hate appeared in the sky. Since that time, when night falls on the Kithicor
Woods blood seeps from the trees and ground and the hateful dead hunt any living
being who dares to trespass in the woods that ended their lives. '</p>
