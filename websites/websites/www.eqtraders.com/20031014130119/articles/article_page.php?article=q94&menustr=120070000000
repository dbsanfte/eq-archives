<span class="headers">Ak`Anon Rogue (Shadowwalkers Chain) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests. The quest originates with Welno Tanboots, in the Rogue guildhall of Ak'Anon. It should result in armor that is lore (other than bracer) no drop, and is GNM/ROG only. (Note: if you're a gnome rogue of Bertoxx, you need the quest at <a href="akanon_evilrogue.htm">this link</a>, instead). Graphic for the armor is purple chain. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
