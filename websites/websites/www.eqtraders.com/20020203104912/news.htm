                <p>I just got the following in email and wanted to forward it 
                  on to everyone:</p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p><b><font size="+1">GU Comics closes it's doors</font></b>.</p>
                  <p> After more than a year and some 18 million+ page views, 
                    I feel that GU Comics has run it's course. There are a ton 
                    of people I'd like to simultaneously thank and say goodbye 
                    to; but for the sake of brevity, I'll do that else where and 
                    at another time. </p>
                  <p>I would like to thank Everlore at this time though. They 
                    were wonderful hosts for my little web comic. I appreciate 
                    all the hard work they put into keeping GU live. You guys 
                    own. Thanks. </p>
                  <p>And to the fans... I love you guys. At the darkest moments 
                    and the lowest point you were there to lift me up and support 
                    my work. I enjoyed the time you shared with me, and I hope 
                    I brought atleast one smile to you. And, hopefully helped 
                    you realize that EQ is a game... and that it's okay to take 
                    yourself lightly. </p>
                  <p>Thanks again and maybe I'll be seeing you around. </p>

                <p><i>Your humor and art will be missed, Woody, but I can't say 
                  that I blame you at all. My best wishes to you, and I hope we

                  Everlore's still having some residual problems, so while the 
                  <a href="http://gucomics.everlore.com">/gu comics</a> addy I 
                  have listed works most of the time, Woody's FTP access for putting 
                  up new strips was still unhappy at last check. I've offered 
                  to let him leave a message here on my front page if he needs 
                  to reach a chunk of his loyal fans. :)</p>
                <p>In other news, yes, imbued field plate boots work now, and 
                  yes, I'm mostly absent from the site and EQ for a while. Time 
                  for a long halfling nap in someone's backpacks. ;)</p>
                <p><span class="dates">8/15/01 - Patch Day</span><br>
                  Imbued field plate boots are supposed to be working as of today 
                  - I'll try to get some updates done later today once folks have 
                  a chance to test them and report back with stats. ... Now, if 
                  only we could get imbued armor, any imbued armor, for some of 
                  the forgotten deities, such as my own Bristlebane! ;) <i>{said 
                  very tongue-in-cheek, I know there's lots going on}</i></p>
                <p>The village newspapers have brought forth information on another 
                  new recipe, this one for <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1025.topic">vegetable 
                  roughy</a>. Again, site updates will happen later in the day.</p>
                <p>I was getting pretty antsy without my /gu comics fix until 
                  Woody gave me a happier URL for it. For those of you used to 
                  hitting http://www.gucomics.com, try <a href="http://gucomics.everlore.com" target="_new">http://gucomics.everlore.com</a> 
                  for your humor fix. I'll go through the site, yep, you guessed 
                  it, later in the day, and make sure all my links point to the 
                  working URL.</p>
                <p>I'm really burnt out on EQ, tradeskills and the site, and am 
                  going to be taking it easy for a while longer, trying to remember 
                  where the &quot;fun&quot; part of all this is. (Yes, the tell 
                  bombs are still bad, and most folks think that even the simplest 
                  question requires 10 tells to dance around the subject before 
                  they come to the point, adding to the load of spam scrolling 
                  across my screen, and making it hard for me to concentrate on 
                  everything else going on ... like raids that they've interrupted.) 
                  I'm not running away yet, I'm not closing down the site or anything 
                  silly like that, but I'm going to take my grumpy redheaded self 
                  and hide a lot until I can become ungrumpy again. :)</p>
                <p><span class="dates">7/24/01 - Patch Day</span><br>
                  Top news from the patch message is that non-quest pelts will 
                  be stackable, and that two of the deity-specific pottery idols 
                  have been changed. (We know some non-quest tailoring pelts were 
                  overlooked, but we're not sure if it was accident or intent 
                  - I've submitted an enquiry) about it. At least one of the idols 
                  we consider &quot;bugged&quot; has not been fixed (Rallos Zek), 
                  and another (Cazic Thule) had a couple surplus classes removed 
                  from the list of who could wield. More details as they become 
                  available.</p>
                <p>New issues of the newspapers should be available in all starting 
                  cities. Please use <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=624.topic">this 
                  message board thread</a> to track anything regarding tradeskills 
                  that is found in local papers.</p>
                <p>Site updates have been slow due to an RL death in the family 
                  last week. I hope to get a bit more caught up on information 
                  from the boards, screen shots, etc., as time goes on. So far, 
                  the biggest news item since the last front page update, was 
                  information on three different imbued versions of the <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">erudite 
                  steelsilk</a> armor.</p>
                <p><span class="dates">7/10/01 - Patch Day</span><br>
                  As usual, I'm going to be swamped, the boards are going to be 
                  VERY busy, and very slow. It looks to be a good patch day tradeskill-wise, 
                  but it's going to take time for us to verify everything mentioned 
                  in the patch message ... and the stuff that wasn't mentioned. 
                  :)</p>
                <p>On the confirmed list, we've got the new weight stats for the 
                  <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_leathers.htm">black panther 
                  armor</a> (two pieces stayed at their old weight of 0.3, all 
                  others had their weight reduced), the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_silks.htm">ice 
                  silk lined slippers</a> had their stats updated, spider silk 
                  and silk swatches are now stackable, and at least some types 
                  of sheet metal and folded sheets of metal are stackable (we've 
                  not yet tested all the racial sheets yet). More information 
                  will be on the message boards as the day goes on. Meanwhile, 
                  I'm going to be working on editing and submitting screenshots 
                  to EQ'Lizer and Alla'Khazam's, so that they have the updated 
                  stats on the changed tailored items ... and maybe get some more 
                  sleeeeeeep.</p>
                <p><span class="dates">06/29/01</span><br>
                  Nothing <i>too</i> earth-shattering to report with this patch. 
                  Pottery idols are now equippable, for the most part, by the 
                  proper races and classes. (I've added in a <a href="secrets/pottery_idols.htm">stats 
                  page for the idols</a>, and we're slowly filling in the blanks 
                  on it.) One new baking recipe (orange flavored cod) was found 
                  in the village newspapers. </p>

                <li>I've added a few new images to the fashion section in the 
                  last few days, but I really can't do much with it on top of 
                  everything else, so it will be slow to get updates until I find 
                  another fashion editor. </li>
                <li>I've added info about mana vials to the FAQ section of the 
                  boards, and will try to find time to put up an FAQ section on 
                  this main site as well as time permits. Now, if only we could 
                  get folks to read the FAQ posts, it'd clear up some of the extra 
                  noise on the boards. :)</li>
                <li>There are still folks directly emailing me with questions 
                  about things that are better posted to the message boards where 
                  they'll get responses from more folks. Please, folks, use the 
                  boards. Do not expect one overworked halfling to sit there and 
                  personally explain to you the ins and outs of making dyes, for 
                  example. If my explanation on the main site isn't clear, then 
                  maybe someone on the boards can explain it to you more clearly 
                  than I apparently can. ;)<br>

                  It's been submitted to the SONY QA boards, and hopefully they'll

                  <b>Patch Day</b>. As usual, this means I'll be really busy once 
                  the servers come back up, seeing what's changed on the live 
                  servers. Also, as usual, it means the message boards will be 
                  VERY slow loading, as it's likely to hit the 20K hits in a single 
                  day mark today. Patience, grasshoppers. I'll get updates up 
                  as able.</p>
                <p>I normally don't talk a lot about what's going on over on the 
                  Test server, though we randomly get updates from the Test tradesfolk 
                  when something is coming through that will impact the trade 
                  community. After all, it <i>is</i> Test, and things can/will/do 
                  change often on Test before they hit the live servers. (And 
                  I absolutely refuse, under any situation to post recipes/stats 
                  on the main part of my site until it's verified as &quot;live&quot;.) 
                  However, an accomplishment last night on Test deserves a little 
                  cheering. The fleeting quiver has been very much a &quot;holy 
                  grail&quot; type item for tailors and archers for 2 years now, 
                  and finally, the recipe was put in place on Test. Given the 
                  difficulty of obtaining the needed ingredients on Test, and 
                  the fact that there is a much smaller tradesfolk community on 
                  Test, extra kudos go to Uind and Gyodokan for reporting the 
                  first known success on a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=1676.topic">fleeting 
                  quiver</a> on Test last night about half an hour before the 
                  servers went down. Well done! I'm sure the folks on the live 
                  servers will quickly follow suit once the servers are back up. 
                  :)</p>
                <p><b>Addendum:</b> The new imbued pottery idols are in-game. 
                  Recipe is on the pottery recipes page and has been verified 
                  as functional. Discussion and stats are on the message board. 
                  Snake meat can now be pickled and made into steaks. Another 
                  fish recipe (marinated muskie) has been found that trivials 
                  at 142. The fleeting quiver recipe is live, and folks who have

                  <b>Tailoring Recipes Found</b>. My thanks to Suppina as well 
                  as a large number of other folks who took the challenge of the 
                  missing recipes and ran with it. We have stats, plus rough trivial 
                  levels for an entire new set of silk armor (<a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring.htm">Wu's 
                  Fighting Armor</a>) that will get tailors into the 150-range 
                  with their tailoring skill. You folks on the message boards 
                  have done the EQ tradeskill community proud with your cooperation 
                  and information sharing! My one comment on all this, though, 
                  is that they just recently stated that the Coldain Tanners Kit 
                  could be used for ALL recipes other than the cultural tailoring 
                  ... but they don't have enough slots in them for the 3-silk 
                  pieces of this armor. Hmmmmmm ... Are tailors stuck needing 
                  multiple sewing kits ... again?</p>
                <p>Last week, Aragir also posted results on the enchanted Antonian 
                  longswords. It seems we had the right recipes all along -- sort 
                  of. (The &quot;ruby&quot; and &quot;emerald&quot; mentioned 
                  by the NPC turned out to be &quot;star ruby&quot; and &quot;fire 
                  emerald&quot;, respectively)</p>
                <p>New baking discoveries seem to have trickled to a halt for 
                  the moment, but it's likely we'll figure out a few more once 
                  the dust settles.</p>
                <p>Potters are eyeing a couple new items on Test with some interest. 
                  There's a lot of speculation going on, but we'll just have to 
                  bide our time to see what actually makes it to the live servers.</p>

                <b>What's New?</b> New baking recipes are still pouring in from 
                a horde of happy cooks, and I'm sure it will take a while before 
                we figure out all the new fish dishes. Expect some shuffling to 
                be done on the baking recipes page in a few days to try to better 
                organize the new recipes, but for now, I'm just trying to make 
                sure they all get listed as we find them. Smiths are reacting 
                with a mixture of pleasure and frustration. Enchanted chain jointing 
                is now working for high elves and dark elves, as are their racial 
                chain boots, and stats are starting to come in for many of these 
                armor items. However, human cultural smithing recipes for imbued 
                field plate boots and the enchanted antonian longsword still appear 
                to be nonfunctional. Tailors are still pulling their hair out, 
                as they're trying to find the hinted-at new recipes, and not having 
                much success, as the only new &quot;recipes&quot; that have been 
                found are for the 5th Thurgadin Shawl quest.</p>

                    <b>Patch Day!</b> Most folks know the drill - it's going to 
                    take time to process everything that went in during this patch 
                    to see what affects us. Please be sure to check message board 
                    threads before you start yet another totally new thread on 
                    a topic that's covered in 6 other places - it makes it really 
                    hard for folks to follow what's going on with all the repetition. 
                    :) The below information will be updated later today, once 
                    we know for sure how things are going on the live servers.</p>
                  <p>Here's what I know about today's patch and how it will affect 
                    tradesfolk:</p>
  
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a problem making it hard to loot really large NPCs 
                    - if this works as stated, it should make it easier to loot 
                    Terrorantula for silk.</li>
                  <li>Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows - the details 
                    are VERY vague on this, and I'm sure everyone will have their 
                    own pet theories or ideas on how this &quot;should&quot; work 
                    in the forums. Only time will tell how significant a change 
                    this truly is.</li>
                  <li>Not only the party, but the person looting, will now see 
                    a text message saying what the person looted - at the least, 
                    this will make those folks hunting cat pelts in the Karanas 
                    happier, as you can tell which quality pelt you looted without 
                    having to peer at each pelt as you're looting.</li>
                  <li>You can move items in and out of containers in your bank 
                    without having to remove the containers from the bank - a 
                    great boon to space-impaired tradesfolk!</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>Other things not in the patch message that are expected in 
                    this patch. (We won't be able to check any of it out until 
                    things are up and running again, of course)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>&quot;Some&quot; new tailoring recipes. No word yet on what 
                    form these will take, but this message will be updated accordingly 
                    as we know more.</li>
                  <li>New baking recipes, mainly for the seafood lovers amongst 
                    us. Unfortunately, the text for these recipes didn't make 
                    it in this patch, though, so unless we succeed with some creative 
                    experiments, we may not actually see these until the next 
                    patch.</li>
                  <li>Several fixes were made to bugged recipes (enchanted adamantite 
                    chain, enchanted/imbued adamantite leggings, stats on the 
                    velium hound moccasins, etc.), but we don't know if they managed 
                    to get added to today's patch, or if they're waiting on the 
                    next patch.</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>I've also added a <a href="learn/learn_velious_nontailors.htm">lovely 
                    guide</a> for all the non-tailors out there who want some 
                    of the Velious tailored armor, giving information on the relatively 
                    difficulty of obtaining the needed items for your local tailor. 
                    It will hopefully raise a bit of awareness amongst non-tailors 
                    in just why it's so difficult to get a tailor to &quot;just&quot; 
                    make and sell them some pieces.</p>

                  <p>It's a quiet week on the tradeskill front since there's no 
                    patch, but experimentation and discussion continue on the 
                    boards. Slowly, we're getting more <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">stats

                    keep my fingers crossed that the hard-working folks at Refplace 
                    have got things well in hand now.</p>
                  <p>I'll get more up tomorrow, as I'm sort of busy in Hate right 
                    now, but a quick note to let folks know that while the tier'dal 
                    version of enchanted adamantite chain jointing is misbehaving 
                    (Yakatizma's looking into it), enchanted tier'dal plate works! 
                    I'll get the appropriate recipes onto the dark elven smithing 
                    page tomorrow . For now, you'll find out how I did it on <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=2160.topic">this

                    recipes</a> have been updated with several new recipes, as 
                    well as food type information and know stat information. Once 
                    the boards are back up, I'll ask folks to scan the recipes 
                    page and see what I've missed. Since this <i>is</i> a tradeskill 
                    site, you'll only find information on there for player-made 
                    food, not for any of the purchased stuff. It's also been officially 
                    confirmed that right-clicking on foods will NOT give any of 
                    the listed stat changes for that food, and will only last 
                    half-duration.</p>

                    to the rarity of the spawn, and the extreme expense involved, 
                    we don't expect to quickly have complete stats for this tailored 
                    plate-class armor.</p>
                  <p>Thanks to the changes in enchanting metals for smithing, 
                    we're gradually learning more about the various enchanted

                  <b>Patch Day!</b> It's that time again, and there are several 
                  known tradeskill changes in it:</p>
              </blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>Durations on food items have changed. We've got a thread on 
                  the baking message boards tracking meal/snack status on various 
                  goodies. Some foods also have stat bonuses listed, however, 
                  these bonuses are NOT actually showing up when you right-click 
                  to eat the food.</li>
                <li>Ovens have been added to Grobb. I'll get info on where, and 
                  put it on the proper Trade Supplies pages.</li>
                <li>Buying stacks of items off merchants has been implemented. 
                  This, of course, only works if the item is stackable. Also, 
                  merchants have improved their inventory retention program, and 
                  fully count stacks of items that are sold to them, so that they 
                  can sell all the items back to someone else. (Before, if you 
                  sold a stack of items to a merchant, the merchant paid for them 
                  all, but would then only think he/she had one of the item to 
                  sell back.)</li>
                <li>World (stationary) trade containers have been fixed. This 
                  <i>should</i> fix the crash to desktop problem folks were having 
                  on a combine, and solve the confusion generated when folks thought 
                  their ingredients were disappearing after an incorrect combine 
                  (from a wrong recipe). This likely does NOT address the tailoring 
                  issues we're seeing, and once the dust has settled, we'll need 
                  to start getting in feedback if the DNC problems are still continuing 
                  for portable trade containers such as sewing kits.</li>
                <li><b><i>Cooking spits have had their weight increased to 3. 
                  Contrary to the patch message, skewers are still weight 0.1</i></b></li>
                <li>Last, but <i>definitely</i> not least, enchanting metals for 
                  cultural smithing no longer requires gems during the enchanting 
                  process. This is a great boon to cultural smiths, and should 
                  allow us to experiment a bit more easily with some of the enchanted 
                  armors and weapons. There's already been much rejoicing over 
                  the news that this was on Test, and I expect we'll see a lot 
                  of the &quot;gaps&quot; in our enchanted cultural armor stats 
                  information filled in over the next week or two.</li>

                  <b>Thanks folks!</b> Thanks to feedback from various folks who 
                  follow these boards, the QA folks may have nailed down the crash 
                  to desktop problem with tradeskill containers. I'm still not 
                  sure if the DNC message folks have been getting on valid recipes 
                  are linked (i.e., &quot;phantom&quot; items still in the container 
                  from a failed combine) or not, but they've at least found part 
                  of the problem, and are working to resolve it. For those of 
                  you unaware of what I'm talking about, here's a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000032.html">link 
                  to the thread over on the SONY boards</a>. </p>

                  <b>One Million ... Plus!</b> Thanks to Ragefire not showing 
                  up for a few days on my server (just when I'm one of the prime 
                  people &quot;camping&quot; for hours on end to try to get him 
                  for a guildmate), I'm even more behind on things than normal. 
                  However, since today's a banner day, of sorts, it deserves some 
                  sort of post. The message boards topped the 1 million hit mark 
                  today, since their rebirth a year ago January. (That's a half 
                  a million hits just since this January.) I wish I had better 
                  stats for the main website, which is tracked separately from 
                  the boards, but we only have stats for the last couple of months 
                  since I moved hosting providers. If March's traffic is any indication, 
                  I'd expect that the main site will get over a million hits this 
                  month, on top of all the heavy volume on the message boards. 
                  Welcome to the mainstream, folks! It's only going to get busier 
                  from here, with all the changes/additions to tradeskills that 
                  have been happening.</p>
                <p>Other mini-updates. Thanks to Khrolan and his raids, I was 
                  able to test out two more pieces of the ice burrower silk (&quot;ice 
                  silk&quot;) armor this week, as well as verify stats on two 
                  more pieces of haze panther armor. As soon as I get more haze 
                  panther pelts, I'll try to get stat verification for the final 
                  piece of that set, then will be trying to avoid my sewing kit 
                  except for testing the rest of the ice silk and the velium hound 
                  armor as parts are available. It's STILL taking folks about 
                  10 tell bombs to get it to sink in that I'm not tailoring for 
                  other folks anymore, but eventually folks will either accept 
                  that no means NO, or I'll be clearing out and refilling my /ignore 
                  list every half an hour because of all the folks who think I 
                  &quot;owe&quot; them civil conversation on tradeskills in the 
                  middle of a raid. ;)</p>

                the FanFest: <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=449.topic">pickled 
                bixie</a> and <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm55.showMessage?topicID=33.topic">fish 
                eggs</a>. I'll get them onto the recipe pages later. Sleep is 
                my friend. Meanwhile, the message board links are included for 
                folks. I also added a comment in the huge thread about <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=215.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100">tradeskill 
                containers</a> with an idea that has been brought up to Yakatizma. 
                There are NO promises it will go anywhere, but at least the idea 
                has been aired. There are also <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=446.topic">changes 
                afoot in baking sometime soon</a>, and I'll talk about that, and 
                other experiences from the FanFest (including my interview for 
                the <i>Avatars Offline</i> documentary) ... but likely not until 
                Monday. The same goes for the multitude of posts with trivials 
                and other site updates that I've not dealt with - it likely will 
                be Monday before I tackle much more. Sleeeeeeeeep <i>&lt;thuddddd&gt;</i></p>

                  Tradeskill experimenters rejoice! One of the things that has 
                  always hindered significant experimentation with the myriad 
                  of recipes that we've been told are &quot;out there somewhere&quot; 
                  but that have been undiscovered has been resources. It's painfully 
                  hard to throw what can be hundreds of platinum pieces' worth 
                  of items and/or hours worth of collection time, into a tradeskill 
                  container on an &quot;experiment&quot; that will fail and destroy 
                  the items. Currently live only on the test server is a change 
                  that will make tradeskill containers NOT destroy items that 
                  &quot;do not combine&quot; (DNC), making the lives of curious 
                  experimenters a lot easier. On the downside, many portable tradeskill 
                  containers will given a weight increase, making it harder for 
                  packrats like myself to lug about multiple different containers 
                  for tradeskilling in the field. (My worst packrat is my shamaness, 
                  who regularly carries around a spirit pouch, bearskin potion 
                  bag, Coldain Tanners Kit *and* a cooking spit.) Message board 
                  threads were popping up all over regarding this change, and 
                  I'm trying to get them funneled into <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=215.topic" target="_new">one

              <li>More brewed egg oils have been discovered, though we've not 
                found a use for them yet. Discussion/experimentation for valid

                I'm sure folks (especially tailors) will start trying every crazed 
                combination they can, to see if they can find a use for these, 
                but as always, it will be expensive and time-consuming experimentation 
                since we have no &quot;clues&quot; as to if these are for any 
                implemented recipes, or if they are for future recipes, or if 
                they're just there for the sake of being there.</li>

                <b><u>PART TWO:</u></b> I promised some happier stuff in Part 
                One of today's update (written earlier today). Since then, I've 
                managed to get stats for one piece of ice burrower silk armor, 
                and one of the three velium hound recipes. Eventually, more will 
                follow, but these are high-level mobs, and the parts are hard 
                for any of us tradesfolk to come by, since we're generally so 
                busy huddled over our sewing kits as to not be of a high enough 
                level to hunt these beasts for ourselves. ;)</p>
              <p>I also sent in feedback via the new Sony process for their message 
                boards, regarding today's patch message. I'm sure I'm not the 
                only one that caught the newest &quot;oops&quot; with the note 
                about specialized tradeskill containers telling folks to rely 
                on in-game information and NPC text, then the statement that the 
                Velious tailoring now has to use the Coldain Tanners Kit ... but 
                they forgot to add the note about the kit to the proper recipe 
                book (i.e., Velium Leathers) and/or to any NPC that folks have 
                hailed in Thurgadin. It's been submitted, we'll see where it goes 
                from there. In the meantime, I'll continue to keep on verifying 
                recipes, and making sure that functioning ones are listed here, 
                even when that conflicts with information in the books, etc.</p>
              <p>(<font color="#FF0000"><b>Corrected update:</b></font> the crystalline 
                silk still works in the large tailoring kit. Ice burrower silk 
                and all the Velium Leathers are confirmed to need the Coldain 
                Tanners Kit. The Fine Furs have not yet been tested in both kits. 
                Also note that <b>these tanning kits are MISSING on the Zeb server</b>, 
                possibly others. It has been bugged. One of these years someone 
                will remember to bring down Thurgadin on that server and patch 
                it in.)</p>
              <p><b><u>PART ONE:</u></b> The &quot;About&quot; page has been updated 
                at long last. I'm not happy to have to spell things out as bluntly 
                as I did there, and I fear it will give the wrong message to the 
                99.9% of you who are truly emjoying/using this resouce, while 
                the 0.1% of the ingrates that have spurred the change blithely 
                ignore it, and try to hound me until I get fed up enough to throw 
                in the towel and close all this down.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, once we've got some more positive news on tradeskills 
                (such as after I get my hands on the ice burrower silk and velium 
                hound fur that folks in one of the bigger guilds on my server 
                are risking life and limb to obtain for recipe verification and 
                testing), I'll be glad to balance all this depressing stuff with 
                happier celebration. ;)</p>
              <p><b>Time will tell:</b> if the changes to the SONY boards means 
                that they are continuing their recent track record of ignoring 
                anything that is uncomfortable to them, or if it will truly mean 
                that there will be more positive change and improvement on things 
                that are currently broken (and repeatedly reported as bugs) ... 
                if something to bridge the 131 to 230+ tailoring gap will be put 
                in within a few weeks, or take months, if it ever goes in at all 
                ... if the steelsilk recipes (aka Terrorantula silks) that have 
                been in-game for a few weeks will be actually functional, with 
                all parts dropping in reasonable amounts (more than 2 or 3 silks 
                per server per day) on the live servers within a month ... if 
                the sense of &quot;community&quot; that was on the SONY boards 
                has been totally destroyed by the sudden changes on the SONY boards 
                just at a time when a noticeable chunk of the EQ community can't 
                stay connected due to the recent patch or if folks will continue 
                to be forgiving, even though the timing on the board revamp was 
                horrific ... whether recipe books will be updated to be correct 
                any time in our lifetime (this includes not only the Velium Leatherworking 
                book which doesn't make any mention of Coldain Tanner's Kit and 
                never has, but also things like the several baking recipe books 
                that have been incorrect for well over a year) ... whether other 
                tradeskill improvements that were promised and/or hinted at many 
                months ago will be seen any time, *in a fully working order* will 
                be seen any time in the next half a year.</p>
              <p>I won't hold my breath, but life goes on. So do tradeskills. 
                There's always something more that needs verification, more stats 
                that need to be scrounged, etc., etc. You can play a passive part 
                and simply slurp up the wealth of information provided here, or 
                you can dive in, pitch in, and instead of saying &quot;I can't 
                believe she doesn't have <i>X</i> yet, since it's out on the net&quot;, 
                spend the extra few minutes to go out on &quot;the net&quot;, 
                find it, and post it here. </p>
              <p>The message boards are, as expected, seeing a higher load than 
                ever before. A second message board admin has been added, but, 
                as always, this is a labor of love for the folks that help out 
                around here and stomping around finding fault with stuff instead 
                of rolling up your sleeves and helping out is, and always has 
                been, considered bad form on in <i>this</i> community.</p>

                <b>Velious recipes now need the Coldain Tanner's Kit</b>. Imagine 
                that. Almost 4 months AFTER the recipes are put in game, they 
                retroactively &quot;fix&quot; the recipes to not work in a normal 
                sewing kit, wait a day, then announce they were supposed to use 
                a different kit all along, then they bring down Thurgadin on all 
                servers to patch in said Tanner's Kit. Oh, SO sorry for the inconvenience 
                folks, this is what we intended all along, but had to do bass-ackwards 
                &quot;fix&quot; before we bothered telling anyone about the fix, 
                nor before we fixed the recipe books or put the kit in place. 
                That's no way to run a business.</p>
              <p>Before this patch, earlier today, I posted about the Velious 
                tailoring problems, and counseled patience, since I had faith 
                that Verant would find the problem and fix it. Foolish halfling. 
                My rose-colored glasses are now ground into dust, and the only 
                thing I have faith in is that they've finally pushed me over the 
                edge. Even when I've been upset at how things are working, and 
                upset with snerts in-game, I've tried VERY hard to put a positive 
                spin on things and not degenerate into Verant-bashing, but right 
                now I am SO steamed at the folks responsible for this mismanaged 
                &quot;fix&quot; that it isn't funny. It's taken two years, but 
                I've lost my faith in them ... but not in the wonderful folks 
                in this tradeskill community, so I'll keep plugging along, somehow, 
                for your sake.</p>
              <p>That having been said -- loyal visitors to this site and the 
                message boards, please brace yourselves, the worst is to come. 
                Verant's tired of folks getting mad at them when they mess up, 
                have pretty much taken away their message boards, and I expect 
                a large backwash of angry folks here.</p>
              <p>I know we're all going to want to rant and rave here, since they've 
                taken away places where issues can be raised elsewhere. Just remember: 
                This site is not connected to Verant. This site is at best viewed 
                by them as a &quot;fan&quot; site and at worst as a &quot;spoiler&quot; 
                site, and some of them would probably like nothing better than 
                to see it go under. If you use my boards as the dumping ground 
                for everything you're pissed at <i>them</i> about, it just might 
                go under as I hit total burnout and total frustration. Remember: 
                yes, folks here want to know about things that don't work BUT 
                if you're reporting something broken here, you'd better report 
                it to Verant through their lovely new submission process too. 
                Oh, and don't mention you got the recipes from here, else they're 
                likely to ignore you as working from &quot;spoiler&quot; recipes. 
                {rolls eyes}</p>
              <p>I am putting up a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm58">&quot;Primal

                ears and keep on going with your tradeskills are free to do so
