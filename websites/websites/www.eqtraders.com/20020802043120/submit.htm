            <ul>
              <li><b>Trivial listings, new recipes, additions, corrections</b> 
                - please post them to the message boards. This way others can 
                see the information while it's waiting to be added to the web 
                pages, and I don't get email-spammed with several copies of the 
                same information. ;)</li>
              <li><b>Tradeskill guides:</b> Yes, we need them, especially for 
                smithing. However, we're having problems getting a mailbox set 
                up. Please post to the message boards, and the DenMom will get 
                back to you with contact information.</li>
              <li><b>Locations for trade materials in each city and zone:</b> 
                If your favorite merchant is missing from the Trade Supplies list, 
                or they've started offering a trade skill item for sale that's 
                not on the list, please post merchant information to the message 
                boards. Make sure that you a) are looking in the proper zone listing 
                before you say they are missing (for example a merchant in East 
                Commons is listed in the East Commons listing, not in Freeport), 
                b) you mention in the post the zone name, merchant name, location, 
                and item sold. Vague &quot;someone in WK is selling some fishing 
                stuff&quot; means a lot of extra work by others, chasing needles 
                in haystacks. Additionally, we're looking to add locations to 
                vendors on the trade supplies listings, so if you want to adopt 
                a zone and get data on the vendors with no locs, please post your 
                findings to the message boards.</li>
              <li><b>Merchants wanted!</b> You want to make money, I want to help 
                you hook up with players who need your goods. If you've got tradeskill 
                items to sell, or a skill to offer (i.e., wedding services, weapon 
                sharpening, guide services) go to the Marketplace forums on the 
                message boards with your ad. Please be sure to post under the 
                proper server forum and include all important information, specifically 
                what you are offering (i.e., not just "I'm a tailor", but what 
                types of tailored items you can/will make), and your in-game name. 
                And if you wish, include your contact information in the post. 
                Make sure you are NOT selling phat l00t, selling/trading accounts, 
                etc. <i><b>The Marketplace is for tradeskills only, please.</b></i></li>
