<span class="headers">Halas Warrior (Northern Wolf) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>All Molds are NO DROP, tiny, and weight 0.0.  The readied Materials after first combine are also NO DROP. None of the ingredients are NO DROP.  The final combines are no-fail. </p>

<p>Near the starting point in Warrior guild stands a guy called Rollian Galothar, that is our guy! </p>

<p>Hail him:<br> 
Rollian Galothar says "Are you a young warrior here for [training]? If not, I do not have time to chat." </p>

<p>You say, 'What training?' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says "Very good. With my instruction you will craft a set of [armor] that if crafted well, should serve you well for some time to come." </p>

<p>You say, 'What armor?' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "I will give you instructions to make your first set of armor. just keep in mind that I don't tolerate those that are lazy! Once you start something, you should always finish it! With that said, take this Northern Wolves Plate Assembly Kit. You will use it to create the various parts of your armor such as [helm], [bracers], [armplates], [boots], [legplates], [gauntlets], and [breastplate]. when you combine components in your kit, make sure they are un-stacked. Let me know what piece you wish to craft and I will give you instructions." </p>

<p>He gives you a Northern Wolves Plate Assembly Kit. </p>

<p>You say, 'I wish to craft a helm' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "To craft a Helm of Northern Wolf, you will need two Small Pieces of Ore, one Gnoll Pup Scalp, and two Bone Chips. You should be able to find most of the items in Everfrost. The ore is most likely sold here in town. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Helm of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new helm." </p>

<p>He gives you the mold for your helm. <br>
The completed Helm weighs 2.0 stones and has the following stats; AC6 STA1 HP5 </p>

<p>You say, 'I wish to craft a bracer' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "To craft your bracers of Northern Wolf, you will need two Small Pieces of Ore, three Bone Chips, and one Polar Bear Skin. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Bracers of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new bracers." </p>

<p>He gives you the mold for one bracer. <br>
<p>The completed Bracer weighs 1.0 stones and has following stats; AC5 STR1 STA1 HP6 </p>

<p>You say, 'I wish to craft armplates' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "To craft your armplates of Northern Wolf, collect one Small Piece of Ore, two ruined Wolf Pelts, one Bone Chips, and one Patch of Gnoll fur. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Armplates of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new armplates." </p>

<p>He gives you the mold for your armplates. <br>
<p>The completed Armplates weigh 2.0 stones and has the following stats; AC6 STA2 HP5 </p>

<p>You say, 'I wish to craft boots' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "It is always wise to protect one's feet. To craft Boots of Northern Wolf, you must find two Small Pieces of Ore, one Spiderling Legs, and one Polar Bear Skin. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Boots of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new boots." </p>

<p>He gives you the mold for your boots. <br>
The completed Boots weigh 2.0 stones and the stats; AC6 STR1 STA1 HP5 </p>

<p>You say, 'I wish to craft legplates' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "To craft your legplates you must find one Small Piece of Ore, two Ruined Wolf Pelts, one Bone Chip, and one Spiderling Leg. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Legplates of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new legplates." </p>

<p>He gives you the mold for your legplates. <br>
Completed the Legplates weigh 2.0 stones and has; AC7 STR1 STA2 HP10 </p>

<p>You say, 'I wish to craft gauntlets' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "To craft gauntlets of Northern Wolf, you must collect one Small Piece of Ore, four Bone Chips, and one Ruined Wolf Pelt. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Gauntlets of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new gauntlets." </p>

<p>He gives you the mold for your gauntlets. <br>
Your Gauntlets weigh 1.0 stone with following stats; AC6 STA1 HP7 </p>

<p>You say, 'I wish to craft a Breastplate' </p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says, "Probably the most important part of your armor is the Breastplate of the Northern Wolf. It shows your true dedication to our cause. This is perhaps the most difficult part of your armor that you will create. To construct your breastplate, you will need to find three Small Pieces of Ore, two Ruined Wolf Pelts, and one Spider Venom Sac. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Breastplate of the Northern Wolf Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new Breastplate. Once you have completed your breastplate, I have another [task] for you should you feel ready." </p>

<p>He gives you your breastplate mold. <br>
Completed Breastplate weighs 2.0 stones with; AC14 STR1 STA3 HP15.  It is also a light source.</p>

<p>You say, 'what Task?'</p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says ''Part of becoming an effective warrior is overcoming your fears. Travel to Blackburrow and find two Perfect Gnoll Skins and two Giant Snake Rattles. Return them to me and you shall be rewarded for your bravery.''</p>

<p>Rollian Galothar says ''I must say, Lunalee I am impressed. You have passed your training and should now have a full set of armor to begin your adventures. Take this weapon as a symbol of your dedication and hard work. You have earned it. Your training with me has ended. Farewell.''</p>
