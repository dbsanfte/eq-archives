            <p class="headers">Notes on Advanced<a name="Advanced"></a> and Cultural 
              Smithing</p>
            <p><i>~By Niami DenMother, with thanks to all the folks on the message 
              board for sparking this document with their questions and comments</i></p>
            <p><a href="http://gucomics.keenspace.com/d/20010425.html"><img src="../pics/gu_20010425.jpg" width="200" height="300" align="left" border="0"></a>There 
              has been a lot of excitement, and even more confusion, over cultural 
              smithing. Hopefully this guide will help to clarify some of the 
              more commonly asked questions.</p>
            <p><span class="headers">What is cultural smithing?</span> Cultural 
              smithing is race-specific smithing. It must be performed at a specific 
              cultural forge, by a smith of that same race. Enchanters cannot 
              fool cultural forges by using illusion. (<a href="../secrets/recipes_smithing_cultural_main.htm">Cultural 
              smithing recipes can be found here.</a>)</p>
            <p><span class="headers">I heard someone mention dyes</span> - can 
              I dye my banded/cultural/etc. armor? Currently, only fine steel 
              plate armor (shortened to "fine steel" by many) can be dyed. Some 
              of the cultural armors have colors of their own, but this is not 
              done by dyeing process. Dye making for fine steel is a multi-step 
              process that adds significant time and expense to the smithing process. 
              (More <a href="../secrets/recipes_dyes.htm">information on dyes 
              can be found here</a>. Recipes for <a href="../secrets/smithing_armor.htm">fine 
              steel plate can be found here</a>.)</p>
            <p><span class="headers">What about this imbue and enchant thing?</span> 
              Any race that has cultural smithing also have some "normal" cultural 
              recipes, and then either imbued versions of the recipes OR enchanted 
              and enchanted/imbued versions of the recipes.</p>
            <p><b>Imbuing</b> is the process of calling the blessings of a specific 
              god down upon an item, limiting it to use by followers of only that 
              deity. While we originally thought that there would be imbued armor 
              for pretty much every race/deity combination, this is not turning 
              out to be the case. Imbuing is performed by a cleric/shaman/druid 
              on the specific gem for that deity. (See the <a href="../secrets/imbued_gemlist.htm">imbued 
              gems list</a> for information on the gem for each deity.) <font color="#400000"><b>The 
              imbued gem can then be used by a smith of <i>any</i> religious background, 
              provided that the recipe in question accepts that gem as a valid 
              recipe</b></font>. The end result will only be able to be worn by 
              a person who meets the race/class AND deity restrictions of the 
              end result. (Exception to the above info is the Solusek Ro imbue, 
              which is performed by wizards of Solusek Ro.) Races that have non-enchanted 
              imbued items include: barbarians, iksar, ogres and wood elves, plus 
              some Freeport human recipes. These groups have no enchanted versions 
              of their armor/weapons.</p>
            <p><b>Enchanting</b> is the process of granting magical bonuses to 
              an item without deity restrictions. Several races have enchanted 
              versions of their armor and sometimes weapons. These items can often 
              also be imbued, though, again, seem to have some odd limits to what 
              gems will work, leaving many gaps in that race's armor for different 
              valid deities. Each enchanted ore requires a level 49 enchanter 
              to cast the spell as well as a large brick of the proper type of 
              ore. If an enchanted folded sheet is needed, then all three large 
              bricks that go into the making of the block must be enchanted.</p>
