      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was time, and 
        then some, for her vision quest. </font></p>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Full daylight greeted 
        her as she settled herself crosslegged on the windy peak. Many of her 
        fellow shamen had said that vision quests such as the one she was about 
        to perform could only be properly performed in their frozen Northern homeland. 
        She knew better. Her heart, and more importantly, the spirits, had told 
        her that these windy peaks, birthplace to the fierce hill giants, was 
        the best place for her particular quest. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Resolutely, she 
        readied mind and body to pray, to sing, to dance ... to cry. The last 
        would be the hardest. She'd cried once since she left home as a young 
        girl, and it was quite telling that it had been when she aided in her 
        first hill giant kill. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> For a moment, her 
        mind floundered, trying to dredge up other times that she had cried. Surely 
        she had let herself grieve at the many sorrows that had been heaped upon 
        her; at the loss of Kavan, the loss of most of her clan, the bitter heartache 
        of being alone at night because it was better to be alone than to be vulnerable. 
        </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> There had been once, 
        but she discounted it immediately, as they'd been tears of rage, not pain. 
        The time an elderly gnome had prevented her from suiciding against a hill 
        giant when she learned of Kavan's death ... when she was young and foolish. 
        </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Now she was older, 
        but still foolish. All this time had passed, more than half her lifetime, 
        and she'd never let anyone truly inside her self-made walls. Hugs, kisses 
        on the cheek, and harmless flirtations had been all she'd allowed others 
        ... and herself. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Her reverie was 
        broken as she watched a cloud drift across a nearby mountaintop, seeming 
        to brush a gentle kiss atop the craggy peak's "head" before drifting on 
        it's way. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Shavanna's thoughts 
        crystallized with painful clarity. She was that cloud - drifting here, 
        flirting there, teasingly touching down before dancing off once again.

        The dry mental voice in her head belonged to her first teacher. A teacher 
        that had been dead a century before Shavanna was born. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> So. It had begun. 
        Shavanna let her mind slip deeper into a trance-state, to remember ... 
        to learn ... to hopefully heal. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> She had started 
        the flirtatious dance as a way to prove a point, but long after tragedy 
        had struck, and that point had pierced her heart, it was a defensive maneuver. 
        If she didn't open herself up, she couldn't be hurt, or so she'd thought. 
        So, she danced from person to person, always keeping things light and 
        flirtatious. Always making it a game. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Nobody tried to 
        bridge that distance she kept anymore, except perhaps Unkle, on rare occasions,

        that had been bottled up for so long? </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> She hadn't, hadn't 
        allowed herself to -- until in one piercing moment, all her carefully

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shavanna had been 
        a precocious young child, ever-curious and outgoing. From the moment she'd 
        been able to walk, the adults had started chuckling at her "making up" 
        dances. When she began to talk, and said the spirits taught her to dance, 
        the small clan's only shaman, a dried up old fellow who was jealous of 
        his power, had scoffed and called it the overeager imagination of a child. 
        </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Her parents had 
        been mortified about "bothering" the shaman with their precocious child, 
        punished the child, and instructed her to never speak of it again. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> But the spirits 
        <i> had</i> been teaching the child dances. Dances of long-dead clans, 
        of lost races, of the various people's of the world of Norrath. Through 
        dance comes learning, and understanding, or so they told the precocious 
        lass, though it would be a while before she knew what they meant. It was 
        enough that they taught her, and didn't think her a liar, like her clan 
        did. (Well, her half-brother believed her when he was old enough to know 
        what she was talking about, but that's what little brothers were for. 
        Besides, she told him she'd beat him up if he ever said anything about 
        it, so of course he was going to nod and agree!) </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When she was 6 summers 
        old, the small clan, grown smaller due to the harsh northern climes, merged 
        with another small clan that had been virtually wiped out by orc raids. 
        </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> A younger shaman, 
        Garinthwen, was part of this new clan, and he stepped up to take the place 
        as the tribe's shaman as the old shaman became too aged to impart his 
        duties. Having heard rumors of Shavanna's claims, and having seen her 
        dance, vainly did Garin try to talk with the young child, but she'd learned 
        her lesson too well, and told him as pertly as a 6-year-old could, that 
        she'd outgrown such childish fantasies. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Only with her new 
        friend and now-clanmate, Kavanaladran, did she confide the truth. The 
        10-year-old son of Garin had also seen her dancing, and tried to tease 
        her about it. In return, she launched into one of the more spectacular 
        ogre war-dances ever created, quite boggling the young lad. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Standing slightly 
        bow-legged, her entire stance making her seem somehow much larger and 
        bulkier than a barbarian child of 6, she swung one arm, then the other, 
        ponderously in front of her, then she waggled her hips twice, then shimmied 
        her upper torso, and bumped hips with an imaginary being next to her. 
        <i>(It should be noted that during the current-time, the ample Shavanna 
        gets a much different boggled reaction from all that shimmying and swaying 
        than either an ogre, or a child of 6, elicits.)</i> As she started these 
        opening moves, she chanted: "Swing, swing, wiggle, wiggle, jiggle, bump! 
        Ogres barsh an' ogres thump, slice yur arm an' maek a stump!" With these 
        and similar chants and moves, she dazzled the bloodthirsty young lad into 
        temporary silence. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> When she was done, 
        Kavan begged to learn more "warrior dances" from her. The budding warrior-to-be 
        and the young spiritdancer were fast friends ... once they got done calling 
        each other childish names and such. </font>

      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> A second time the

        her ninth summer, the time was fast drawing near for her to be apprenticed 
        to a trade. While the way of the shaman appealed to her, she still feared 
        it, feared the derision when once again she'd have to claim to learn from 
        the spirits ... and be scolded and punished. She'd run away before she'd 
        let that happen again </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Before the day of 
        decision could come, however, an event happened that would make the decision 
        for her. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The clan had come 
        across the summer hunting camp of a neighboring clan, and found it freshly 
        demolished by a bandit attack. Bodies lay strewn everywhere, and anything 
        that could not be carried off had been destroyed. The only survivor had 
        been a badly-wounded elderly woman who had been left for dead. From the 
        look on Garin's face, death would only be a matter of time ... and not 
        much of it at that. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The dying request 
        of the old crone, as she lay balanced between the land of the living and 
        the land of the spirits, was to see, one more time, her tribe's farewell 
        dance, the dance that was meant to escort a spirit from one land into 
        the next. The dead of her tribe called out to her from across the veil, 
        clamoring for it. Garin had not the heart to tell the woman that there 
        was none of her clan left alive to teach them the dance, but told her 
        he would find a way, using his magics to strengthen her spirit's hold 
        on life just a bit longer. Finally, he had a way to catch his elusive 
        prey ... his desired student. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Quickly, Garin summoned 
        Shavanna from her gathering duties, fixing her with a stern gaze that 
        had made folks stronger than a 9-year-old girl quail in their boots. </font>
      <p> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"We are under death-oath 
        to the last survivor of the Stormfollower clan. I need you to perform 
        their Farewell Dance for those that died ... and the one that is dying." 
        </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Shavanna's eyes 
        widened in surprise, then went momentarily unfocused as she sought her 
        memories, and her teachers, for the proper dance. So distracted was she, 
        that she did not see the small smile of triumph flit across Garin's face 
        as his suspicions were confirmed. When Shavanna nodded her head in agreement 
        with a mumured "Yes, sir" he allowed himself a small nod in return. The 
        lass had been well-trained that the shaman's word was law.</font>
      <p> 
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"You have a half-candlemark 
        to prepare. The old widow will not last much longer than that." </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Shavanna's feet 
        flew as if granted the fleetness of a wolf pack as she ran for her family's 
        hunting tent, and rummaged for a clean tunic. All the while, the spirits 
        were there, in her head, teaching her what she needed to know.</font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Within the alloted 
        half-candlemark, she was at Garin's tent, freshly scrubbed and garbed. 
        Only the voices in her head kept her from panicking, granting her needed 
        serenity. Perhaps it was the spirits that clouded her eyes, so she would 
        not notice the slow gathering of her clan around the tent. Mayhaps it 
        was the spirits that allowed her to see only the old woman, eyes clouded 
        with pain, lying on a pile of furs on the ground, watching, waiting. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Shavanna bowed deeply 
        and reverently to the old woman, and then launched herself into dance, 
        a low keening drone coming from her throat. Somewhere in the background, 
        she could hear a drum pick up the beat that she was stamping with her 
        foot, and then a gourd rattle started in as well. She let those things 
        slip from her conscious mind, recognizing only the rightness of it before 
        focusing on the dance, whirling, twirling, stamping, swaying. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Garin stood to one 
        side, watching and nodding to himself. He had been right. She did have 
        some link to the spirits, and he was determined to demand her as his apprentice. 
        He barely controlled a gasp, howevever, as his spirit sight let him see 
        more. Quickly, the shaman cast a spell to allow those gathered to see 
        what he could see, starting first with her friend Kavan, then with Shavanna's 
        parents, then with the other clanmates. Let them see for themselves what 
        this young lass that they had scorned was doing. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Gasps followed his 
        spell, although the young Shavanna was unaware of them.As the dance progressed, 
        the clearing around her and the old woman had been filling with the spirits 
        of the Stormfollower clan, and they had been joining the young girl in 
        the dance. Only long practice had allowed Niall, the drummer, and Ruadh, 
        who'd been shaking the gourd, to continue with the beat as they and the 
        others saw the clearing with new sight. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Shavanna danced 
        on, heedless, swaying in front of first one spirit, then another, bidding 
        them a proper farewell. As the dance drew to a close, the spirit of an 
        elderly man reached out to the old woman dying on the ground, and beckoned 
        her to join him. Tears coursed down Shavanna's young cheeks at sight of 
        the embracing spirits as they turned to give her a salute ... and disappeared.

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The clearing was 
        once again empty, but for a winded young girl-child, and the corpse of

        Shavanna, she was long-gone, leaving behind a mute message in front of 
        Kavan and Gavin's hut. There, lying in the dirt, was a necklace that had 
        been given to her as a sign of her apprenticeship, and a silver friendship 
        ring given to her by Kavan. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Shavanna fled for 
        many long days, bypassing the human lands, laying several false trails, 
        before stopping to rest in the small, misty thicket that the halflings 
        called home. Little would she know that one of those false trails would 
        cause such disaster. </font>

        to a close, Shavanna was more certain now that she'd seen Kavan's spirit 
        out of the corner of her senses as she'd danced. Poor Kavan. Too late 
        had she learned that he'd <b><i>not</i></b> been dallying with the warrior 
        lass, despite her attempts to the contrary. Too late had she learned the 
        true depths of his feelings, through the journal that had been found on 
        his corpse. </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Again, the spirits

      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> With tears streaming 
        down her face, Shavanna reached for the ghostly hands that reached for 
        her, and started a dance created by the spirits ... just for them. It 
        was part recognition of a life-bond gone awry, part absolution, part farewell, 
        part promise for the future ... and totally theirs. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> ~~~~~ </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Determined to try 
        to appear that she wasn't bothered by Kavan's popularity with the women, 
        the young Shavanna had begun flirting with every male she saw, from the 
        local halflings, to the visting folk that passed through the sleepy thicket 
        from all over the lands. It became a challenge to prove that she wasn't 
        a "child", but a young woman fully capable of attracting a male. Not that 
        she did anything with them once she attracted them, but they didn't seem 
        to mind the flirting games she played. </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And so the months 
        passed, as her wounded young pride and blossoming hormones were soothed 
        by the admiration of the males around her. The longer she was away, the 
        harder it was for her to return home, to swallow shame, and to apologize 
        to folks for her stubborn, childish pride. Finally, she steeled her resolve 
        to go home, only to be stopped by an unexpected spirit trainer ... Gavin. 
        </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Gavin as a spirit 
        trainer? But that meant he was ... dead?! Shavanna's mind reeled in numb 
        horror, even as her spirit clamored a multitude of frantic apologies and 
        questions. There had been an ice giant rampage on her clan's winter camp, 
        and with both the clan's only other healer-shaman <i>(her)</i> and one 
        of their better young warriors <i>(Kavan)</i>, gone, the clan's battle 
        with the giant had ended in tragedy. </font> 
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Shame and despair 
        had flooded through the young shamaness, to be replaced by cold horror. 
        Kavan gone? Solemnly, Gavin's spirit had told her the grim news. Kavan 
        had stayed in camp only long enough to collect his own gear, and then 
        had followed after Shavanna. His remains had been found the following 
        month, killed by hill giants ... after following one of Shavanna's false 
        trails. </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> She'd forcibly broken 
        the connection with Gavin's spirit then, and ran, shame and fury lending 
        her legs once again the fleetness of wolves. Hardly resting at all, she 
        ran until she could run no more, then walked, then shambled, until she 
        reached a known lair of the dreaded hill giants. Clenching a puny staff 
        that she'd made from a tree branch, she launched herself full tilt at 
        the first hill giant she saw, screaming curses at the top of her lungs. 
        She should have died. The wizard should not have interfered. But she didn't, 
        and he did ... and he convinced her to live long enough to properly take 
        on the hill giants and get her revenge. (See bio for the wizard's side 
        of the story) </font>
      <p> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> From that point 
        until now, she'd used the flirting aloofness as a way to actually keep 
        folks from getting too close. Biding her time until she could have her 
        revenge. </font>
