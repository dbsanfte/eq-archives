<p>
<p>
This is one of several armor quests for younglings that was recently added. This one is for evil Freeport human clerics, and is HUM/CLR, Innoruuk, no drop and lore (other than bracer). <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>

Do you plan to construct a [dismal priest helm], a [dismal priest bracer], [dismal priest gauntlets], [dismal priest boots], [dismal priest vambraces], [dismal priest greaves], or a [dismal priest breastplate].'

A cleric of the Sentries of Passion, Ulia Yovar, has been attempting to uncover our allies among the citizens of Freeport and is believed to be in hiding in the sewer tunnels under the western quarter of Freeport. Seek this enemy of the Dismal Rage and bring me her head.'

She will put the finishing touches on your new weapon.'
