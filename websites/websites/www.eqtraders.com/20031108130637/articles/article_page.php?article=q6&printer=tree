<span class="headers">Surefall Druid (Pine Druid) Armor</span>
<p>
<p><i>This is one of several new youngling armor quests appearing throughout the
lands. This quest, which originates in Surefall Glade, results in DRU only armor
and a DRU only weapon. All pieces of this set should be lore (other than the
bracer) and no drop. While stats for these pieces were not provided, it is
reported that it has a green leather graphic when worn.</i></p>
<p>Salmekia is standing right next to Te'Anara (right in front of you when you
port in to Surefall). I am not a human druid, but she still gave me the quest,
though I doubt I'll be able to use the rewards...</p>

<br>
You say, 'Hail, Salmekia Treherth'<br>
Salmekia Treherth says 'Welcome to Surefall Glade Tyrsa, the home of the
Jaggedpine Treefolk. I help teach young druids the ways of our people. We have
worshipers of both Karana, the Storm Lord, and Tunare, the All Mother, living
here in the glade. If you are a new druid I will help you obtain a [suit of
clothing] that will offer comfort and protection while working in the wilds and
help protect you from the weapons of the Gnolls that wish to take these lands.'<br>
</p>
<p>You say, 'what suit of clothing?'<br>
Salmekia Treherth says 'You must use this specially prepared Curing Kit to craft
the clothing. Each article of clothing requires different materials for its
construction. Do you plan on crafting Pine Druid [Gloves], Pine Druid [Boots], a
Pine Druid [Bracer], a Pine Druid [Cap], Pine Druid [Leggings], Pine Druid
[Sleeves], or a Pine Druid [Tunic]? When you have been outfitted and are ready I
will tell you of a [task] that you can assist with.'<br>
</p>
<p>You say, 'what gloves?'<br>
Salmekia Treherth says 'To craft Pine Druid Gloves you require two [silk
thread], ruined gnoll leather gloves, two giant field rat whiskers, and a large
king snake skin. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your
Curing Kit with this Tattered Glove Pattern.'<br>

</blockquote>
<p>You say, 'what task?'<br>
Salmekia Treherth says 'We druids seek to live in harmony with nature, taking
only what we need from the land and the creatures that inhabit it. Although the
City of Qeynos is a noble place, there are people in the city that do not share
our reverence for nature and poach the animals of the Karanas needlessly. Even
worse than these poachers, whom the rangers of the Jaggedpine Treefolk
constantly seek to deter, are the despicable worshipers of Bertoxxulous that
hide in the sewers and catacombs of Qeynos. These wicked individuals are known
as the [Bloodsabers].'<br>
</p>
<p>You say, 'what Bloodsabers?'<br>
Salmekia Treherth says 'The Bloodsabers are responsible for a number of
atrocities including the spreading of the diseases which have been inflicting
the wolves and bears of the Qeynos Hills and the recent poisoning of the farmers
fields in the Plains of Karana. Recently we have discovered that a Bloodsaber
defiler has been attempting to poison the waters of Surefall Glade. Find this
individual and deal with him accordingly, I doubt that this individual will
surrender willingly. If need be eliminate them and bring me their head.'</p>
<p>The mob is called "a Bloodsaber defiler" and is behind the
waterfall in Surefall. Turning in her head gets you:</p>
<p>Salmekia Treherth says 'It is a shame that some people decide to throw away
their humanity with the worship of evil deities. Your actions have saved the
lives of many creatures that rely on the waters of this glade. Take this Rusty
Pine Druid Scimitar and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may
take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is
done return to me with the Sharpened Pine Druid Scimitar, a Gnoll Fang, and a
Large King Snake Skin.'<br>

Animals, and Guards of Qeynos; negative faction with Unkempt Druids; a small
