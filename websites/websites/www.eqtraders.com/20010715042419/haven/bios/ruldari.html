<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Face it, no 
  matter how you sugar-coat the truth, one fact remains. I am a bastard half-elf 
  with no kin in the lands willing to claim me. Mayhaps it is this that makes 
  me cautious of others. Mayhaps this is what spurs me to prefer the outdoors 
  to the city. Or, mayhaps it was that fateful day in Blackburrow ... </font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mother was a brewer. Unfortunately, 
  she oft sampled a bit too much of her own brew. Whenever she got into one of 
  those "sampling sessions", she'd go into maundering tales about the handsome 
  human she'd tried to trap into marriage. When she was sober, she'd tell me nothing, 
  but slowly I pieced together some of it. From comments such as "flying feet" 
  and "hands of an artisan", I'd determined that he was a monk, and a potter of 
  some skill. Apparently he hadn't wanted her ... hadn't wanted me. To be fair, 
  I don't know if he ever knew about me. It does not matter anymore. There is 
  no way I can find him from this single piece of pottery that my mother always 
  kept hidden away. I will never know if she kept it hidden from me, or from herself, 
  in fear of what she would do in a drunken rage. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One day mother heard rumors 
  of a new brewing recipe in Halas. Nothing was going to stop her from getting 
  that new recipe, not even the fact that she had a young child to drag with her 
  on such an unsafe journey. I balked only momentarily out of panic, until her 
  hand connected with the side of my head hard enough to make me see stars. Knowing 
  more blows would come if I didn't behave, I resigned myself to the journey. 
  Off we went from Qeynos, my short child's legs valiantly trying to keep up with 
  her adult strides. I always desperately wanted to please her, so I didn't dare 
  complain again of my exhaustion, much less my fear. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We had to pass through 
  the chaos that is Blackburrow on our trek, and there I was lost. A mob of gnolls 
  separated me from my drunken mother. I ran and hid from them behind a rock, 
  biting my lower lip until it bled to keep from crying out. Finally, the gnolls 
  were slain by others, and I made my cautious way out of my hiding place. I looked 
  everywhere, dodging gnolls, hiding when necessary. My mother was nowhere to 
  be found. Hours passed as I looked for some trail, some sign of my mother. I 
  begged total strangers to help me. None heeded me, although some barbarian shaman 
  who was hard-pressed in a fight somehow managed to throw a protection spell 
  on me before being swept away by battle. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finally, exhausted, I found 
  a hollow tree and slept inside it. In the morning, I started the search again, 
  tired, scared, and very hungry. I know not how, call it instinct, call it an 
  innate tracking skill, but I thought I sensed my mother deep in the caves of 
  Blackburrow. Quickly, I hurried on, finding faint tell-tales here and there 
  that spurred me ever deeper. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I stopped dead in my tracks 
  at the dreaded snake pit. There was my mother. Dead from numerous snake bites. 
  </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After several long minutes 
  of frozen shock, I clambered down into the pit, sobbing. Mother smelled even 
  moreso of alcohol than usual, and instead of a weapon in her hand, she clutched 
  a crumpled piece of paper. The cursed recipe. Had she been trying to kill the 
  snakes with paper cuts? The irreverent thought was gone as quickly as it came. 
  My mother died looking for me. How could I live with the guilt? </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Such a grief-stricken, 
  guilt-ridden child I was. I probably would have died right then and there if 
  not for "Unkle" Mortekai. With many soothing words, the kind shaman escorted 
  her from that foul place, seeing that I was fed and cared for. Knowing I was 
  poorly suited for life in his northern homelands, he found a couple in Qeynos 
  who were willing to care for a young orphan, and promised to visit often. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I was not an easy child 
  to care for, either. I became quiet and withdrawn, never voicing the belief 
  of my part in my mother's death, but letting it fester instead. I spent many 
  long days in the wilds, learning how to track even the faintest trail, vowing 
  I would never lose a loved one like that again. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was only years later, 
  when I reached my teenage years, that I realized the significance of that piece 
  of paper my mother had been clutching. She hadn't been looking for me. She had 
  lost me and continued on her way to Halas to acquire the recipe. Then she had 
  sampled the result and fallen, drunk, into the snake pit, to be bitten to death. 
  </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finally, I can see clearly. 
  My real mother never truly cared for me, only for her drink. My true father 
  may never be found, and if he does, he may never care for me. The Spiritwalkers, 
  however, led by Unkle, seem to have genuine concern for me. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">They are all the family 
  I need.</font>
