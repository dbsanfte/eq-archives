<P>
<P>
Day 1: Games fly off the shelves, 150,000 people attempt to logon at once.<BR>
Login server, rather than crashing, makes users wait in logon queue so they<BR>
don't have to update their network outage page. Also, special "Fiery<BR>
Avenger" Lightsaber quest advertised.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
Day 2: Total chaos as fledgling Wookies make up 45% of the universe<BR>
population. Forest world dwellers of Kashyyk have lifespan of .02 seconds.<BR>
Most popular trade skill: making laser crossbows and bandoliers. Most<BR>
commonly used emote: /growl
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
Day 3: Jedi discover first spell bug: Jedi mind trick erases mob's hate<BR>
list, enabling them to KS from anyone. <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 5: Complaints of Yavin, Hoth, Dagobah zones not appearing in game as<BR>
promised. Management states Dagobah never promised, Yavin and Hoth will<BR>
appear "later".<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 9: Management explains that it's necessary to allow Star Destroyers to<BR>
fire through planets in order to keep players from exploiting the<BR>
programmer's laziness of not providing proper pathing for their mobs. <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 10: First player kick/banned for ticking off a GM.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 19: Management denies any bugs in game, yet takes servers off-line for<BR>
a 4-hour scheduled maintenance period. 16 hours later, servers re-start.<BR>
Message of the day = <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 19.00001: 2.9 million posts appear on alt.games.starwarseq protesting<BR>
the nerfing of Wookie beserk, Jedi mind trick, and Droid Lightsaber Toss<BR>
abilities. <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 50: Complaints of not being able to find the start of the "Fiery<BR>
Avenger" Lightsaber Quest met with puzzlement by management, who claims<BR>
it's in there someplace.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 75: First report of Death Star being killed on a server.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 76: Secret buffing of Death Star during 3-hour I mean 14-hour scheduled<BR>
server downtime.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 95: First player kick/banned for training Super Star Destroyers to Ord<BR>
Mantel to keep high-level players from killing the Interdictors guarding<BR>
the Imperial newbie areas.<BR>

&nbsp;
<P>
Day 103-119: Plane of the Dark Side opens and closes, sometimes 3x a day.<BR>
Total chaos but great loot if you can get in. Level 1 Sith Lords map the<BR>
Plane.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 120: Death Star and 2nd Death Star killed on every server daily. <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 121: Death Star and 2nd Death Star buffed to 250% during server<BR>
downtime.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 121.00001: 35 50th level players lose their level on Death Star and 2nd<BR>
Death Star kill attempts.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 128: Hoth zone populated at last. 200 Level 20-50 characters arrive and<BR>

&nbsp;
<P>
Day 139: Millenium Falcon spawn campers warned "No more 'Princess Leia<BR>
Earmuff' drop after tomorrow. "Leia 'Muffs" Ebay auction bids jump 10-fold.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 140: Yavin zone populated. Millenium Falcon spawn moved to Yavin, rate<BR>
set to Ultra-Rare, appears once every server reboot. <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
Day 175: Jedi Knight armor quest implemented. Quest items too difficult to<BR>
obtain, Jedi stuck running around in old bathrobes unless they want to wear<BR>
encumbering Stormtrooper Armor (-5 AGI, AC 1 more per piece than Bathrobe).
<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
