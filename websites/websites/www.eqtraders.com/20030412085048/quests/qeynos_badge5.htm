            <p>This is a continuation of the progressive Qeynos Badge of Honor 
              quest. While the first four steps in this quest do not require tradeskills, 
              this fifth step requires baking. You need at least amiable faction 
              to Jaggedpine to get the full quest. You also need to have done 
              the first four steps in the quest. (Details regarding the first 
              four quests can be found on Allakhazam's: <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1271">Badge

            </p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Sergeant Caelin' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Caelin says 'Hail, ______. You have nothing to fear 
                from the gnolls. My men and I have been sent from Qeynos to help 
                defend Fort Jaggedpine should those worthless curs make the mistake 
                of assuming this will be a place of easy plunder. I've fought 
                and slain scores of gnolls in my time. Were I not bound to my 
                post here I would go forth and drive them from their dark cave 
                to the north myself. However, I can offer you a [bounty], should 
                you choose to take such a mission upon yourself.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'what bounty' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Caelin says 'If you choose to go and fight against the 
                gnolls, I shall offer a bounty for every gnoll canine that you 
                return to me. You look a bit more adventurous then many of those 
                that live in this settlement. They seem a bit [docile].' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'who is docile' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Caelin says 'Perhaps it comes from living in harmony 
                with nature for an extended period of time but they are more concerned 
                with trading food recipes and doing arts and crafts. I have offered 
                to give them some basic training in the arts of war but they seem 
                to have no interest. This is a dangerous world in which we live 
                and failure to acknowledge that has meant the downfall of many 
                a society. I won't let this happen on my watch, provided my [men] 
                are on their toes.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'What men' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Caelin says 'Guard Bossamir is a model soldier and a 
                good man. I'm happy to have him watching my back. That Finewine 
                character however, he is not worth the cost of the sword he wields! 
                All he does is whine and complain. He was born with a silver spoon 
                in his mouth and his family enrolled him in the guard to teach 
                him some discipline but I've had no luck with him. He hasn't even 
                turned in a [shift report] for weeks. Captain Tillin will bust 
                me down to private if I don't deliver those soon.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Unless you are amiable to Sergeant Caelin, you will not be able 
              to progress further, as he will state: &quot;You have not proved 
              yourself worthy to our cause. It is recommended that you kill gnolls 
              and turn in gnoll fangs to increase your faction.</p>
            <p>You say, 'what shift report' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Caelin says 'You have been helpful in our defense efforts. 
                However, I can not be too careful about whom I trust with carrying 
                this information. If you truly consider yourself an ally to Qeynos 
                then no doubt you have assisted the city in its defense before. 
                Show me your Qeynos Badge of Honor and I'll know I can trust you 
                fully. I'll place my mark upon it should anyone question your 
                authority to do this service for me.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hand him your Qeynos badge of Honor and you will receive &quot;Marked 
              Qeynos Badge of Honor&quot; in return along with &quot;A warning 
              note/report&quot; to give to Guard Finewine. <em>(Hail text not 
              available at this time.)</em></p>
            <p>Guard Finewine is nearby, standing at the back entrance to the 
              next house.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Guard Finewine' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Guard Finewine says 'Yeah. Hi. Lovely place this. Humid, dark, 
                wild animals all over the place, man eating plants, snakes and 
                bugs finding their way into my armor and biting me where a man 
                ought not be bit. And if [Bossamir] is right, we're soon to be 
                cut down by ravaging gnolls. Why-oh-why did I get assigned to 
                this job? Why wasn't I assigned to Qeynos where a man can get 
                a decent meal and sleep in a nice bed at night? Oh I'm sorry. 
                Did I say that out loud?' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'What Bossamir' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Guard Finewine says 'Hmm. . . Yeah, I have this tendency to prattle 
                on when I'm completely miserable. According to what my colleague 
                Bossamir has heard, these gnolls may be tougher then we thought. 
                But that would be par for the course anyway with the way my pitiful 
                life is going. Woe is me. The people in this backward settlement 
                hate me, Sergeant Caelin hates me and I assume Kane hates me too 
                because he sent me to the armpit of Antonica on a suicide mission.' 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Give him the Warning letter.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Guard Finewine says 'So he wants to send me to jail simply because 
                I'm not filling out some silly reports? How can I be expected 
                to think in such a decrepit state? Maybe you could help me. If 
                I had a meal worthy of someone of my breeding then maybe I could 
                think. Bring me something elegant, I don't want anything dull 
                and pedestrian. I don't know what I want though. Do you have any 
                suggestions?' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Feed him either Dryad Pate or Potemied Pate. Dryad pate is made 
              by combining dryad parts, plant shoots (foraged in Jaggedpine), 
              spices and brandy in a spit or oven. Baking trivial is 191. (Replace 
              the dryad parts with potemied parts to make the potemied pate.)</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Guard Finewine says 'Hmm. . . This is interesting. . . The taste 
                is very refined but sort of. . . odd. . . We're almost there but 
                I don't think you have the recipe quite right. Rather then that 
                peasant Brandy, use this in your recipe instead. And rather then 
                whatever other 'meat' you were using before use a Panther Liver. 
                You do seem to have some skill as a chef, mayhaps you could work 
                for me some day. Prepare some Panther Pate for me. Give me the 
                Panther Pate and let me read that warning again.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He then gives you back the Warning letter (No Drop, Lore) and Finewine 
              Family Brandy (No Drop Lore)</p>
            <p>Now you must make him panther pate. We suspect that this is a no-fail 
              combine, but it has not yet been confirmed. We do know, however, 
              that it is definitely trivial below 114. You must take a no drop 
              panther liver (dropped only off the Jaggedpine &quot;a black panther&quot;), 
              the finewine family brandy, plant shoots (foraged in Jaggedpine), 
              and spices. Combine in a spit or oven.</p>
            <p>Hand him back the warning letter, as well as the panther pate.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Guard Finewine says 'Ah yes, this is perfect! I feel my head 
                clearing already. Wait, is that the sun poking through the trees 
                there or the moon? Hard to tell in this hideous jungle. . . Oh 
                wait yes. My shift reports for the last few weeks. Why don't you 
                go ahead and turn these into Sergeant Caelin for me. I'm going 
                to enjoy this fine pate.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will hand you Compiled Shift Reports (No Drop, Lore), which 
              you then give to Sergeant Caelin.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Caelin says 'Oh praise Karana, how did you manage to 
                get these out of him? Never mind, I don't really care. Here, take 
                this Compiled Report to Captain Tillin in Qeynos at once.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will hand you a book of reports. Run to South Qeynos and give 
              Captain Tillin the Book. The captain will give you some Captain's 
              Orders <em>(hail text not available)</em>. Return to Sergeant Caelin 
              and give him Captain's Orders <em>(hail text not available)</em>. 
              You will receive a &quot;Writ of Execution&quot; and &quot;a Black 
              Sachel&quot; both No drop, Lore. </p>
            <p>Now you need to Kill Barduck Darkpaw(*) in the JaggedPine Gnoll 
              caves just north east of the Town. He has 15k-ish HP and can be 
              slowed. He hits hard and fast so DO slow him if able. Loot his head 
              and combine with the Writ to make a Sealed Black Satchel.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Give &quot;a Sealed Black Satchel&quot; to Sergeant Caelin along 
              with your Marked Qeynos Badge of Honor. </p>
            <p>Receive &quot;Qeynos Badge of Nobility&quot; </p>
            <p>(*) <strong>Note</strong>: Killing Barduck Darkpaw starts the Gnoll 
              War. The Gnoll War is where a series of gnolls start to invade the 
              town through 3 waves of ten to eighteen level 42-45 MoB's. Partaking 
              in the Gnoll war does not effect you getting the badge whatsoever, 
              but you might have to wait until the Sergeant respawns to turn everything 
              in if you lose the war. Turn in the combined box before hand to 
              avoid this problem.
