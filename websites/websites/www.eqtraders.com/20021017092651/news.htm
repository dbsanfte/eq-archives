                  at the moon and hit the ENTER key ... wait, sorry, that last 
                  bit is the Bristlebane in me. Try the non-targeted talk and 
                  the inventory closed if you're having problems with an NPC,

                  we're working on collecting all the information needed to have 
                  a comprehensive tradeskill database that will allow cross-referencing 
                  of trade supplies, sources (vendors, mob drops, etc.) and recipes. 
                  It's a huge undertaking, and it's going to take a lot of time 
                  to get it ready for public viewing. If you see requests in one 
                  of the forums asking for help collecting data, that's why, and 
                  the information we need the most is on the exotic stuff - tradeskill 
                  drops off mobs, player-made cultural items that are then used 
                  as ingredients for other recipes (i.e., adamantite chain jointing, 
                  and other such things) and so on. So, as you're tradeskilling 
                  and shopping, the data that you get from a right-click is likely 
                  exactly what we're looking for. Keep an eye on the various forums 
                  for a request for your tradeskill(s). Meanwhile, this half-blind 
                  hobbit is toddling off tomorrow for lasik eye surgery,and is 
                  supposed to be MIA from the boards and other eye-strain until 
                  sometime Wednesday (patch day). Wish me luck!</font></p>

                  several things to highlight today:</font></p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The new 
                    smithing recipes and trivials are slowly trickling in, and 
                    I have some requests to make, based on the first day's worth 
                    of data. Please be sure that when you're reporting on stats 
                    for new items, that you're including race/class/weight information. 
                    I know it takes a few extra moments to scribble it all down, 
                    but it really makes a difference on the completeness of information 
                    for the site. Please make sure you're clearly stating trivials 
                    - there's a difference between &quot;trivial 222&quot; and 
                    &quot;trivial &lt;=222&quot;. Make sure you're being fully 
                    clear if you know the <i>exact</i> trivial vs. it being trivial 
                    at that point or some point below. Please be sure that when 
                    you're reporting new trivials on old cultural items that you 
                    are explicitly stating whether you're working in racial chain 
                    or plate for things like dark elven and high elven armors. 
                    It may seem like a little thing, but when we're already dealing 
                    with normal, enchanted, and imbued/enchanted armor, I refuse 
                    to &quot;assume&quot; that I know which set you're talking

                    having been said, there is a lot of data already on the appropriate

                    include two trivial colums (old &amp; new), then I have not 
                    yet processed any new information for that specific group 
                    of items. This may mean that nobody has submitted any new 
                    information, or it may just mean that I've not reached that

                    likely to change until new trivials are more fully nailed 
                    down and folks start submitting new guides based on that information.</font></p>

                    of the new cultural items that were added on May 5 have had 
                    stats changed based on yesterday's patch. Wood elves, especially, 
                    please check all those lovely tailored armors of yours, and

                    banning. We also ask, rather clearly, that you &quot;keep 
                    it clean&quot;. Unmasked swearing in subject lines, as well 
                    as swearing (however masked) <i>at specific people</i> are 
                    also not acceptable. For those that are unaware of the history 
                    of that forum, it was originally meant as a spot where people 
                    could rant and rave out their tradeskill frustrations after 
                    a horrible run of luck, etc., while still keeping it within 
                    the realms of polite public behavior. While we've allowed 
                    some leeway on what's allowed in there, it is still not a 
                    place to come in and spew filth. There are plenty of other 
                    message boards in the world where you can spew that trash 
                    if you <i>really</i> need to, but we don't need it in our 
                    community.</font></p>

                    found themselves in the doghouse. The posting and conduct

                <p>The following is <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1638.topic" target="_new">a 
                  post</a> from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers for EQ: 
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>If you are not a Druid and you've completed <a href="quests/potc_intro.htm">the 
                    PoTC quest</a>, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove 
                    - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able 
                    to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.</p>
                  <p>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and 
                    lost an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game 
                    and a GM will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed 
                    to make another earring after verifying your loss.</p>
                  <p>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with 
                    Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one 
                    that has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are 
                    retroactively changed, it sometimes causes the &quot;out of 
                    charges&quot; bug. </p>
                  <p>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's 
                    Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. 
                    Give her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a 
                    fully charged Xanthe's earring back.</p>
                  <p>Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you, this should 
                    solve any difficulties anyone's had with the earring.</p>
                  <p>Thanks,</p>

                  everywhere! Yes, it's chaos everywhere, with tradesfolk running 
                  around, comparing notes, wanting to exchange their gifts for 
                  other gifts, and so on. It's going to take quite a while for 
                  things to settle down around here and for &quot;DenMom&quot; 
                  to clean up everything. In the meantime, you'll want to watch 
                  the message boards (as always), as well as bookmark the following: 
                  <a href="secrets/recipes_may8.htm">Main collection of May 8

                  to their own page for easier sorting out, and then later merge 
                  them with their other cultural recipes, but I keep getting sidetracked 
                  by new recipe updates. It'll get there.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been 
                  agonizing for over a day now what to mention in a front page 
                  update, as so much of it is newsworthy to varying parts of the 
                  tradeskill community, and I know, no matter what I highlight, 
                  someone will feel left out. Some posts late last night/early 
                  this morning decided me on what would be highlighted ...</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Druids 
                  and tradeskillers from all across Norrath have been hard at 
                  work, deciphering the Liber Brassica Felix books, in search 
                  of the Protection of the Cabbage spell (a single-target PoTG). 
                  It's been a monumental undertaking, and I'd like to thank the 
                  EQTC community and the folks over at the Druid Grove for sharing 
                  information and ideas enough to get this sorted out quickly. 
                  The quest has been gargantuan, to say the least. And it's now 
                  over. The lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf of Bertoxx exhaustedly 
                  reported in last night that she had completed the quest, and 
                  was kind enough to provide us with information on the reward 
                  (the spell and a nice earring), and a run-down of the quest. 
                  (I'll be working on webbing it after the caffeine kicks in.) 
                  We then received a visit from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers 
                  from EQ (I swear, he's got to be getting as little sleep as 
                  I am right now, from the looks of his posts on the boards!)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Rich said</font></p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>Congratulations, Xanthe!</p>
                  <p>With the first completion of this quest, a new spell was 
                    brought into the world, and I'd like to thank the many druids 
                    and tradesfolk who participated in this event. </p>
                  <p>This quest is unusual in EverQuest, as it was intended to 
                    be done once and then change after it was solved. In the next 
                    patch, Xanthe will reap the rewards of finishing the quest 
                    first, and all druids will find the scroll much easier to 
                    attain now that the quest has been completed.</p>
                  <p>The quest will stay in game, for people who enjoy tradeskills 
                    and anyone who completes the full quest will find the final 
                    reward is quite suitable for the effort.</p>
                  <p>Thanks for playing,</p>
                  <p>Rich Waters<br>

                <p>In other words, folks, if you wait until the next patch, the 
                  spell <i>will</i> be easier to obtain. The quest will stay in 
                  game for those of us who enjoy playing with such stuff <i>{curls 
                  protectively around her fishing pole and her Misty Thicket Picnic}</i>, 
                  but for those who don't have a tradeskill junkie's patience 
                  with such quests, find enough patience to wait for the next 
                  patch. ;D</p>

                  <li> Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant <i>(this 
                    should make poisonmaking, dyemaking, pottery idols, and a 
                    few other things a bit easier for those who have chosen to 
                    live mostly in Velious)</i></li>

                  <li> Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't 
                    cast due to deity restrictions <i>(imbue gem spells were bugged 
                    for a while so anyone of the proper level/class could scribe

                <p>Your best bet for the first 24 hours is to keep an eye on the 
                  message boards for the new recipes. It's going to take some 
                  time to get these things webbed, especially with the server 
                  lag I'm already seeing this morning from eager folks at w*rk

                  and were timing out all over the place, you weren't alone. I 
                  feel sort of bad for the folks at EZBoard when they saw the

                  is automagic, but please DO change your bookmarks when you have 
                  a chance, to cut down on their load.. It will take me days before 
                  I can change all the links on all the pages other than the front 
                  page, as the recipes that everyone's trying to get information

                  While we may not have noticed much extra traffic from the mention 
                  of this site in the March PC Gamer magazine, I suspect that 
                  the redesigned EQLive site, with it's community link to EQTraders, 
                  may spur a bit more traffic through here. For those of you new 
                  to the site, be welcome, browse around! Please, however, make 
                  sure you read the Visitor's Corner section of the message boards 
                  before you post over there, as this community does have some 
                  basic rules that need to be followed. For you longtime members 
                  of the EQTC community, please try to not get <i>too</i> frustrated

                  thing for everyone to brace for, is the new tradeskill recipes 
                  that are coming &quot;soon&quot;. I don't know if any will be 
                  part of the patch this week, but it's best to be prepared, just

                  working. It seems that the &quot;rare herb&quot; we've been

                  Meanwhile, Lyssabeth discovered brewed essences using zone-specific 
                  fish, and several other members of the community have helped 
                  sort out recipes and narrow down trivials. We've discovered 
                  brews that correspond to <i>most</i> of the druid port zones, 
                  but not all of them. Of course, we still have only guesses as 
                  to the eventual function of these essences, but ... You'll find

                  foraged eggs, it is not a fast path to skillups, but it gives

                  of the EQ developers was quoted last week on Caster's Realm 
                  as stating that there were over 1000 new tradeskill recipes 
                  going in &quot;in a couple weeks&quot; to &quot;expand on various 
                  cultural tradeskills, fill in some gaps in tradeskill progression, 
                  and raise the bar significantly for grandmaster tradesfolk. 
                  Many of the new recipes create items of a much higher quality 
                  than previously available, and I expect they'll be in high demand.&quot; 
                  This means a lot of extra work around here once those go live, 
                  so please be braced for chaos. You'll find several threads around

                  cultural scale temper, which is rare due to the difficulty in 
                  obtaining iksar blood, d) the final product is no drop, requiring
