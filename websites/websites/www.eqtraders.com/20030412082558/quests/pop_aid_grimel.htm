            <h3> PoP: Aid Grimel Quest - For multi-GM tradeskillers<br>
            </h3>
            <p><i>This quest originates in the top of the Plane of Knowledge Library, 
              with Aid Grimel. It requires advanced planar flags for PoP zones, 
              multiple tradeskills over 200 (exact requirements listed below) 
              and, of course, the Planes of Power expansion. At this time, the 
              quest has not been fully completed, so additional details will be 
              added to this page as they become available. Discussion of this 
              quest can be found <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=76">on 
              the new message boards</a>.</i>

            <p>After Hailing Aid Grimel, he will mention that he needs someone 
              willing to help him who is a master of trades AND has travelled 
              the planes. In other words, you will need to meet a certain minimum 
              skill level in a tradeskill AND have been flagged for a certain 
              plane or two for each tradeskill quest he gives you. If you do not 
              have the appropriate planar flag yet, he will reply to you with:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Aid Grimel says 'I am sorry but one who has such limited knowledge 
                of the Planes would not be able to assist me.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you have the proper flags, but your skill does not meet the 
              requirement, he will insult your ability in the skill. </p>
            <p>This assumes that all combines are done in either a Planar kit 
              of some sort (i.e. Planar Fletching Kit, Planar Sewing Kit, etc) 
              or in a stationary container IN the Plane of Knowledge. </p>

                a blow from a War Boar that was headed towards Taldarius's back. 
                For some time afterwards my hand was crippled but Brell saw to 
                it I regained full use of it. The ring I used to wear was damaged 
                beyond repair and my hand was never steady enough to etch a new 
                one. If you would make me a new one by combing a mounted blue 
                diamond, the etching dust and etching tools in a jewelry kit. 
                Then take the faceted gem and combine it with a bar of pure enchanted 
                velium and my signet. I have no idea how the pure bars are made.

                set of mine. If you are working with Royal Velium and want to

            <p><b><i>Part 4: Pottery. <a name="pottery"></a></i></b></p>
            <p><b>Skill requirement:</b> Between 200 and 250 Pottery. </p>

            <p>Now Grimel will give you an urn pattern and ask you to make a Sacred 
              Urn and fill it up with Sacred Water -- to replace one that was 
              destroyed in the Plane of War--and to cap it with your signet from 
              the Jewelcrafting part of the quest. Pretty straightforward. After 
              making the, start heading over to the Plane of Valor and camping 
              &quot;the knights in the tents in Valor&quot; as Khoren puts it 
              for Sacred Water. After filling up the Urn with Water and your signet, 
              combine for the Filled Sacred Urn and turn it in for the REALLY 
              promising Metal Signet. </p>

              <p>You say, 'I am ready to use some clay.' <br>
                Aid Grimel says 'On our last tome gathering expedition a stray 
                arrow in the Plane of War struck our urn filled with sacred water. 
                It was quite a waste of sacred water! Three large enchanted blocks 
                of clay, three lacquered opals, a vial of purified mana, a ceramic 
                lining, sculpting tools and the urn pattern should make an unfired 
                urn. The urn is so large you will need to fire it with three divine 
                crystalline glazes. Once you have the urn it needs to be filled 
                with three sacred waters and the signet as a cap.' <br>
