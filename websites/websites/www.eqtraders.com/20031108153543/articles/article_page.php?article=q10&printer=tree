<span class="headers">Rivervale Druid (Moss Toe) Armor</span>
<p>
<p><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Rivervale.
All armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, HFL/DRU only. They are
no-fail tailoring combines. The armor is green in color. Please note that while
the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first
bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Hibbs Rootenpaw'<br>
Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'Hello! I am Hibbs Rootenpaw, Master Druid of the Storm
Reapers. If you have not yet ventured beyond Rivervale beware of the [dangers]
that lurk through out the lands beyond our shire. There are many evil beings
that would not hesitate to end the life of a young druid of the Storm Reapers. '</p>
<p>You say, 'what dangers?'<br>
Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'The Teir'Dal, or Dark Elves, to the east have slain a
number of brave Storm Reapers that are attempting to cleanse the Nektulos Forest
of the corruption caused by the Teir'Dals evil magics. To the west, the human
farmers in the Plains of Karana are beset upon by vicious tribes of Gnolls and
must valiantly defend their farms. Closer to home the Death Fist Orcs and Goblin
Clans Runnyeye and Pick Claws all attempt to control the Misty Thicket and chop
down its sturdy trees for lumber. If you are planning on leaving the safety of
Rivervale I advise you to deliver this note to Bartle Barnick. He will help you
get yourself outfitted for survival in the wilds. When he has outfitted you in a
suit of protective leather return here for [further instruction]. '</p>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Bartle Barnick'<br>
Bartle Barnick says 'Good day! If you are a new Druid of the Storm Reapers I
have promised Hibbs that I would assist in getting you outfitted for ventures
beyond Rivervale but you must bring me a note from Reebo as proof that he sent
you. There are many dangers outside of the shire so often leather clothing and a
weapon become necessities for a traveling druid. '</p>
<p>(give Bartle the note from Hibbs)<br>
Bartle Barnick says 'It is good to see another of our young people choose the
humble life of a druid of Karana. I have assembled that will allow you to
construct some protective leather garments to keep you comfortable in the wilds
and help turn aside the weapons of the Storm Reapers enemies. The required
components for the leather vary according to which piece of Moss Toe Leather you
are planning on crafting. Do you wish to craft a [moss toe cap], a [moss toe
bracer], [moss toe gloves], [moss toe boots], [moss toe sleeves], [moss toe
leggings], or a [moss toe tunic]. '</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Now, go back to Hibbs for that extra instruction...</p>
<p>You say, 'what further instruction?'<br>
Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'If you feel you are ready for the responsibility of an
important task then you may assist with the [investigation] of the ancient
cursed fields in the Misty Thicket. The crumbling walls that surround the cursed
fields are believed to have been constructed around the same time as the ruined
tower and the great wall of Cetelt. We Storm Reapers believe that the walls once
surrounded beautiful and fruitful gardens. The arrogance of the caretaker of the
gardens offended the Gods and in turn the gardens were cursed with disease and
an evil power that animates the corpses of the dead. The Scarecrow, Old
Gourdhead, stands in one of these two fields and warns passers by that it is an
accursed place. Recently someone has been placing rats in the fields to become
diseased. '</p>
<p>You say, 'what investigation?'<br>
Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'We Storm Reapers are searching for the culprit that is
seeding the cursed fields with the diseased and undead creatures. The person
responsible has committed great offenses to the ways of Karana and the people of
Rivervale and must be stopped. Should you identify the individual responsible
slay them and bring their head to me and you shall be rewarded for your deed. It
is a shame that our otherwise peaceful lives must occasionally be interrupted by
the necessity for bloodshed. '</p>
<p>Find Rusbek the Inhospitable found at -981, -2331, along with a pair of named
wolves. It is suspected that the wolves will agro along with him, if you are low
enough level. Kill him, loot his head, and bring it back to Hibbs.</p>
<p>Hibbs Rootenpaw says 'Excelent work young Storm Reaper. It is sad that one of
our own would resort to such vile acts; his mind must have been twisted by evil
desires. Such behavior is practically unheard of among the kind people of
Rivervale. Take this dull scimitar and sharpen it in the forge here at the
Tagglefoots Farm with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you
are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done give the sharpened scimitar
and a large fruit bat wing to Bodbin Gimple and he will put the finishing
touches on what will be a fitting scimitar for a Druid of the Storm Reapers.’</p>
<p>Combine the dull scimitar and a sharpening stone in a forge. Then hand it and
the large fruit bat wing to Bodbin Gimple (not to Hibbs), to receive:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Storm Reaper Initiate Scimitar, damage 5, delay 30, lore, magic, wt 8.5,
  1-hand slashing, HLF/DRU</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Further details:</b></p>
<p>mossy rat pelts come from diseased rats in Misty Thicket<br>
the various giant wood spider parts come from giant wood spiders in Misty
Thicket<br>
the various large wood spider parts come from large wood spiders in Misty
Thicket</p></p><p>
