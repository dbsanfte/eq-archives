            <h3> Shar Vahl - Register for Citizenship</h3>
            <p><i>NOTE: This quest for Vah Shir starts with the &quot;newbie note&quot; 
              - the note that every young Vah Shir starts out with when they enter 
              the game for the first time. The example here is for the beastlord 
              version of the quest, but every class of Vah Shir has the same quest. 
              The only difference is that you will be handing in parts to your 
              guildleader (instead of Elder Animist Sahdi), and the fact that 
              upon completion, your guildleader will tell you to go to someone 
              else in your guild to start your next set of quests.</i></p>
            <p><i>My thanks to the Wrath of the Ancients folks who put together 
              the original information, and made it available to the site.</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Elder Animist Sahdi says '_____, welcome to the Animist's guild. 
                You have grown strong in the safety of our city and it is now 
                time for you to register for official citizenship of Shar Vahl. 
                The Khati Sha, explorers of this hostile land, have granted your 
                request of inclusion and deem you to be worthy of our training. 
                Take this application to Registrar Bindarah and return to me with 
                proof of your citizenship. </p>
              <p>Elder Animist Sahdi says 'I know that you may be nervous right 
                now... after all, this should be a very exciting first step for 
                you. If you happen to get lost while looking for the registrar, 
                just ask one of the other citizens or guards for directions. They 
                will most likely know where to find the place or person that you 
                are looking for. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You gain experience!!</p>
            <p>Receive an application and take it to Registrar Bindarah.</p>
            <p>Bindarah is at roughly N372 P149, a little north of the South Gates 
              (to Shadeweaver) in the square. Give the application to Bindarah. 
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Registrar Bindarah says 'Young _____, I will be happy to process 
                your registration for you. While I etch your name on our people's 
                book of records I will require you to run a couple of errands. 
                Take this certificate to the tax collector and obtain his seal. 
                While you're out doing that, have Mignah create your personal 
                Acrylia slate for you. Bring both the seal and the slate to me 
                as soon as you can. </p>

            <p>You gain experience!!</p>
            <p>Receive the certificate and take it to the Tax Collector.</p>
            <p>The Tax Collector is in the bank, due east of Registrar Bindarah. 
              Give the certificate to the Tax Collector</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Tax Collector Khugra places his seal on the certificate before 
                returning it to you, 'Ahh, a new taxpayer, wonderful! You must 
                always remember that it is a distinct priveledge to contribute 
                to the upkeep of our noble society and not merely a duty or a 
                burden. I look forward to collecting your honorable taxes in the 
                future. May the spirits prosper you, _____.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Receive the Tax Collectors seal to return to Registrar Bindarah 
              (after you get your slate from Mignah).</p>
            <p>Mingah is upstairs in a building on the north end of town (a spot 
              many folks forget to look), but the helpful guards will tell you 
              where to find him ...</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Khati Sha Jaarin'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Khati Sha Jaarin says 'Greetings, how may I assist you? </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'where is Mignah?'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Khati Sha Jaarin says 'You can always find ol' Mignah right above 
                the tavern right next to the North Gate that leads to Hollowshade. 
                Say, if you are headed there, you may want to purchase a bandage 
                first. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Once you have found Mingah (loc 483, -283) ...</p>
            <p>You say, 'what acrylia slate?'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Mignah Cahru pulls a smoldering piece of forged acrylia from 
                a nearby oven and, before you can react, presses your hand into 
                the still soft metal, 'This may hurt a bit, but it'll heal.' He 
                then etches your name and the date into the slate and plunges 
                it into a bucket of water before placing it into your stinging 
                palm. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You bow before Mignah Cahru.</p>

              and your slate.</p>
            <p><i>NOTE: He will keep the slate for now. You will get it back later</i></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Registrar Bindarah says 'This item, by itself, means nothing 
                to me. </p>
              <p>Registrar Bindarah says 'Ahh, there you are. I was about to send 
                someone looking for you. Everything seems to be in order here, 
                only one task remains. You must gain audience with the king and 
                swear fealty to his highness by handing him this document. Return

                the first to welcome you to citizenship of Shar Vahl! May you 
                serve our society as well as it serves you. Return to your guildmaster 
                and present both the slate and the application to him. The acrylia 
                slate shall henceforth serve as proof of your citizenship. </p>

                young initiate. It is a symbol of your loyalty to our noble people. 
                May it serve you as you serve us all. Present your acrylia slate

            <p><b>Note:</b> for non-Vah Shir who wish to perform any of the progressive 
              quests in Shar Vahl, this quest can be multiquested if you can find 
              someone willing to create a throwaway Vah Shir (or have a second 
              account with a character slot free). Have the Vah Shir complete 
              every step of this quest up to getting the slate from Mignah. The 
              person who needs the citizenship slate (&quot;the questor&quot;) 
              then asks Mignah for the personal acrylia slate. The Vah Shir hands 
              in the tax collector's seal to Registrar Bindarah, then &quot;the 
              questor&quot; gives the slate they just received to Bindarah. Then 
              &quot;the questor&quot; gives the document to the king, and hands 
              the resulting item to Bindarah in order to receive the proper personal 
              acrylia slate needed for future questing. Remember to do this multiquesting 
              ONLY with a Vah Shir that never ever plans to do their newbie quest, 
              or any other quest that requires the personal acrylia slate.</p>
