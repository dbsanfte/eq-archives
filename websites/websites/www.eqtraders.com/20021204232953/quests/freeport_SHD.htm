            <h3> Dismal Knight Armor - Freeport Shadowknight Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Freeport. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, HUM/SHD only. 
              Further details on stats and exact armor names are not yet available 
              for this armor, but it's been reported as having a black plate graphic 
              when worn. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the 
              bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you 
              get the parts for a second one</i> 
            <p> 
            <p>Hail Gunex Eklar in the underground guild area in East Freeport. 
              He will give you a letter to take outside to Quan Nektogo in East 
              Freeport (merchant NPC in pit outside). Give Quan the letter and 
              he will give you a Mail Assembly Kit and instructions on making 
              the newbie shadowknight armor.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Gunex Eklar' </p>
            <p>Gunex Eklar says 'Begone lest you seek instruction, I am very busy. 
              I teach those who [follow the path of rage] as a Shadowknight, the 
              leaders of the Dismal Rage.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I follow the path of rage' </p>
            <p>Gunex Eklar says 'As the leaders of the Dismal Rage we Shadowknights 
              forefront of our struggles. We use the spiritual guidance of our 
              Clerics, the Dark Arts of our Necromancers, and the tactics of our 
              Warriors to advance the causes and secure the needs of our followers. 
              If you aspire to be of importance to your colleagues you must first 
              obtain a suit of armor to defend you from the aggressions of our 
              enemies. Take this note to Quan Nektogo here in the eastern quarter 
              of Freeport. He will aid you in the construction of your armor. 
              When you are properly outfitted return to me and I will present 
              you with an [important task].' </p>
            <p>Quan Nektogo says 'Sorry buddy I didn&#146;t realize you were one 
              of us. I've got no problem helping out an associate of Gunex. You'll 
              need this Mail Assembly Kit to construct your new armor. The materials 
              required depend on the section of armor you're planning on crafting. 
              Do you plan on crafting a [dismal knight helm], a [dismal knight 
              bracer], [dismal knight gauntlets], [dismal knight boots], [dismal 
              knight vambraces], [dismal knight greaves], or a [dismal knight 
              breastplate].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft a dismal knight helm' <br>
              Quan Nektogo says 'To assemble a Dismal Knight Helm you will need 
              to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge] with 
              a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine 
              the Crude Iron Helm with a Ruined Cat Pelt and two Large Leaf Scarab 
              Eyes in the Mail Assembly Kit.' </p>

              Truth in the sewer tunnels beneath the western quarter of Freeport. 
              The incompetent Freeport Militia has yet to capture these wanted 
              followers of the Mar twins. We will wait for their capture no longer.

              Take this Dull Dismal Long Sword and sharpen it in a forge with 
              a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are
