              Mistrunner Preserver of Nature and loyal servant of Tunare. I have 
              resided in this guild house for many of my years. I pride myself 
              on being a mentor to many young druids of Tunare that come up through 
              our ranks. If you are a [druid of Tunare] then I might have some

              exercises. These tests will enable you to learn your way around 
              this great land we call home and to pick up some very valuable hunting 
              skills that will aid you in all of your battles to come. When you 
              are [ready to begin your training] I will present you with your

              will be infused together to create armor materials used to crafting 
              Leafrunners Leather Armor. Once you have created the armor materials

              items can be found on some of the deadliest creatures and also on 
              some of our most trust worthy merchants. Once you are ready to begin 
              creating your armor pieces simply tell me what piece you [want] 
              to craft. I can provide you with the material recipes and patterns

              so close to us it is feared that a full-scale attack could level 
              our city and at the very least, leave many of our bretheren dead 
              by the hands of the filthy orcs. What I ask is that you bring me 
              the detailed battle plans that only the highest-ranking orcs could 
              be carrying. Bring me these battle plans along with 2 pairs of Crushbone 
              Battle Beads and I will surely reward you for your trouble.'
