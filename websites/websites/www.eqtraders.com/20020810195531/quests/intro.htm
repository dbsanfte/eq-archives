<h3> Introduction to the Thurgadin Shawl Quests </h3>

                <td>
                  <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of the shawls! The most exciting, 
                    entertaining, and action-packed quests ever seen in the land 
                    of Norrath! 
                  <p> Weeell, not exactly.... Oh, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't 
                    have bothered to go through with the blimey thing, much less 
                    write this guide, if I didn't think it's worth it in the end. 
                    But most people who have gotten very far with the shawl quest 
                    find themselves in a Love/Hate relationship. The thing about 
                    the shawls is that they require a LOT of work. 
                  <p>Ok, here, take the amount of work that you are right now 
                    envisioning you will need to put into the whole thing, getting 
                    from nothing to the eighth shawl. Now, if you are a pessimist 
                    by nature, multiply that amount by ten. If you are an optimist 
                    by nature, multiply it by a hundred. 
                  <p>That is how much effort will go into just getting your tailoring 
                    where it needs to be to complete the sixth shawl. 
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>You also need to get your baking, brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, 
              pottery and smithing all up to similar levels. You need to get items off 
              of creatures in Iceclad, East Wastes, Kael Drakkel, Cobalt Scar, 
              Great Divide, Siren's Grotto, West Wastes, and Velketor's Labyrinth, among others. 
              Some of these critters cannot be soloed by a single person of any 
              level or class. Unless your trade skills are all already where they 
              need to be, you will <i>not</i> have the eighth shawl with only 
              a few weeks of work. Even if by some strange twist your 
              skills are all up there and you don't have this thing yet, you'll 
              still need a lot, a lot lot lot of time and help to get it that 
              fast. I think of this as the epic quest for tradeskillers. With 
              all the time required to get my skills up and do some research and 
              collect obscure stuff, I easily spent as much time on this thing 
              as I did on my shaman epic weapon, probably a great deal more. 
            <p> 
Now, that said...I obviously love this quest and love trade skills or else I would not have taken the time to compile these guides to help others through it. I just want you to realize with crystal clear understanding the magnitude of what you are undertaking before you make yourself and the rest of Norrath miserable. 
<p> 
The demands of the shawls are great. So are the rewards. And the headaches in between the two. 
<p> 
One note for the faction-conscious: this quest will require the deaths of numerous giants and their wolves. If you are aligned with the giants and Coldain against the dragons, you will want to make sure you are willing to sacrifice some giant faction (or the time to repair it), or have friends willing to invest a LOT of time helping you collect things. In some cases you can buy what you need from others, but you'll still have to be extra careful if you want to maintain giant faction. 
<p> 
Still with me? Alright, let's get to work! 
<p> 
<a name="how"><h4> "What is the quickest way to raise Xxxxxx skill?" </h4></a>
            <p>At one point I had considered putting in a guide to what to use to raise each skill, as submitted by one shawl quester.  However, after watching every existing smithing guide get very obsolete with the changes to smithing, and hearing word that similar changes are in store eventually for many of the other tradeskills, I've changed my mind. It is too much attention to be paying to something that I don't think is necessary. Also, NO guide will be completely accurate for any given race/class/diety/level/playing style/time available. A little time and effort developing a plan for yourself may well save you a LOT of time and effort spent using an approach that wasn't designed with your situation in mind. 
<p>You are not without any guidance, however! EQ Traders is a comprehensive site that tries to offer every conceivable tidbit of information that may be useful to a tradesperson. Therefore, I suggest you take the following steps, either to find any particular answer or just to familiarize yourself with the site and get started with your skills: 
<p> 
First, go to the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes.htm">EQ Traders Recipes</a> page. Select the skill you would like to improve. Print that page. Then go to <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/supplies.htm#skill">Supplies sorted by Skill</a> and again select the skill you want to improve. Print that page.
<p> 
To figure out how to raise your skill to the level you desire, look over both pages that you just printed. Specifically, look for recipes that require ingredients that you know you can find easily and/or that are listed on the supplies page as available somewhere within reason. For some skills like jewelcraft, fletching, or pottery, just about everything will be on vendors if you find a good city in which to work. For other skills you will have to practice the fine arts of merchant mining or auctioning or even rolling up your sleeves and slaughtering greens. 
<p> 
Once you get a feel for which recipes are feasible and which are not, look at where they become trivial and plan out an order to do them from easiest to hardest. It is possible to go from 0 to 200+ on a single recipe that trivials at that high, if you wish. The difficulty of the recipe has no bearing on the rate at which your skill will improve when you use that recipe, as long as it's not yet trivial.  However, it is definitely more fun if you use at least a few different recipes that trivial at gradually higher levels.
<p> 
If you want to give this trade skill stuff an honest try, look for a few recipes that sound fun (Gnome Kabobs!) and throw them in for the heck of it. When working up your skill, keep in mind that just because something is trivial does not mean that you are <i>guaranteed</i> to succeed. There is <b>always</b> a 5% chance of failure, no matter how good you are and how easy the item. Depending on the value of your ingredients and the cost and trouble of increasing your skill, it may be worth it to get 30-40 points of skill beyond where the item trivials. Likewise, if a skill is very hard to raise and your quest ingredients are easier to get, you might be better off making several attempts at a skill below trivial than to try to get to trivial skill first. 
            <p> Still have problems or questions? Make sure that you have read <b>everything</b>
              on the pages you already printed, and then go to <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/learn.htm">Learn 
              a Skill</a> and select the relevant skill and read all of that. 
              Question not yet answered? Try the General <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm61">FAQ</a>. 
              Answer still not there? Ok now, go to the <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/beqtraderscorner">Message 
              Boards</a> and select your skill. Check the FAQ at the top of those 
              posts. They are called Frequently Asked Questions because many people 
              ask them. If many people ask them then you might well be asking 
              the same thing. Yes, I realize that this is a lot of reading, but tradeskills are complicated stuff. There is a lot you might need to know, so the investment of time learning about it up front will save you headaches when the time comes that you need the knowledge. If you're still determined to find a guide to what to use to skill up, the trade-specific forums are the best place to look. If all of those sources fail you, post your specific question in the forum relevant for your skill. 
              Depending on the time of day and week of your post, answers will 
              appear within minutes or hours. When you have made it to the level you desire in your current trade skill, pat yourself on the back! 
              You are that much closer to your shawl. 
            <p> 
Do <b>NOT</b> under any circumstances go straight to the message boards without first checking the existing resources. Especially do NOT post "What's the quickest way to improve Xxxxxx skill?". There are at least twenty posts on that very same topic on the boards for every single skill, so if you insist you can go there and look for them and see what has been posted in response. All of the answers to those posts are based on people looking at the links I've given you above and regurgitating it for you. That level of helplessness is annoying. The recently reintroduced EZ Board search engine is much better than it used to be.  It also won't kill you to flip back through the last few pages of posts and skim the titles. You're not the first person to work on your skill, so chances are very slim that you have a question that has not yet been asked and answered. Questions relating to skilling up for the shawls or in general are especially common.  Folks on the boards love helping with honest questions and problems and dilemmas, but do not appreciate being treated like personal researchers when the answer is just a few clicks away on the very same site. If you've looked and just can't find it, then by all means post!  But please, just take a look around first.  If you cannot spare an hour or so just once to get oriented and learn how information is arranged on the site, then you'll never, ever manage to invest enough time to get through these shawls.  And who knows, you might even find some helpful information about which it wouldn't have occurred to you to ask!
<p> 
<h4> Suggestions, Corrections, and Updates </h4>
            <p> Please post any feedback about the shawl quest pages <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11">here</a>. 
              I read the boards religiously and will get it updated much more 
              quickly if it's here and not buried in email. We will also get feedback 
              from the rest of the tradeskill community this way. Note: If you 
              hunt me down in Norrath for any purpose other than to offer me heaps of blue diamonds, I will growl fiercely in your general direction 
              and be grumpy and uncooperative. You will get much better results if you pursue your questions here on EQ Traders! 
            <p> 
In many places I do not have precise trivial levels, but instead have a range (160-165) or a maximum (&lt;140) or minimum (&gt;132). Please post if you can narrow the ranges down at all for those, or have corrections to trivials that you found to be incorrect. 
<p> 
<h4> Credits </h4>
<p> 
Not much of what is on these pages is fresh from my own brain. The vast majority of it is information that I gathered from sites all over the place, especially the fantastic suggestions, corrections, and additions provided by the folks on the message boards here.  My other main sources have been <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">Allakhazam</a>, <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com">Illia's Bestiary</a>, <a href="http://www.geocities.com/dragonslayers_eq">The Dragonslayers Guild</a>, Xilith Tvyn (whose link no longer works), and all the folks who posted their findings on these sites to make things easier for the rest of us. And last but most certainly not least, I owe thanks to my friends and family on the Karana server who have helped me along in the quest with their various skills, including Sumamael and Cantatus (editors extraordinaire), Wathakhorforpyne (for a looong evening of griffon tracking), Xlint (efficiently killing sirens when not charmed and blasting me to bits), Kyren (for the many gifts of foraged food), Savant (for countless acts of enchanterly generosity to an impatient tailor), Jannelle and Steelheart (kromrif blood <i>finally</i>!), and Calandria, Ganelon, Dano, and Zipple for all around support. I owe a great debt to these and all my other faithful friends who listened patiently to my ranting and then quietly hauled me off to take out my frustrations on unsuspecting mobs.
