<span class="headers">Freeport Rogue (Coalition Trader) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>Much like other "newbie" zone revamps, this is a quest for young Freeport rogues who wish to make armor. Armor is lore (other than bracer), no drop, HUM, ROG only. It has a dark leather graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>

<p>
Hail Tovan Tenlah, he mentions something about needing proper equipment for my employment as a Coalition Trader. He handed me a note to give to Venora Rankin, another NPC a few rooms away.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Tovan Tenlah' 
</p>
<p>

Tovan Tenlah says 'The first thing you need is a suit of sturdy traders clothing. Take this note to Verona Rankin and she'll help you with a suit tailored to your needs. Once you have been outfitted in your traders clothing return to me and I will inform you of your [next task].' 
</p>
<p>
Verona Rankin says 'Ah, Tovan sent you for a suit of traders clothing. I can instruct you on how to prepare your suit of clothing but you will have to acquire the required materials yourself. Use this Curing Kit to construct the clothing once you have done so.

You say, 'what next task?' 
</p>
<p>
Tovan Tenlah says 'Ready to get to work are you? Listen carefully. Outside Freeports South gate you will find one of our employees, Rigg Nostra, who is acting as an intermediary between the Coalition of Tradefolk and some recently acquired business associates. Give him this card so he knows I've sent you and he will give you further instructions. Do not mention any of our names in public. The Freeport Militia would likely impose high taxes on the Coalition if they found out about the goods being exchanged to us by our new associates.' 
</p>
<p>
Rigg Nostra says 'Excellent I've been waiting for the Coalition to send me some assistance. I have an associate waiting for some supplies that have not yet been collected. I need you to acquire a [crate of pick heads] and a [bundle of hardwood shafts] and bring them to me so that I may prepare them for delivery to my associate.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what crate of pick heads' 
</p>
<p>
Rigg Nostra says 'I've heard that a dwarf who calls himself Grendig and has not registered with the Coalition of Tradefolk has recently arrived in Freeport and is staying at the Freeport Inn just inside the South Gate. He has brought to Freeport pick heads from his home city of Kaladim. Find Grendig and 'convince' him to 'donate' a crate of pick heads to the Coalition of Tradefolk as tax for peddling his wares in our city.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what bundle of hardwood shafts' 
</p>
<p>
Rigg Nostra says 'There is a halfling named Jimble Woodentoe that occasionally visits Freeport to peddle his woodcrafts. He can be found traveling through the Commonlands from the direction of Rivervale. Find Jimble and 'convince' him to donate a bundle of hardwood shafts to the Coalition of Tradefolk as tax for peddling his wares in our city.'
