      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Shavanna enjoyed 

        fall. It was an overly busy time, with many preparations for the cold 

        winter, but she enjoyed it nonetheless.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Maybe it was because 

        it brought back memories of walks in the colorful woods with her long-lost 

        beloved Kadran, home-made pies, fresh-pressed Surefall cider, and fat 

        squirrels scampering about stashing nuts. It was a time of collecting 

        and gathering, of setting things to rights before winter-induced sluggishness 

        set in.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The day had started 

        with a wispy fog curling hither and yon amidst the trees and pastures 

        of the plains, and the sun seemed a bit anemic. She had the time to spare 

        today, however, and knew that if she waited for a drier day, she might 

        not be able to complete her expedition. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So she wandered off 

        through the woods, her footfalls muted as her large feet walked atop the 

        damp leaves that had already fallen from the trees. A large empty backpack 

        was slung over her shoulder, and her eyes peered about intently at the 

        trees. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At last she found 
        what she was looking for -- a stand of kiola nut trees. She slid the backpack 
        off her back, opened it, and set it on the ground. Then she crouched near 
        it and began picking fallen nuts off the ground. A little over twice the 
        size of a pecan, they very covered with a soft, fuzzy skin, and a hard, 
        prickly shell underneath. It would take them a month or two to dry out 
        enough for shelling and eating, and they were a real pain to crack, but 
        she'd always found them worth the effort. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unfortunately, her 

        muscles were telling her that she wasn't a teenager anymore, and the squatting 

        and bending began to send slow aches through her back and legs. Her pack 

        was about two-thirds full anyway, so she decided it was time to stop and 

        stretch. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She straightened 

        up and began to walk in circles, working the kinks out of her tall, lithe 

        body. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Suddenly, she hit 

        a patch of damp leaves in just the wrong way, and her feet flew out from 

        under her. "Aaaaaaggghhhhhh!" She flailed about for a moment, trying to 

        regain her balance, and then landed heavily on her back, her breath rushing 

        out of her in a whoosh. Several moments passed as she tried to regain 

        her breath and to get her stunned mind to realize just how she'd ended 

        up horizontal. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At last her eyes 

        focused and she finally managed to focus on the colorful leaves in the 

        tree above her head. There seemed to be an odd spot in her vision, however 

        ... </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i><b>>>THUNK<< </b></i></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There was a sharp 

        pain between her eyes and odd chittering noises seemed to come from the 

        tree above her. It was a while before she could process this new attack 

        on her befuddled self, but finally it dawned on her that she'd been hit 

        between the eyes with a nut, and that the noises were coming from two 

        squirrels quarreling in the tree above her.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She could feel the 

        damp starting to work its way though her clothes, as she lay there trying 

        to get up the oomph to struggle to her feet. Several twinges told her 

        that more than her pride was going to be sore for the next several days. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She enjoyed fall. 

        Really she did ... </font></p>
