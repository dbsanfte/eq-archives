<span class="headers">Paineel Shadow Knight (Fell Blade) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Paineel. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ERU/SHD only. They are no-fail smithing combines. The resulting armor graphic is dark grey plate. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make
your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one.</i>

</p>
<p>
 Faratain says 'Salutations Darulius. If you are here to make use of the forges then feel free to pursue your crafts within this chamber. If you are a new Fell Blade in need of a suit of armor and weapon then I will assist you in crafting [armaments] fitting of a young Shadow Knight.'

Do you desire to craft a [fell blade helm], a [fell blade bracer], [fell blade gauntlets], [fell blade boots], [fell blade vambraces], [fell blade greaves], or a [fell blade breastplate]?'

 Faratain says 'The blacksmiths of [Clan Kolbok] craft weapons using an ancient Kobold tradition that has been long forgotten by most of the kobold clans. I believe there is something to be learned from their traditions should we discover their intricacies. Go into the Warrens and locate the chambers of the kobold blacksmiths. There you should be able to find some record of their traditional techniques to return to me here in Paineel where they can be translated and studied.'
