<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you wish to make non-metal 
  armor for yourself and others, tailoring is the skill you need to learn. Your 
  first finished products will be patchwork armor for the non-casters, and silk 
  swatches and raw silk armor for the pure spellcasters and monks. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While some folks have expressed 
  an interest in learning simply to make themselves some armor, in order to develop 
  enough skill to make yourself armor, you might as well continue working on the 
  skill enough to pay for all those pelts and patterns you ruined in the process. 
  &nbsp;&lt;g&gt; </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> I'm <I>not</I> going to 
  tell you everything there is to know about tailoring, but here's some basic 
  information to save you a lot of mis-spent money. </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>For patchwork:</b> </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">First, lets clear some 
  misconceptions and confusions: a) Small sewing kits can be used to make armor 
  for <I>all </I>size folks. The size of the sewing kit does NOT affect the size 
  of the armor being made. (I've seen a lot of humans running around looking for 
  &quot;medium sewing kits&quot; to no avail.) b) Somewhere along the way, the 
  powers that be did a name change on things, so some pelts will be called pelts, 
  others will be called &quot;skins&quot;. As long as the other part of the description 
  matches the pelt you need, it's the one you want. (i.e., ruined bear pelt, high 
  quality bear skin, etc.)</font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The <I>pelt</I> or <i>skin</i> 
  determines the size of the armor made. (Wolf for the wee folks, cat for the 
  medium folks, and bear for the large folks.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruined pelts are for 
  patchwork, which makes sense, since patchwork is bits and pieces, and you mangled 
  the pelt while skinning it. Better pelts/skin, plus the large sewing kit mix 
  with &nbsp;patterns and certain metal objects, to make studded leather and reinforced 
  leather armor. Of course, these sorts of things are a lot more difficult to 
  make, and so on, so forget about it for now. Just focus on the basics -- patchwork. 
  By the time you have mastered that, and have a tailoring skill of 26, then you 
  can start asking around to find someone willing to teach you the tricks to the 
  better leather armors. Until that time, you'll waste a lot of materials, and 
  frustrate yourself unduly. </font> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>For silk armor:</b> 
  The first thing you're going to need is spider silk, and lots of it. Now, we're 
  not talking of mugging spiderlings here, as their silk is too small to do any 
  good. You need the bigger spiders to pull this off: large spiders, giant spiders, 
  carrion spiders, crag spiders, wooly spiders, etc. You can get your skill in 
  tailoring from 0 to somewhere in the teens by just taking two pieces of spider 
  silk and combining them in either size sewing kit. Set the resulting silk swatch 
  aside -- you're going to need lots of it. Once your sewing skill is in the teens 
  (or sooner if you want to risk ruining more silk swatches and patterns), you 
  combine silk swatches and patterns in the large kit to produce raw silk armor 
  that spellcasters and monks can wear. The number of swatches you need varies 
  with the item being made, but always, always, with any trade skill, remember 
  that if something needs 2 or more of an item, that those items <i>must</i> be 
  unstacked in your kit before you combine. Once raw silk armor is trivial for 
  you, then you can start teaming up with a brewer to make cured silk armor, and 
  with an enchanter to make Wu's Fighting Gauntlets for the monks (the only piece 
  of &quot;glowing silk&quot; armor in the game so far), but definitely don't 
  even think of trying to learn how to tailor on the more advanced items unless 
  you have a <i>lot</i> of money you're willing to waste as you ruin things. </font>
