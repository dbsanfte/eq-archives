<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There's been a lot of frustrating 
  time and energy spent trying to find the ground spawns for dye components. In 
  a lovely sign of tradesfolk cooperation and unity, various members of the EQ 
  Traders Corner community have banded together to share information on ground 
  drops ... even when it means that they'll then have more informed &quot;competion&quot; 
  on their server for these very same drops. My hat goes off to them all - this 
  sharing of information is what this community is about. :) So far, we've been 
  able to narrow down the spawn time for the oxides and fungi to 21-22 hours. 
  Evergreen leaves have reports of varying spawn times, from one report of &quot;almost 
  instant&quot; to other reports of up to 20 hours. (The most reliable source 
  says he camped a spawn point for a couple days solid, and the spawn time is 
  12 hours. Ugh, that's a long time to stare at a patch of ground!) Note that 
  loc #s for the evergreen leaves may have a point or two variation off what is 
  listed, but this should get you into the right areas. Screenshots for the leaf 
  spawns and the fungus spawns will be along eventually, once I make/get some.</font></p>
