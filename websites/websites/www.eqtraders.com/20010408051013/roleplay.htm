            <p>Originally<a name="Top"></a>, I was just making a web site to make 
              trade skills easier, but I know there are a lot of us roleplayers 
              scattered across the servers who are interested in more than just 
              skills. Until I figure out if there's much interest in this little 
              corner of the site, I'm not worrying much about "prettying up" this 
              section. Yell if you're truly using it, and I may try to clean it 
              up a bit.</p>

            <p class="headers"><b>Character Description<a name="Character"></a></b></p>
            <p>While I personally dislike all the folks who walk up without a 
              word and start inspecting my equipment (I feel like there's a bunch 
              of peeping toms staring down my bodice), there is a way to add to 
              the eyefull folks get when they do that. For thoseof you who don't 
              mind the folks who spam-inspect you, and then harass you trying 
              to buy the clothes off your back, it's a good spot to put any info 
              about yourself that you want to share.</p>
            <p>Take a good long look at yourself from an external view (i.e., 
              press the f9 key a time or two, so you can see yourself on your 
              screen). Right click on yourself, and it should bring up a picture 
              of you, with a blank area below it. Click on that area and it will 
              let you type in a brief character history (or whatever you prefer) 
              that will show when anyone looks at your equipment. ("If you're 
              done staring, kindly remove your eyeball from my bodice" was one 
              of the ones I heard of that got a giggle out of me.) </p>

            <p class="headers"><b>Hunting Tips <a name="hunting"></a></b></p>
            <p><b>"Hail a sand giant"</b> - By now, if you've done much group 
              hunting, you've probably hear this one, however, here's some RP 
              justification/explanation for it. Your group just got done beating 
              on something nasty, and most of the spellcasters are busy meditating. 
              Something nasty comes over the hill, and you need to get out a timely 
              warning before it stomps on your party. You can try, "Guys, look 
              out, there's a ..." followed by the sounds of one or more party 
              members getting blindsided. There's a faster way to warn, them, 
              however, to make up for the time that it's slower to type a warning 
              than it is to physically say it. Target the critter and hit the 
              "h" key to hail it. Think of this as the RP equivalent of pointing 
              at it and blurting a warning. Once you've hailed it, <b>then</b> 
              you can give more accurate information about where it is and who 
              is in danger ... as you yourself either backpedal out of it's path, 
              or move to defend your group's spellcasters. For those of you busy 
              meditating with your noses in your spellbooks, if you hear someone 
              hail a nasty critter, get your nose out of that book and be ready 
              to move or fight. It might just save your life and the lives of 
              those with you.</p>
            <p><b>Corpse fetching</b> - You died somewhere you should not have 
              been ... again. And, well, you would die ... again ... if you tried 
              to loot your body in that particular spot. If you're unable to become 
              invisible, or you died somewhere that creatures can see through 
              invisible, then get yourself, and a couple bodyguards into the general 
              area where you died. Then <b>carefully</b> edge your way closer 
              to your body, trying a /corpse every step or two. The moment the 
              command works, BACK up many steps, and /corpse again. Repeat this 
              process until you've got your body somewhere that is a little safer. 
              Think of this as the RP equivalent of grabbing your corpse and dragging 
              it to somewhere you can loot it in safety. You have to get close 
              to it to "grab" it, and can only drag in tiny spurts because, well, 
              have you ever tried dragging something that is as heavy, or heavier 
              (due to gear) than yourself? Not a fun process for distance-dragging, 
              is it? You can also do this with other people's corpses as well, 
              as long as they have given you /consent. It helps to have /corpse 
              pre-mapped to a socials button in advance, to speed up the dragging 
              process.</p>

            <p class="headers"><b>Language lessons?<a name="language"></a></b></p>
            <p>All the races, other than human, know at least one language other 
              than Common Tongue when they start out. You can learn other languages 
              as you go along, both for the pure fun of it, and for things like 
              spell research later on. (<i>At last count, at least until the expansion 
              pack, there are 24 languages available.</i>)</p>
            <p>There are two main ways to learn other languages, and you can intermix 
              them.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>As you get older, your trainer can teach you various languages, 
                should you wish to spend the training points.</li>
              <li>You can find a native speaker, listen to them talk the language 
                a while, and then practice the language yourself.</li>
            </ol>
			<P>This second method is a great way for a group to pass 10 or 15 
              minutes while they are waiting for someone or something to happen. 
              Make sure you are grouped, and in close physical proximity to each 
              other. Each member of the party should go to their speech selection 
              screen and change their language to something that at least 1 other 
              in the group does not know, or knows to a much lesser degree than 
              you.
            <P>Then go to your <b>socials</b> menu and reprogram one of your buttons 
              to /gsay three or four lines. Due to lag issues with "spamming large 
              amounts of text", Euar Firestreak of Veeshan suggests that you speak 
              only a single letter per line. The skill checks are per-line of 
              text, regardless of how much text is coming across, and less text 
              means less lag and less chance of someone going linkdead due to 
              "spam".
            <P>Example social text
			  <blockquote>
			  /g a <br>
              /g b <br>
              /g c <br>
              /g d 
			  </blockquote>
            <P>Put that socials button onto one of your hotkeys that is currently 
              unused. <b>Turn off group say</b> (in your chat filter section of 
              the options menu) so that you don't see the spam that the others 
              are saying, only the skill increases and your own babble. <b>Remember 
              to turn group say back on in the chat filters when you're done with 
              the lesson.</b>
            <P>Take a deep breath, and then everyone begin babbling at once, via 
              the hotkeys, in the various languages. (This is called "spamming") 
              Have one person ready to switch back to Common at the drop of a 
              hat and spam "HOLD!" in normal say until everyone stops if there 
              is danger approaching (alternately, have someone jump up and down 
              or do some other action to get people's attention). At random times, 
              you will see a message flash across your screen that says <font color="#0066FF"><b>"Your 
              language skills have improved."</b></font> However, <b>you won't 
              see those improvements on your skill list until you zone or log 
              off and back on.</b> It's amazing how quickly you can become very 
              multilingual, with a few good friends from other races to assist 
              you.
            <P>Once you have learned that language, you can also try to increase 
              your skill by speaking it to another, but it's much slower learning 
              to laboriously try to pronounce all those foreign words than it 
              is to learn by listening.
