<p>When I was born, my cleric mother had a vision. Based on that vision, she named 
  me Triptych, for the 3-part paintings that adorned the altar of her dark god. 
  Then she deserted me on the doorstep of one of the Spurned - the Forsaken Ones 
  who have chosen not to follow the path of evil that most of my race embraces. 
</p>
<p>What was this vision, you ask, that caused my own flesh and blood to turn her 
  back on me? I was told that she saw that there would be many parts to me, but 
  that none of these parts would spur me to walk in the darkness, the hatred, 
  of Innoruuk. 
<p>Mayhaps if she had not been a high priestess of that dark god, she would have 
  rejoiced in my complexity, my difference, but instead, she rejected me. 
<p>Many see nothing but my surface faces. They see me as female, and assume I 
  am weak. They see me as a dark elf, and assume I am evil. They see me as an 
  enchantress, and assume I am bookish. I am not weak, I am not evil, and I am 
  far more earthy than most can imagine. 
<p>Still, however, most races fear me, if they do not downright hate me. Spurned 
  by my own kind, I wander the lands of light, seeking a place in which to belong. 
  I have found that place among the Voidrunners. Mayhaps they do not fully understand 
  me, but they at least accept that I may have some honor, some value. ... It 
  is sufficient for now.

  was not quite the whole truth, see <a href="../stories/family.html%20">&quot;Family
