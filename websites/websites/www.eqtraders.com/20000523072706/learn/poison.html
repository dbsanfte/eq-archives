<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><I><font size="-1">(When this was 
  written, the patch containing poison for the rogues was only two days old. Since 
  then, there have been no new submissions for this section. I'm still hoping 
  some rogue out there will submit an article soon.)</font></I></font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> In order to make poison 
  you need a mortar/pestle, a poison sac, suspension, and a vial. Different sacs 
  create different poison. Vials are not sold, and only pottery experts can make. 
  This aspect doesn't seem to be fully implemented yet, and I will update you 
  when I can, as well as the different poisons that can be made. </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The the book, mortar/pestle, 
  and suspension are found in West Karanas on a vendor called Gindlin Toxfodder. 
  I have also hear of a dwarf vendor on the island in Dagnor's Cauldron, but have 
  not confirmed this. </font>
