<span class="headers">Xanthe`s Earring of Nature/PoTC Quest</span>
<p>
<p>
This is an outline of the two versions of the quest for the Protection of the Cabbage spell (NO DROP, level 59, single-target Protection of the Grove spell for druids.) The original version of this quest, which relies very heavily on tradeskills, results in a copy of the spell and a no drop earring. The second version (also linked in below), results in only the spell. The earring reward is:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
<b><a href="/items/show_item.php?item=1111&menustr=">xanthe's earring of nature</a></b><br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />
Slot: EAR<br />
AC: 5<br />
STR: +8 &nbsp;&nbsp;STA: +8 &nbsp;&nbsp;WIS: +10 &nbsp;&nbsp;HP: +55 &nbsp;&nbsp;MANA: +55 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
SV FIRE: +7 &nbsp;&nbsp;SV COLD: +7 &nbsp;&nbsp;SV MAGIC: +7 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Effect: Circle of combines (Must Equip. Casting Time:24.0)<br />
WT: 0.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Size: TINY<br />
Class: DRU <br />
Race: ALL<br />

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you have completed this quest and are not a druid, fear not! You can hand this earring back to Rebecca Cabbageleaf for:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a href="/items/show_item.php?item=1770&menustr=">earring of the solstice</a></b><br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />
Slot: EAR<br />
AC: 5<br />
STA: +5 &nbsp;&nbsp;WIS: +8 &nbsp;&nbsp;INT: +8 &nbsp;&nbsp;HP: +55 &nbsp;&nbsp;MANA: +55 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
SV FIRE: +5 &nbsp;&nbsp;SV COLD: +5 &nbsp;&nbsp;SV MAGIC: +5 &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Recommended level of 51<br />
Effect: flowing thought I (worn)<br />
WT: 0.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;Size: TINY<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />

</p>
</blockquote>

<i>(Yes, druids can do this quest twice, first trading in their Xanthe's Earring of Nature for the Earring of the Solstice, <b>then</b> completing the quest a second time for the Xanthe's Earring of Nature. Remember to trade the Xanthe's earring in before attempting the second quest combine, due to the lore flag)</i>
</p>
<h3>Some basic background:</h3>
<p>
On May 8, 2002, during the massive tradeskill patch, nine Liber Brassica Felix books were introduced throughout the lands, each written in a different language. They outlined various "gifts" from the three druid races, and gave hints as to the proper combination of them. The folks here at EQTC and the druids from the Druid's Grove did <i>much</i> pooling of knowledge to solve this <i>extremely</i> tradeskill-intensive quest. It was the first cross-server quest of it's kind, and once it was completed, the folks at VI stated that there would become an easier path to obtaining the spell. They also stated that the quest would stay in place for those who wished to strive and obtain the extra reward. (The first person to complete the quest it was the lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf on Bertoxxulous, which explains the new name for the earring.) At that time, the reward was the spell, and a lovely little ALL/ALL no drop earring.
</p>
<p>
On June 5, 2002 during another patch, the tenth Liber Brassica Felix book was found, and the old Earring of the Solstice magically changed into Xanthe's Earring of Nature in inventories throughout the lands. While greeted with some excitement, there was also much consternation by the non-druids in the community who suddenly found their all/all earring turn into something druid-only. Fortunately, VI took pity on all the frenzied tradeskillers who had spent the time and money to obtain the rather lovely earring, and announced partway through the day that Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungus Grove would be glad to accept trade-ins on earrings for something more suitable. (She could also be used to recharge earrings that were mistakenly out of charges, apparently by handing in the Xanthe's earring, then returning the Earring of the Solstice to her.)
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Please note that ALL of the "gifts" (and all the items that go into them) outlined in the links below are tradeable, so you can (and likely should) enlist the aid of grandmaster tradeskillers on your server for the items that are beyond your abilities.</b></i>
