<p>
With the launch of LoY, spell research combines began to be used for other tradeskill combines (tailoring). While I had always resisted tracking spell research on the site, due in part to various caster sites already containing the information, and in part from way too much on my plate already, I've decided to bend a little on this one. I will be tracking <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g83&menustr=080105000000">new spell research combines</a> that came out with the LoY expansion, and only those combines. For those of you doing the happy-dance over this news, make sure to <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4456">stop by the boards and thank Earenhylle Erlkoenig</a> for compiling a master-list of the new spell combines. ;)</font> </p>

<p><span class="headers">February 26, 2003 - Patch Update</span>
<p>
Some new bugs were fixed today, more are slated for the next patch. The bazaar bug that was giving folks an error message when they tried to buy stacks of items from player-vendors appears to be fixed. I believe the cast time on the charged spirit shift potion has also been fixed. Scheduled for the next patch is the fix to the collapsible bearskin potion bag and the collapsible medicine bag, which currently are only working for the new LoY alchemy. Also in the works for the next patch is the fix so that the 5-dose version of some of the LoY potions works properly 

We've made good progress on narrowing down trivials on the new recipes, and it's been a pretty productive week already. Now, if I could just beat my bank space into submission and magically juggle all the trade supplies onto 3 mules across the 2 accounts without having to character hop a gazillion times ... </p>

      <p>While others might wax enthusiastic about frogloks as a playable race,
      new things to see, new mobs to kill, I suspect that the majority of

      swear, even my mules have mules right now!) Of course, that's not to say
      that we're not eagerly awaiting the other bells and whistles that are in
      this new expansion, but the bank space thing tends to overshadow the rest.</p>

<p>
<p>That's right, folks, less than a week until the Legacy of Ykesha expansion goes live. As usual, you can expect things to be crazed around here once the day hits, as folks are scrambling all over the place finding new recipes, new drops, and cackling gleefully over the expanded bank space. I'll definitely be joining in the cackling for glee, in between gibbering as I try to do 30 different things at once. I'll try to get things up here on the main site, with links from the front page to the new recipes, as quickly as possible so that folks don't feel the need to hit the boards every 2 minutes for updates. ;)
<p>I'm also going to try to squeeze in some time, somehow this week, to get
another chunk of the ever-growing database ready before I have to stop to put
all my attention back into the boards and the main site for the flood of LoY
information. Yes, we're still working on the database; yes, it's going to be
very large and very comprehensive; no, we have no release date yet, but I hope
to have it into beta before I go to the Fan Faire at the end of March ... I
hope. {crosses fingers, toes and eyes}</p>

<p><span class="headers">February 07, 2003 - Evening Update</span>
<p>
<p>The trolls that were lugging along the cultural forge from Grobb to Neriak have
finally arrived at their destination, complied with local fire codes, and set up
the troll forge in Neriak's Foreign Quarter. Meanwhile, the frogs are settling
in nicely, and have industriously replaced all the stationary tradeskill
containers that were damaged during their claiming of Grobb with ones that are
more suited to their more diminutive statures.
<p>I suspect there will still be some changes to be seen, as both groups settle
into their new homes, but this will hopefully settle down some of the more ...
feisty ... tradeskillers a bit. ;) <i>(translation: Primal Scream has gotten a
bit overheated lately. Settle down in there and remember your manners! Just
because you're having a bad week and are upset is no need to ignore the "no
personal attacks" rule, and many of you seem to have forgotten that a) this
is "just a game", and b) there are real people with real feelings and
opinions behind those other personas. If you're THAT steamed about something,
take several steps back AND self-censor yourselves before we get fed up enough
to start doing more bannings, or temporarily close that forum until folks
remember common courtesy.)</i>

<p>
<p>It seems there is no end of troubles for the troll race right now. Not only have
they been kicked out of Grobb, and been forced to go bother the dark elves, but
along the way, they forgot to some very important items. (Trolls aren't known to
be the smartest of creatures, after all!) Among the things forgotten is their
cultural forge, which seems to have been uprooted from their old home, but which
hasn't yet shown up anywhere else. I expect it's going to take time for the dust
to settle, so, for now, things like the trade supplies listings for Grobb ... or
<a href="http://eqtraders.com/sources/source_zone_page.php?article=g89&menustr=110000000000&sz=1054">Gukta</a> ... or whatever
it's called today, are NOT going to be up-to-date. I'll make some temporary
pages as the weekend progresses, but I expect there will still be a lot of
changes incoming before things finally settle down.

<p><span class="headers">February 06, 2003 - Another Patch</span>
<p>
<p>This is another day with a variety of things of interest to tradeskillers. As
usual, I'll add my commentary after each item:
<blockquote>
  <p>- Many Planar Recipes can now be used in collapsible containers. Some
  Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to the Planar
  Sewing Kit. Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was added to the
  collapsible tailoring kit. Skills changed were Baking, Sewing, Jewel Craft,
  and Fletching. <i>(Wheee! This is definitely a happy change for those packrats
  who have invested in collapsible containers. For those wondering, the only
  thing I can think of that specifically requires the PoK loom are parts for the
  planar armor quests</i><br>
  - Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon. <i>(Using clockwork armor as a
  base, these are <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=140&rsa=Tinkering&sub=armor&sb=item&menustr=080120040000">tinkered
  armors with some brewing and imbuing required</a>.)</i><br>
  - Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones. <i>(Spiritstones
  were changed from weight 20.0 to weight 0.1 to match the weights on the cleric
  faithstones. Additionally, ogre and troll shammies, please note that the
  Spiritstone of Innothule is now Spiritstone of the Banished, and it ports you
  to Nektulos, not Innothule. We expect to see the storyline explanation for
  this change "soon")</i><br>
  - Changed Collapsible Jeweler's Kit to 6 slots from 4. <i>(The planar
  jeweller's kit has 6 slots, so this is just fixing it to match)</i><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>- Fixed a bug that caused merchants to charge a little extra or less (1
  copper).<i> (We've long known that vendors do creative rounding when you're
  buying multiples of items. I suspect that this might fix that.)</i><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll likely have further updates to this later in the day, once I am more
caffeinated.

<p><span class="headers">February 04, 2003 - Woohoo (updated)</span>
<p>
<p>Today's patch has many lovely little tidbits for tradeskillers, especially
shaman alchemists. My comments are in italics after the various items:
<blockquote>
  <p>- Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver
  Portal. - <i>recipe has been found, and is <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=31&rsa=Alchemy&sb=item&sub=potion&menustr=080010010000">up
  on the site</a></i><br>
  - Renamed one of two items called Figwort. The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has
  been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion. - <i>the Gulon's Impunity
  alchemy potion will now use ground figwort</i><br>
  - Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk. The Drachling Silk that was
  once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk. - <i>these are two
  Kunark forages that have been annoying due to having the same name. They're
  currently still only vendor-fodder, but at least they have unique names!</i><br>
  - Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes. These great
  beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed. - <i>this
  should allow shammies to now make the Assailing alchemy potion</i><br>
  - Fixed the recipe for the potion "Soul of Incorporeal" to use a
  "feather". <i>- finally, a use for foraged feathers!!</i><br>
  - Fixed the recipe for the potion "Troll's Essence". <i>- it's been
  broken forever, but this old alchemy potions should actually work!</i><br>
  - Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with
  their single dose versions - <i>several of the potions listed as "Luclin
  potions" on our alchemy recipes page had a cast time of 30.0 for the
  charged versions, but lower cast times for the singles. The charged versions
  should now have the lesser cast times of their single-dose kin</i><br>
  - General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a
  problem crossing in the past. - <i>8th shawl questers, rejoice! If the silly
  little General can remember his new route, he should no longer get stuck under
  the ice floes and lose his way!</i><br>
  - Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak,
  Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable. - <i>erudite tailors,
  wood elven fletchers, folks making blessed fishing poles and others should be
  happy with this. If folks can post verification of these, I'll update the
  database accordingly</i><br>
  - Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable. -<i> tinkers rejoice!
  Since this little item is not only used in a quest, but in two other recipes,
  it's been impossible for younger gnomes to get access to this.</i><br>
  - Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents. <i>-
  potions that don't use reagents are happy things!</i><br>
  - Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability. - <i><a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7484&menustr=035000000000">Grandmaster's
  Medicine Bag</a> has been made! Many thanks to Frizznik for convincing Jolum
  to give up information that he's temporarily forgotten - Thursday's patch
  should see the hail text in place on the live servers, as well as the ammo
  slot added to the trophy itself.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With so many of these changes being related to alchemy, it would likely be
good to dive into the old Letters of Jonas alchemy books, and see how they have
been changed/updated to reflect this information. My many thanks to Verdandi for
putting together a "laundry list" of things outright broken/bugged
with alchemy, as it looks like it's helped pinpoint, and address, several
outstanding problems. <i>(My thanks also go to the folks who put in these fixes
as it's a good step in the right direction at addressing several nigglies).</i>

<p><span class="headers">January 24, 2003 - Feeling crabby!</span>
<p>
<p>I have good news and bad news, and it's a very crabby day.
<p>On the good news front, those industrious tinkers over at <a href="http://www.tinkering.org">Tinkering.org</a>
have found the recipe for a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6490&menustr=035000000000">crab
cracker</a>, which is required for one of the currently-unsolved <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=149&rsa=Baking&sub=pop&sb=item&menustr=080020060000">PoP
baking recipes</a>.
<p>On the bad news front, the message boards are also feeling a bit crabby, and
are NOT behaving, in the least. The fix that was put in place yesterday morning
did not fix the problem, and we're still crossing our fingers that someone over
at the phpBB support forums will have some insights into exactly what's going
awry. I suspect I'll have several more grey hairs interspersed with the red
before all this is sorted out, and I know it's frustrating for our very active
message board community as well. The problems last week with the boards turned
out to be due to some other site running on the same machine as our message
boards, but this time it's something awry with our software or the message board
databse. ... bleargh!!

<p>I'd like to apologize for all the problems folks are seeing with the message
boards recently. We're <i><b>still</b></i> trying to find out if it is a problem
with the software (I doubt many have tested phpBB under the massive load we
present it with), or if it's a problem with the server software or the new
hardware. (The boards were very recently moved to yet another machine.) I'm more
than ready to pull my hair out over it, and I'm sure some of you are as well. As
we find out more, we'll keep you posted, and we're trying to work on getting
some <i>stable</i> boards for folks to use.

<p>As usual, it will take a while to see how much impact this patch has on the
tradeskill community.The only tradeskill-related item that was noted in this
patch was a change in the effects on some of the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q138&menustr=120055000000#plateornate">quested
planar armor pieces</a>. I'll likely have more updates to this later today.

<p><span class="headers">January 01, 2003 - Hoppy Gnu Ears!</span>
<p>
<p>Well, for some of you, New Year's Day is over, and for others of us, it's got
another 3 hours to go before it is over and done. Regardless of where you are,
best wishes from my household for a safe and Happy New Year! As a belated
holiday gift, I offer up a new recipe page upon the site, thanks in large part
to the recipe contributions from our community, and the compilation efforts of
Tebyen Trueheart. We're pleased to introduce a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g100">real
life recipes page</a>, with some of our favorite meals, munchies, raiding
supplies, and so forth. Bon appetit!
<p>Addendum: Information on <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q24&menustr=120055000000">the
Zek-bane weapon quest</a> is now available!

<blockquote>
  <p>Twas the night of Christmas, and all through the house,<br>
  many creatures were stirring, even the (catnip) mouse!<br>
  The database gnomes were taking a nap,<br>
  but a site elf seems to have stolen Mum's (thinking) cap!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... All right, so it doesn't scan well, but at least it is some
acknowledgement that the holiday season is in full swing. Whether your main
holiday was over days ago, or if that day of days is just finishing ... whether
you celebrate New Year's in a week, or whether your new year follows a Chinese
calendar, you're likely around a lot of folks that are celebrating <i>something</i>
right now. So, I have to be properly mom-ish right now, and say a few things:
<ul>
  <li>May your holiday season be a safe and joyous one. Regardless of the
    stresses of everyday life, remember to take time now and then to savor the
    company of those around you.
  <li>Remember there are real people behind those characters you run into
    in-game. Just because the game isn't "real life", don't forget
    that the people behind those players are very real, and your in-game actions
    have the chance to hurt, or help, other people.
  <li>Remember that practicing real-life alcohol tolerance and driving don't
    mix. Remember that others may/will forget this fact, and be extra careful
    when traveling. Generally, those irresponsible in their partying seem more
    likely to hurt innocents than they are to hurt themselves.
  <li>Remember, there is no "rez plz" in real life.
  <li>Remember to take time out to just plain have fun now and then. It helps
    you keep perspective.
  <li>Remember that random acts of kindness <i>DO</i> come back to surprise you
    now and then; so, whether in-game or out, surprising someone "just
    because" with a kind word, an ambush buffing, etc. really <i>does</i>
    make an impact, even if you don't see the direct result of it.
  <li>Remember that compliments cost nothing, and that criticism can do more
    damage than expected. So when your group actually manages to survive when
    something goes badly wrong, throwing in comments about what was done <i>right</i>
    can help ease the blow of the inevitable commentary about what was done
    wrong. This, of course, applies to the real world as well, but after having
    someone in a pick up group last night actually making an effort to praise
    stellar crowd control, it rememinded me that too often we're silent when
    things go right, and very noisy when things go wrong.
  <li>Remember to pamper yourself now and then. If <i>you</i> can't expend the
    effort to spoil yourself, why should you expect that anyone else will
    either?
  <li>Remember that laughter cures much. Tickle those corpses back to life,
    don't just click 'em! ;)</li>
</ul>

stats from the player-made <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=130&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=pchain&menustr=080100160000">Chain Smithed</a>, <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=131&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=pplate&menustr=080100180000">Plate Smithed</a>

armor that was changed last week, I expect it will take time for us to be given
the new information and get it onto the site as well.
<p>There also seems to be a DNS problem right now for reaching the message
boards. We just got home to find the problem, and we're still trying to figure
out where the problem lies, since the boards themselves are up. For those of you
who are true message board addicts, you can try using <a href="http://mboards.racknine.net/phpBB2/">http://mboards.racknine.net/phpBB2/</a>
in order to reach the message boards. <i>However, be aware that your cookies may

<p>
<p>As usual, it will take a bit before we're positive what impact the patch will
have on tradeskillers. It is also going to take a while before it all makes it
onto the site. So far, what's been confirmed:
<ul>
  <li>negative stats on some of the alchemy potions have been removed. More
    details should go up on the alchemy recipes page later today, after we can
    go through the list and double-check them
  <li>gnomish fireworks have had their particle effects changed. The folks over
    at <a href="http://www.tinkering.org">http://www.tinkering.org</a> have
    screen shots
  <li>the level restriction on <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6302">anizok's
    gauze press</a> has been removed
  <li>the mana costs on the various enchanter-made mana vials have been cut in
    half. The FAQ on the boards has been changed to list the new mana costs
  <li>At least a couple of the PoP tradeskill armor sets (<a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=130&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=pchain&menustr=080100160000">PoP Chain Smithed</a>, <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=131&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=pplate&menustr=080100180000">PoP Plate Smithed</a>
    and <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=137&rsa=Tailoring&sb=item&sub=plthr&menustr=080110160000">PoP Tailored Leather</a>, <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=138&rsa=Tailoring&sb=item&sub=pslk&menustr=080110180000">PoP Tailored Silk</a>)
    have undergone a flipflop from INT to WIS and WIS to INT to better suit the
    classes that can wear the armor. It will take time to confirm that the
    changes were done across the board, as we hunt down folks that own pieces of
    these armor sets. As we receive updates, the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q138&menustr=120055000000#plateornate">PoP
    armor stats page</a> will be updated.
  <li>trivials on <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=140&rsa=Tinkering&sub=armor&sb=item&menustr=080120040000">clockwork
    watchman armor</a> changed. It will take a while before we're able to narrow
    down the new trivials, but the trivials have been lowered
  <li>I've been told that trivials on some of the fishing lures have changed,
    but as yet, I have no details</li>
</ul>
<p>Random updates to this list will continue throughout the day, as I hear back
from various folks regarding stat changes, etc.

<p>
<p>Whee. It seems like the code tweak needed so that phpbb properly tracks what
you've really read, and what you haven't read, was never stress tested with the
sort of load that we see on a regular basis, nor for the sheer number of boards
that we have. So, yes, things are beyond sludged right now, and I apologize for
that. We have a couple options from this point, and we'll be looking at those
alternatives carefully over the next day or two. One alternative would be to
back out the tweak that uses the proper "read" indexing, and go back
to it using your last visited timestamp to determine what you may/may not have
read. I don't really like that alternative, personally, as I like to process
posts from the boards in manageable chunks. The second alternative is to get rid
of the Marketplace forums. This would <i>more</i> than halve the hits to the
database as the main forum listing was generated, given the sheer number of
servers there are these days. I really don't like that one, either, but it may
be something we need to consider. Another alternative, which opens up issues
with seeing if one registered user list can be shared between two separate
message boards, is to make the Marketplace a separate message board.
<p>We'll let you know what we manage to work out so that we're back to the very
fast new boards once again

<p>Some days, I just can't win.I posted here this morning in between errands
regarding the message boards spazzing out, and the moment I posted the message
and left for another 4 hours of nearly-fruitless running errands, etc., they
started working again. Anyway, nothing to see here, move along now.

<p>
<p>Last night's patch fixed the issue with Froststone faction. Those who kill
those foul snow orcs should now be properly rewarded with a more positive
welcome from the Froststone dwarves in Crystal Caverns.
<p>I'm also busy right now changing message board links all over the place to
point to the new boards. <i>(I'll drop a post in the new boards with the URL for
the old boards, if you want to recover information from there, but I'm starting
to turn off posting rights to the various old forums, as folks are still adding
fresh posts in the Marketplace, etc.)</i> Please <b>DO</b> let me know if you
find message board links from the main site not working properly later today.

<p><span class="headers">December 04, 2002 - Patch Day, and more about the boards</span>
<p>
<p>Today has been a "quiet" day with respect to tradeskills and the
patch. There are a couple things to mention, however. A couple (or more, we're
still waiting on reports regarding the others) of the PoP pottery items have had
a recommended level flag added to them, as well as the addition of being
range-wieldable (woohoo!) There also may be an issue with faction in Crystal
Caverns. Those cantankerous dwarves in there can't seem to make up their minds,
and while they REALLY dislike all those annoying orcs in "their"
caverns, killing the orcs themselves now results in <i>negative</i> faction with
the Froststone dwarves. I suspect this will be fixed relatively quickly.
<p>We would like to thank everyone for your patience and tremendous support as
we made the switch to the new message boards. It's still going to be a bit
awkward until the dust settles some more and we can get past the glaring issues
to fine tune the less critical settings (in between keeping up with the flow of
new information for the site!) Your patience and continued cooperation are much
appreciated! In the end, all the effort should be well worth being able to host
the community far more economically.
<p>That said, we would like to offer our thanks to the folks at EZBoards for
their hosting of our message board community for close to three years. While the
time has come for us to move on, EZBoards were the home where our community grew
and thrived, up to this point. They still have much to offer communities that
may not have the time, interest, or technical know-how to create and host their
own boards. <i>(As well as for those communities, such as my server's boards,
where folks seem more willing to put up with popups than they are to contribute
cash to support the boards.)</i> We hope that the Everquest community does not
see our change of venue as an indication that we are in any way dissatisfied
with the quality of their services - we'd just rather spend more of our own time
and effort, and less of our cash! Thank you and fond farewells, Vanchau and
crew!

<p><span class="headers">December 03, 2002 - Message Boards and More</span>
<p>
<p>With the chaos that has abounded IRL due to PoP launch, the Fan Faire, the
grand opening of the House Ogre's comics and gaming shop (last Friday!), my
strep throat and whiplash, I've delayed on this annoucement until the last
minute, as I needed some breathing time before doing final tweaks to the [<a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/index.php">new
message board</a>]. You ask, 'What new message board?'
<p>Many of you likely remember us mentioning our desire to explore other message
board options, after we saw how much renewal for our EZBoard Gold membership was
going to cost. We had a lot of folks approach us with different alternatives,
including the folks at Mazevo, and the EZBoard folks also worked hard to come up
with a more viable option for us. Fortunately, we had enough in the Community
Chest to extend the board Gold status to cover the PoP launch chaos, but that
extension is about to expire. After a lot of deliberation and price comparisons,
and our very strong desire to keep the boards and site as ad free as possible,
we've decided to host the boards with our site hosting provider, and run phpBB.
While it <i>does</i> mean a lot of chaos for the next little while, as folks get
their registrations set up, etc., if board traffic stays relatively stable, it
will cost us about 25% of what our Gold renewal would cost. I suspect that the
actual numbers may be closer to 50% if the current growth curve continues, but
it's still a hefty amount of money.
<p>I fully realize this means everyone needs to register for yet another message
board, and re-do your preferences for sigs, etc. It will also mean that custom
posting titles will be pretty much MIA for the time being, and that those of you
who earned titles due to post count tallies may not be happy about having to
re-earn titles all over again. Much as I am sorry for the extra chaos this
causes for everyone, better that chaos than a) ads all over the place, or b) me
deciding this is costing too much time and money and throwing in the towel.
(Really, I don't want to do 'b'. I very much don't want to do that, and I've
turned down some very blunt cash offers for the site ownership recently. I will
not do that to this community ... but I am <i>very</i> burnt out IRL, and I'm
very much dreading the hubub that's going to hit once I publish this front page
update ...) Bleargh.
<p>Anywayyyy ... I'm leaving the old boards up for now, but nudging you all to <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/index.php">use
the new boards</a>. I'll leave the old links in place for a bit longer, so folks
can copy over any needed information from server forums, etc. into the new ones.
In another week (or less if it gets too crazed handling both sets of boards),
I'll block posting to the old boards, but leave them up for reference purposes.
