              and Ad-free!!</h3>
            <p>There are many expenses that come with running this site, and as 
              the popularity of EQTC grows, so do the costs. It is no longer feasible 
              for us to pay for the costs by ourselves, so we're asking for the 
              help of those in the community who are able to contribute. <i>(FYI: 
              All of the first two years, including domain name registrations, 
              EZBoard fees, software and hardware costs were covered by the DenMother 
              and House Ogre. Since December 2001, we've accepted donations, but 
              they do not cover the growing costs of running this site.)</i> New 
              expenses are fast approaching, including monthly fees for hosting 
              via the site where the database is currently being developed, and 
              an unprecedented $1900+ in order to make the message boards ad-free 
              for another 6 months (up from $700+ for the current 6-month renewal 
              that expires in October.) While we're thrilled that the site has 
              become so popular, the surge in traffic is really starting to cost 
              money. (Not to mention a solid 60-80 hours a week of combined time 
              from the DenMother and the House Ogre while the database is being 
              built/developed.)</p>
            <p>We really <i><b>DO</b></i> want to keep the boards ad-free, and 
              continue to develop the tradeskill database that will make recipe 
              and supply hunting much easier, but we cannot do it without the 
              support of the community.</p>
            <p>Currently, we have only the one method for donating to the site, 
              though we may work out a second alternative for those of you who 
              have problems with Paypal accounts for any reason:</p>
            <p><b>Paypal</b> - donations go directly to the DemMother to help 
              cover the new hosting costs, message board costs, software/hardware 
              expenses, etc. If there's any left over (there usually isn't), it 
              will go to cover things like asprin, energy drinks, chocolate, and 
              hair color to hide the grey hairs that the site has caused ... consider 
              it her &quot;pay&quot; for the amount of work put into this site.
