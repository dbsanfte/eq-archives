      <P> 

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dead was dead. Sort 

        of. But not always. Not even all that often, come to think of it.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Niami Denmother tried 

        to gather her scattered thoughts as she stared at the green latticework 

        above her, squinting until it finally resolved into a tree at the top 

        of the ramp leading to Highpass Hold.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Piffle. That last 

        giant skeleton had proven too much for her, and her spirit had &quot;temporarily 

        dissassociated itself from her body.&quot; Hogwash. She'd died, plain 

        and simple. But the gods had seen fit, once again, to let her try to learn 

        from her mistakes.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a weary sigh, 

        her bare feet flapping against the hard-packed trail, Niami began the 

        long scamper back to her body, pondering death and life in Norrath.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Not everyone who 

        died came back to life. Sometimes souls were unable, or unwilling, to 

        return to the mortal shell from which they'd been evicted. While this 

        may have been a good thing with respect to population control, there were 

        an awful lot of souls running around out there nekkid as they day they 

        were born, scrambling to reunite with all their mortal baggage. Herself 

        included, it would seem.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Clerics who found 

        enough favor with their gods could intercede on the soul's behalf, shortening 

        the trip back to the corpse, as well as blunting some of the painful lessons 

        meted out by the gods upon the person's death. Niami had giggled when 

        she'd overheard a cleric of Rodcet Nife pontificating once upon the fact 

        that &quot;clerics should approach a revive with the proper dignity and 

        reverence that befits a representative of one's god.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now, with a long 

        run ahead of her, she thought more deeply on how one such as herself should 

        approach such an event. And as she scampered through the Karanas, her 

        cackles of glee could be heard rolling across the plains as she struck 

        upon the perfect idea.</font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <hr align=center width=380 color=#007D7D>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">About a week later, 

        she finally felt she'd exacted sufficient revenge upon the giant skeletons 

        who'd sent her soul precipitously fleeing from her body. Since it had 

        taken 3 at once to bring her down, she retaliated by turning 30 of them 

        into tiny piles of dust and fragmented bone chips. She'd just found a 

        quiet corner in which to rest when she heard an anguished scream, then 

        a barbed bone monk's cackle of victory. Scampering forward, she whacked 

        it on the kneecaps a few times to trim it down to size, then called down 

        some holy wrath upon it. That task complete, she turned her attention 

        to the still-warm corpse of a young barbarian warrior. &quot;Och! Puir 

        lad.&quot; A quick check with the Voidservants found that the fellow's 

        soul was in Halas, while his corpse was down here in the mountains of 

        Rathe.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Puir lad indeed. 

        That be a long run, e'en wi' such long legs. I wish I could shorten th' 

        trip for him.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;But you can, 

        little one.&quot; She heard the familiar hearty laughter in her head, 

        then silence.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Och! Bristlebane! 

        Do nae do that tae a wee lass! Ye fain startled me oot o' me new boots!&quot; 

        She shook her finger at empty air a moment, then paused. &quot;I can?&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Only silence answered 

        her.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Proper dignity 

        an' reverence me toes! Let's see how ye like this one, oh mischevious 

        creator o' wee halflings!&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She pulled a griffon 

        feather from her backpack as she circled thoughtfully around the corpse, 

        eyeing it from several angles. She muttered to herself as she pondered, 

        &quot;Other clerics get rules an' guidelines. What do I get? Brief messages 

        that gi' me nae clue as how tae start, but startle me silly. Now, how 

        shall I ... ? O' course! Th' kneecaps. Must be th' kneecaps frae this 

        first one.&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a cackle, she 
        dove for the kneecaps, wielding her griffon feather to devastating effect. 
        She drew upon her impressive will, and threw it through the feather and 
        into the body. &quot;In th' name o' Bristlebane, god o' Mischief, get 
        yuirself up an' laughing again.&quot; She continued to tickle a few more 
        moments, brown eyes watching carefully for signs of life. Mystical energies 
        had been released, she could feel them all about her, and a corresponding 
        drain on her resources, but nothing was happening. Determinedly, she pulled 
        off a boot, ignoring the ripe odor, dragging her feather along the arch 
        of his bare foot. &quot;Come on, lad, get up, afore I have tae tickle 
        ye some more!&quot; </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Suddenly, the foot, 

        and the attached leg, was pulled out of her reach as the former corpse 

        drew up into a fetal position, laughing. &quot;No! Ha ha. No more. Hee 

        hee. Please! Stop. Oooohhh!&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With a tired giggle, 
        Niami plopped to the ground beside the fellow. &quot;Ye hae jus' been 
        tickled back tae life by a priestess o' Mischief. Go forth an' laugh some 
        more. ... An' please ... air out those boots o' yuirs!&quot;</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Grinning, she accepted 

        his thanks, even while she was mentally planning new things to try on 

        her next tickle-revive, ... and adding a mental note to never remove a 

        warrior's boots again unless the situation was dire. </font> </p>
