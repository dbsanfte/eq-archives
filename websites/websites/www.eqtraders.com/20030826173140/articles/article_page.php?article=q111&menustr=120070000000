<span class="headers">Qeynos Karana Paladin (Rainkeeper) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, PAL/HUM, HEF and allow the young human paladin to gain a small amount of smithing skill. Armor has a green plate graphic when worn.</i> <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
This quest originates with Miltiades Tal`Azroth in Qeynos. More details will be added as they become available.
</p>
<p>
Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'Greetings and salutations Greyjoy, I am Miltiades Tal`Azroth Crusader of Karana. I have spent all of my years here in Qeynos and gathered infinite knowledge from my teachers on my path to enlightenment. I have also started training new recruits to help them find their calling as a Holy Warrior of Karana. If you are a [Paladin of Karana] I might have some tasks for you to complete.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am a Paladin of Karana.'
</p>
<p>
Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'That is excellent news Greyjoy, As a Knight in training of Karana I would like to offer you a series of [tests] what will test your devotion to yourself and your god.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What tests?'
</p>
<p>
Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'I have put together a series of tests that will enable our new recruits to create their own armor. You will use a Rainkeepers Assembly Kit to combine assorted items that you will collect from both the hunting areas surround Qeynos and the city itself. Combining these magical items in your kit will create a material that you will place in a forge along with molds that I will present to you to create your armor. Are you ready to start [fashioning your materials]?'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am ready to start fashioning my materials.'
</p>
<p>
Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'Excellent Greyjoy, Please take this Rainkeepers Assembly Kit. Now for your materials you will fashion you will obviously need to know what items are used for what armor materials. Simply tell me what armor piece you [want] to create and I will present you with the recipe for that specific armor material. I can present you with the molds and recipes necessary for creating Rainkeeper [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].'

<p>
You say, 'What final favor?'
</p>
<p>
Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'In the past I have sent some of my finest messengers to Qeynos Hills to deliver messages to the Sayers about current events in Qeynos. However the last few I have sent did not return so I began to look into what might have happened when I received word that the Bloodsabers had claimed responsibility for the slayings. I must ask that you bring me the head of a certain Bloodsaber who I think is [responsible] for the slayings.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Who is responsible?'
</p>
<p>
Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'I have reason to believe that Tovax Vmar is behind this, a dreaded necromancer that has been known to prowl the hills. Having Tovax dead will surely send a message to the Bloodsabers to tread lightly for their days are numbered. If you are able to find Tovax return to me his necklace along with 2 Enchanted Wisp Globes and I will reward you with a weapon suitable for a true knight of Karana.'
