            <h3>Pine Scout Armor - Surefall Youngling Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is a new armor quests for young rangers that originates 
              in Surefall Glade. All pieces of this set should be lore (other 
              than the bracer), no drop, and HUM, HEF/RNG only. Armor has a green 
              leather graphic when worn.</i></p>
            <p>Speak with Errin Pinewhisper in the Ranger guild hall. She will 
              give you a no drop curing box in which to make the items, and will 
              give you the appropriate patterns upon request. All pieces use ruined 
              gnoll chain as a base, a tattered armor pattern (given) and curing 
              box.</p>

            <p>Errin Pinewhisper says 'Welcome to Surefall Glade friend. I am 
              Errin Pinewhisper, Ranger of Karana the Storm Lord. You will find 
              worshipers of both Karana and Tunare residing here in harmony. I 
              train young rangers of both faiths and assist them in getting prepared 
              for work in the often dangerous lands beyond the glade. If you are 
              in need of a [sturdy outfit] suitable for work as a young ranger 
              then I will gladly instruct you on the means to obtain one.' </p>
