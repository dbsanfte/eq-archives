            <h3> Akanon Evil Warrior Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <p>This is one of many youngling armor quests based out of Ak'Anon. 
              It is specifically for gnome warriors that worship Bertoxx. <i>Please 
              note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often 
              are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i> 
            <p> 
            <p>Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests 
              - you get a parchment from the quest giver (Naygog Mitope ) which 
              you have to give to a secondary NPC (Windlebeck Tobokog), who will 
              then give you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit, exactly the same one as 
              the evil rogue, cleric and shadowknight kits I think, and LORE so 
              you can't get one of each). Windlebeck will then tell you the recipe 
              for each item and give you a mold (Crude [xxx] Mold) when prompted. 
              These molds appear to be exactly the same items as the evil cleric/shadowknight 
              Crude [xxx] Molds (i.e. they're interchangeable). The primary quest 
              giver gives out the class-specific weapon quest. 
            <p>Your Location is 2109.61, -505.88, -182.06, in Ak'Anon<br>
              You say, 'Hail, Naygog Mitope'<br>
              Naygog Mitope says 'Hail Genumkin. I train those young gnomes who 
              wish to [serve as a warrior] in the service of the Dark Reflection 
              and our patron, Bertoxxulous the Plaguelord. Decay and destruction 
              are powerful forces that influence Norrath. It is the duty of the 
              Warriors of the Dark Reflection to bring destruction to the weak 
              and injury to the strong so that our fellow gnomes may be reminded 
              of their own mortality and new strong individuals may rise to power 
              before Bertoxxulous decides it is their time to decay and be replaced 
              like countless before them.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i serve as a warrior'<br>
              Naygog Mitope says 'Ours is the duty of a martyr, to be the hated 
              and feared hand of destruction and catalyst of change. All roads 
              are paved with destruction and in turn are eventually destroyed. 
              All machines are built from the rubble of broken mountains and in 
              turn become rust and bits of metal. You must outfit yourself with 
              the tools of a warrior, crafted from the destruction of archaic 
              clockworks that have long since finished serving the purpose for 
              which they were built. Take this parchment to Windlebeck Tobokog, 
              he will assist you in the construction of a suit of armor. When 
              you have been properly outfitted return to me for [further instruction].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what further instruction?'<br>
              Naygog Mitope says 'It is one thing to destroy the artificial life 
              of a clockwork. It is another thing entirely to claim the life of 
              another gnome. There is a member of the Dark Reflection, Yulcabis, 
              who has been assigned to a task in the Steamfont Mountains. He has 
              failed repeatedly in the tasks assigned to him in the past and has 
              become a burden to the Dark Reflection. Find Yulcabis and slay him. 
              Return to me with the weapon he carries.'</p>
            <p>Windlebeck Tobokog is found with Mimtia Zethkog, Rebbie Romblerum 
              and Glerbella Gibblix, in the tunnels at 2159.36, -592.41, -182.06. 
              You give him the parchment...</p>
            <p>Windlebeck Tobokog says 'Hail Genumkin! You must be one of Naygog's 
              new soldiers. Naygog has asked me to help get you outfitted in a 
              suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our foes. I have 
              assembled a kit for you that will allow you to construct the armor 
              pieces once you have gathered the necessary components. The required 
              components vary according to which piece of Plague Warrior Armor 
              you are planning on assembling. Do you wish to craft a [plague warrior 
              helm], a [plague warrior bracer], [plague warrior gauntlets], [plague 
              warrior boots], [plague warrior vambraces], [plague warrior greaves], 
              or a [plague warrior breastplate].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to craft a plague warrior helm'<br>
              Windlebeck Tobokog says 'To assemble a Plague Warrior Helm you will 
              need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge 
              with a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine 
              the Crude Bronze Helm with a Ruined Coyote Pelt and two Rebel Clockwork 
              Eye Lenses in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</p>
