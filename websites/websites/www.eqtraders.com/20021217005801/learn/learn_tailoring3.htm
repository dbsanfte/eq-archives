            <h3>Myrron's Beginner's Guide to Tailoring</h3>
            <p>Tailoring is perhaps one of the toughest trades to grandmaster, 
              easily taking months (if not years) of constant farming for supplies 
              and little resale value of any item until the higher-end. Since 
              October 16, 2002, the skill-up rate for tailoring was increased 
              slightly, now making it somewhat easier to raise your skill. This 
              guide suggests steps to a tailoring skill of 188, along with recommended 
              levels for each step so you can increase your tailoring skill as 
              you level up. It is assumed that you will likely farm most of the 
              materials needed, so the total cost is relatively low.<br>
            </p>
            <p>First things first: increase your stats! If you are a caster, raise 
              your intelligence/wisdom (whichever is your primary stat) as high 
              as you can before attempting to tailor. If you are a melee, pick 
              whichever of the two stats is easier for you to raise and get it 
              as high as you can. There was once a rumor that dexterity played 
              a role in gaining tailoring skill-ups, but as far as we know to 
              this date, the only stat that directly matters is the higher of 
              the wisdom/intelligence statistic. Recall that spells may also alter 
              stats, not just armor and weapons, so getting a few mind buffs will 
              certainly not hurt!<br>
            </p>
            <p>Why do you want to increase your stats? As your stat increases, 
              so does your chance of getting a skill-up in tailoring. This is 
              not to be confused with the actual creation of a new item. Whether 
              or not you succeed when trying to create a new item depends on your 
              tailoring skill level. If your tailoring skill is 25, you have the 
              exact same chance of creating a patchwork tunic whether your intelligence 
              is 120 or 180. However, with a 180 intelligence, you will be more 
              likely to improve your tailoring skill to 26. <br>
              Tailoring will also require you to become a blacksmith and a brewer, 
              unless you have a good friend who is willing to handle those areas 
              for you. Use the guides and message boards at www.eqtraders.com 
              in order to learn the best paths for getting these skills up. I 
              recommend mastering both; aim for a minimum skill of 120 in each. 
              The higher you are above the listed trivial, the more often you 
              will succeed. Pottery is another trade that may help you later when 
              you need poison vials, but poison vials can also be bought. If you 
              want, however, get your pottery skill to around 150 for a good success 
              rate on poison vials.<br>
              <i>(Begin Steps in Guide)</i><br>
            </p>
            <p>1. Create silk swatches (2 unstacked spider silks) and silk threads 
              (2 unstacked spiderling silks) until 15. Save these swatches and 
              threads, you will need them later.<br>
            </p>
            <p>2. Create patchwork armor (1 ruined wolf/cat/bear pelt + pattern) 
              until 26. Pick a cheap pattern to work with, most cost mere silver. 
              All pieces trivial at the exact same time, so you may get to 26 
              with any pattern. Recommended level: 1+<br>
            </p>
            <p>3. Create raw silk armor (1 silk swatch + pattern) until 36. Do 
              not choose to skill up on the tunic or the pants patterns; they 
              require 2 swatches. All other pieces require 1 swatch, and since 
              they all trivial at 36, why waste swatches? Recommended level: 1+<br>
              You now have a choice: Create studded leather armor, cured silk 
              armor, or woven mandrake. One route requires a decent smithing skill 
              (recommended 50+) while the other route requires a decent brewing 
              skill (recommended 70+). Both are discussed below. The third, the 
              woven mandrake, requires you to buy supplies from an alchemy store.<br>
            </p>
            <p>4. Many people choose to make studded leather armor next. Studded 
              leather armor requires a medium quality wolf/cat/bear/rockhopper 
              pelt, a pattern and varying amounts of metal studs (3 metal bits, 
              file, flask of water, smithing trivial of 35). If you pick this 
              route, make the studded leather mask until 56, as it is the only 
              piece that requires 1 metal stud. After 56, move on to cured silk 
              armor. Recommended level: 5+</p>
            <p>5. Create woven mandrake (2 unstacked mandrake roots) until 66. 
              Mandrake roots can be bought at various alchemists, including Shadow 
              Haven and the Plane of Knowledge. Recommended level: 5+<br>
            </p>
            <p>6. Other people move from raw silk armor directly into cured silk 
              armor. Cured silk masks, which is the piece you want to make since 
              it requires the least supplies, requires 1 silk swatch, 1 mask pattern, 
              and 1 heady kiola (2 kiola saps, 1 bottle, 1 flask of water, brewing 
              trivial 46). All cured silk armor pieces trivial at 82, so you can 
              just make masks until then. Recommended level: 5+<br>
              Myrron's Note: I chose to move from raw silk straight into cured 
              silk, and I am quite happy I did. Silks are fairly easy to come 
              by, whereas you need to fight animals a lot longer to find a decent 
              amount of medium quality or high quality pelts (which can be skinned 
              down to medium quality). Plus, I skinned down all medium quality 
              pelts I found into low quality to make leather padding (1 low quality 
              wolf/cat/bear/rockhopper pelt, 1 silk thread). Leather padding sells 
              for a very nice amount, as it is used for higher-end smithing. Leather 
              padding trivials at 31, but you get a much better success rate once 
              you are in the 50's. You can make a lot of money from leather padding, 
              so why waste the pelts when you can skill up on cured silk armor? 
              That was my rationale. I was not aware of the woven mandrake option 
              until my tailoring was above 66, so I know little about it.<br>
            </p>
            <p>7. Create handmade backpacks (1 high quality bear or rockhopper 
              pelt, 1 backpack pattern) until 88. Handmade backpacks traditionally 
              sell pretty well on most servers, so here you can make a tremendous 
              profit. While the price varies from server to server, buying HQ 
              bear or HQ rockhopper pelts and then selling the finished backpack 
              often yields you a very nice profit. Of course, you profit even 
              more if you farm the pelts yourself. Between leather padding and 
              backpacks, you can make a pretty decent living as a young tailor. 
              Recommended level: 10+<br>
            </p>
            <p>8. Create tailored quivers (1 high quality cat pelt, 1 quiver pattern) 
              until 115. The best source I have found for high quality cat pelts 
              is East Karana, where all the lions and lionesses seem to drop them 
              somewhat often. Because it is East Karana though, the recommended 
              level is now 18+. You can, of course, go elsewhere to farm for them 
              if you are still too low.<br>
              You now have another choice: crystalline silk armor or Wu's armor. 
              Crystalline silk armor requires lots of crystalline silks, which 
              drop off of fairly high-level spiders in the Crystal Caverns. Wu's 
              just requires our old friend, spider silk. For lower-level players, 
              I recommend moving right into Wu's, but for those of you who can 
              handle Crystal Caverns easily, I wanted to make you aware of your 
              options. I will move on to discuss Wu's armor as the next step in 
              the guide.<br>
            </p>
            <p>9. Create Wu's mantles (1 silk swatch, 1 shoulder pad pattern, 
              1 vial of viscous mana, 4 unstacked heady kiolas) until 144. A vial 
              of viscous mana requires a poison vial, one pearl, and a level 12+ 
              enchanter. If you are not an enchanter, you may need to find one 
              who can help you; the poison vial and pearl can be bought. (The 
              poison vial can also be made reliably with a pottery skill around 
              150+ if you are so inclined.) Wu's armor requires a lot of spider 
              silk and a lot of heady kiolas, so be prepared. Spider silk is best 
              found in East Karana since crag spiders have been known to drop 
              as many as eight silks at once. Because of this, East Karana is 
              also often crowded with several people all hunting crag spiders. 
              If you have track or a friend who can track, it would be in your 
              best interests to make use of this ability, and know the rules about 
              kill stealing. Recommended level: 25+<br>
            </p>
            <p>10. Create Wu's sleeves (2 unstacked swatches, 1 sleeve pattern, 
              1 vial of viscous mana, 4 unstacked heady kiolas) until 151. Create 
              Wu's tunics (3 unstacked swatches instead of 2) to 158. When you 
              get to the tunics, you will need to use a loom in a city, as the 
              recipe calls for 9 items and your large sewing kit has only 8 slots. 
              Recommended level: 25+<br>
              Congratulations! You've finished Wu's armor and no more kiolas! 
              Many people don't go onward too much farther from this point, as 
              supplies (if you choose to buy them) now get real expensive. However, 
              the upside to this is that many pieces you can make now sell for 
              a lot, so if you farm your supplies, you stand to make a nice profit. 
              First, take a break and build up your smithing and brewing skills 
              now; get each above 120 for the tailoring to come.<br>
            </p>
            <p>11. Create studded acrylia masks (superb rockhopper hide, paeala 
              bark tannin, mask pattern, 1 acrylia stud) until 188. Paeala bark 
              tannin is made by combining paeala bark (vendor sold) and water 
              in a brew barrel, trivial at 102. An acrylia stud is made in a forge 
              when you combine 3 acrylia bits (2 acrylia pieces and water = 1 
              acrylia bits), one flask of water, and a file, trivial at 45. Masks 
              (on my server, anyway) do not sell for much, but if you are so inclined 
              to, other armor like the acrylia studded cloak sell very well. The 
              cloak calls for 4 studs however, so it can be more work to skill 
              up on those. Masks are the only item that requires one stud, thus 
              making it the easiest item to make if skilling up is your primary 
              objective. All pieces of armor trivial at 188. Recommended level: 
              40+<br>
              <i>(End Steps in Guide)</i><br>
            </p>
            <p>Good job! You've hit tailoring (188), a skill level that not many 
              people ever reach. But you want to go further? You have some choices 
              to make! From here, you have multiple routes in which to pursue 
              to 250. All are time consuming if you farm, and some finished products 
              sell better than others. In short, here are some tried methods:<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Method 1:</i> Acrylia reinforced armor. This requires a flawless 
              rockhopper hide, paeala bark tannin, a pattern, and acrylia boning 
              in varying amounts. Again, the mask requires only one boning. Acrylia 
              boning takes a small brick of acrylia, a flask of water, and a file 
              in the forge, trivial at around 40. Acrylia reinforced armor can 
              raise your skill to 242.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Method 2: </i>Studded arctic wyvern hide armor. Requires an 
              arctic wyvern hide, cod oil, pattern, and varying amounts of velium 
              studs. Velium studs are made by combining 3 velium bits, a file, 
              and a coldain velium temper. Cod oil is made from combining a cobalt 
              cod (fishing) and a flask of water in a brew barrel. You must combine 
              these in a Coldain Tanner's Kit and not a regular sewing kit. Trivials 
              above 250.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Method 3:</i> Othmir fur caps. Requires 2 othmir furs, a silver 
              thread, cap pattern, and a vial of clear mana. The silver thread 
              is sold in Thurgadin. The vial of clear mana requires an emerald, 
              a poison vial, and a level 29+ enchanter. You must combine these 
              in a Coldain Tanner's Kit and not a regular sewing kit. Trivials 
              above 250. <br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Method 4:</i> Ceremonial Solstice Robe. Requires gem studded 
              chain, 3 sacred Tunare silks, tunic pattern, and an embroidery needle. 
              This one is expensive to make, particularly the gem studded chain. 
              The robe requires a jewelcraft skill of 250, smithing skill of 122, 
              a pottery skill of 103, and a tailoring skill of 135 (which you 
              have covered). The robe sold well for a long time, but I'm sure 
              the price currently varies from server to server. Check EQTraders 
              for all of the combines and items required per robe. The robe will 
              take you to 250. <br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Method 5:</i> Check your cultural options. Some cultures have 
              alternative routes to high tailoring skills. Wood elves, for example, 
              have mithril leathers that can take you to 228 if you don't mind 
              foraging a lot of oak bark. Half-elves do not have this option for 
              skilling up.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i>Method 6:</i> Keep an eye out on EQTraders for new recipes and 
              for other tailoring options. Most people tend to do one of the above 
              methods, but you never know when a new quest will come along and 
              much profit can be made on a new tailored item. The Planes of Power 
              expansion may also contain new tailoring methods to 250, so keep 
              an eye out there as well. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b>Tip: </b>It has been hinted at that your chance for a skill-up 
              is slightly better when you succeed making an item versus when you 
              fail an item. Whether this is true or not is in debate, but if you 
              want to increase your chance of simply being successful making an 
              item, you may wish to invest in a geerlock which adds to your tailoring 
              skill success rate. If nothing else, the additional successes you 
              have can be sold back to recover more money spent.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I have found that handmade backpacks and leather padding are still 
              great moneymakers if you are purely interested in profit. The backpack 
              market alone has been the sole funding for the mastery of 5 of my 
              trades, including the expensive blacksmithing trade. I do not often 
              see any market for other below-158 items except the occasional monk 
              wanting to buy some Wu's armor. However, of all the trades, tailoring 
              is one of the most difficult (arguably the most difficult, even 
              after the October 2002 patch), and it is no small accomplishment 
              to get to 250. I wish you the best of luck!<br>
