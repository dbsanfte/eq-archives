While most would think that a halfling's cultural tradeskill should be eating, in actuality, these fur-footed folk are skilled tailors, making leathers, chain and even plate-grade armor in their Vale sewing kit. They also perform a tiny bit of smithing via their cultural forge, but only enough to enhance their tailoring.
</p>
<p>
As with all cultural tradeskills, any recipes that require the use of a cultural tradeskill container (Vale forge, Vale sewing kit) must be performed by real halflings. Those of you illusioning into halflings, or attempting to glue fur onto the feet of a gnome or a dwarf in order to perform these tradeskills will be solidly laughed at by the container ... or at least told you can't do that.  ;)
