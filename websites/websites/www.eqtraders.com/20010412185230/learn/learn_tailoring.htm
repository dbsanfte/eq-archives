            <p><i>(updates made 03/27/01 to mention advanced tailoring)</i> </p>
            <p>If you wish to make non-metal armor for yourself and others, tailoring 
              is the skill you need to learn. Your first finished products will 
              be patchwork armor for the non-casters, and silk swatches and raw 
              silk armor for the pure spellcasters and monks. </p>
            <p>While some folks have expressed an interest in learning simply 
              to make themselves some armor, in order to develop enough skill 
              to make yourself armor, you might as well continue working on the 
              skill enough to pay for all those pelts and patterns you ruined 
              in the process. <g> </p>
            <p>I'm not going to tell you everything there is to know about tailoring, 
              but here's some basic information to save you a lot of mis-spent 
              money.</p>
            <p><b>For patchwork:</b></p>
            <p>First, lets clear some misconceptions and confusions: a) Small 
              sewing kits can be used to make armor for <i>all</i> size folks. 
              The size of the sewing kit does NOT affect the size of the armor 
              being made. (I've seen a lot of humans running around looking for 
              "medium sewing kits" to no avail.) b) Somewhere along the way, the 
              powers that be did a name change on things, so some pelts will be 
              called pelts, others will be called "skins". As long as the other 
              part of the description matches the pelt you need, it's the one 
              you want. (i.e., ruined bear pelt, high quality bear skin, etc.)</p>
            <p>The <i>pelt</i> or <i>skin</i> determines the size of the armor 
              made. (Wolf for the wee folks, cat for the medium folks, and bear 
              for the large folks.) Ruined pelts are for patchwork, which makes 
              sense, since patchwork is bits and pieces, and you mangled the pelt 
              while skinning it. Better pelts/skin, plus the large sewing kit 
              mix with patterns and certain metal objects, to make studded leather 
              and reinforced leather armor. Of course, these sorts of things are 
              a lot more difficult to make, and so on, so forget about it for 
              now. Just focus on the basics -- patchwork. By the time you have 
              mastered that, and have a tailoring skill of 26, then you can start 
              asking around to find someone willing to teach you the tricks to 
              the better leather armors. Until that time, you'll waste a lot of 
              materials, and frustrate yourself unduly.</p>
            <p><b>For silk armor:</b> The first thing you're going to need is 
              spider silk, and lots of it. Now, we're not talking of mugging spiderlings 
              here, as their silk is too small to do any good for armor (there 
              are tailoring uses for spiderling silk, and this guide WILL be rewritten 
              with that information once the DenMother is back from vacation). 
              You need the bigger spiders to pull this off: large spiders, giant 
              spiders, carrion spiders, crag spiders, wooly spiders, etc. You 
              can get your skill in tailoring from 0 to somewhere in the teens 
              by just taking two pieces of spider silk and combining them in either 
              size sewing kit. Set the resulting silk swatch aside -- you're going 
              to need lots of it. Once your sewing skill is in the teens (or sooner 
              if you want to risk ruining more silk swatches and patterns), you 
              combine silk swatches and patterns in the large kit to produce raw 
              silk armor that spellcasters and monks can wear. The number of swatches 
              you need varies with the item being made, but always, always, with 
              any trade skill, remember that if something needs 2 or more of an 
              item, that those items must be unstacked in your kit before you 
              combine. Once raw silk armor is trivial for you, then you can start 
              teaming up with a brewer to make cured silk armor, and with an enchanter 
              to make Wu's Fighting Gauntlets for the monks (the only piece of 
              "glowing silk" armor in the game so far), but definitely don't even 
              think of trying to learn how to tailor on the more advanced items 
              unless you have a lot of money you're willing to waste as you ruin 
              things.</p>
            <p><b>Studded/reinforced leather:</b> At one point, studded and reinforced 
              leather armor were the main tailored armor upgrade for druids. With 
              the addition of halfling and wood elf cultural tailoring, especially 
              the imbued versions which cover the druidic deities, this is no 
              longer the case. While these items are good for skill increases, 
              it's unlikely you'll find much of a market for them.</p>
            <p><b>Bags and other containers:</b> There are several containers 
              that you can make via tailoring. Some, such as handmade (10-slot) 
              backpacks and bearskin potion bags (for combining several single-charge 
              alchemy potions into one multiple-charge potion) will have a market. 
              Others, such as quivers, are not in high demand at all, and you 
              will likely mainly use them for skill increases. <i>(Note: quivers 
              grant no added benefit to archery, and they do NOT autoload different 
              types of arrows. There's no difference between storing your arrows 
              in a pack or a quiver ... other than that the quiver can't hold 
              the variety of items that a pack can. Also note that there is no 
              known recipe for a fleeting quiver. Yes, I know there's a pattern 
              for it, and there's been a pattern for it since beta, but Verant 
              still will not acknowledge that it can, indeed, be made, and many, 
              many folks have tried a large number of combinations in a fruitless 
              attempt to discover a recipe.)</i></p>
            <p><b>What's next?: </b>There's still a LOT more you can make with 
              tailoring from this point onwards, but it will be expensive to your 
              pocketbook as well as eat a lot of your time. If you're looking 
              for the &quot;cheapest&quot; path to mastery after cured silk, your 
              best bet is likely to work on quivers until they go trivial at 115, 
              and then work on the crystalline silks from Velious until skill 
              131. <font color="#400000"><b>There is no cheap and easy way to 
              grandmaster level tailoring from 131 onwards at this time.</b></font> 
              All other &quot;advanced&quot; tailoring from this point onwards 
              requires serious amounts of time spent collecting components and 
              serious amounts of cash investments ... plus high failure rates. 
              There are many nice items that can be made by highly-skilled tailors, 
              and you may be one of the treasured few who works their way to becoming 
              a grandmaster (200+) tailor, but please, don't say you weren't warned 
              that it would be a difficult and expensive path. :)</p>
