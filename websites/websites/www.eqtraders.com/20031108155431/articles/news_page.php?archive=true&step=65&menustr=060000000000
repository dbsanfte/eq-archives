<p>
<p>I wanted to take a few moments to give my heartfelt thanks to <a href="http://www.refplace.com">Refplace</a>
for the "home" that they gave the site as an <a href="http://www.eqportal.com">EQPortal
Community</a> during some tough times. While load and database issues have
caused us to move over to Racknine for our hosting, I cannot stress enough how
much I appreciate the aid that Rory gave us in our time of need. It is very
likely that EQTC would have had to close it's doors (or be merged into one of
the fee-based sites) well before Luclin launched, if not for the site hosting
home that he provided.
<p>For those of you who are wondering, yes, the site move has increased our
costs, and costs will continue to grow, especially once PoP launches in another
month and a half (Luclin more than doubled our site traffice for a while, and
increased message board traffic 10-fold.) However, we <i>hope</i> to continue
managing to tread water financially, thanks to those of you that are clicking on
that PayPal icon over to the left, and making donations. Time will tell. In the
meantime, we will continue our struggle to keep the site as ad-free as possible.

<p>
<p>With little ado, DNS was changed today to point to our new hosting provider at
Racknine, catching many of us by surprise (I'd expected it to take another week
or so for the paperwork to be finished.) If you can read this message, then the
nameserver that you use has the new information. It also means that you've
likely seen some craziness with nav buttons today, due to a case-sensitive issue
on some links. I <i>think</i> I caught them all, but there may be a couple
holdovers for a day or two as I go over everything with a fine-toothed comb.

<p>Rumors that the Terrorantula, 8-legged menace of the Southern Desert of Ro,
has been reproducing have been verified. While they may be a bit easier to take
on than their mother, they're still tougher than your average dune tarantula.
Fortunately for all of us, they also drop terrorantula silk, long-prized by the
Erudites for durability in <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">cultural

<p>While we're not ready to give out an ETA on the new database, we <i>are</i>
ready to start asking for more concerted help on gathering information on the
thousands of items that need to go into it. If you are interested in helping,
please visit the <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm74">DenMom's

<p>
<p>Some days it's the little things in life that make you dance around,
sometimes it's the big. I'll let you all decide for yourselves where you put the
following updates. (Note: more information may be added to this later in the
day, but this is what the sleep-depreived halfling has found so far):
<ul>
  <li>jars of acid stack
  <li>jars of lacquer stack
  <li>low quality rockhopper hides can now be used for making leather padding. I
    also verified that dropping a medium quality rockhopper hide into the sewing
    kit with a skinning knife does yield low quality rockhopper hides. (I've not
    tested high quality hides yet, but I'm presuming the downward conversion is
    working for them as well)
  <li>stormreaper chainwoven skirt now fits properly in the waist slot
  <li>tired of trying to tell half your guild what the starts are on some brand
    new tradeskill item are? You can now give them a hotlink with a few extra
    keyclicks! In main chat, start your message to the appropriate chat channel
    (/gu, /auction, various created chat channels, etc.), alt-left click on the
    item you want to announce, click on the icon of the item in the item
    description box that you just caused to open, and it should drop the item
    name as a hotlink, into your current line of chat text. If these
    instructions make little sense, then find someone less sleep-impaired to
    explain it to you. ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I'll be knuckling down and beating the database into
submission more (no ETA on when you folks will see it yet, but it will
definitely be worth the wait), and dealing with a lot of IRL stuff, so if I'm
unusually quiet for the next few weeks, don't be surprised. Expect to see me
post <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2255.topic">more

<p>We're back! I know many of you were pacing nervously earlier this week when
you couldn't reach the site - you weren't alone! Thankfully, the dead router
that caused the outage for us, EQPortal and others was either repaired or
replaced yesterday afternoon. Just in time, of course, for my DSL connection to
die for several hours. (Which is partly why this update is a day late.)
<p>While I haven't received direct word regarding the VI stance on custom UI
mods, <a href="http://eqtoolbox.not.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=56&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0">EQ
toolbox has an interview with a senior editor at VI</a> regarding them. For
those of you working on tradeskill mods, there are multiple threads in the
General Tradeskills Forum regarding them. One thing to note is that if you're
going to do screenshots, direct copies of the data/layout from this site, please
make sure that it <i>also</i> contains the URL to this site in the mod. Not only
will this let folks who use your mod know where to find updated recipes,
trivials, etc., but it will keep you from having an upset redheaded DenMother
chasing after you for redistributing copyrighted information without permission.
;)
<p>Look for news next week on our decision regarding EZBoard renewal. I've seen
the newest "estimates" for a 6-month renewal, and it's going to cost
over 3 times what it cost a year ago to renew for a year. (Yes, we've grown <i>that</i>
much in traffic.) We may decide to renew (in which case we'll be asking for
donations), or we may decide to host our own boards (in which case it we'll also
be asking for donations, but likely have a different target amount, etc.). We're
not sure yet, and while folks have been full of all sorts of helpful suggestions
and commentary, we're going to think on it a bit longer before we make a
decision. Given the hassles inherent with the second option, we may end up
biting the bullet and paying the $1910 to renew ... or have those of you who are
not EZBoard Community Supporters deal with ads when you hit the boards for a
while. ... bleargh!

  <p>SOE recently began promoting their new book, the Everquest Atlas, and some
  of you have expressed to me some confusion regarding this. Despite the
  similarity between the name of this product and their use of "EQ

<p>
<p>Well, the webserver is unwell this morning, so I'm not sure when folks will
get to see this update, but here's what we've got so far with regards to
tradeskills and the patch:
<ul>
  <li>the noodles recipe now works! Keep an eye on <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking">the
    baking forum</a> for any up-to-the-minute discoveries on the various yields,
    as well as recipes requiring noodles
  <li>casserole dish sketches now stack. This is indeed happy news for the
    potters that are making casserole dishes to go with our noodles
  <li>plains pebbles stack at last! Foragers around Norrath are heaving sighs of
    relief as their overloaded packs get a bit of relief
  <li>in other pack-happy news, black acrylia now stacks
  <li>the adding items to stacks issue that caused you to pick up the entire
    stack when trying to drop an item into the stack, has been fixed
  <li>the bazaar search function now lets you see an alphabetic listing of
    traders</li>
</ul>
<p>Other items with this patch include druid/wizzie ports from anywhere to
various locations on the moon, a fix to the tracking box, and much more. See <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_patch_message.jsp">the
complete patch message here</a>. Happy tradeskilling!

<p>
<p>Today's patch is quite large, so it will likely be a while before we catch
and mention everything in it that impacts tradeskills. While I sift through the
many posts on the subject, here are a few things of note:
<ul>
  <li>The new UI has been released, including the bazaar functionality. Remember
    that you must set "newui=TRUE" in your eqclient.ini file before
    you can buy <i>or</i> sell using the new bazaar trader functions.
  <li>The Jaggedpine zone has been released (it is an optional patch, so you
    must actively ask for it under the Advanced options when loading EQ). The
    baking forum already has a <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1820.topic">thread
    started for new recipes and trivials</a> from this zone.
  <li>Stats on stat drinks are reported as working.
  <li>Faydwer was updated with quests for young adventurers. Information on the
    quests can be found in the Quests message board under the following threads:
    <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11.showMessage?topicID=871.topic">Felwithe
    Newbie Quests</a>, <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11.showMessage?topicID=870.topic">Kelethin
    Newbie Quests</a>, and <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11.showMessage?topicID=869.topic">Kaladim
    Newbie Quests</a>. I'll give it a day or two before I make up quests pages
    for all of these.
  <li>Cazic-Thule tailored items did <i>not</i> get an expected upgrade with
    this patch.</li>
</ul>
<p>That looks to be about it on the updates for today, other than the
decomissioning of the May 8 recipes page at long last. (All recipes stemming
from the May 8 patch should now be on their permanent recipes pages.)

to take a moment to wish <a href="http://www.gucomics.keenspace" target="_new">Woody
and his humorous comics of EQ life</a> a happy 2-year anniversary. I'm very
pleased that Woody has allowed me to display several of his tradeskill-related

<p>The fish & game wardens in Erud's Crossing are happy to announce that
their efforts to reintroduce barren flounder into the waters have been
successful. (i.e., Erud's Crossing was patched today) Erudite clerics of the
non-evil persuasion can now join their priestly bretheren in the possession of a
coveted <a href="secrets/recipes_may8.htm#pottery">Faithstone</a>. <font color="#800000"><b><i>(Note:
folks on the Quellious server apparently did not get the zone patch and are
still fishing up Timorous Tuna. The other servers, so far, seem to have been
restocked properly.)</i></b></font>
<p>The mysteries of <a href="secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm">Cazic Thule
tailoring</a> continue to unravel ... so to speak.
<p>Those of you who have seen stats of items on other sites and have come here
looking for the recipes may find that the following will aid in your search:
<ul>
  <li>Those looking for "Luminate" armor (as per Alla'khazam's and <a href="http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/" target="_new">EQ'Lizer</a>)
    really want to look for "Luminant" heraldic armor, which is <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human_qeynos.htm">Human
    Cultural, Qeynos</a>.
  <li>Those of you looking for Stormreaper Chainwoven or Stormreaper Steelwoven
    will not that it is not smithed (as per <a href="http://mmo.gameznet.com/eq/" target="_new">EQ'Lizer</a>).
    These items are made via <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_halfling.htm">halfling
    cultural <i>tailoring</i></a><i>. (It seems their data entry gnomes are a
    tad busy right now, but these will get fixed in their database soon).</i>
  <li>Those of you looking for Tae Ew items, the tailored Tae Ew goodies are
    still on the <a href="secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm">Cazic Thule recipes</a>
    page.
  <li>If you're looking for ___ Heraldic armor, or "that new Veeshan bard
    armor", you'll find it, again, under <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human_qeynos.htm">human
    cultural, Qeynos</a></li>

<p>
<p>Well, it's a week later than I'd originally planned, but my new home office
furniture is finally installed, and I've got the 2 PCs and the laptop set back
up. It's going to take me quite a while to get the CDs, documentation, maps,
knicknacks, unpacked, sorted and put into their new spots, but I'm already
enjoying the feeling of "space" that the new layout gives me. (The
extra storage space will also come in handy, as I'm definitely a packrat!)
<p>Meanwhile, I'm sure you folks are more interested in what's going on
tradeskill-wise, so here's a small update for you. Barren Flounder, that had
been chased into virtual extinction by the introduction of Timorous Tuna into
their spawning grounds back in November, have been seen once again in Erud's
Crossing on Test server. This is wonderful news for the "good" erudite
clerics, who have been unable to enjoy the use of faithstones that their other
healing brethren have been using. Hopefully it will be re-introduced onto the
live servers with the next patch. We're also hoping to see a few other item
tweaks next patch, such as to the stats of the Cazic Thule armor and weapons,
stackability of Tae Ew meat, etc.
<p>As time and oomph permit, I'm going through all <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">the
armor stats pages</a> to see what's missing for the older smithed armor sets. As
I'm finding missing data, the relevant stats page is having question marks added
in the appropriate spots, and on the more major information, I'm <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=6540.topic">whimpering
for help</a> on data that I can't find elsewhere. After I tackle all the armors
(I'm about a third of the way through the cultural sets now), I'll tackle the
smithed weapons. Those of you with a solid player-made weapon collection are
more than welcome to compare what's on the weapon stats page with the
information on your weapons, and post with missing information in that same
message board thread.
<p>My thanks to Fallenhero for the new art at the top of this page. We try very
hard to keep the site fast-loading, without a lot of extra frufru, but it's
amazing how a couple tiny files make a difference. :)
<p>For the Americans amongst us, may you have a happy and <i>safe</i>
Independence Day tomorrow.</p>

<p>Fortunately, things are relatively quiet on the tradeskill front right now.
Discussion of the new EQ interface that is currently on Test can be found via <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm64.showMessage?topicID=275.topic" target="_new">this
message board thread</a>. Some progress has been made at last on sorting out the

recipes</a>. As always, a lot of updates are going on behind the scenes on a
daily basis, especially in narrowing down smithing trivials, adding stats for
the newer tradeskill items, etc. A few weeks back, I also had to split apart the
cultural armor stats from the main armor stats page. This has caused quite a bit
of confusion, and it's currently not the most elegant or intuitive layout, but
it will have to do for the near future. For now, all smithed cultural armor
stats can be found a) via the nav buttons on the left-hand side of the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">main
armor stats page</a> and, b) via a link at the TOP of each cultural recipes page
for that culture's stats. I apologize for the kludgy feel of this, but it's
going to be a while before I can tackle nav issues.
<p>This brings me to the mischief and mayhem portion of this update. I've been
dual-wielding computers for quite a while now, as it allows me to work on site
updates at the same time I am performing research in-game, wield both my
accounts at once to have easier access to tradeskill mules, etc. Unfortunately,
the setup I've been using for the last couple of years is not ergonomic, and
hasn't been very good for my chronic back problems. We finally made arrangements
to have both my office and Ngreth's office redone, with setups that should make
them much more comfortable workplaces. We've been planning this for a couple
months, and yesterday the movers arrived to box up everything in my office, so
the folks could come in today with the custom setup for my office. Ngreth's
office was to follow next Tuesday. Unfortunately, some wires were crossed
somewhere (I blame Bristlebane, may all his toe fur fall off!), and the
installers showed up today with <i>Ngreth's</i> office setup, not mine. They're
not even done building mine. Soooo ... Ngreth and two installers are busy
disassembling Ngreth's old office right now and packing it up, most of my office
possessions are taking over the guest room, my cats are frantic and hiding from
the chaos, and I ... am working off a card table set up in my almost-empty
office. I'll be working off this setup until Tuesday morning, at which time I
re-disassemble everything and pray there are no more surprises in store. (edit:
hubby's office is taking 2 days to complete, so I expect mine will as well ...
wheeeeee).
<p>{gibber}
<p>Needless to say, I'll likely get less accomplished than normal for the next
few days.

<p><span class="headers">June 12, 2002 - Patch Day ... seen with \</span>
<p>
<p>I'm back from my lasik surgery at last, though the trip home took 6 hours
instead of 2 due to an accident closing off the highway we came home on. I'm
exhausted, and going to avoid taxing my energy levels, much less my
"new" eyes, so site updates WILL wait until tomorrow. Please, please,
PLEASE in the meantime, remember to READ before you post your questions and
comments in the various forums, especially since it sounds like everyone's been
posting helter-skelter over there. The more mayhem folks make in the "data
only" threads, the longer it's going to take me to get things updated
tomorrow. For those who haven't caught it yet, here's what was tradeskill-related
from the patch message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>** Trade Skills **</p>
  <p>- Improved many of the smithed Acrylia items<br>
  - Large Blocks, Blocks, and Small Blocks of Magic Clay are now stackable<br>
  - Brick of Deathsteel Ore is now stackable<br>
  - Several blacksmithed cultural armor set pieces have received a slight
  improvement to their armor class.<br>
  - Tarnished and Fine Steel Weapons may now be recycled into ore by placing
  them into a forge with<br>
  a water flask.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other items of note:
<blockquote>
  <p>- Acrylia Reinforced Armor is now usable by short races<br>
  - Shadowhaven Faction Amulet should be more useful now<br>
  - Loremaster Borannin should be responding properly again<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's very likely that you folks now know more about the effects from this
patch than I do, and it will stay that way until tomorrow. Please remember to
post trivial and stat updates to the proper spots in the message boards (there
are threads already started in the Smithing forum) ... and watch those vents
that are starting to pop up with inappropriate language and/or in inappropriate
spots, please.</p></p>

Just a few quick updates:
<p>Cazic-Thule jewelcraft has been deciphered, and the first pieces have been successfully made. Recipes and stats are on the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm">Cazic-Thule recipes page</a>.
<p>The dust is finally starting to slowly settle from the June 5 patch and all the changes to smithing trivials. It's still going to take a while to get it all updated, but we're getting there. For all of those asking on the various forums, as far as we know <i>only</i> smithing trivials were changed.
<p>There's another patch this Wednesday. Hopefully the rockhoppers and sambata that share a cave in Dawnshroud Peaks will find their way home again, as well as a few other spawn issues. :) We'll have more of an update Wednesday.
<p>We received the following suggestion on our Quests message board, and there's already been responses that it does help when having problems with quest NPCs:
<p><blockquote>If any NPC is not responding to direct text do this. Clear your target window and say the quest text. For some reason they will respond when you do NOT have them targeted. So just make sure you don't have a target at all by pressing the escape key.</blockquote>
<p>As an addendum to this, close your inventory window before you hail them, as this has been reported to be one issue with non-responsive NPCs. If that doesn't work, close your eyes, stand on one foot, bay at the moon and hit the ENTER key ... wait, sorry, that last bit is the Bristlebane in me. Try the non-targeted talk and the inventory closed if you're having problems with an NPC, and, as always, remember to research in advance to verify that you have the proper faction, proper text, etc. 
<p><b>Administrivia:</b> we're working on collecting all the information needed to have a comprehensive tradeskill database that will allow cross-referencing of trade supplies, sources (vendors, mob drops, etc.) and recipes. It's a huge undertaking, and it's going to take a lot of time to get it ready for public viewing. If you see requests in one of the forums asking for help collecting data, that's why, and the information we need the most is on the exotic stuff - tradeskill drops off mobs, player-made cultural items that are then used as ingredients for other recipes (i.e., adamantite chain jointing, and other such things) and so on. So, as you're tradeskilling and shopping, the data that you get from a right-click is likely exactly what we're looking for. Keep an eye on the various forums for a request for your tradeskill(s). Meanwhile, this half-blind hobbit is toddling off tomorrow for lasik eye surgery,and is supposed to be MIA from the boards and other eye-strain until sometime Wednesday (patch day). Wish me luck!

<p>
I have several things to highlight today:
<p><blockquote>The new smithing recipes and trivials are slowly trickling in, and I have some requests to make, based on the first day's worth of data. Please be sure that when you're reporting on stats for new items, that you're including race/class/weight information. I know it takes a few extra moments to scribble it all down, but it really makes a difference on the completeness of information for the site. Please make sure you're clearly stating trivials - there's a difference between "trivial 222" and "trivial <=222". Make sure you're being fully clear if you know the <i>exact</i> trivial vs. it being trivial at that point or some point below. Please be sure that when you're reporting new trivials on old cultural items that you are explicitly stating whether you're working in racial chain or plate for things like dark elven and high elven armors. It may seem like a little thing, but when we're already dealing with normal, enchanted, and imbued/enchanted armor, I refuse to "assume" that I know which set you're talking about.
<p>That having been said, there is a lot of data already on the appropriate smithing pages. If you find a smithing page that does <i>not</i> include two trivial colums (old & new), then I have not yet processed any new information for that specific group of items. This may mean that nobody has submitted any new information, or it may just mean that I've not reached that part of the huge pile of updates that have been dropped in my lap.
<p>Yes, I'm aware that pretty much every smithing guide in the Learn Smithing section is now totally outdated. This situation isn't likely to change until new trivials are more fully nailed down and folks start submitting new guides based on that information.
<p>I've managed to verifiy race changes to halfling cultural tailored armor, but folks are slow in reporting in whether other of the new cultural items that were added on May 5 have had stats changed based on yesterday's patch. Wood elves, especially, please check all those lovely tailored armors of yours, and report in if anything has changed with your armor. (I'm hoping half elf was added to the sets.)
<p>Contrary to yesterday's patch message, enchanted clay is still not stacking. Whoops! 
<p>More updates have been done to the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/potc_intro.htm">PoTC quest writeup</a>, including the addition of the non-tradeskill spell-only version of the quest. It still needs a lot of fleshing out, but that's going to take more time than I currently have.
<p>The mailbox to which all my private EZBoard messages are sent is beyond overflowing with viruses, trojan horses, spam, unwanted trash as well as various stray emails from folks who need my attention. I'm afraid to say that I'm beyond behind responding to any real mail that might be lurking in that mailbox, and it's not likely to change any time in the near future. In some cases, I cannot respond as the people in question have not included any email address in their message (EZBoards doesn't include your email addy on private messages). Additionally, I'm having problems with my ISP that I use for <i>the rest</i> of my email, and it's been timing out left, right, sideways and diagonally for the last several days. For the dozen or so of you offering to take over the fashion section, however, I'm going to close down that section of the site. Due to a horde of problems, as well as system load, it's not feasible for this site to track every single new/old set of player-made armor and track two versions of the graphics for them (with and without Luclin models).
<p>Folks have started emailing moderators when they have problems registering an EZBoard account. Unfortunately, we don't own EZBoards, so it's rather hard for us to troubleshoot these. You'll want to report such problems in directly to the EZBoard <a href="http://pub121.ezboard.com/fezboardaccountproblemsfrm1">Login/Support</a> Forum and see if they can help. (You don't need to be registered/logged in to post to that forum.)
<p>I've developed zero tolerance for certain antics on the message boards. Please remember that the Primal Scream Forum, as is mentioned on the banner text when you enter that forum does not allow personal attacks (name-calling, slander, etc.), and yes, saying "I hope you @#$^'ing die" is WELL beyond acceptable behavior and is subject to immediate banning. We also ask, rather clearly, that you "keep it clean". Unmasked swearing in subject lines, as well as swearing (however masked) <i>at specific people</i> are also not acceptable. For those that are unaware of the history of that forum, it was originally meant as a spot where people could rant and rave out their tradeskill frustrations after a horrible run of luck, etc., while still keeping it within the realms of polite public behavior. While we've allowed some leeway on what's allowed in there, it is still not a place to come in and spew filth. There are plenty of other message boards in the world where you can spew that trash if you really need to, but we don't need it in our community.</blockquote>

<p>
It's another BIG day with regards to tradeskills, and it will be a while before updates hit the site and the dust settles. I'll make another update later today, once we have some solid information in place, but a few things to note in the meantime. 
<p><li>The initial writeup for the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q34&menustr=120010000000">Protection of the Cabbage quest</a> is up on the site, including the new earring reward. Nondruids who had been working on this quest should pay special note to the fact that the previous all/all earring is now druid-only. </li>
<li>Many new smithing recipes were put in today, as well as many new trivials. It WILL be mid-afternoon before even the first of these gets onto the site. It's even more important than ever that you READ before you post your questions and comments in the message boards, as we're going to be running a tight herd on the chaos caused by stampeding smiths. There are specific sticky topics set aside JUST for recipes and stats, and other threads set aside for questions. </li>
<li>Other quests, item stats, etc. have changed, and we'll get those updates on the site as able. </li>
<li>Rennet vendors are back in place. </li>
<li>Remember to watch your manners when posting on the message boards. A LOT of folks have been less-than-mannered lately, and have found themselves in the doghouse. The posting and conduct rules are there for a reason, and we are very actively enforcing them. This goes especially for those of you wanting to let off some steam. Even in the Primal Scream Forum, remember that the rules apply. Keep it family-rated, and remember NO personal attacks. We understand that when tradeskills change, folks tend to get a tad ... excited ... but this message board community really does NOT appreciate some of the foaming at the mouth we've seen lately. Such antics only distract us from making sure that data gets accurately reported, then recorded, onto the site. </li></ul>
<p><b>June 5, Addendum 1: </b>
<p>The following is a post from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers for EQ: 
<p><blockquote>If you are not a Druid and you've completed the PoTC quest, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.
<p>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and lost an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game and a GM will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed to make another earring after verifying your loss.
<p>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one that has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are retroactively changed, it sometimes causes the "out of charges" bug. 
<p>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. Give her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a fully charged Xanthe's earring back.
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you, this should solve any difficulties anyone's had with the earring.
<p>Thanks,
<p>- Rich

Just a quick note to let folks know that I've changed links around since the last front page update. The main May 8, 2002 recipes page can still be found in the same spot, but ALL cultural recipes have been moved to their <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g67&menustr=080040000000">permanent links off the cultural recipes page</a>. In another week or so, I hope to split out the May 8, 2002 recipes onto thier permanent recipes pages. I'll also be redoing FAQs and trade supplies listings as time permits.</p>

<p>
In a very hobbit sort of way (giving gifts on a special day instead of receiving them) this tired mother (of this community, plus 3 cats ;D) has a plethora of gifts for you all. Recipes, recipes everywhere! Yes, it's chaos everywhere, with tradesfolk running around, comparing notes, wanting to exchange their gifts for other gifts, and so on. It's going to take quite a while for things to settle down around here and for "DenMom" to clean up everything. In the meantime, you'll want to watch the message boards (as always), as well as bookmark the following: Main collection of May 8, 2002 recipes, <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g79&menustr=080040120000">wood elven cultural</a>, <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g67&menustr=080040000000">other cultural</a>. Yes, I really do mean to move each of the cultures to their own page for easier sorting out, and then later merge them with their other cultural recipes, but I keep getting sidetracked by new recipe updates. It'll get there.
<p>I've been agonizing for over a day now what to mention in a front page update, as so much of it is newsworthy to varying parts of the tradeskill community, and I know, no matter what I highlight, someone will feel left out. Some posts late last night/early this morning decided me on what would be highlighted ...
<p>Druids and tradeskillers from all across Norrath have been hard at work, deciphering the Liber Brassica Felix books, in search of the Protection of the Cabbage spell (a single-target PoTG). It's been a monumental undertaking, and I'd like to thank the EQTC community and the folks over at the Druid Grove for sharing information and ideas enough to get this sorted out quickly. The quest has been gargantuan, to say the least. And it's now over. The lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf of Bertoxx exhaustedly reported in last night that she had completed the quest, and was kind enough to provide us with information on the reward (the spell and a nice earring), and a run-down of the quest. (I'll be working on webbing it after the caffeine kicks in.) We then received a visit from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers from EQ (I swear, he's got to be getting as little sleep as I am right now, from the looks of his posts on the boards!)
<p>Rich said
<p><blockquote>
Congratulations, Xanthe!
<p>With the first completion of this quest, a new spell was brought into the world, and I'd like to thank the many druids and tradesfolk who participated in this event. 
<p>This quest is unusual in EverQuest, as it was intended to be done once and then change after it was solved. In the next patch, Xanthe will reap the rewards of finishing the quest first, and all druids will find the scroll much easier to attain now that the quest has been completed.
<p>The quest will stay in game, for people who enjoy tradeskills and anyone who completes the full quest will find the final reward is quite suitable for the effort.
<p>Thanks for playing,
<p>Rich Waters
<br>Lead Designer, EverQuest
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, folks, if you wait until the next patch, the spell will be easier to obtain. The quest will stay in game for those of us who enjoy playing with such stuff <i>{curls protectively around her fishing pole and her Misty Thicket Picnic}</i>, but for those who don't have a tradeskill junkie's patience with such quests, find enough patience to wait for the next patch. ;D
<p>I'm back to practicing my dual-wielding skills - foraging for tufts of dire wolf fur on one machine while tackling site updates on the other ... have fun with all the new recipes, everyone!
