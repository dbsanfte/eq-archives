            <h3> Thorn Mail Armor - Rivervale Ranger Quests</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several quests for youngling armor originating 
              in Rivervale. All pieces made from this quest are HFL/ROG only and 
              are lore and no drop (bracers NOT lore). All combines are no fail.</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Megosh Thistlethorn'</p>
            <p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'Greetings Placibo! I am Megosh Thistlethorn 
              first Ranger of the Storm Reapers of Rivervale. I journeyed many 
              years ago to the Surefall Glade far to the west of our lovely shire. 
              It was there I trained with the human and half-elven rangers that 
              like the Storm Reapers are faithful disciples of Karana. I have 
              returned now to Rivervale to teach our interested young people the 
              ways of a ranger of the Storm Lord, so that we may defend our shire 
              and the wilds of Norrath from the [evil forces] that would see it 
              destroyed. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what evil forces'</p>
            <p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'Currently the Death Fist Clan of Orcs, 
              a race of bloodthirsty humanoids concerned only with expanding their 
              territory and slaughtering all who stand in their path, threatens 
              our homeland. The Orcs have long had a minor presence in the Misty 
              Thicket but lately they have been amassing in greater numbers. The 
              Death Fist has been chopping down our trees and quarrying rock from 
              the nearby mountains. We know only that they have been shipping 
              the materials to the commonlands and stockpiling it for what purpose 
              we do not know. As rangers of the Storm Reapers it is our duty to 
              [stop the desecration] of the thicket. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i will stop the desecration of the thicket'</p>
            <p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'First you must outfit yourself for battle 
              with the Death Fists. Seek Bipdo Hargin here in Rivervale and give 
              him this letter. He will instruct you further on getting yourself 
              outfitted for the tasks ahead. Once you have been outfitted in a 
              suit of Thorn Mail Armor return to me and I will instruct you for 
              your [next task]. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what is my next task'</p>
            <p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'If you feel you are ready to face the 
              Orcs of Clan Death Fist then journey to the Misty Thicket beyond 
              the protection of the Wall of Cetelt. Hunt the Orcs that are cutting 
              down the trees of the thicket and bring me two of the Orc Lumberjack 
              Axes and two of the Orc Lumberjack Machetes. '</p>
            <p>Providing the above items to Megosh results in a Storm Reaper Thorn 
              Machete, 1HS, dam 4, delay 27, STR 1, DEX 1, MAGIC, wt 8.5, lore, 
              no drop weapon.</p>
            <p><br>
              You say, 'Hail, Bipdo Hargin'</p>
            <p><i>( I gave him the note at this point)</i></p>
            <p>Bipdo Hargin says 'Pleased to meet you Placibo! You must be one 
              of Megosh's new trainees. Megosh has asked me to help get you outfitted 
              in a suit of armor to protect you from the vile weapons of Rivervales
