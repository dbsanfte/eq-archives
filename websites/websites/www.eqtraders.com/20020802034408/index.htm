              with the next patch. We're also hoping to see a few other item tweaks 
              next patch, such as to the stats of the Cazic Thule armor and weapons, 
              stackability of Tae Ew meat, etc.</font>

              armor sets. As I'm finding missing data, the relevant stats page 
              is having question marks added in the appropriate spots, and on 
              the more major information, I'm <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=6540.topic">whimpering

              all the armors (I'm about a third of the way through the cultural 
              sets now), I'll tackle the smithed weapons. Those of you with a 
              solid player-made weapon collection are more than welcome to compare 
              what's on the weapon stats page with the information on your weapons,

              adding stats for the newer tradeskill items, etc. A few weeks back, 
              I also had to split apart the cultural armor stats from the main 
              armor stats page. This has caused quite a bit of confusion, and 
              it's currently not the most elegant or intuitive layout, but it 
              will have to do for the near future. For now, all smithed cultural 
              armor stats can be found a) via the nav buttons on the left-hand 
              side of the <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">main 
              armor stats page</a> and, b) via a link at the TOP of each cultural

              wield both my accounts at once to have easier access to tradeskill 
              mules, etc. Unfortunately, the setup I've been using for the last 
              couple of years is not ergonomic, and hasn't been very good for 
              my chronic back problems. We finally made arrangements to have both 
              my office and Ngreth's office redone, with setups that should make 
              them much more comfortable workplaces. We've been planning this 
              for a couple months, and yesterday the movers arrived to box up 
              everything in my office, so the folks could come in today with the 
              custom setup for my office. Ngreth's office was to follow next Tuesday. 
              Unfortunately, some wires were crossed somewhere (I blame Bristlebane, 
              may all his toe fur fall off!), and the installers showed up today 
              with <i>Ngreth's</i> office setup, not mine. They're not even done 
              building mine. Soooo ... Ngreth and two installers are busy disassembling 
              Ngreth's old office right now and packing it up, most of my office 
              possessions are taking over the guest room, my cats are frantic 
              and hiding from the chaos, and I ... am working off a card table 
              set up in my almost-empty office. I'll be working off this setup 
              until Tuesday morning, at which time I re-disassemble everything 
              and pray there are no more surprises in store. (edit: hubby's office

              less my &quot;new&quot; eyes, so site updates WILL wait until tomorrow. 
              Please, please, PLEASE in the meantime, remember to READ before 
              you post your questions and comments in the various forums, especially 
              since it sounds like everyone's been posting helter-skelter over 
              there. The more mayhem folks make in the &quot;data only&quot; threads, 
              the longer it's going to take me to get things updated tomorrow. 
              For those who haven't caught it yet, here's what was tradeskill-related 
              from the patch message:</font> 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>** Trade Skills **</p>
              <p>- Improved many of the smithed Acrylia items<br>
                - Large Blocks, Blocks, and Small Blocks of Magic Clay are now 
                stackable<br>
                - Brick of Deathsteel Ore is now stackable<br>
                - Several blacksmithed cultural armor set pieces have received 
                a slight improvement to their armor class.<br>
                - Tarnished and Fine Steel Weapons may now be recycled into ore 
                by placing them into a forge with<br>
                a water flask.<br>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Other items of note: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>- Acrylia Reinforced Armor is now usable by short races<br>
                - Shadowhaven Faction Amulet should be more useful now<br>
                - Loremaster Borannin should be responding properly again<br>

              we're working on collecting all the information needed to have a 
              comprehensive tradeskill database that will allow cross-referencing 
              of trade supplies, sources (vendors, mob drops, etc.) and recipes. 
              It's a huge undertaking, and it's going to take a lot of time to 
              get it ready for public viewing. If you see requests in one of the 
              forums asking for help collecting data, that's why, and the information 
              we need the most is on the exotic stuff - tradeskill drops off mobs, 
              player-made cultural items that are then used as ingredients for 
              other recipes (i.e., adamantite chain jointing, and other such things) 
              and so on. So, as you're tradeskilling and shopping, the data that 
              you get from a right-click is likely exactly what we're looking 
              for. Keep an eye on the various forums for a request for your tradeskill(s). 
              Meanwhile, this half-blind hobbit is toddling off tomorrow for lasik

            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The new smithing 
                recipes and trivials are slowly trickling in, and I have some 
                requests to make, based on the first day's worth of data. Please 
                be sure that when you're reporting on stats for new items, that 
                you're including race/class/weight information. I know it takes 
                a few extra moments to scribble it all down, but it really makes 
                a difference on the completeness of information for the site. 
                Please make sure you're clearly stating trivials - there's a difference 
                between &quot;trivial 222&quot; and &quot;trivial &lt;=222&quot;. 
                Make sure you're being fully clear if you know the <i>exact</i> 
                trivial vs. it being trivial at that point or some point below. 
                Please be sure that when you're reporting new trivials on old 
                cultural items that you are explicitly stating whether you're 
                working in racial chain or plate for things like dark elven and 
                high elven armors. It may seem like a little thing, but when we're 
                already dealing with normal, enchanted, and imbued/enchanted armor, 
                I refuse to &quot;assume&quot; that I know which set you're talking 
                about.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That having 
                been said, there is a lot of data already on the appropriate smithing 
                pages. If you find a smithing page that does <i>not</i> include 
                two trivial colums (old &amp; new), then I have not yet processed 
                any new information for that specific group of items. This may 
                mean that nobody has submitted any new information, or it may 
                just mean that I've not reached that part of the huge pile of

                change until new trivials are more fully nailed down and folks

                to verifiy race changes to halfling cultural tailored armor, but

                cultural items that were added on May 5 have had stats changed 
                based on yesterday's patch. Wood elves, especially, please check 
                all those lovely tailored armors of yours, and report in if anything

                zero tolerance for certain antics on the message boards. Please 
                remember that the Primal Scream Forum, as is mentioned on the 
                banner text when you enter that forum does <i>not</i> allow personal 
                attacks (name-calling, slander, etc.), and yes, saying &quot;I 
                hope you @#$^'ing die&quot; is WELL beyond acceptable behavior 
                and is subject to immediate banning. We also ask, rather clearly, 
                that you &quot;keep it clean&quot;. Unmasked swearing in subject 
                lines, as well as swearing (however masked) <i>at specific people</i> 
                are also not acceptable. For those that are unaware of the history 
                of that forum, it was originally meant as a spot where people 
                could rant and rave out their tradeskill frustrations after a 
                horrible run of luck, etc., while still keeping it within the 
                realms of polite public behavior. While we've allowed some leeway 
                on what's allowed in there, it is still not a place to come in 
                and spew filth. There are plenty of other message boards in the 
                world where you can spew that trash if you <i>really</i> need 
                to, but we don't need it in our community.</font></p>

                - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to 
                use instead of Xanthe's Earring.</p>
              <p>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and lost 
                an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game and a GM 
                will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed to make another 
                earring after verifying your loss.</p>
              <p>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with 
                Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one that 
                has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are retroactively 
                changed, it sometimes causes the &quot;out of charges&quot; bug. 
              </p>
              <p>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's 
                Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. Give 
                her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a fully charged 
                Xanthe's earring back.</p>
              <p>Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you, this should
