For a number of the Recipes there are pages that are used with a name of ".... (left)" or ".... (right)". The tags in parenthesis, the left and right keywords, are not part of the official name of the item. They are added to clarify which side of the page is used for the recipe. They can be distinguished graphically in game by the icon of the page showing a "half-page" with the torn side either on the Right Side of the icon (this is a left page), or the torn side is on the Left Side of the icon (this is a right page).
