            <h3>Tunarean Scout Armor - Kelethin Rogue Quest</h3>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Kelethin. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ELF/HEF,ROG 
              only. They are no-fail tailoring combines. Armor has a dark green 
              chain graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are 
              not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer 
              before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Tilania Shadowwalker'<BR>
              Tilania Shadowwalker says 'Greetings to you Dobbila. I welcome you 
              to the Scouts of Tunare training halls. I have seen many scouts 
              pass through my halls with unimaginable abilities and daggers guided 
              by Tunare herself. I cannot say for certain what the future has 
              in store for you. But I can say that wherever your adventures may 
              take you it is always wise to have the proper [training].'</P>
            <P>You say, 'what training'<BR>
              Tilania Shadowwalker says 'The training that I speak of is only 
              intended for rogues of Tunare that wish to develop skills that will 
              mold them into the most deadly assassins in all of the lands. If 
              you are a [rogue of Tunare] then I will be happy to explain the 
              training exercises to you. However, if you are not a rogue I suggest 
              you seek training from another house.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'i am a rogue of tunare'<BR>
              Tilania Shadowwalker says 'Excellent Dobbila, let us get started 
              then. Your training will test your fighting and gathering skills 
              respectively, because of the items you will be required to gather 
              all over the Faydark for [magical armor materials].'</P>
            <P>You say, 'what magical armor materials'<BR>
              Tilania Shadowwalker says 'First things first, here is your Assassins 
              Mail Assembly Kit. Inside this kit you will combine different magical 
              items, which in certain quantities in your mail kit can create armor 
              materials for specific pieces of Tunarean Scouts Armor. Once you 
              have completed a specific armor material you can then place it in 
              a forge with the applicable pattern to create your piece of armor. 
              Simply tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft and I can provide 
              you with the material recipes and armor patterns for [Coifs], [Bracers], 
              [Sleeves], [Boots], [Legplates], [Gauntlets] and [Tunics].'</P>
