        ... a Halfling's View </b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the beginning, 
        there was the Void, and a tall one came unto it and claimed it as his. 
        And this Lord of the Void allowed his kneecaps to be hugged, and did not 
        smite the halfling for calling him "lad", and the halfling was happy. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The halfling drew 
        friends about her and spun them tales of a new alternate world (server) 
        that would be named after the tall one, and a dream was formed. And the 
        halfling was happy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But the new world 
        never materialized, as the other gods decided that the Void needed nothing. 
        And the halfling was unhappy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Then the halfling 
        heard of another alternate world, and another dream of friendship, and 
        the halfling conspired with a tall barbarian to turn it into a shared 
        dream across two worlds. There was much wiggling of toes, and the Spiritwalkers 
        were born. And the halfling was happy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In shared happiness, 
        the halfling and her friends threw their doors and hearts open, and invited 
        others into the fold too soon, and not all was happiness and fellowship. 
        And the halfling was unhappy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then the halfling 
        saw that the bigger, more active world (Tunare) had room in their hearts 
        for refugees who wanted to share fun times with good friends. And the 
        halfing, heart breaking, mentioned this other land, and promised aid to 
        any who joined in an exodus to that land. Much was her surprise and deep 
        love for those precious ones who gave up all for a fresh start in the 
        new land. And though they were all one big family, she still thought of 
        this group as "hers", and held responsibility for their happiness tightly 
        in her heart and soul. She also adopted one of the ones that had helped 
        found both guilds as "hers", chuckling at him pulling Klaknaks out of 
        his hat on the world of Veeshan, and grinning at his antics as the first 
        barbarian ranger on the world of Tunare. And the halfling was happy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many good times followed, 
        and the refugees were joined by a couple other hardy souls who had relocated 
        from other worlds to share in the Spiritwalker dream. A wee gnomish mage 
        who'd had many troubled times, and had left the Spiritwalker family not 
        once, but twice, also bonded strongly with this hardy band. And the halfling 
        was happy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Troubled times followed, 
        however, as words, thoughts and deeds went awry, and these refugees found 
        themselves once again in the midst of strife, and once again wishing they 
        had a quiet haven away from it all. And the halfling was unhappy. Many 
        friends were hurt, angered, upset, and while she had ties to the remaining 
        Spiritwalkers she did not want to sever, she could not bear to see her 
        friends hurting. And the halfling was very unhappy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At about this same 
        time (the halfling still suspects Bristlebane's involvement), the tall 
        one, his royal Voidishness, became mortal. No longer did he have his Voidish 
        powers, though mighty he still was. And the halfling was unhappy. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Being a motherly 
        sort, and having not only a possessive redheaded streak from goodness-knows-where, 
        but also a strong nesting instinct, the halfling finally stopped running 
        about in circles and started grabbing those cherished refugees. And the 
        halfling was glad indeed when those refugees grabbed back and held on 
        for dear life. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And the halfling 
        said, "Come, hide in this haven, leave politics at the door, we all have 
        a vote, and while I may be the Denmother, I'm only your equal and your 
        friend." And so the Voidrunners were born. And the halfling was exhausted, 
        but very happy indeed.</font></p>
