              My cable connection is less than reliable right now (@home), and 
              our &quot;backup&quot; DSL isn't quite happy, so I've been trying 
              to do a bit of offline work with the information I have available 
              on my hard drive (and in my overloaded memory). Several hours after 
              I wrote this initial update, I've finally got enough of a DSL connection 
              to publish all the pages I've worked on today ... barely. Hopefully 
              by tomorrow things will have stabilized a bit, and we'll have full 
              net access once again.</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've 
              formally added a solid <a href="quests/quests.htm">Quests</a> section 
              to the site, specifically for quests requiring tradeskills. It will 
              take a while for me to get the button onto all the pages, and for 
              the page to include all the Shar Vahl class quests, etc., but it's 
              starting to shape up a bit. (I'm always looking for accurate, well-researched 
              tradeskill quest summaries.)</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I'll 
              be slowly removing items from the temporary <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin 
              Recipes</a> page and moving them to their proper recipes pages. 
              So, if you don't find a recipe that you saw here, look a bit more 
              closely at the proper tradeskill recipe pages. (Hint for <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">baking</a>: 
              scroll down. The old world recipes are listed first, then the Velious 
              recipes, then the Luclin recipes.)</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've 
              also added a &quot;<a href="secrets/recipes_bugged.htm">Flyswatter 
              Needed</a>&quot; section to the site. This will contain various 
              recipes that are listed in in-game books, given as quests, etc. 
              that, for one reason or another, we can't seem to get working properly. 
              They may be solidly bugged or they may be something we've just not 
              properly figured out. They may also include recipes that were reported 
              in as bugged, and we've not yet realized that the fix has been patched 
              in. If you find anything on this page that you've personally tested, 
              and it is working, please report back what you found to be the working 
              recipe, and I will update the page accordingly.</font></p>

              Smiths have reported back in that the various metal rings are now 
              stacking as promised and the recipes are yielding 2 rings (in some 
              cases they had returned 1 ring, in other cases 2, now there is some 
              consistency). I'm working on updating the smithing recipe pages

              Sorry for the delay in updating the front page. After we're back 
              from bringing the final houseguest to the airport in the very early 
              morning tomorrow, I'll be updating the recipe pages to reflect the 
              following information (once I hear back from folks on the boards, 
              verifying that all is happy - I've only personally verified the 
              high quality rings so far.)</font></p>

              Yesterday I spent a couple hours (while our houseguest was still 
              asleep) doing a bit more merchant re-verification. <a href="location/felwithe.htm">Felwithe</a> 
              looks a lot better now for tradeskills, but I'm still not sure I 
              found everything in <a href="location/akanon.htm">Ak'Anon</a>. If 
              folks find any updates/corrections, please provide details on the 
              message boards, and I'll get to them as able.</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It's 
              going to be RL chaos here for several more days (more guests incoming 
              late tonight), but I'll be cramming in updates as able. I've got 
              a couple pieces of email from wonderful folks to tackle that contain 
              more details regarding Luclin tradeskill quests, and I'll be updating 
              <a href="quests/luclin.htm">that quest web page</a> accordingly 
              as time permits. It <i>will</i> take time, but hopefully it will 
              be worth it. After I get done with that, then I'll be going back 
              to beating on things that still need tackling from message board 
              posts, and also doing some final straightening on the <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin

              and <font size="+5" color="#800000"><i><b>Happy New Year</b></i></font>

              It's very slow going, but I'm starting a page that will detail the 
              various <a href="quests/luclin.htm">Luclin tradeskill quests</a>, 
              and am cross-linking recipes from the <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin 
              recipes page</a> over to it as I get the appropriate details in 
              place. As always, I'm worried more about the accuracy of the information 
              before I worry about making it &quot;pretty&quot; and so forth. 
              I should be adding quite a bit to both these pages over the next 
              couple weeks, so for those of you interested in saving a few trees, 
              I'd recommend not printing them out until just before you're going 
              to need them, otherwise your printouts will likely need to be replaced 
              at least a dozen times per week. Once I'm fairly certain that the 
              majority of the information is on these pages, and correct, I'll 
              start splitting the recipes off onto the appropriate tradeskill 
              pages, and will clean up the quests page. I'll get to further merchant 
              re-verification in the Old World once I take a much-needed nap ... 
              hopefully it will help me recover from yesterday's flight chaos 
              as well as this morning's snert news.</font></p>

              The December 20 patch, which advertised some tradeskill changes, 
              may not have had as many tradeskill changes as we thought. At least 
              some of the rings (such as some of the quality rings) are reported 
              as still not stacking. Other reports state that bait and fishing 
              flies are not able to be equipped in the ammo slot, as advertised, 
              and if there is a bonus to the fishing skill available from player-made 
              fishing flies, it's not yet visible. On the positive side, new tradeskill 
              merchants have been added in several spots, and now that I'm back 
              from traveling, I'll be doing more zone verification to make sure 
              we catch them all. (I spent time in <a href="location/halas.htm">Halas</a> 
              this morning, and those trade supply location pages should be updated.)</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>{activates 
              rant mode}</i> While the DenMom's back from holiday travel, I won't 
              guarantee a happy mood, thanks to information that one of my regulars 
              found in the pit of chaos that is usenet. Someone who apparently 
              needs a clue-by-four as to the amount of time and expense that this 
              site has cost me over the past two years of running it is slamming 
              my chosen uses for donation money. Of course, if I'd NOT upgraded 
              the memory on this dratted machine so that I could explore Luclin 
              and verify tradeskill information, I'm sure he/she would be complaining 
              because I wasn't keeping the site &quot;current&quot;. I'd rather 
              deal with my third nosebleed since getting off the airplane in the 
              dark hours of last night, than go over to usenet right now, but 
              for those of you following that particular thread, I'd actually 
              rather NOT hear about what's going on with it. I'm having a hard 
              enough time keeping up enthusiasm for all this at times, despite 
              the other 99% of the folks around here who are the reason I've burnt 
              myself out for the last 2 years doing this. I stopped counting all 
              the things I've put in out-of-pocket over the last 2 years so that 
              I could explore for the site and not crash at the drop of a hat, 
              as well as all the web publishing and graphics editing tools, etc. 
              (If not for the site, I'd not need half this junk, and I'd have 
              been VERY happily retired from EQ months ago), I stopped counting 
              the hours per week I've put into site research when I'd rather have 
              been playing (but it is anywhere from 20-60 hours PER WEEK, every 
              week. Even while on &quot;holiday travel&quot; this past week, I 
              put in over 10.) I stopped counting the fees for domain name registration, 
              reimbursement for my OLD hosting provider when her fee schedule 
              changed without warning before I could move the site, etc. I've 
              lost count of the times that idjits have run through slamming my 
              way of doing things, oft-times simultaneously making use of two 
              years of hard work and stubborn redheaded research. None of them, 
              of course, want to do the work that is required for pretty much 
              solo-running a million-plus page hit per month site, plus mommy 
              the mess that is the message boards (accounting for an added 10K 
              hits per day on top of the site page hits), nor would they have 
              payed for the first 6 months of CSC gold out of their own pockets, 
              etc.</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>{sighs 
              tiredly}</i> It's days like this when I ask myself why I'll be spending 
              another 20-30 hours of site work before the end of the week (even 
              with a houseguest arriving tomorrow), in order to clean up a lot 
              of this Luclin data that's been flooding in. Then I look at all 
              you wonderful folks that are contributing on the message boards, 
              and who have helped me recover a small portion of my expenses from 
              the past two years, and I know exactly why I've not just given up. 
              Thank you, from the bottom of my halfling heart. You folks are, 
              and always will be, the reason I continue with this, even when the 
              &quot;game&quot; turns once again to &quot;work&quot;. </font></p>
