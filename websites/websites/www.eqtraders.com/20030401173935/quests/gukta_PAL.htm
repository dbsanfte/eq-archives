            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Gukta. 
              Armor pieces should lore (other than bracer), no drop and restricted 
              to FRG/PAL. These quests start with your trainer, shin Master Grubbus, 
              who also provides you with the assembly kit. As you ask about each 
              piece of armor, he will give you the mold that you need for that 
              piece. 
            <p>Initial hail text not available at this time. 
            <p>GAUNTLETS: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Shin Master Grubbus says 'Gauntlets are a good choice. Gauntlets 
                of the Shin Initiate are fairly simple to craft. You will need 
                to gather one Small Mosquito Wing, one Large Snake Skin, two Zombie 
                Skins, and one Small Brick of Ore from Innothule. If you cannot 
                find any ore in the swamp, you might be able to find some ore 
                for sale by visiting the local merchants. Once you have found 
                these items, combine them in your assembly kit and take the newly 
                created material to a forge, such as the one in the Gukta Exchange, 
                along with this mold.' </p>

              <p>Shin Master Grubbus says 'Creating bracers is a fairly easy task. 
                However even the most basic of tasks are important when done in 
                Marr's name. Gather one Snake Fang, one Zombie Skin, one Turquoise, 
                and one Small Brick of Ore from the swamp. If you cannot locate

            <p>BREASTPLATE: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Shin Master Grubbus says 'This is the most difficult item that 
                you will make. Please meditate on this and make sure you are ready 
                before you begin. Through great perseverance and piety we are 
                able to overcome almost any obstacle. To make a Breastplate of 
                the Shin Initiate you will need to travel to the Common Lands, 
                the Deserts of Ro, and Innothule Swamp and gather a Lightstone, 
                one Pristine Giant Scarab Carapace, a Desert Tarantula Chitin, 
                a Deathfist Slashed Belt, and two Small Bricks of Ore. If you 
                cannot locate any ore in your travels, you might be able to find 
                some ore for sale by visiting the local merchants. Once you have 
                found these items, combine them in your assembly kit and take 
                the newly created material to a forge, such as the one in the 
                Gukta Exchange, along with this mold. After you have completed 
                your Breastplate, come back to talk to me if you wish to perform 
                your [final test].' </p>

            <p>BOOTS: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Shin Master Grubbus says 'Very good. We, as paladins of Marr, 
                have a duty to uphold Marr's teachings and be his voice to all 
                who will listen. Though the crafting of Boots of the Shin Initiate 
                are relatively easy to create, do not be idle in either thought 
                or action. To craft your boots you will need to venture into the 
                swamp and gather a few items. You will need to gather one Snake 
                Fang, one Small Mosquito Wing, one Zombie Skin, and two Small 
                Bricks of Ore. If you cannot locate any ore in the swamp, you

                of the more difficult parts of your armor that you will craft. 
                Make sure you are prepared before you venture out to locate the 
                needed items. To make your helm you will need to gather a Giant 
                Snake Rattle, one Fungus Clump, one Spider Legs, and two Small

                brethren fell. Their lives lost so that we may carry on Marr's 
                Blessing. To aid in your forthcoming battles you may want to begin 
                constructing Legplates of the Shin Initiate. Be forewarned however 
                that they are somewhat difficult to construct. You will need to
