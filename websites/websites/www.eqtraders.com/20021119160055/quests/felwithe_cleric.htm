            <h3>Sylvan Initiate Armor - Felwithe Cleric Quest</h3>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Felwithe. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, HIE/CLE 
              only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Armor has a green plate 
              graphic when worn. (Please excuse the creative formatting. Information 
              was provided by multiple sources, and I've not yet had a chance 
              to sort it all out and make it &quot;pretty&quot;) Please note that 
              while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, 
              so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i></p>
            <p>The Felwithe Cleric newbie armor quests are initiated with Terren 
              Starwatcher (right behind the cleric guildmaster in the cleric guild 
              in Felwithe) and the pieces are called Sylvan Initiate ___. Terren 
              is your source for the mail assembly kit, as well as the molds needed 
              for the various pieces of armor.</P>
            <p>Terren Starwatcher says 'Welcome friend! Have you come to the Temple 
              of Tunare to give praise or are you a young Cleric [seeking guidance] 
              from your elders?' </P>
            <p>You say, 'I am seeking guidance' </p>
            <p>Terren Starwatcher says 'Tunare shall be pleased to have a new 
              disciple amongst her Koada`Dal children. We Clerics of Tunare offer 
              spiritual guidance to the citizens of Felwithe and when needed aid 
              the Paladins of Tunare and the Keepers of the Art in the defense 
              of our people and forest from those [creatures] that seek to cause 
              us harm. Every young cleric should pursue acquiring a [suit of armor] 
              to protect themselves when aiding those in need outside of the safety 
              of Felwithes walls.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want a suit of armor' </p>
            <p>Terren Starwatcher says 'You will need this Mail Assembly Kit to 
              craft your Sylvan Initiate Armor. The materials required for the 
              armor vary according to which piece you desire to craft. Once you 
              have been suitably outfitted return to me and I will offer [further 
              guidance]. Do you desire to craft [Sylvan Initiate Gauntlets], [Sylvan 
              Initiate Boots], an [Sylvan Initiate Bracer], an [Sylvan Initiate 
              Helm], [Sylvan Initiate Greaves], [Sylvan Initiate Vambraces], or 
              an [Sylvan Initiate Breastplate]?' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft sylvan initiate breastplate' </p>
            <p>Terren Starwatcher says 'To assemble a sylvan initiate breastplate 
              you will need to obtain four bricks of crude bronze and smelt them 
              in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once 
              that is done combine the Crude Bronze Breastplate with a Giant Sylvan 
              Bat Fur, and two Mature Arborean Barks in the Mail Assembly Kit.'<br>

            <p>Terren Starwatcher says 'If you are ready to put your life on the 
              line for the citizens of our homeland than hear my words. The Crushbone 
              Clan of Orcs are evil and strong adversaries of we Koada`Dal. Recently 
              an orc scout assaulted a merchant from our city carrying a valuable 
              amulet from the Fier`Dal city of Kelethin. Our seers have divined 
              the name of the orc that is in possession of the amulet, Gurleg 
              Bribgok. Find this despicable creature and return the amulet to 
              me so that I may return it to its proper owner.' </p>
            <p>Kill Gurleg Bribgok in Greater Faydark at loc 1987, 2304. He spawns 
              with the Orc Arsonist. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Terren Starwatcher gives a you a Rusty Sylvan Morning Star for 
              turning in the amulet from Gurleg Bribgok. You also receive minor 
              experience and positive faction with: Clerics of Tunare, King Tearis 
              Thex, and Anti-Mage. </p>
            <p>Terren Starwatcher says 'You have done well young Ansley. If you 
              continue to show such devotion to your people and your faith then 
              perhaps one day you will serve in the chambers of King Tearis Thex 
              himself. Take this Rusty Sylvan Morning Star and scrape the rust 
              from it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take several 
              attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done 
              bring me the Refined Sylvan Morning Star, a Pristine Drakeling Scales, 
              and an Arborean Amber.' </p>
