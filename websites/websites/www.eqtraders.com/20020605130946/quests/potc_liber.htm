            <b>Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 1 (Fungus Grove, written in Halfling) 
            </b>
<p>I have not always run this Inn.<br>
              In times a-passed, I was much more thin!<br>
              In these works I shall recount my tale,<br>
              On pages extant, lest my memory fail ...<br>
              Once during every thousand years,<br>
              Throughout the shards, across the spheres,<br>
              The planets into alignment fall.<br>
              Through unseen barriers, laws do stall:<br>
              Upon each shard - a sacred Wood.<br>
              The realities bend, and 'twixt them could<br>
              A faithful spirit through them travel,<br>
              Into neighbouring worlds; and space unravel. </p>
            <p>My tale is of one time now passed.<br>
              When the Blessed Grove of each world touched last:<br>
              Priests of Nature, from every sphere,<br>
              For a brief time, met without slightest fear.<br>
              Strangers all, they came as one,<br>
              To praise their Gods, and tell of victories won ...<br>
              A throng of Nature's priests did meet.<br>
              In that Sacred Grove, and each other greet.<br>
              As if they had known one another forever.<br>
              Perhaps kindred spirits, apart but never<br>
              Separate - united by their art,<br>
              Each a single facet of Nature's part.</p>
            <p>After feasting, and much merriment,<br>
              There came a silence, exuberance all spent.<br>
              'Twas the ritual Sacrifice's time,<br>
              And the purpose of this humble rhyme.<br>
              Heed these words, for should ye follow<br>
              In their wake, and not in tawdriness wallow,<br>
              Thou shalt perhaps catch eye of higher powers,<br>
              Whom look down upon our mortal hours,<br>
              And in sacrificing, as did we that night,<br>
              Blessings to ye,m impart they might.<br>
              About ye thy sharpest wits do keep!<br>
              'Til Sacrifice is made, restless be thy sleep!</p>
            <p>For now, ensure to pay closest heed,<br>
              For upon these pages, the secret ye shall read,<br>
              As to the Sacrifice's construction.<br>
              And so, to work ye go, after some deduction.<br>
              Keep handy ye store of scholarly wits,<br>
              For in tongues quite foreign are these writs,<br>
              So from the Heathern to safe-guard,<br>
              The hidden knowledge - by study hard,<br>
              Thou shalt the Naturewalker's Tale unfold,<br>
              And to the eventual Sacrifice travel bold.</p>

            <p>&quot;Nine offerings were made to the Powers,<br>
              Each symbolizing toil of mortal hours,<br>
              Three times three, created by mortals,<br>
              Burned at once, in the Grove between portals,<br>
              Three given by Elvenkind fair,<br>
              Delicate offerings worked with care,</p>
            <p>Three from noble Humanity's kin,<br>
              Each festive creation ushered in,<br>
              And three from Karana's favored race,<br>
              Fitting tribute to their Lord's smiling face,<br>
              First came the priests from Elven lands,<br>
              Their three gifts held in whitened hands...</p>
            <p>There came a tall elf named Sylvaned Tree,<br>
              Carrying a bottle bigger even then me!<br>
              Of workmanship it was most refined,<br>
              the jewelled bottle well definied.<br>
              The bottle itself was first created,<br>
              from magical gold, with opal mated,</p>
            <p>With a glass bottle, by jeweller skilled,<br>
              what gorgeous craft with drink to be filled.<br>
              Once bottle crafted, now came this brew:<br>
              Using the magnum, wine yeast, and double grapes too,<br>
              With a little soda water mixed to taste,<br>
              Not a drop of liquid gone to waste.</p>
            <p>With these fine ingrediants five,<br>
              The result was a champagne for which to strive!<br>
              In order to mix the soda water,<br>
              Ye should seek out Mudhand's Daughter.<br>
              Thus water and soda should ye simply mix,<br>
              To produce more fizz than Fizzlepop's six!</p>
            <p>The elves do brewing in varying strengths,<br>
              adding more or less grapes, such lengths!<br>
              However this drink requires grapes just two,<br>
              Though using one or three can taste fine too.<br>
              With gift upon the fire overturned,<br>
              Back to the throng Silvered Tree returned.&quot;</p>

            <p>Then came the second Elven gift,<br>
              A sacred sickle with poise and lift.<br>
              A smiling elf stepping out from the band,<br>
              Named Summer Sirocco, after warm wind's hand.<br>
              From three main parts were made his Sickle,<br>
              All forged together with hammer fickle.</p>
            <p>First I must tell you of captured essence,<br>
              So that what follows makes more sense.<br>
              Across the worlds there are scattered,<br>
              Runes, words and other magicks mattered.<br>
              Here in Fungus Caves can be found,<br>
              A Celestial Solvent, from elf-girl bound.</p>
            <p>Place a vial of this within a mortar,<br>
              And grind in rune, or word, without water.<br>
              The result is purest magic's flavor,<br>
              With many uses, ye shall savour.<br>
              One such use is in powder blessing:<br>
              Imbue the Elf-deity's gem with Tunarean tressing.</p>
            <p>With this gem, and acid, and magical essence,<br>
              Fire in a kiln, to release the magical presence/<br>
              For each of the Sickle's three main parts,<br>
              The process is similar, say truest hearts:<br>
              Each main part is made of Seven:<br>
              Dust blessed from Tunare's Heaven.</p>
            <p>Your hammer, and a metal sheet,<br>
              Celestial Essence and a temper meet,<br>
              A gem - one from red, green or blue,<br>
              And finally the correct Mold too.<br>
              Whether making blade, hilt or pommel, choose thy Mold,<br>
              And the correct product shall ye behold.</p>
            <p>The temper of which I have said,<br>
              Is brewed from Elf-wine, coloured red,<br>
              Mixed with Magical Essence but,<br>
              Also add a sprig of the leaf that the Sickle shall cut.<br>
              From these three can the temper be made,<br>
              With which this Sickle's game is played.</p>
            <p>With the offering place upon the fire,<br>
              So to the crowd did Summer Sirocco retire. </p>

            <p>From the kilns of Kelethin came offering third,<br>
              A prayer to the Goddess then was heard,<br>
              From the lip of she name Fox's Fyre came,<br>
              Hymns sung in the Elf-Queen's name.<br>
              As the gathering sung in a single voice,<br>
              Upon the fire was placed the Elf druid's choice: </p>
            <p>A shining Idol of Tunare, golden<br>
              From potter's hands, this product molden.<br>
              Eight constituents for this are needed,<br>
              To my earlier words I trust ya heeded!<br>
              Take magic's essence, and water flask,<br>
              And a sizeable block of magical clay for this task,</p>
            <p>With a sketch of the idol, too,<br>
              A lump of gold, and Emerald Imbue,<br>
              With Distilled Mana and your sculpting tool,<br>
              Place on thy Potter's Wheel, as normal rule.<br>
              When ready to firm the clay at fiery heat,<br>
              Use a Godly glaze, and adequate firing sheet.</p>
            <p>With practiced skill and some luck,<br>
              From the kiln's flames the Idol might you pluck.<br>
              Also made by the Potters of Kelethin precarious,<br>
              Other Idols, for deities various.<br>
              It is said that each uses a differing stone,<br>
              Though this is knowledge that I do not own.</p>
            <p>And so it was that the Elf-gifts Three,<br>
              Were all upon the fire beneath the Great Tree.<br>
              The sun that had lit the Grove so far,<br>
              Sunk beneath the trees, and so we saw a Star,<br>
              A sign that the Powers' now did glance,<br>
              Down upon the Congregation's dance. </p>

            <p>Though not solved, this course to thee I show,<br>
              So that in the right direction might ye go.<br>
              Brew together magical essences four, <br>
              And into that mix a special drink they pour:<br>
              Crated by human settlers in the Ice Land<br>
              Explorers, brave adventurers, and</p>
            <p>Made from Allspice; water ye will also need<br>
              With some brown form of native seaweed.<br>
              Using a small glass, you Heater is created,<br>
              Upon which the strongest tastebud can be sated!<br>
              However, ye shall use it to mix, as I have said,<br>
              with magical essences four, as you have read.</p>
            <p>&quot;Listen here&quot;. said the first druid of Man.<br>
              Here is your gift, but I won't like your plan!&quot;<br>
              With fiery tempter and eyes alight,<br>
              From the one named Gosselin many took fright.<br>
              &quot;There are ways and means for druid life,<br>
              My way is the right way, al else is strife!&quot;</p>
            <p>Unto the fire he placed an object strange.<br>
              'Twas a fishing rod, with incredible range.<br>
              The spool was smithed by the look,<br>
              Two velium bits and sandalwood I think it took.<br>
              Then, so strong and pliant the cord,<br>
              What incredible fabric could this afford?</p>
            <p>Perhaps a cord made entirely of silk,<br>
              and treated by tailor, maybe of that ilk.<br>
              It would take the largest egg ye could find<br>
              Then brewed into oil, if I used my mind.<br>
              Use that egg's oil with silk cord to treat.<br>
              That would be the line - it would be quite a feat.</p>

            <p>Also using a pattern, and the gemmed chain,<br>
              And a magical needle, or I am not sane!<br>
              Those basic ingredients six went to form,<br>
              The luxuriant robe, honourably worn.<br>
              Upon the magical silk, I then did wonder,<br>
              A process exact, one cannot blunder!</p>
            <p>Combing a swatch of silk, and magical essence,<br>
              And a pinch of Tunarean dust would make sense.<br>
              The magical needle, now there is a thought -<br>
              I think from a mold and metal bits is it wrought;<br>
              Magical essence and water don't forget to include,<br>
              Then smith in the forge whenever is your mood!</p>
            <p>So mankind and elfkind their gifts are given,<br>
              By love of their Gods to their arts driven.<br>
              A second star appeared brightly in the sky,<br>
              As if the opening of another deity's eye;<br>
              And so, to those of Karan's humble folk,<br>
              To the duty of sacrifice, passion awoke!</p>
            <p>Sorrun, brave halfling, he held high,<br>
              What appeared to be a sumptuous pie!<br>
              So fitting for the halfling kin,<br>
              There is no doubt he is far from thin!<br>
              The pie smelled divine, made from good dough,<br>
              A good shaped pie tin; the filling though</p>
            <p>It seemed familiar, as if it were a paste,<br>
              Created from vile plants in my Caverns, make haste!<br>
              Stay them well, and mix them with flour,<br>
              And cream and allspice, a taste to devour!</p>

            <p>Such a wonderful pie, all the halflings agreed,<br>
              All eyes on the crust, so great was our need!<br>
              That gift delivered, it was my wish,<br>
              To give to Karana our customary dish;<br>
              My eyes well up, tis how strongly I feel,<br>
              When I contemplated this epic meal. </p>
            <p>Listen closely, and I shall teach you the making,<br>
              Though it requires much study of baking!<br>
              The Picnic is something that we all adore,<br>
              One always desires to have just a little more!</p>
            <p>Eight components there are to this feast,<br>
              The first, a cheese, is but the least.<br>
              Add mints, salad and jumjum spiced beer,<br>
              And two slices of jumjum cake, nothing to fear!<br>
              And the eighth is a basket, bringing up the rear.</p>
            <p>The most widely known is the jumjum cake,<br>
              From usual methods, add jumjum, to make!<br>
              Mints are simple, and can be made by the sheaf,<br>
              Just mix frosting with a eucalyptus leaf!</p>
            <p>Now listen closely for brewing of spiced beer - <br>
              Barley, hops, spices and jumjum you shall need near!<br>
              Mix in some water, and into a bottle pour;<br>
              The salad requires ingrediants (sic) four:</p>
            <p>Lettuce, and fennel, vegetables and jumjum,<br>
              Tasty on its own, sometimes nice with rum!<br>
              Mix three frostings and a fruit portion,<br>
              Creates a spread quite lovely, use caution!</p>
            <p>Mix it with bread and a sandwich you'll find.<br>
              That's for the picnic, if you've been left behind!<br>
              Weave two mandrake roots together, task it!<br>
              Then sew in some boning: your picnic basket!</p>
            <p>A meal so good, a while it takes to eat,<br>
              More than a food, a religious treat! </p>

            <p>A final gift of Karana's kind.<br>
              What other treat could I possibly find?<br>
              Something worthy of his attention.<br>
              What better symbol could I mention!<br>
              From my backpack I then withdrew,<br>
              My old talisman, that's seen me through,<br>
              Adventures of all kinds, when I were young,<br>
              And with the brave and foolish fought among.<br>
              The Lucky Cabbage, my faithful friend,<br>
              That's been with me until the end!<br>
              And then to the Elder Gods I did proffer,<br>
              The ninth of Nine, the final offer. </p>
            <p>A cabbage of your own you can enchant,<br>
              Sprinkle dust upon the wild cabbage plant.<br>
              Magical essence, acid, pebble from the plains,<br>
              To place in the kiln is all that remains.<br>
              Thus your blessed dust created,<br>
              Your craving for Lucky Cabbage sated.</p>
            <p>The fire in the Grove roared high,<br>
              Its flames touching the ebon sky,<br>
              The Gods then did upon us shine,<br>
              What they revealed I shall keep mine.</p>
            <p>However, you can perhaps try too,<br>
              By making the Nine sacrificing true,<br>
              In a fiery furnace of suitable heat,<br>
              A smiths forge, perhaps, your needs will meet,</p>
            <p>Remember that the Gods are always looking,<br>
              Make well thy sewing, and fair thy cooking!<br>
              For those of you bold and adequately plucky,<br>
              Come and try thy skills, if ye feelst lucky.</p>
            <p>Such endless talk will wear me thin.<br>
              I shall sleep now, and return to my Inn.</p>
