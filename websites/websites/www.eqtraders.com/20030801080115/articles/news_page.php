<p>
As most, if not all of you, have noticed by now, things were crazier than usual around here for the last couple days.<p>
We ended up moving the boards to a new software package to handle the myriad of bugs that we couldn't address before. The timing sort of took me by surprise, but we're managing.  95% of everything came over just fine, but the other 5% is causing some problems.  (Avatar sizes are still only half-fixed, the nav buttons are gone, the logo needs replacing, and so forth.) We'll get there, but, it will take time, especially with other stuff going on in our lives.<p>
The hard-working folks at Racknine also realized we weren't joking about the extra load when the database went live. We apologize for some flakiness today as they copied the site over to a new server (with newer SQL server software for more "oomph" as well), and then flipped the DNS over. I lost edit access for a bit, as did all the folks doing updates to the site, but we should be good now ... I hope.<p>
I do apologize for all the chaos due to growing pains and the like, and we'll continue our clean-up efforts over the next week or two. This wasn't as seamless as we'd like, but the longer we waited on getting all this out the door, the more likely it was that it would never get done, and I'd just shelve the whole site. :/ I suspect that most of you would be a tad unhappy with that option, so we muddle along as best we can. {tired grin}</p>

<p><span class="headers">July 25, 2003 - Stray Updates</span>
<p>
Just a few things, before I finally go get some sleep.<p>
<ul><li>The mass enchant spells for cultural metals (adamantite, mithril, steel, brellium) are currently not working as intended. It is fixed on Test. Unfortunately, even after more than one warning from EQTC staff, the message board thread regarding this issue degenerated into SoE-bashing, and will not be revived, so take this as your warning that there's a problem until the next patch.</li>
<li>The serverwide.eqtraders channel is pretty much MIA. Someone passworded it, nobody seems to know who did it or what the new password is. Since I've never had (nor wanted) ownership of that chat channel, there's not a lot I can do about it. There's a <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=9437">message board thread</a> discussing alternative channel possibilities.</li>
<li>The database forum is up and running. Again, I ask that you please keep the commentary there, and NOT in DenMother's Corner, direct PMs to me, etc. I'm feeling very extremely overloaded, if you couldn't tell from the last front page update from me, and I am literally cringing every time I hit the boards right now. Please, folks, ease up on the PMs, the feature requests we've already said to WAIT on, and such.</li>
<li>Gukta trade supplies fell through a crack, and I've not slept in about 22 hours. I'll finish them after sleep.</li></ul>
I want to add my thanks to Ngreth's to all of you who have helped make this database a reality. I'm not coherent enough to go through a list without missing someone and likely offending them horribly, so I'll just say a huge thank you to all of you at once for now.  {exhausted halfling hugs}</p>

<p><span class="headers">July 21, 2003 - Welcome to the database!</span>
<p>
If you're reading this, you're now seeing the database version of the site. (For the non-beta testers, this means that we've finally recovered from exploding computer power supplies, sorted out the issues with backing up a far-too-large dev versoin of the item database, and so on.)<p>
It's been a rough year, getting all of this ready, and we're not done with it yet. At the rate this game changes, we may never be fully done with it. It is, however, done enough for the public to come play.  I'm excited, I'm relieved, I'm very burnt out on the entire EQ tradeskill thing, and this site.<p>
To go along with the burnt out thing, here's <b>a few things to note before you post a single, solitary thing about the database:</b>
<ul><li>We'll have a database bug forum in place for true-blue bugs (incorrect trivials, incorrect recipes, etc.) within 24 hours of the database launching.  We'll set up some posting rules so it doesn't turn into total anarchy, and you'll want to read the sticky there before posting to it.</li>
<li>Don't PM me with bugs. Don't email me with bugs.  Don't post in the DenMother's Corner with bugs. See the above about the bug forum. I won't be the only person tackling bugs, and addressing something personally to me adds unneccessary grief. Drop it in the proper forum so it can be tackled as someone has time for it.</li>
<li>Not all quest recipes are in the database. It will take time, and the primary focus has been on main tradeskill recipes, not quest recipes. <b>This means do NOT submit a bug report if you find a quest recipe missing from the database!</b> If the actual quest is missing from the quests writeup, then you can submit a writeup for the quest, but it is not yet considered a "bug" if we don't have every single quest recipe in the db.</li>
<li>Not all item prices are in place. Not even close. Once the dust settles, we'll likely be looking for some help with getting that fleshed out now, but please, don't be helpful and flood the forums, or my mailbox, with offers.  When/if we want volunteers, we'll say so. Until then, you're making more work with your offers, not helping with the problem.</li>
<li>Not all mob sources are in the database. I take full blame for that. I am working on it, slowly. It's an ugly set of lists, it's a messy collection of mobs, and I'm having to triple-check a lot of stuff before adding the 13 zillionth form of cat to yet another zone, for example.</li>
<li>Hold all feature requests! Do not put them in the bug forum, do not put them in DenMother's Corner, do not PM me with them, do not submit them to us in any way until we say so!  I repeat: <b>do not give us feature requests, requests to change display formats, search formats, etc., etc. at this time.</b> When the dust has settled, and Ngreth is ready to tackle some requests, we'll set up a submission method.  We will gladly ignore any and all people who feel they must ignore this and flood us with requests.  Those of you who turn your requests into demands or orders, will find I am a very burnt out and frazzled redhead who is not amused with the folks who are "instructing" me on what I must do for my site. Please remember that we cannot please everyone, some requests simply may be either technically impossible, or too resource-intensive. We reserve the right to say no if something is beyond the scope of what we can/want to do.</li></ul>
<p>I really hate having this much negativity on the front page, but as we learned from the beta phase, even with things spelled out this much, folks will still ignore all this and post whatever the blazes they feel like, and my tolerance is very, very thin right now. This has been a year-long nightmare, and the straw that broke the camel's back, and I've totally stopped playing EQ, as the game has been turned from play into "work" for me.  No, I'm not looking for sympathy, or another several dozen emails, posts, etc. of support, I'm just telling it like it is. Those who decide to <b>demand</b> more than I can give, or who decide that the forum rules are not meant for them, will find I'm a lot less tolerant of such things now that this has turned from a "labor of love" to simply "hard labor". While I hope folks will find the new format more helpful than the old static pages, I'm no longer going to stress because I can only please 95% of a far-too-large population.

<p>
It seems I was premature in promising that the next update would be from the new site. There was just a loud BANG from downstairs ... the House Ogre's computer literally blew up ... it'll be a few days before the replacement power supply is here. <i>(And we mean literally blew up!! I almost fell out of my chair in startlement. - Ngreth)</i> You guessed it ... there's irreplaceable info on that machine that we need in order to move the DB from the test site to the production side. We'll give a new ETA when able.</p>
