            <h3>Armor of the Ordained - Freeport Cleric Quest</h3>
            <p>This is one of several armor quests for younglings that was recently 
              added. This one is for Freeport human clerics, and will be HUM/CLR, 
              no drop and lore (other than bracer). <i>Please note that while 
              the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make 
              your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>The following items must be combined in the Gem Encrusted Mail 
              Kit obtained by talking to Salinsa Delfdosan outside the Temple 
              of Marr.</p>
            <p>Each item is made from the special material obtained by combining 
              the correct items in the kit, and the specific mold, also obtained 
              from Salinsa Delfdosan, combined in a forge. Trivial &lt;=21 smithing 
              skill and are no-fail combines. Armor is grey with a slight purple 
              tinge. </p>
            <p>You say 'Hail Salinsa Delfdosan' </p>
            <p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Pleasure to meet you ____, I am Lady Salinsa 
              Deifdosan of House Marr. I have spent many hours on the battlefield 
              in service of our glorious god however these days I spend my time 
              training new [recruits].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'What recruits' </p>
            <p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Well you see sense I am such a well seasoned 
              adventurer my knowledge is very helpful to the young members of 
              our house. That is why I have developed a system of hunting and 
              gathering assignments that reward the new recruit with a set of 
              armor that they work very hard to craft themselves. Are you a [young 
              cleric of House Marr]? If so I will be happy to offer my assignments 
              to you.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a young cleric of Marr' </p>
            <p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Great! Let me first begin by explaining 
              how you will be creating your own armor. You will use this magical 
              kit I have presented you with to gather numerous [recipe components]. 
              Your magical kit will be used to gather specific materials that 
              will form together in certain numbers and quantities to create an 
              armor material. You must then take the material you have fashioned 
              to a forge along with armor molds that I will supply you with to 
              create your armor.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'What recipe components' </p>
            <p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'There are many different items that you 
              will need to collect for your material components in all areas surrounding 
              Freeport and our temple. I will be able to supply you with the mold 
              for any armor piece you [want] to craft. I have the molds and recipes 
              necessary for [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], 
              [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to craft a piece 
              simply tell me what piece you would like to craft. For example if 
              you wanted to create boots you would say, &#147;I want to craft 
              boots&#148;.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a helm' </p>
            <p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Any cleric should always be very selective 
              about what headpiece they choose for it can mean the difference 
              between life and death. To create your helm material you will need 
              to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Leaf Scarab Carapace, 1 
              Armadillo Tooth and 2 Fish Scales in your assembly kit. Once you 
              have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this 
              mold to fashion your very own Helm of the Ordained.'</p>

              the battlefield. If an enemy was to wound you about the wrist area 
              you may find it difficult to channel your spell. To create your

              can be quite devastating. To create your armguard material you will

              been a thorn in our side ever sense they were trusted to care for 
              our city during the crusade. Things have never been the same sense 
              then and things are actually starting to get worse. There have been 
              numerous reports of Freeport Militia soldiers harassing all those 
              that do not follow their rules of tyranny. My sister was bringing 
              me a newsletter from qeynos when she was abducted. She escaped but 
              [Deisnak] stole the newsletter she was delivering to me.' </p>

              to retrieve my newsletter for me by all means necessary. It had 
              some very important messages from Qeynos and I must have it. Return 
              to me with my newsletter and 2 Pristine Spider Eyes and I will reward 
              you greatly for your efforts.' <font color="#400000"><i>Note that
