              by Ellesidil</p>
            <p><i>(DenMother's Note: the following process will not work for Paineel 
              merchants, other than the newspaper vendor, due to the fact that 
              Paineel merchants refuse to sell back any items that they purchase 
              from players)</i></p>
            <p>I have heard of this thing called "vendor mining" what is that? 
              In order to answer this question, you have to understand merchants 
              and their inventory in EQ. When you sell a merchant an item, if 
              they have an open visible slot, it fills that slot. What happens 
              when a merchant has no visible open slot? The item you just sold 
              them goes "under the counter". It is not deleted, just not visible. 
              Knowing this, it is possible for a vendor to have 100 or more pelts 
              that you may be interested and you cannot see them. <br>
              Mining vendors can be a useful way to get a large number of pelts 
              in a short amount of time. I personally do not use it when looking 
              for specific pelts like HQ bear. It tends to be too costly for the 
              return, but if you are looking for any quality pelt, it can be well 
              worth your time. That being said, often the best places to mine 
              are vendors that can have at least two or more of the following 
              in various qualities cat, wolf,and bear pelts, and/or spider and 
              spiderling silks. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Where do I choose most often? The vendor in Everfrost, near the 
              Halas zone line. Why would I travel that far, three major reasons. 
              First and foremost, it is that far away from everywhere else and 
              that will deter most people from going out there to mine. Secondly, 
              there are wolves, bears, and spiderlings killed in large quantities 
              in the canyons nearby. Third there are two vendors on top of each 
              other and when I stand between them, I can buy from one, turn and 
              click on the other and sell directly back to the other. <br>
              How do you mine a vendor? Well there are a couple of steps. </p>
            <p><ol>
              <li>Learn the relative value of a product and it's resale value to 
	      a vendor. Fine steel weapons are a prime example of a "no-no" when 
	      vendor mining. The cost to you is extravagant compared to the 
	      resale value to a vendor, can cost 60+ plat and sell for a mere 5 
	      plat. The key to a successful mining mission is to spend as little 
	      as possible and get as much as possible in return. </li>
              <li>Gather up one (at least) of every item that you are looking to 
	      mine. This could include one of each quality pelt you are looking 
	      to buy, with a spider silk or spiderling silk. I call these "test" 
	      items. </li>
              <li>Once you have a relative idea of the cost of a certain item to 
	      buy and sell back, and a few "test" items, you look for the cheap 
	      stuff in the vendor's inventory that you can sell back for as much 
	      as half or more with high faction and charisma. Start purchasing as 
	      much as any given "good buy" as you can until a slot opens in the 
	      vendor's window. When a slot has opened, sell back one of the 
	      "test" items you are looking for. If that item appears in the open 
	      window, then the vendor has no more of that item "under the 
	      counter" and you should buy it back now. If it does not appear in 
	      the window then the vendor has at least one more of that "under the 
	      counter". I keep buying and selling "test" items until I have a 
	      feel for what the vendor has, then I decide if I am gonna mine the 
	      merchant. </li>
              <li>When you have determined that this merchant has at least one or 
	      more items that you are looking for, it is time to decide if you 
	      are gonna take the "plunge" and go for it. It really is a gamble as 
	      someone (like me) might have mined that merchant the day before and 
	      grabbed the bulk of the useful things that you are looking for, and 
	      the merchant only has one or two of each "test" item under the 
	      counter. There is no way to know this until you start finding the 
	      "test" items. </li>
              <li>When you have decided to go for it, there is a decision yet to 
	      make. Should you do a shout and ask people not to sell to this 
	      vendor, or not? I personally will do a quick "who" on the zone to 
	      see whether I think I will have someone try to take advantage of my 
	      mining the merchant and come when most of the junk is gone and 
	      start buying up all the goodies while I am selling. If not, I will 
	      usually announce it and let people know I am mining. Most will ask 
	      what I am doing and I will give a quick response, letting them know 
	      I will buy the pelts off of them directly for more than the 
	      merchant will pay. If I feel I will have competition, I will not 
	      announce it and simply keep going. <br>
              Why would I choose to announce it? There is little more 
	      irritating than buying up a merchant for half an hour and start 
	      getting to the goodies than to have someone come and unload a bunch 
	      of fine steel weapons onto that merchant and cause me to buy them 
	      up to get back to the product I am looking for. Remember if the 
	      slot is open and someone sells something to the merchant that they 
	      do not have, it will appear in the open window. </li>
              <li>Now start buying all the cheap and good return items i.e. rusty 
	      weapons, bone chips, and the like. When you open a slot, close the 
	      window and see what appears, if it is not what you are looking for, 
	      choose the next item and repeat until you cannot buy any more. Find 
	      the nearest merchant and sell the stuff back to that merchant and 
	      begin again. Eventually, if noone beats you to it, you will run 
	      into the "test" items and any number of others that the merchant 
	      has to sell. Buy them up and repeat until you have your fill of 
	      items. </li>
            </ol><p></p>
            <p>Some general statements about mining. <br>
            </p>
            <p>When you sell a "test" item and it does not appear in the window, 
              if you do not mine the merchant you will not be able to get it back. 
              If you decide not to mine the merchant, you will have to kill mobs 
              until you get a replacement "test" item. <br>
            </p>
            <p>I usually will not mine unless I have in excess of 500 plat to 
              throw into it. Nothing more disconcerting then spending your last 
              200 plat and not finding your "test" items. The main reason for 
              that is if the merchant has that much "junk", most likely noone 
              has mined them for a while, and you could hit the jackpot with another 
              100 plat. Or not. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Charisma and faction are key to the price you pay and the price 
              you get, try raising faction in the area for a while before mining 
              that merchant, it will cost you less in the long run. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Mining is a result of a lot of luck and some preparation, some 
              things to keep in mind, if your server has been down recently, or 
              the merchant has been killed recently, they will loose their inventory. 
              Never mine a merchant the day after a server comes up, and never 
              mine merchants who are routinely killed for exp (Shady in EC Tunnel 
              on my server). <br>
            </p>
            <p>You can try to mine for only one item, but that tends to be a huge 
              risk, when I am mining Everfrost, I keep the spider legs (baking), 
              the bone chips (necro alt), the med and low quality pelts get made 
              into padding, the ruined get made into patchwork for nearby low 
              level players. The high quality gets made into backpacks (bear) 
              and reinforced leather ((wolf)when I needed the skill ups, now they 
              get downgraded for padding), and the polar bear pelts get traded 
              for faction to continually get me to ally status in Halas (better 
              prices). That is how I make the best of it. <br>
            </p>
            <p>You can get as lucky as I have and pull over 200 ruined pelts, 
              75 low quality, 50 medium quality and 30 high quality bear pelts 
              (same ratio and quantity of wolf pelts), 15 polar bear pelts (good 
              for halas faction), too many bone chips to count (had to stop buying 
              them when I ran out of room), and over 250 spiderling silks like 
              I did in 3 hours in Everfrost once, or you could blow 500 plat and 
              get 15 total pelts like I did one other time in Everfrost. It really 
              is a gamble, but one I am willing to take occasionally in the game. 
              <br>
              Good luck, should you choose this method, I only do it when a friend 
              needs padding and I could use some extra cash, we split the cost 
              on the mining and usually make out fairly well. </p>
