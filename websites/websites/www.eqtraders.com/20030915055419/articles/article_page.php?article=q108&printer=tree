<span class="headers">Qeynos Bertoxxulous Warrior (Scourge Warrior) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and are restricted to HUM, HEF/WAR (other than the sword, which is not HEF-useable at this time). This quest originates in the Qeynos Aqueducts with Rocthar Bekesna. </i><i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>.
</p>
<p>
You say,'Hail, Rocthar Bekesna'
<p>
Rocthar Bekesna says'I've little time for banter, unless you have come to me for training as a [new warrior] of the Bloodsabers move along.' 
</p>
<p>
You say,'I am a new Warrior' 
</p>
<p>
Rocthar Bekesna says'A warrior want to be is more like it. You¿ve got a lot of work to do if you¿re going to be a valued member of the temple of Bertoxxulous, the Plague Bringer. That pompous ruler Antonius Bayle IV has this city in a tight grip with the support of our enemies, the temples of Rodcet Nife and Karana. It is not safe for us to walk the streets of Qeynos openly. You must learn to hold your tongue when not within the walls of our temple here in the Qeynos Catacombs. Should the Qeynos Guards discover your devotion to the Plague Bringer they would surely execute you. We have enemies all about and you must [learn to defend] yourself.' 
</p>
<p>
You say,'I want to learn to defend myself' 
</p>
<p>
Rocthar Bekesna says'Take this note to Illie Roln. She will help get you outfitted in a suit of armor. Once you have been properly outfitted return to me and I will tell you how you can make yourself useful. I have a [small task] in mind.' 
</p>
<p>
Take note to Illie Roln by the sacrificial pool. 
</p>
<p>
Illie Roln says'Ah, so you are in need of a suit of armor fitting a young scourge warrior of the Bloodsabers. I will assist you. You will use this Mail Assembly Kit to construct the pieces of armor. Each piece will require different materials for its proper construction. Do you seek to assemble [Gauntlets of the Scourge Warrior], [Boots of the Scourge Warrior], a [Bracer of the Scourge Warrior], a [Helm of the Scourge Warrior], [Greaves of the Scourge Warrior], [Vambraces of the Scourge Warrior], or a [Breastplate of the Scourge Warrior]?' 
</p>
<p>
You say,'I seek to assemble Gauntlets of the Scourge Warrior' 
</p>
<p>
Illie Roln says'To assemble scourge warrior gauntlets you will need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge] with a Water Flask and this crude Gauntlet Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Iron Gauntlets with a Ruined Wolf Pelt and two Gnoll Finger Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'

<p>
 You say,'What small task?' 
</p>
<p>
Rocthar Bekesna says'The Priests of Life and Knights of Thunder often travel the roads from Qeynos carrying messages for the farmers of the Plains of Karana and the Knights of Truth in Freeport on the opposite coast of Antonica. We have recently been sending Bloodsabers to the Plains of Karana in search of a possible location for a new hidden temple should the need arise. One of the messengers of the Knights of Thunder has alerted the peasants of the plains the possibility of a Bloodsaber presence there and is using them to track our motions. Find the messenger, Lukas Hergo, and bring me his head.' 
</p>
<p>
Head to West Karana and close to the small village in the far left corner you will find Lukas Hergo. Kill him and go back to the guild and give Rocthar his head. (The faction hits for the goodly factions in Qeynos is very small so there is no worry of becoming KoS or even dropping a faction when killing Lukas.) 
</p>
<p>
Rocthar Bekesna says'Well done Xxyl. Now take this Rusty Scourge Warrior Broadsword to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done take the Tarnished Scourge Warrior Sword and a Giant King Snake Skin to Illie Roln and he will put the finishing touches on the weapon.' 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Your faction standing with Bloodsabers got better. <br />
 Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got worse. <br />
 Your faction standing with Opal Dark Briar got better. <br />
 Your faction standing with Priests of Life got worse. <br />
 Your faction standing with Corrupt Qeynos Guards got better. <br />
 You gain experience!! 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As he says, sharpen the blade and find yourself a Giant King Snake Skin. They drop from the Giant King Snakes in Qeynos Hills. The snakes themselves are rare spawns and the skins are rare drops so don't get discouraged. 
</p>
<p>
Give the skin and the tarnished blade to Illie and he'll give you back a Broadsword of the Scourge Warrior. (sorry, I forgot to log the text on the final turn in) You get experience and the same faction hits above upon turn in.
