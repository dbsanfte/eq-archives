            <p class="black">Hail and well met, citizens of Norrath! Do you want 
              to learn a trade skill? Do you want to sell the fruits of your labor 
              to other players? Are you trying to find specific items to pratice 
              your craft? Or are you just trying to find someone who sells player-crafted 
              items for a reasonable price on your server? If the answer to any 
              of these questions is "yes", then I hope this site will be of assistance 
              to you. If you can't find the information you need on the main part 
              of the website, it's likely that you can find the answers you need 
              on the message board.</p>

                <b><u>PART TWO:</u></b> I promised some happier stuff in Part 
                One of today's update (written earlier today). Since then, I've 
                managed to get stats for one piece of ice burrower silk armor, 
                and one of the three velium hound recipes. Eventually, more will 
                follow, but these are high-level mobs, and the parts are hard 
                for any of us tradesfolk to come by, since we're generally so 
                busy huddled over our sewing kits as to not be of a high enough 
                level to hunt these beasts for ourselves. ;)</p>
              <p>I also sent in feedback via the new Sony process for their message 
                boards, regarding today's patch message. I'm sure I'm not the 
                only one that caught the newest &quot;oops&quot; with the note 
                about specialized tradeskill containers telling folks to rely 
                on in-game information and NPC text, then the statement that the 
                Velious tailoring now has to use the Coldain Tanning Kit ... but 
                they forgot to add the note about the kit to the proper recipe 
                book (i.e., Velium Leathers) and/or to any NPC that folks have 
                hailed in Thurgadin. It's been submitted, we'll see where it goes 
                from there. In the meantime, I'll continue to keep on verifying 
                recipes, and making sure that functioning ones are listed here, 
                even when that conflicts with information in the books, etc.</p>
              <p>(As a side note, the only recipes that we are positive that they 
                require the Coldain Tanning Kit are the Velium Leathers. To my 
                knowledge, no testing has been done on the Fine Furs. Reports 
                have come in that the crystalline silks work in a normal large 
                sewing kit OR the Coldain Tanning Kit ... and there was no way 
                I was going to risk the ice burrower silk today to a normal kit. 
                It definitely works in the Coldain Tanning Kit.)</p>
              <p><b><u>PART ONE:</u></b> The &quot;About&quot; page has been updated 
                at long last. I'm not happy to have to spell things out as bluntly 
                as I did there, and I fear it will give the wrong message to the 
                99.9% of you who are truly emjoying/using this resouce, while 
                the 0.1% of the ingrates that have spurred the change blithely 
                ignore it, and try to hound me until I get fed up enough to throw 
                in the towel and close all this down.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, once we've got some more positive news on tradeskills 
                (such as after I get my hands on the ice burrower silk and velium 
                hound fur that folks in one of the bigger guilds on my server 
                are risking life and limb to obtain for recipe verification and 
                testing), I'll be glad to balance all this depressing stuff with 
                happier celebration. ;)</p>
              <p><b>Time will tell:</b> if the changes to the SONY boards means 
                that they are continuing their recent track record of ignoring 
                anything that is uncomfortable to them, or if it will truly mean 
                that there will be more positive change and improvement on things 
                that are currently broken (and repeatedly reported as bugs) ... 
                if something to bridge the 131 to 230+ tailoring gap will be put 
                in within a few weeks, or take months, if it ever goes in at all 
                ... if the steelsilk recipes (aka Terrorantula silks) that have 
                been in-game for a few weeks will be actually functional, with 
                all parts dropping in reasonable amounts (more than 2 or 3 silks 
                per server per day) on the live servers within a month ... if 
                the sense of &quot;community&quot; that was on the SONY boards 
                has been totally destroyed by the sudden changes on the SONY boards 
                just at a time when a noticeable chunk of the EQ community can't 
                stay connected due to the recent patch or if folks will continue 
                to be forgiving, even though the timing on the board revamp was 
                horrific ... whether recipe books will be updated to be correct 
                any time in our lifetime (this includes not only the Velium Leatherworking 
                book which doesn't make any mention of Coldain Tanner's Kit and 
                never has, but also things like the several baking recipe books 
                that have been incorrect for well over a year) ... whether other 
                tradeskill improvements that were promised and/or hinted at many 
                months ago will be seen any time, *in a fully working order* will 
                be seen any time in the next half a year.</p>
              <p>I won't hold my breath, but life goes on. So do tradeskills. 
                There's always something more that needs verification, more stats 
                that need to be scrounged, etc., etc. You can play a passive part 
                and simply slurp up the wealth of information provided here, or 
                you can dive in, pitch in, and instead of saying &quot;I can't 
                believe she doesn't have <i>X</i> yet, since it's out on the net&quot;, 
                spend the extra few minutes to go out on &quot;the net&quot;, 
                find it, and post it here. </p>
              <p>The message boards are, as expected, seeing a higher load than 
                ever before. A second message board admin has been added, but, 
                as always, this is a labor of love for the folks that help out 
                around here and stomping around finding fault with stuff instead 
                of rolling up your sleeves and helping out is, and always has 
                been, considered bad form on in <i>this</i> community.</p>

                <b>Velious recipes now need the Coldain Tanner's Kit</b>. Imagine 
                that. Almost 4 months AFTER the recipes are put in game, they 
                retroactively &quot;fix&quot; the recipes to not work in a normal 
                sewing kit, wait a day, then announce they were supposed to use 
                a different kit all along, then they bring down Thurgadin on all 
                servers to patch in said Tanner's Kit. Oh, SO sorry for the inconvenience 
                folks, this is what we intended all along, but had to do bass-ackwards 
                &quot;fix&quot; before we bothered telling anyone about the fix, 
                nor before we fixed the recipe books or put the kit in place. 
                That's no way to run a business.</p>
              <p>Before this patch, earlier today, I posted about the Velious 
                tailoring problems, and counseled patience, since I had faith 
                that Verant would find the problem and fix it. Foolish halfling. 
                My rose-colored glasses are now ground into dust, and the only 
                thing I have faith in is that they've finally pushed me over the 
                edge. Even when I've been upset at how things are working, and 
                upset with snerts in-game, I've tried VERY hard to put a positive 
                spin on things and not degenerate into Verant-bashing, but right 
                now I am SO steamed at the folks responsible for this mismanaged 
                &quot;fix&quot; that it isn't funny. It's taken two years, but 
                I've lost my faith in them ... but not in the wonderful folks 
                in this tradeskill community, so I'll keep plugging along, somehow, 
                for your sake.</p>
              <p>That having been said -- loyal visitors to this site and the 
                message boards, please brace yourselves, the worst is to come. 
                Verant's tired of folks getting mad at them when they mess up, 
                have pretty much taken away their message boards, and I expect 
                a large backwash of angry folks here.</p>
              <p>I know we're all going to want to rant and rave here, since they've 
                taken away places where issues can be raised elsewhere. Just remember: 
                This site is not connected to Verant. This site is at best viewed 
                by them as a &quot;fan&quot; site and at worst as a &quot;spoiler&quot; 
                site, and some of them would probably like nothing better than 
                to see it go under. If you use my boards as the dumping ground 
                for everything you're pissed at <i>them</i> about, it just might 
                go under as I hit total burnout and total frustration. Remember: 
                yes, folks here want to know about things that don't work BUT 
                if you're reporting something broken here, you'd better report 
                it to Verant through their lovely new submission process too. 
                Oh, and don't mention you got the recipes from here, else they're 
                likely to ignore you as working from &quot;spoiler&quot; recipes. 
                {rolls eyes}</p>
              <p>I am putting up a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm58">&quot;Primal 
                Scream Room&quot;</a> message board forum. If you need to just 
                blow your top over this, do it there. Do NOT dump it onto the 
                other forums, such as the Tailoring section, etc. Keep it as clean 
                as you can. Do not use that area to do personal attacks against 
                others. Other than that, those of you that want to just plug your 
                ears and keep on going with your tradeskills are free to do so 
                in the rest of the forums, with less screaming going on in them.</p>

                <b> Patch update!</b> Today's patch has reports of one improvement 
                for tradesfolk (combine messages for your party members) and one 
                report of a problem. I've NOT had time to test the problem out 
                personally (I'm on the second floor of Hate at the moment), but 
                several respected tradesfolk are reporting <font color="#400000"><b>problems 
                with <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_leathers.htm">Velium Leathers</a> 
                recipes that have worked perfectly well up until this patch</b></font>. 
                So far, the cobalt drake belt, tigeraptor belt and cloak are reported 
                with problems for at least some folks on some servers. PLEASE 
                be careful on your combines until this can be investigated and 
                addressed. (Someone's already posted to the SONY boards about 
                it.) </p>
              <p>In the meantime, yes, the Velious tailoring section has been 
                re-done. I know it confused a lot of folks when it was done, and 
                I wasn't able to announce it properly because there was a bit 
                of a fibercut problem yesterday and I couldn't get to the site 
                when I had time for updates. However, there really are buttons 
                once you get to the Velious tailoring recipes section that lead 
                you to the Fine Furs, the Silks (crystalline and ice burrower) 
                and the Velium Leathers. I apologize for the confusion, but hope 
                the information is a bit more manageable in smaller chunks, rather 
                than all thrown together like it was before. :)</p>
              <p>One LAST time, before I start having my mail forwarding service 
                start flinging email back at folks with a message telling folks 
                to tell it to the message boards instead of to me. Screen shots 
                of tradeskill fashions go to <a href="mailto:fashion@eqtraders.com">fashion@eqtraders.com</a> 
                (yes, if she stays missing much longer, I'll find another fashion 
                editor volunteer and this email will go to them instead). Trade 
                guides go to <a href="mailto:guides@eqtraders.com">guides@eqtraders.com</a>. 
                Information on trivials, new recipes, new merchants and &quot;how 
                do I ...&quot; and &quot;where can I ...&quot; and &quot;what 
                is the recipe for ...&quot; go to the message boards. I can and 
                will delete email from folks that think that one little halfling 
                has the time and energy to deal with the flood of folks who seem 
                to expect personal attention in email for things that are better 
                handled by the tradeskill community at large. Yes, there are things 
                that should be directed to me in email, but the above are not 
                part of that list. Folks, I know, there are many of you who think 
                I'm now a &quot;bitchy, whining, redhead&quot; for repeating this, 
                but it's just NOT sinking in to some of you, and, believe it or 
                not, I'm as tired of repeating this as you are of hearing it. 
                One of the many reasons I created this website was so that I would 
                NOT get hammered with the junk that folks are still trying to 
                insist I handle all by myself. There's a huge pile of information 
                on this site, and an active community on the message board. Use 
                them instead of trying to burn me out even faster by sending me 
                email questions/comments that should be handled here.</p>
              <p>More once I'm coherent. I have a ton of recipe pages to fix now.</p>

                Even though folks were told to &quot;check your books&quot; by 
                Verant, scouring the lands high and low has found nothing new 
                in any books. The jewelry book text has been modified a bit, but 
                contains nothing new. The only other &quot;book&quot; is the Terorantula 
                silk stuff, which was live a week ago, and is totally useless 
                until the silk is in game. Arctic wyvern armor doesn't count as 
                new, because the recipe has been in-game since Velious launched, 
                just nonfunctional. There are a couple of new things, but not 
                from any book we've found ... a) there's a new <a href="secrets/recipes_pottery.htm">pottery 
                recipe</a> for a Thurgadin quest, that can be used to make a no 
                drop Thurgadin Gate potion. b) at least one velium weapon can 
                now be smithed, possibly more. It wasn't found from a book, but 
                from experimentation. Keep up the good work on trying stuff out 
                and <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=1787.topic">posting

                to them, the more likely they are to continue here with their 
                antics. Nuff said.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty fed up/burnt out due to a lot of things right now, 
                and will be taking several steps back to take a few deep breaths. 
                I'll likely be less visible in-game for a while, which means less 
                speedy verification of some information for the site. Hang in 
                there, folks, the idjits may have me down, but I'm not giving 
                up yet.</p>

                <b>Patch Day.</b> After seeing the patch message, I know folks 
                are going to be screaming through here at Mach 20 hoping for news. 
                The front page will be updated as information comes in, but a 
                couple things before the floodgates are opened. Questions, comments, 
                discoveries, etc. go to the message boards, please. Do NOT send 
                me email with patch information - <i>six</i> people have already 
                felt the need to email me telling me there's new tradeskill stuff 
                in this patch (I know folks mean well, but, seriously, I <i>do</i> 
                check patch messages myself). Do NOT tell bomb me to give me information 
                OR to ask if something has been found. I will be BEYOND swamped 
                today trying to verify things, and the more you bother me, the 
                slower you and everyone else, will get the information you want. 
                Nuff said. I shouldn't have to repeat myself on this.</p>
              <p><b>Cod</b> is in game and fished in Cobalt Scar. The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">arctic 
                wyvern armor</a> makes shaman-only armor. Yes, we've got full 
                stats. No, you don't want to know how much money my guild and 
                I spent to make that many studs and such in prep for today. (And 
                yes, there was an &quot;oops&quot; in the recipe page for a couple 
                hours. It really does need arctic wyvern hides, and the page has 
                been fixed accordingly.)</p>
              <p>As for the many &quot;other&quot; new recipes that were mentioned 
                for the patch ... none have been found. The Terrorantula Silk 
                (aka &quot;steelsilk&quot;) recipes were actually available on 
                a merchant since <i>last</i> patch ... and the silk isn't dropping 
                in-game yet. Since the message said to check our &quot;books&quot;, 
                folks are scrounging recipe books left, right, center and diagonally 
                from all across the lands and have yet to find any of the new 
                recipes in old books, much less in new books. Hmmm ... further 
                discussion is on the message boards. Something may turn up yet, 
                but I'm understandably burnt out from the &quot;sewing bee&quot; 
                earlier today, so I'm taking the rest of the night off from tradeskills 
                ... really. I can do it. I won't try out anything more tonight, 
                even though I have more pel.... &quot;Step away from the sewing 
                kit, DenMother ...&quot;</p>

                <b>Poor Ester the Tester</b> is ill, but she managed to dig up 
                some information for us. Cod is still missing, but it's supposed 
                to go in during tomorrow's patch. Mind you, they've told her this 
                before, and it's not gone in, but I'm going to cross my fingers, 
                toes and eyes that tomorrow, at long last, we'll be able to finally 
                see the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">arctic wyvern armor</a> 
                that has been dangling in front of our noses since the launch 
                of Velious. :)</p>

                <b>Patch Day.</b> A happy note for tradesfolk who can never remember 
                what their skill is in a certain tradeskill. Your skills listing 
                will now list your skill level, if it is above 100.</p>
              <p>The frustrating hunt for cod begins .. again. This <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=816.topic" target="_new">message 
                board thread</a> will contain updates on our search. Feel free 
                to grab a pole, several stacks of bait, and check out various 
                zones for yourself, then post the information to the boards.</p>
              <p>There is new silk tailoring now to be found on Velious, using 
                crystalline silk and ice burrower silk. All stats are verified 
                for the crystalline silk, but the ice burrowers are not only a 
                higher level mob (Western Wastes), but a lot more expensive, too. 
                :) Soooo, expect it to be a while before we have verified recipes 
                for those. In the meantime, recipes can be found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious 
                recipes page</a>. Sometime this week I hope to revamp all the 
                tailoring pages, including this one, but at least you can get 
                to the recipes while I'm doing so.</p>
