            <h3> PoP Planar Armor Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p><i>(Note that this quest requires the Planes of Power expansion.) 
              </i>It will take time to have complete details on this quest, as 
              it requires specific PoP character flags in order to obtain the 
              proper response, and items, from the NPC. While the final combine 
              for this armor does NOT require any tradeskill ability, the quest 
              is included here due to the need for several player-made items for 
              the combine. 
            <p>Bor Warhammer in Plane of Tranquility is willing to share his secrets 
              (and the appropriate combine container and emblem) to making planar 
              armor ... for a price. He also is unwilling to share this information 
              with just anyone, and will not deal with you unless you have certain 
              character flags. (<i>It appears that you may need to be flagged 
              as having defeated Terris-Thule in order to proceed with this quest. 
              However, we're still testing various flag combinations to see if 
              tier 1 deity events will work.</i>) The armor molds/patterns, which 
              are only mob drops (they are not vendor items), are tradeable. The 
              final result is not. 
            <p>His response to a properly flagged person will vary based on your 
              character class. 
            <p><b>All classes: </b> 
            <p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Bor Wharhammer' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Greetin's t'ye ____! Isn't the area 'round 
                'ere so nice an' quiet? Such a departure from me old days; slaving 
                o'er the forge t'create masterpieces! T'be 'onest, at times I 
                do miss the old forge, but after I created me finest breastplate, 
                it seemed as if nothing else I made could ever live up t'it. So 
                I left me home to'wander the land an' see what I could learn o'the 
                world. I 'ave learned quite a bit from the elders 'ere an' the 
                skilled craftspeople in New Tanaan. I 'ave even devised a type 
                o'emblem that will impart the magic o'tranquility into the user 
                t'create planar armors from pieces o'energy found in the planes.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'what planar armor?' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'From me understanding, the very fabric o'the 
                planes is so strong out 'ere, it can be found in raw form the 
                deeper ye traverse. Anyone who ventures far into the planes finds 
                that they must wear excellent armor t'protect them from the savage 
                environment. The very essence of planar energy can be focused 
                into a form that can fit our shape. As ye progress deeper into 
                the planes, ye will find many molds an' patterns with which t'base 
                a set o'armor. If ye want t'know 'ow t'craft the various types 
                o'armor, I can instruct ye about plate, chain, leather an' silk. 
                '<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'what emblem' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Well ____, the emblems dinnae be easy t'craft 
                but I will gladly give ye one fer the price of 500 platinum pieces. 
                They allow a planes traveler with no craftin' skills t'create 
                many fine pieces o'planar armor in a special, magical kit I also 
                'ave an' will throw in with the price. The kit acts as a focal 
                point fer the wild magic energy o'the Planes. Ye will only be 
                able t'use each emblem an' kit once when ye create the piece, 
                'owever I dinnae be goin' anywhere soon! Just venture back when 
                ye need another an' dinnae ferget the coin! </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Give him 500pp and you get back a &quot;Mystical Forge of Ro&quot; 
              8-slot portable forge with a &quot;____ Emblem&quot; coin inside 
              it. (Emblem will match the class of the person hailing him.)</p>
            <p><b>Plate classes:</b> 
            <p>You say, 'what plate?' 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Ahhhhh ____! The fine rigid armor that can 
                stop a shaft from piercing yer heart! Too bad it be so cumbersome 
                an' difficult t'move about in. To construct a piece o'plate armor, 
                ye need t'combine a plate mold, an emblem, various amounts o'sheet 
                metal an' use one o'those crafty Tanaan smithin' 'ammers all within 
                a furnace touched by Ro. Ethereal metal sheet construction is 
                another matter. Ye will need t'combine two bricks o'ethereal energy, 
                an ethereal temper an' a Tanaan smithin' 'ammer within a Tanaan 
                forge. I would seek a skilled craftsperson t'make the metal sheets 
                fer ye; the emblem will enable ye t'craft the final armor piece 
                no matter what yer skill be. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Have a skilled smith combine two bricks of ethereal energy, an 
              ethereal temper, and a tanaan smithing hammer in one of the forges 
              in Plane of Knowledge. Trivial is &gt;250.</p>
            <p>The armor molds needed drop off various PoP mobs. The one mold 
              reported so far was an &quot;ornate bracer mold&quot;, and was dropped 
              off the dragon that spawns during a Halls of Honor event.</p>
            <p>You say, 'What ethereal temper?'<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Temper be the juice o'smithin'. T'make an 
                ethereal temper, ye will need t'combine two celestial essences 
                along with soda an' an emerald tealeaf. A skilled brew master 
                can distill the power o'the raw ingredients fer ye. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Have a skilled brewer combine 2 celestial essence, soda and an 
              <a href="../location/PoKnowledge.htm">emerald tea leaf</a> in a 
              brew barrel. This is a skill restricted combine, and a brewer of 
              206 unmodified skill may not even attempt the combine. Further details 
              on trivial narrowing as well as minimum skill to attempt the combine 
              will be provided as available.</p>
            <p>(Stats will be split onto a separate page as more of them become 
              available, but for now ...) </p>

            <p><b>Chain classes:</b></p>
            <p>You say, 'what chain'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Bor Wharhammer says 'Ahhhhh _____! Chain armors, while not as 
                sturdy as plate, provide so much more mobility if constructed 
                properly. T'construct a piece o'chain armor, ye need t'combine 
                a chain pattern, an emblem, various amounts of ethereal metal 
                rings an' use one o'those crafty Tanaan smithin' 'ammers all within 
                a furnace touched by Ro. Ethereal metal ring construction is another 
                matter. Ye will need to combine a brick o'ethereal energy, an 
                ethereal temper an' a file within a Tanaan forge. I would seek 
                a skilled craftsperson t'make the rings fer ye; the emblem will 
                enable ye t'craft the final armor piece no matter what yer skill 
                be. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It is suspected that the chain patterns needed will also drop off 
              various mobs in PoP.</p>
            <p>Have a skilled smith combine a brick of ethereal energy, an ethereal 
              temper (instructions in the plate section above), and a file in 
              one of the forges in Plane of Knowledge. Trivial is &gt;242.</p>
            <p><b>Leather classes:</b></p>
            <p>You say, 'what leather'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Leather armor provides little protection 
                due t'the make-up o'the materials. We shall do our best, 'owever, 
                t'see ye make a quality piece. T'do so, ye must combine a pattern, 
                an emblem, various pieces o'cured ethereal energy an' a Tanaan 
                embroidery needle all within a sewing kit boilin' with magical 
                energy. The cured energy may be problematic fer an unskilled craftsman, 
                'owever. Just sew two silk ethereal swatches together using a 
                Tanaan embroidery needle within a Tanaan loom. I can just imagine 
                yer next question t'be about swatches, aye?'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Again, it is suspected that the patterns in question dropfrom various 
              mobs in PoP.</p>
            <p>Cured ethereal energy is made by combining two ethereal silk swatches 
              and tanaan embroidery needle in one of the stationary looms in Plane 
              of Knowledge. Trivial is &gt;250</p>
            <p>You say, 'what swatches'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Bor Wharhammer sighs at you. 'T'make a swatch, ye need t'combine 
                two strands o'ether along with a curing agent in a Tanaan loom. 
                Ye will need t'seek a skilled brew master t'make the curing agent 
                fer ye. Just 'ave them create it by using two celestial essences, 
                soda an' paeala sap<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Have a skilled tailor combine two strands of ether and the ethereal 
              curing agent in a stationary loom in Plane of Knowledge. Trivial 
              is &gt;250</p>
            <p>A skilled brewer must make the curing agent by combining two celestial 
              essences, soda and paeala sap in a brew barrel. As with the temper 
              for the plate and chain armors, this is a skill-restricted combine, 
              and must be attempted by a 200+ skill brewer.<br>

            <p><b>Silk classes:</b></p>
            <p>You say, 'what silk'<br>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bor Wharhammer says 'Har! It be quite funny that we be referin' 
                t'silk as armor, fer the amount o'protection it provides be miniscule 
                at best. The planar armor made from strands o'ether can still 
                be quite useful fer its magical properties, 'owever. Ye will need 
                t'take up a Tanaan embroidery needle, a pattern, an emblem an' 
                various amounts o'ether silk swatches t'create a piece. Craft 
                it all within a sewing kit boilin' with magical energy.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Again, it is suspected that the patterns in question drop from
