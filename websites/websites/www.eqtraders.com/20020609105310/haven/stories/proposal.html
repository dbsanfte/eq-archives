      <P>

        paced the small room impatiently. She had asked Coreena to meet her here 
        promptly at 4:00. It was now 15 minutes past, and Sun just KNEW Coreena 
        was either picking up dropped shinies somewhere, or hanging at her favorite 
        place, the bank. It didn't help that Sun had spent the last hour making 
        sure everything was perfect...armor polished, swords placed just so...thick 
        golden hair brushed, and flowers, of all things, on the small bedside 
        table.<br>
        <br>
        She was in the middle of fussing with the aforementioned flowers when 
        she heard the door open behind her. Blushing furiously at being caught 
        in such an unwarriorlike task, she whirled around to confront Coreena, 
        at last.<br>
        <br>
        "Where have you been??" Sun blustered, attempting to regain her dignity.<br>
        <br>
        "Whaa? Oh, nowhere really...at the gate practicing intimidation on corpses. 
        Been having trubbs getting it just right, ya know?"<br>
        <br>
        "I told you to meet me here at 4:00 sharp!" Sun snapped. Realizing that 
        this was NOT the tone she had hoped to set for this meeting, she relented, 
        and sighed. "Never mind, you're here now." She settled herself on the 
        bed, suddenly horribly nervous. "I have something I wanted to talk to 
        you about."<br>
        <br>
        "Aye, I kinda got that idea," Coreena grinned, totally unrepentant, "So, 
        what's up?"<br>
        <br>
        "Well..umm..you see.." Sun stammered, astonished at herself. She had practiced 
        this so many times, she could hardly believe she was having trouble with 
        it now. "That is..well...look. You and I have been together for a long 
        time now, right?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yup"<br>
        <br>
        "And we're really happy being together, right?"<br>
        <br>
        "Yup"<br>
        <br>
        "And we can't see any reason why things can't just stay that way always, 
        right?"<br>
        <br>
        "Uhuh." Coreena shifted, already drifting off into daydreams of the loot 
        she was going to get off the raiders later tonight.<br>
        <br>
        "So..umm..seeing as how this is the case..umm.." Sunhawk took and deep 
        breath, and blurted it out, before she lost her nerve completely. "What 
        do you think about getting married?"<br>
        <br>
        "Sure..what??" Coreena snapped out of her visions of acquisition, and 
        gawked at Sun. "Say what??"<br>
        <br>
        "Well, you don't have to look so shocked," Sunhawk muttered, taken aback 
        by her reaction, "Lots of people do it."<br>
        <br>
        Coreena blinked, still staring. "Aye, but lot's of people aren't' us! 
        I thought you liked it this way. Now you want to get married?"<br>
        <br>
        "Well..I just thought it wold be nice for us to be..umm..you know..have 
        our names the same..all that.." Sun trailed off, beginning to flush furiously.<br>
        <br>
        "Hmm.." Coreena hid a grin, and attempted a feigned indifference. She 
        raised her eyebrows and said sarcastically, "Sure you wouldn't rather 
        marry your sword?" she sniffed, "Then you could be known all over Norrath 
        as Sunhawk Langsaxe...heh"<br>
        <br>
        "Aww, come on," Sunhawk muttered, "You know as well as I do that I was 
        only saying that to make Meian crazy. I thought you agreed it was fun??"<br>
        <br>
        "Aye," Coreena could not help giggling then, "It was." She frowned suddenly, 
        and looked thoughtfully at Sun. "But I'm not sure about this marriage 
        thing. Would that mean that MY stuff would be OUR stuff?"<br>
        <br>
        "Oh for crying out loud!" Sun, exasperated now, began to raise her voice. 
        "No, it wouldn't mean that..yeesh..forget it..this was a bad idea. Never 
        mind then. I'll just tell Jarno we're not doing it...oh, and Meian, and 
        Niami and Veriida and Muette. No problem. Forget I ever mentioned it."<br>
        <br>
        Coreena stared, wide eyed. "You told all those people before you asked 
        ME?"<br>
        <br>
        Sun glared impatiently, "Well, I had to didn't I? We'd need someone to 
        perform the ceremony, and witnesses, and guests, and a ring...but it's 
        all moot now, isn't it? So don't worry about it. I'll take care of it, 
        okay?" <br>
        <br>
        Coreena looked thoughtfully at Sun. "A ring? You got me a ring?"<br>
        <br>
        "Of course I did!" snapped Sun. "Jarno gave me a beautiful engagement 
        ring, and I was going to commission a wedding ring from Muette. What do 
        you think I've been saving for anyway?"<br>
        <br>
        "Wow.." Coreena looked impressed. "Thought it was for your armor." She 
        sat down next to Sun, and snuggled up close. "Hmm..since I get to keep 
        my stuff, and you got me rings and all..well...if you ask nice..maybe 
        I WILL marry you." She giggled.<br>
        <br>
        Sun, not daring to hope, gathered Coreena up gingerly in her arms. "We 
        can get married?"<br>
        <br>
        Coreena grinned up at her. "I said..if you ask me nice."<br>
        <br>
        Sun muttered, hiding a rueful smile. "You're gonna milk this for all it's 
        worth, arent' you." <br>
        <br>
        "Of course!" Coreena giggled. "It's not every day a girl gets proposed 
        to.."<br>
        <br>
        Sun sighed, and lowered herself awkwardly to her knees. She fished in 
        her pack and produced a ring. Taking Coreena's hand, she looked deeply 
        into her violet eyes, and recited solemnly, "Coreena, will you be my partner, 
        forever? Will you marry me?"<br>
        <br>
        "Hmm..one question first. If we split up, do I have to give you any of 
        my stuff?"<br>
        <br>
        "Coreena!" Sun exclaimed, totally exasperated.<br>
        <br>
        Coreena laughed in delight, took Sun's face in her hands and kissed her 
        tenderly. "Of course I'll marry you, silly. We're gonna be together forever 
        anyway, and if all this makes you happy, then why not?" She giggled suddenly. 
        "Besides, I LOVE parties!"<br>
        <br>
        Sunhawk shook her head and grinned. "You're incorrigible, but that's one 
        of the reason's that I love you..heh. As soon as I get a chance to tell 
        everyone you've accepted, we'll set a date and do the deed. From that 
        day forward, we will be "The Shadowstrikes." <br>
        <br>
        "I like the sound of that." Coreena smiled softly for a minute, and then 
        perked. "Will there be presents?"<br>
        <br>
        "Coreena!!"<br>
        <br>
        "Sorry..only kidding..I just love to watch that neat purple color go up 
        your neck and into your face.." Coreena grabbed Sun suddenly and tickled 
        her. "Come here and kiss me."<br>
        <br>
        Sun, happy beyond words, did just that.<br>
