<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hail and well met, citizens 

  of Norrath! </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Do you 

  want to learn a trade skill? Do you want to sell the fruits of your labor to 

  other players? Are you trying to find specific items to pratice your craft? 

  Or are you just trying to find someone who sells player-crafted items for a 

  reasonable price on your server? If the answer to any of these questions is 

  "yes", then I hope this site will be of assistance to you. A</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">s 

  the game changes and grows, so too will this site, so remember to check back 

  often. </font>

  More on Velious</b></font><br>

<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#400000">Things 
  are crazed in the DenMother's corner of the world. Thurgadin has been explored 
  and I think all known trade supplies have been listed. The new tinkering, poison 
  and velium leathers books have been transcribed. Many zones still need to be 
  explored for trade supplies, and help is appreciate. Please remember however, 
  that without detailed information, posts/email cost me more time than they save 
  me -- remember that zone name, merchant name and loc, as well as a complete 
  listing of the trade supplies they sell are all needed in order for the information 
  to be of aid to the site. That having been said, I'm scrambling to get information 
  up as I am able, and am processing a huge backlog of posts and email now.</font>
<P align="left"><font color="#400000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>12/05/00: 
  Velious is here</b></font><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#400000">The DenMother is going 
  to be swamped with Velious exploration for a while, trying to get tradeskill 
  info for the site. Unfortunately, anyone who is Velious enabled is unable to 
  take screen shots again until a Thursday patch, so it will be slower going on 
  getting the info onto the site. I *am* collecting info, though, and will get 
  it up as I can. <i>(Tunare folks, please keep your tell bombs to a minimum if 
  you see me on, I am getting *hammered* by everyone and their cousin wanting 
  to grill me on trade skills and/or Velious, and it can get pretty deadly over 
  there if I get distracted with questions)</i></font> 
<P align="left"><font color="#400000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>12/04/00: 
  Halfling cultural leathers!</b></font> <br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#400000">Wood elves are still 
  out in the cold with making their cultural leathers due to a problem with their 
  oak bark tannin. Halfling tailors, however, can rejoice in new cultural leathers 
  ... than can be imbued! (Many thanks to Volfen the Drunken Tailor for not only 
  experimenting with imbues, but then posting results to the message board)</font>
