              is no drop, b) the blood is extremely, extremely rare so far, c) 
              the other ingredient is the iksar cultural scale temper, which is 
              rare due to the difficulty in obtaining iksar blood, d) the final

              A week after I gave up and tossed my no-drop centi meat in a fit 
              of frustration, lo and behold, a patch which makes it not only droppable, 
              but one of the trivial 165+ <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">baking</a>

              working now, but I'm going to cross my fingers, toes and eyes that

              (making it hard for me to confirm), the mention of tradeskills and 
              buffs was a bit misleading, and what was patched in was the ability

              - Various image hosting sites seem to be having issues lately, causing 
              folks on the message boards to receive a login prompt when trying 
              to view someone's sig pic in a post. Please be aware that this is 
              NOT something done by my website, sending me email about it will 
              NOT do much good, it's NOT really a security risk, just very annoying. 
              It is also generally NOT intentional by the folks whose images are 
              being affected. When someone posts regarding affected threads on 
              the boards, as able, we go in and edit the individual post in question 
              remove the personal pic or sig pic, but in some cases, the hosting 
              provider has resolved the problem by the time we get to the image.

              Just a few quick updates today. The Kaladim high quality ore merchant 
              is now in place in the mines of Kaladim, and he offers up the same 
              <a href="quests/qeynos_ore.htm">quest to restock his inventory</a> 
              as the Qeynos and Bazaar vendors. The non-visible pieces of black 
              panther armor have been updated to allow all BST-capable races to 
              wear them. The <a href="learn/learn_alchemy.htm">Learn Alchemy</a> 
              section of the site has been expanded a tad, and more of the content 
              from Belgar's site will be up later this week. As always, I feel 
              like I'm still running way behind on things, and it's going to be 
              a busy week. I'll be sneaking in updates and additions as able.</font></p>

              by tomorrow things will have stabilized a bit, and we'll have full 
              net access once again.</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've 
              formally added a solid <a href="quests/quests.htm">Quests</a> section 
              to the site, specifically for quests requiring tradeskills. It will 
              take a while for me to get the button onto all the pages, and for 
              the page to include all the Shar Vahl class quests, etc., but it's 
              starting to shape up a bit. (I'm always looking for accurate, well-researched 
              tradeskill quest summaries.)</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I'll 
              be slowly removing items from the temporary <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin 
              Recipes</a> page and moving them to their proper recipes pages. 
              So, if you don't find a recipe that you saw here, look a bit more 
              closely at the proper tradeskill recipe pages. (Hint for <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">baking</a>: 
              scroll down. The old world recipes are listed first, then the Velious 
              recipes, then the Luclin recipes.)</font></p>
            <p class="black" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've 
              also added a &quot;<a href="secrets/recipes_bugged.htm">Flyswatter 
              Needed</a>&quot; section to the site. This will contain various 
              recipes that are listed in in-game books, given as quests, etc. 
              that, for one reason or another, we can't seem to get working properly. 
              They may be solidly bugged or they may be something we've just not 
              properly figured out. They may also include recipes that were reported 
              in as bugged, and we've not yet realized that the fix has been patched 
              in. If you find anything on this page that you've personally tested, 
              and it is working, please report back what you found to be the working 
              recipe, and I will update the page accordingly.</font></p>

              Smiths have reported back in that the various metal rings are now 
              stacking as promised and the recipes are yielding 2 rings (in some 
              cases they had returned 1 ring, in other cases 2, now there is some 
              consistency). I'm working on updating the smithing recipe pages 
              now. </font></p>
