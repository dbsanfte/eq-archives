<span class="headers">PoP Planar Armor Quests</span>
<p>
<p>
<i><b>(Note that this quest requires the Planes of Power expansion.)</b> </i>New questable armor has been made available with the release of PoP for the "experienced planes traveler." While the final combine for this armor does NOT require any tradeskill ability, the quest is included here due to the need for several player-made items for the combine. If you're just looking for the stats for these items, <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q138&menustr=120055000000">visit this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
Experienced planes traveler, eh? Just what does that mean? It means that unless you have certain character flags obtained from various boss mob encounters in Planes of Power, the NPC that gives this quest will not deal with you. We're still working out the various flag combinations that will make him happy. We know that he will speak to you if you are flagged as having defeated Terris Thule, or flagged for Bastion of Thunder, or for Plane of Tactics (Behemoth killed), but we're still working on the other various flag combinations that will encourage him to share his information (and the quest container/emblem needed). We suspect that the flag for finishing the Tactics trials will work in place of the Terris Thule flage, but further experimentation/verification is needed. The armor molds/patterns, which are only mob drops (they are <i>not</i> the vendor-sold patterns/molds), are tradeable. The final result is not. 
</p>
<p>
At this time, we have discovered that there are at least two sets of armor for each class, based on the mold/pattern used. The first set for each class uses "ornate" patterns and molds, which have been reported as dropping off higher-end encounters in Tactics, and Honor B (such as the dragon event). The second set uses "elemental" molds/patterns. The first reported drop of one of these was from Xuzl, in the Solusek Ro's Tower.
</p>
<p>
Bor Warhammer (708, -1736) in Plane of Tranquility is willing to share his planar armor secrets (and the appropriate combine container and emblem) to making planar armor ... for a price. He is unwilling to share this information with just anyone, and will not deal with you unless you have certain character flags, as mentioned above. His responses to a properly flagged person will vary based on your character class.
</p>
<h4>All classes: </h4> 
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Bor Wharhammer'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Greetin's t'ye ____! Isn't the area 'round 'ere so nice an' quiet? Such a departure from me old days; slaving o'er the forge t'create masterpieces! T'be 'onest, at times I do miss the old forge, but after I created me finest breastplate, it seemed as if nothing else I made could ever live up t'it. So I left me home to'wander the land an' see what I could learn o'the world. I 'ave learned quite a bit from the elders 'ere an' the skilled craftspeople in New Tanaan. I 'ave even devised a type o'emblem that will impart the magic o'tranquility into the user t'create planar armors from pieces o'energy found in the planes.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what planar armor?' 
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'From me understanding, the very fabric o'the planes is so strong out 'ere, it can be found in raw form the deeper ye traverse. Anyone who ventures far into the planes finds that they must wear excellent armor t'protect them from the savage environment. The very essence of planar energy can be focused into a form that can fit our shape. As ye progress deeper into the planes, ye will find many molds an' patterns with which t'base a set o'armor. If ye want t'know 'ow t'craft the various types o'armor, I can instruct ye about plate, chain, leather an' silk.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what emblem' 
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Well ____, the emblems dinnae be easy t'craft but I will gladly give ye one fer the price of 500 platinum pieces. They allow a planes traveler with no craftin' skills t'create many fine pieces o'planar armor in a special, magical kit I also 'ave an' will throw in with the price. The kit acts as a focal point fer the wild magic energy o'the Planes. Ye will only be able t'use each emblem an' kit once when ye create the piece, 'owever I dinnae be goin' anywhere soon! Just venture back when ye need another an' dinnae ferget the coin!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Give him 500pp and you get back either a Mystical Forge of Ro(plate/chain classes: 8-slot portable forge that can be used only for these quests) or a Druzzil's Sewing Kit (leather/silk classes), each with a "____ Emblem" inside it. (Emblem will match the class of the person hailing him.)
</p>
<h4>Plate classes:</h4> 
<p>
You say, 'what plate?'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Ahhhhh ____! The fine rigid armor that can stop a shaft from piercing yer heart! Too bad it be so cumbersome an' difficult t'move about in. To construct a piece o'plate armor, ye need t'combine a plate mold, an emblem, various amounts o'sheet metal an' use one o'those crafty Tanaan smithin' 'ammers all within a furnace touched by Ro. Ethereal metal sheet construction is another matter. Ye will need t'combine two bricks o'ethereal energy, an ethereal temper an' a Tanaan smithin' 'ammer within a Tanaan forge. I would seek a skilled craftsperson t'make the metal sheets fer ye; the emblem will enable ye t'craft the final armor piece no matter what yer skill be.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Have a skilled smith combine two bricks of ethereal energy, an ethereal temper, and a tanaan smithing hammer in one of the forges in Plane of Knowledge. This is a skill-restricted combine, and cannot be attempted until you have a modified 220 smithing skill. (Actual trivial of the combine is 212)
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What ethereal temper?'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Temper be the juice o'smithin'. T'make an ethereal temper, ye will need t'combine two celestial essences along with soda an' an emerald tealeaf. A skilled brew master can distill the power o'the raw ingredients fer ye. '
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Have a skilled brewer combine 2 <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1190">celestial essence</a>, <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=3917">soda</a> and an <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6461">emerald tea leaf</a> in a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5497">tanaan brew barrel</a>. This is a skill restricted combine, and cannot be attempted until you have a modified 220 brewing skill. (Actual trivial of the combine is 212)
</p>
<p>
Basic recipe is: ornate plate ___ mold, class-specific emblem, tanaan smithing hammer, 1-3 ethereal sheets of metal. Combine in the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6801">Mystical Forge of Ro</a>. (bracer: 1 sheet; gloves, helm, sleeves, boots: 2 sheets; leggings, breastplate: 3 sheets)
</p>
<p>
<i>(<a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g207&menustr=120055000000#plateornate">Stats for known pieces</a>)</i>
</p>
<h4>Chain classes:</h4>
<p>
You say, 'what chain'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Ahhhhh _____! Chain armors, while not as sturdy as plate, provide so much more mobility if constructed properly. T'construct a piece o'chain armor, ye need t'combine a chain pattern, an emblem, various amounts of ethereal metal rings an' use one o'those crafty Tanaan smithin' 'ammers all within a furnace touched by Ro. Ethereal metal ring construction is another matter. Ye will need to combine a brick o'ethereal energy, an ethereal temper an' a file within a Tanaan forge. I would seek a skilled craftsperson t'make the rings fer ye; the emblem will enable ye t'craft the final armor piece no matter what yer skill be.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The chain patterns needed also drop off various mobs in PoP.</p>
<p>
Have a skilled smith combine a brick of ethereal energy, an ethereal temper (instructions in the plate section above), and a file in one of the forges in Plane of Knowledge. This is a skill-restricted combine, and cannot be attempted until you have a modified 220 smithing skill. (Actual trivial of the combine is 212)
</p>
<p>
Basic recipe is: ornate chain ___ pattern, class-specific emblem, tanaan smithing hammer, 1-3 ethereal metal rings. Combine in the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6801">Mystical Forge of Ro</a>. (Bracer: 1 ring; gloves, sleeves: 2 rings; leggings, tunic: 3 rings. Other pieces unknown at this time.)
</p>
<p>
<i>(<a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g210&menustr=120055000000#ornatechain">Stats for known pieces</a>)</i>
</p>
<h4>Leather classes:</h4>
<p>
You say, 'what leather'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Leather armor provides little protection due t'the make-up o'the materials. We shall do our best, 'owever, t'see ye make a quality piece. T'do so, ye must combine a pattern, an emblem, various pieces o'cured ethereal energy an' a Tanaan embroidery needle all within a sewing kit boilin' with magical energy. The cured energy may be problematic fer an unskilled craftsman, 'owever. Just sew two silk ethereal swatches together using a Tanaan embroidery needle within a Tanaan loom. I can just imagine yer next question t'be about swatches, aye?'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, the patterns in question drop from various mobs in PoP.
</p>
<p>
Cured ethereal energy is made by combining two ethereal silk swatches and tanaan embroidery needle in one of the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5494">tanaan looms</a> in Plane of Knowledge. This is a skill-restricted combine, and cannot be attempted until you have a modified 220 tailoring skill. (Actual trivial of the combine is 212)
</p>
<p>You say, 'what swatches'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer sighs at you. 'T'make a swatch, ye need t'combine two strands o'ether along with a curing agent in a Tanaan loom. Ye will need t'seek a skilled brew master t'make the curing agent fer ye. Just 'ave them create it by using two celestial essences, soda an' paeala sap
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Have a skilled tailor combine two strands of ether and the ethereal curing agent in a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5494">tanaan loom</a> in Plane of Knowledge. This is a skill-restricted combine, and cannot be attempted until you have a modified 220 tailoring skill. (Actual trivial of the combine is 212)
</p>
<p>
A skilled brewer must make the curing agent by combining two celestial essences, soda and paeala sap in a brew barrel. As with the temper for the plate and chain armors, this is a skill-restricted combine, and must be attempted by a 200+ skill brewer.
</p>
<p>
Basic recipe is: Ornate ____ pattern, Tanaan embroidery needle, appropriate class-emblem, 1-3 swatches of cured ethereal energy, combine in <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8764">Druzzil's Sewing Kit</a>. <i>(Leggings and tunic are reported as needing 2 swatches, which makes them different ratios than the other sets of this armor. Sandals and helm require 1 swatch, as do, possibly, sleeves. We do not have swatch information for other pieces at this time.)</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>(<a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g212&menustr=120055000000#ornateleather">Stats for known pieces</a>)</i>
</p>
<h4>Silk classes:</h4>
<p>
You say, 'what silk'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Bor Wharhammer says 'Har! It be quite funny that we be referin' t'silk as armor, fer the amount o'protection it provides be miniscule at best. The planar armor made from strands o'ether can still be quite useful fer its magical properties, 'owever. Ye will need t'take up a Tanaan embroidery needle, a pattern, an emblem an' various amounts o'ether silk swatches t'create a piece. Craft it all within a sewing kit boilin' with magical energy.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Patterns can drop from various higher-end mobs in PoP.
</p>
<p>
Follow the instructions in the leather section above for the construction of the ethereal silk swatches.
</p>
<p>
Basic recipe is: Ornate ____ pattern, Tanaan embroidery needle, appropriate class-emblem, 1-3 ethereal silk swatches, combine in <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8764">Druzzil's Sewing Kit</a>. <i>(shoes, cap and sleeves require 2 swatches, leggings require 3 swatches)</i>
</p>
<p>
