            <h3>Qeynos Bertoxx Cleric Armor Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that 
              originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other 
              than the bracer, no drop, HUM/CLR only. Due to the location and 
              the faction of the NPC down in the sewers, it's not recommended 
              that you attempt this if you are not a worshipper of Bertoxxulous. 
              Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials 
              often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for 
              a second one </i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Xeture Demiagar'</p>
            <p>Xeture Demiagar says 'I have much to do here for the defense of 
              our Temple and the appeasing of our patron Bertoxxulous, the Plague 
              Lord. If the Plague Lord has gifted you with the desire to [serve 
              his will] as a priest of the Bloodsabers I will assist in your training. 
              If not, then leave me now and do not interrupt me again.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I desire to serve his will.'</p>
            <p>Xeture Demiagar says 'By spreading the disease, decay, and destructive 
              powers of the Plague Lord you will in turn be gifted with great 
              insight and power. First however you must learn to survive in this 
              city, surrounded by those who would see you destroyed for your faith. 
              Take this note to Torin Krentar. He will instruct you on how to 
              acquire a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our [enemies].'</p>
            <p><i>{Wander over to Torin, near the Necromancer spell vendors}</i></p>
            <p>Torin Krentar says 'Well met young disciple of Bertoxxulous. Perhaps 
              one day you shall serve the Plague Lord in his realm, but for now 
              you will serve the Bloodsabers, his mortal agents on Norrath. The 
              armor you seek must be assembled using this Mail Assembly Kit. The 
              materials necessary to construct the armor vary depending on the 
              piece being crafted. Do you wish to craft [Gauntlets of the Pestilence 
              Priests], [Boots of the Pestilence Priests], a [Bracer of the Pestilence 
              Priests], a [Helm of the Pestilence Priests], [Greaves of the Pestilence 
              Priests], [Vambraces of the Pestilence Priests], or a [Breastplate 
              of the Pestilence Priests]?'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I wish to craft the Gauntlets of the Pestilence Priests.'</p>
            <p>Torin Krentar says 'To assemble pestilence priest gauntlets you 
              will need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a 
              [forge] with a Water Flask and this crude Gauntlet Mold. Once that
