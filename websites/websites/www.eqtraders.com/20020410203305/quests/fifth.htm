            <h3> #5: Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl </h3>
            <p> "Whoo hoo, over halfway there!" Don't we wish that were true? 
              So far you've had to do a bit of tradeskilling and a bit of running 
              around hither and thither, in some moderate danger. The fifth shawl 
              will test you even further, by requiring that you delve a good bit 
              into tailoring and engage in some phenomenal feats of patience in 
              collecting the components. The fifth is no cakewalk, but when you 
              come around to the sixth and seventh, you'll get downright nostalgic 
              about the easy golden days of the fifth shawl...well okay maybe 
              not about collecting the wurm biles.

              was about to send one of my Lorekeepers looking for you. It appears

              We don't have the luxury of waiting for an appropriate task to arise, 
              you must advance as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have neither

            <h4> <a name="inst">Detailed Instructions</a><br>
            </h4>
            <p> Alrighty...we need 5 glowing wurm biles and 75 crystalline threads. 
              First, we combine the threads in sets of five to make crystalline 
              fibers. Then we combine three fibers each with a bile in the glowing 
              bile soaker that Rexx (located among the merchants in the bank) 
              so kindly provides, to make five glowing crystalline silks. Then 
              we combine those five glowing crystalline silks with our fur-lined 
              shawl. There are a few steps but they're pretty simple, right? Well...first 
              we need to get that tailoring up! 
            <p> <i> Basic Tailoring Information </i> <br>
              The fundamentals of tailoring are very straightforward. You combine 
              your recipe ingredients in a sewing kit. Many recipes require a 
              pattern, like all armor recipes, but some do not, like silk swatches 
              or small tailored bags. The thing that makes tailoring such a horrible 
              beast to work on is that there is no point whatsoever at which you 
              can improve your skill solely with store-bought items. You must 
              hunt and collect ingredients for every single attempt at anything 
              tailored. Thus, there are long stretches where you will be working 
              on the same kind of item, and therefore need mind-numbing quantities 
              of the same ingredient. The most common of these are spider silks 
              and various kinds of pelts. Hence the joke: "'What's the fastest 
              way to work up tailoring?' 'Well, first you level a necro to 50 
              to farm for ingredients....'" The scary thing is that it's not entirely 
              exaggerated. For the purposes of this step of the quest, you need 
              to get your skill to 115, which is slow and tedious and frustrating 
              and painful but not yet as heartbreaking as the 150+ stuff. You 
              can get your recipes from the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_tailoring.htm">Basic 
              Tailoring Recipes</a> page, where there's even a link at the top 
              to where you'll find pelts and silks. There are links to other kinds 
              of recipes, but if you follow them you'll see that the skill for 
              those is well beyond what you'd need for this shawl. Actually many 
              would argue that it's beyond what's required for any of the shawls 
              (so far). 
            <p> The other thing that confuses many people is that there are several 
              different tailoring kits. The most basic are the small (two-slot) 
              and large (eight-slot) kits that you can find on vendors in cities 
              all over the place. Recently, looms with ten slots were added in 
              many cities, to allow people to make items that require more than 
              eight ingredients. Looms are stationary containers like ovens or 
              brew barrels that you use on the spot. The only other kind of container 
              readily available is the Coldain Tailoring Kit, sold only in Thurgadin. 
              This is the only tailoring kit that can be used to do some of the 
              high end Velious armor, although old world recipes will all work 
              in it, too. You may also have heard of Deluxe Sewing Kits. These 
              are no longer available except from other players who happen to 
              have them. At one time the large kits sold by vendors had 10 slots 
              on them. Then, perhaps to help the handmade backpack market, Verant 
              decided to change it so that the vendors only sold containers with 
              8 slots. They could not change the existing ones because people 
              might have stuff in them, so they renamed the original ones Deluxe 
              kits and restocked vendors with the new large 8-slot ones. So the 
              only Deluxe kits in existance now are from large ones that people 
              had when the change was made. The ONLY way to get a Deluxe kit now 
              is to buy it from another player, or find one on a merchant that 
              a player sold to that merchant. Given the existance of looms and 
              the fact that there are only a very few recipes that require 10 
              slots, it is probably not worth your while to bother trying to find 
              one. For the purposes of this quest, you would do fine with either 
              a large kit or coldain kit. You could also use a city loom although 
              there are none in Velious, so you'd need to travel to an old world 
              city to do your combines that way. 
            <p> Combine in tailoring kit: 5 Crystalline Silk Threads = 1 Crystalline 
              Fiber (trivial 51) <br>
              Combine in Glowing Bile Soaker: 3 Crystalline Fibers + 1 Glowing 
              Wurm Bile = Glowing Silk Piece (never fails) <br>
              Combine in tailoring kit: 5 Glowing Silk Piece + Fur-lined Coldain 
              Prayer Shawl = Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl (trivial 115) 
            <p> Note that if you fail at the final combine here, you will get 
              your fourth shawl back. The same goes for the final combines for 
              the sixth and seventh, you will always get your previous shawl back 
              if the attempt to make a new one fails. Also, you can trigger Rexx 
              to give you the Glowing Bile Soaker with the key words "I am here 
              for the next prayer shawl", so if you would rather not lug this 
              thing around, you can destroy it after use and keep going back for 
              another one when you need it. 
            <p> <b> Biles: </b> These are dropped by all kinds of shardwurms in 
              Great Divide...young, guardian, elder, ancient...you name it. So, 
              you could go out and just start randomly slaughtering them, in which 
              case they will be a very rare drop. Or, you could take advantage 
              of a fantastic feature and look for the wurms that glow! After all, 
              this is *glowing* wurm bile that we seek, is it not? Unless you 
              have another reason to kill wurms (needing spell drops or getting 
              exp) then I recommend you wait until nightfall and look for the 
              wurms that glow. You need to be careful, because if they are standing 
              near the velium river, spikes of velium on the ground, campfires, 
              or torches in the tunnels, then they may sometimes appear to glow 
              when they have no bile, or may not seem to be glowing when they 
              do have it. So I focused on the wurms outside of the tunnels. There 
              are many of them that roam around to the south of the tunnels, and 
              plenty from there around over to the dragon ring (the teleport spot). 
              So I just ran around at night looking for glowing wurms. They are 
              still pretty rare, I averaged one bile for every one or two (game) 
              nights that I looked. If there are a lot of people looking at the 
              same time, then you might find even less. If there are people out 
              hunting them who are not looking for them, then you might find even 
              more because they'll be respawning as they're killed. It all depends. 
              If you have trouble finding them, kill a few here and there to refresh 
              the population for yourself and others, and hopefully get some glowing 
              ones to spawn. 
            <p> Some people have reported that they absolutely cannot see the 
              glow. Make sure that you have your dynamic lighting on ("/dynamiclights 
              on"). You could test to be sure by heading back to Antonica and 
              finding a wisp. If you see the wisp glow at night, then my guess 
              would be that there's any reason why you wouldn't see the wurm glow 
              too. It is imperceptible during the day, however, so I highly recommend 
              that you spare yourself the heartache of looking during the day 
              and just do it at night. Either way, killing wurms will make new 
              ones spawn and hopefully bring out some new ones with biles. So 
              if you are having trouble finding any, try killing some and see 
              if ones with biles don't turn up eventually. The picture below demonstrates 
              what a glowing wurm should look like the one below, courtesy of 
              Chenier. Thanks to Leafrat Pineheart and Chenier Sangeforet for 
              their screenshots and for not letting it get forgotten!<br>

            <p> <b> Crystalline Threads: </b> These drop off of crystalline spiders 
              in Velketor's Labyrinth. As these spiders are right at the zone 
              and all give experience all the way up to level 60, this is a very 
              popular place for high levels. If you are under level 50 you will 
              probably have a lot of trouble finding a group. However, with so 
              many people hunting the spiders you may not have to do any killing 
              yourself. I got most of my threads by going around to each group 
              on the ground floor (not worth the danger of going up the slippery 
              ramps to groups up above unless you're feeling really impatient 
              or know the zone well) and asking them if they had anyone collecting 
              threads. Those that had no use for them agreed to send me a tell 
              when they got any, and I'd just scoot over and loot em. 
            <p> There are several varieties of spiders in Velks: crystalline spiders, 
              blizzard spiders, and shard spiders. The crystallines are the only 
              ones that drop threads, and are the easiest of the three. Only a 
              few rare spiders called crystalline hunters or blizzard hunters 
              (I don't think there are shard hunters) can see invis. So, you are 
              almost completely safe moving about the spider area with invis up, 
              just watch for the hunters. Shortly after spawning the spiders also 
              invis themselves, so make sure you have some form of see invis on 
              if you want to know where they are. The ground level area is otherwise 
              pretty straightforward, except for an icy patch just past the big 
              mound of snow that is straight ahead from the bottom of the ramp 
              at zone-in. Piece of cake.
