You always hear your oh-so-polite pet always giving you a report that its
"taunting attacker" but what is it doing to taunt the mob? Here's a little
story to give ya a chuckle.
<P>
****************
<P>
The Magician Maddock had just gained the 4th level of skill in the Guild
of Magicians. He goes to the Academy and purchase his new spells and begins
studying. He heard that Water is the best pet for a young magician due to
their fast regenerative powers and fierce Ice spells. After studying his
new spells and purchasing some reagents, he heads out to the Commonlands
to continue with his training.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P>
Once he arrives at the East Commons, he takes a piece of malachite from
hisbackpack and cast his summon pet spell. In a blaze of green energy and
rift is formed in the air in front of him as a small water elemental drops
out of the rift. The water elemental floats around a bit then seems to focus
on Maddock and it settles itself behind him. Maddock smiles in satisfaction
as he notes that the pet appears to be a strong warrior.&nbsp;
<P>
"Pet, what is your name?"&nbsp;
<P>
"I am Karabener, Master."&nbsp;
<P>
Such a polite little thing, thinks Maddock. "Well. Pet follow me."
<P>
"Following, Master."
<P>
Maddock runs past the desert area and follows the path to the 1st inn.
&nbsp;There he sits and practices his new meditation skill to recoup the
large expense of mana from summoning Karabener.
<P>
Suddenly Maddock feels a sharp pain on his shoulder as a black wolf leaps
from the inns opened window and bites him. Karabener immediately attacks
the black wolf. The black wolf takes off out the window with Karabener chasing
it down. It sends him a telepathic message, "Taunting enemy, Master." He
hears a faint "You son of a bitch! Get your ass back here! &nbsp;I'll fuck
you and your mom up for messing with my master, you piece of shit!"
<P>
He feels a sense of satisfaction as the wolf goes down to the watery warrior.
Now he knows that his pet will protect him even when he's busy meditating.
Getting up from his sitting position, he heads out to see Karabener coming
back to the inn. A bit further, the remains of the wolf is lying on the ground
in a soggy pile. A young half-elf bard is standing over it. He notices that
her cute pointed ears are red for some reason, and wonders if she's diseased
or not.
<P>
As Maddock butchers the wolf for its fur and meat, she says, "Wow, that's
a nice pet you have there. A bit of a mouth on it though huh?"
<P>
"The 'son of a bitch thing'? Pets get mad at people who attack their masters
is all. Although you're right, a magician shouldn't have a pet that talks
like a barbarian warrior." He turns to Karabener, "Pet, no taunt."
<P>
"As you wish, Master."
<P>
For the next few weeks, Maddock and his water pet kills all of the spiders
and wolves around the 1st inn. After Maddock achieves his 7th level of skill,
he attempts to take on a rattler. Unfortunately, he sees that Karabener is
almost dying in this battle and the snake hasn't even lost half its life.
He bravely jumps into the fray to take the snakes attention from his loyal
pet. But even with his mighty staff sweeping the air, the poor magician's
lack of dexterity proves to be his undoing as he misses his first two swings.
The snake connects with both hits and poisons Maddock on the second bite.
maddock feels his consciousness slipping from him. he had to make a decision,
"Pet, health report!"
<P>
"I am at 14% health, Sir."
<P>
Damn! Karab won't be able to take more than a hit or two. "Karab, can you
hold him?"
<P>
"Yes, Sir. I'll take him."
<P>
Maddock starts to back away from the snake, but as if realizing that Maddock
is the brains of the team, the snake follows him and continues to bite him.
&nbsp;Maddock is almost dead when he realized his mistake. He screams, "Karab,
taunt...." And faints. Karab continues his attack, but the snake got in one
final bite and Maddock dies.
<P>
****************
<P>
It takes Maddock and a new pet a few more days to earn enough experience
to achieve his eighth level. In these last few days, Maddock has allowed
his pet the freedom to taunt and swear at the monsters they were fighting.
But he's hunting in the desert where no-one will hear his normally very polite
pets swear like a sailors on shore leave.
<P>
With a new spell level comes stronger pets. Deciding on staying with a water
pet since they've proven so useful, Maddock travels to the Northern Desert
of Ro, to hunt with some friends he's made in his travels.
<P>
He is invited into a team of hunters who are fighting the evil Cutthroats
in the desert. The team consists of a Erudin Wizard, Ballsburner, a human
paladin, Lancellot, a half rogue, Adela, a barbarian warrior, Ballzak and
a high elf cleric, Nightingale.
<P>
Ballsburner smirks at Maddock as he runs up to them with his pet, "teh, second
rate burner coming up dudez."
<P>
"Shut up Balls." says Lancellot. "Yo, Maddock, pull up some sand, and let
the dervish bashing begin my friend."
<P>
"hail all, and well met. so what's the plan?"
<P>
Ballsburner sneers at him, "What do you think? I pull it, they intercept
it then I kill it."
<P>
At the tone of disrespect for his master hits maddock's pet, Conon, it responds
in kind, "You dumbass E-turdin! Watch your fucking mouth or I'll have to
help you re-arrange your family tree!"
<P>
Ballsburner's mouth drops as a deep blush show through even on his dark face.
The rest of the party is laughing with Ballzak rolling on the ground pounding
the sand. Wiping the tears from his eyes, Ballzak says,"Where the fuck did
you get that piece of work, Maddock? heehee." Nightingale's pale face grows
bright red as she tries to maintain her holy composure, "Err, yes. Such language
from such a magical being!"
<P>
"Sorry guys. they're kinda protective. Pet, no taunt."
<P>
Conon was still going on as they were talking, "....so fuckin' dumb you don't
even know to take off your damn hood in the fucking desert, err, As you wish,
Master."
<P>
Lancellot, stands up and says, "hail dervish cutthroat."
<P>
Ballsburner, grumbles under his breath about low-bred humans, as he says,
"Pulling." And sends and ice bolt at the Dervish. The derv staggers a bit
then runs up the dune to take on Ballsburner. The melee'rs jump in front
of the wizard and starts engages it in combat with Ballzak throwing off a
stream of obscenities about the derv's dubious ancestry. Maddock points a
finger at the derv and says, "Pet attack!"
<P>
"Attacking enemy, Master"
<P>
"I'll teach you to interfere with me, Ballzak!" screams the derv. he gets
in two good attacks on Ballzak and the mighty barbarian staggers from this.
Nightingale steps back and begins to heal him.
<P>
Ballzak screams, "Lance, taunt him off! I'm getting pounded here."
<P>
Lancellot, with a look of disgust on his proud face, shouts at the derv,
"Your hair is crooked. Your mom was seen at the corner by the Freeport slums
offering her wares. Its said your father once dated...."
<P>
With a groan of disgust, Adela slides in behind the derv and shouts, "Damnit
lance this is how you taunt!" and he slips a fine steel dagger in the back
of the derv. With a shout of pain, the derv turns its attack on Adela, after
one or two hits, Adela's weak rogue-ish stamina has had it and he pulls back
from melee and the derv attempts to take on Ballzak again, when the two casters
unleashed their spells, fire and ice together and kills the derv.
<P>
"My comrades will take revenge on you..."
<P>
Ballzak breathes a sigh as Nightingale begins healing him. "Maddock, let
your pet taunt again, will ya? At least we'll have two taunters in the party
then" He glares at Captain Goody, Lancellot.
<P>
"Sure, Pet, taunt."
<P>
"As you wish, ol fuck-- err, master."
<P>
The rest for a bit more then, Adela says, "Dervs up."
<P>
The battle goes better this time with Ballzak and Conon setting up a scathing
stream of scatological diarrhea at the poor dervish. She was turning from
Ballz to Conon and back trying to make them stop talking about her breasts
and what they how the cows would want their udders back. She was so flustered
that she wasn't even going after the two casters blasting away at her.
<P>
Ballzak sits down next to Maddock after the fight, and says, "hey, you think
I can borrow your pet for when I head back to halas? it'll be great for parties.
What do you say, Conon? wanna follow me for a while?"
<P>
"My leader is Maddock, fuckwit..."
