<span class="headers">Qeynos Rogue (Sturdy Workmans) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that originates
in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other than the bracer) no
drop, and HUM, HEF/ROG only. This quest originates in the Qeynos rogue's guild,
underneath Crow's Bar. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the
bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts
for a second one</i>

<p>
You say, 'Hail, Reldin Harkolis'
</p>
<p>
Reldin Harkolis says 'Hail Wendolyn. Know that only within these few passageways
and rooms whose borders are marked by the symbol of the Circle of Unseen Hands
can we speak freely of our organization and its undertakings. Neither the
streets of the city above nor the sewers and catacombs are free of ears that
would harm the Circle of Unseen Hands should they hear of our [secrets].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What secrets'
</p>
<p>
Reldin Harkolis says 'The Circle has many secrets some of which only Hans may
know. Our agents are all about, mingling among the common law abiding folk and
working in all manner of profession. At one time we had a significant number of
the Qeynos Guard allied to our organization but the loyal soldiers of Antonius
Bayle IV has discovered and punished many of them. The ones that remain are
hesitant at best to continue their association with us. You will need to
exercise much caution within this city as you learn the ropes. I will help get
you outfitted in some [gear] that you will find useful in our line of work.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what gear'
</p>
<p>
Reldin Harkolis says 'Take this Curing Kit. With it you can assemble an outfit
of light, flexible, and sturdy yet inconspicuous leather clothing to protect you
from the perils of your job. The materials required will depend on the piece of
clothing you desire to craft. Do you plan on crafting Sturdy Workmans [Gloves],
Sturdy Workmans [Boots], a Sturdy Workmans [Bracer], a Sturdy Workmans [Cap],
Sturdy Workmans [Leggings], Sturdy Workmans [Sleeves], or a Sturdy Workmans
[Tunic]? Once you are suitably outfitted return to me and I will inform you of
your [next job].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what gloves'
</p>
<p>
Reldin Harkolis says 'To craft Sturdy Workmans Gloves you require two [silk
thread], a ruined wolf pelt, two giant field rat whiskers, and a large king
snake skin. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Curing
Kit with this Tattered Glove Pattern.'

<p>
You say, 'what next job'
</p>
<p>
Reldin Harkolis says 'A message between two of our agents was recently
intercepted by a Qeynos Guardsman. The message is encoded in thieves cant but
should the guards eventually decode it we would expect trouble. Guard Gregor,
the guard who currently is in possession of the message is out patrolling
somewhere in the West Karanas. Find this guard and recover the message. Bring it
back to me when you have done so.'
</p>
<p>
Go kill guard Gregor in West Karana. He is located over by Misty Storyswapper.
He drops the message and I think the faction that goes down when you kill him is
just Qeynos Citizens gets worse. Take the message back to Reldin to get an rusty
unseen hands dagger, lore. Sharpen this dagger in a forge with a sharpening
stone and give Reldin the sharpened dagger, a gnoll fang, and a large kind snake
skin to recieve:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dagger of Unseen Hands, Magic, lore, no drop, damage 3 delay, 21, primary,
  secondary, 1 str, 2 dex, HUM, HEF; ROG
