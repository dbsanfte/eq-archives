            <h3> Shar Vahl Rogue (Baking) Quest</h3>
            <p><i>As with many quests in Shar Vahl, this requires that you've 
              already completed the <a href="citizenship.htm">Vah Shir Citizenship 
              quest</a>. </i></p>
            <p><i>This is a progressive, class-specific quest for Vah Shir rogues. 
              Many thanks to Dokomo Tunderblade for the initial details. Further 
              details on the Hollowshade Moor drops needed <a href="hollowshade_dropinfo.htm">can 
              be found here</a>.</i></p>
            <p>You may wish to read through this quest carefully in advance to 
              see which items are needed from the Shar Vahl pit, and collect them 
              all at once. Otherwise, you're going to be returning there ... a 
              lot. </p>
            <p>After getting your slate of citizenship and your Initiate's Cloak 
              of Shar Vahl (AC 4, wt 5, ALL; BAR, OGR, TRL, IKS, VAH), you are 
              told to look for Harbin Gernawl. He is found to the right of the 
              Registrar's office. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Hail him, if you wish.<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Harbin Gernawl says 'Hello ______, it is my pleasure to meet 
                you. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hand Harbin Gernawl your personal acrylia slate.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Harbin Gernawl says 'Ahh, ______, I was told you'd be coming. 
                I am Harbin, and I will oversee the next bit of your progress 
                in the Taruun. You have bravely chosen a path that will put your 
                every skill to the test. May your abilities be honed in the service 
                of the noble Vah Shir. To begin, bring me the soft chitin of three 
                of the Rhinobeetles that dwell in the crater surrounding our city. 
                <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Go down into the pit surrounding Shar Vahl and kill beetles until 
              you have 3 chitins..<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Harbin Gernawl takes the chitin and deftly fashions a buckler 
                as he speaks, 'Your progress will be reported, ______. For your 
                effort thus far I present you with this buckler. It will help 
                to protect you until you become adept enough to wield a weapon 
                in each of your hands. Meanwhile, it is time for you to practice 
                the skill that Shar Vahl relies on to feed it's people. Following 
                this recipe, deliver four boiled rockhopper eggs to Sergeant Tylah 
                in Hollowshade moor. Return to me with the acrylia he will pay 
                you. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You are rewarded with exp and the Buckler of the Beetle (shield, 
              AC 3, wt. 5, VAH ROG, lore, no drop)</p>
            <p>Now you must go back down to the pit and kill rockhoppers for their 
              (no drop) eggs. They are rare drops so be prepared to wait a while 
              to get 4 (although it's recommended to grab a couple more in case 
              of failures). The recipie for cooking the eggs is 1 Spices, 1 Water 
              Flask, and 1 Rockhopper Egg in an oven or spit. The trivial is reported 
              as 46, but at 64 it was still a 1 in 5 fail rate. Go to the Hollowshade 
              Moor, to the Vah Shir Outpost, and hand all 4 to Scout Tylah<br>
            </p>
            <p>If you wish to hail her first, you get the following response:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Tylah says 'Good day to you ______, would you happen 
                to have any boiled rockhopper eggs for sale? I'm so very hungry 
                and they're my favorite food. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Give her the 4 boiled rockhopper eggs.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Sergeant Tylah devours all four of the eggs in the blink of an 
                eye, 'Delicious! May the spirits bless you ______! Here are a 
                few acrylia flakes for your trouble. I'll be happy to pay for 
                more should you find yourself with any extra! <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You are awarded exp and some acrylia flakes, which you bring back 
              to Harbin Gernawl.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> <br>
                Harbin Gernawl says 'Your progress will be rewarded, ______. Soon 
                all will recognize you as a recruit of the cunning Taruun! Speak 
                with Merchant Rytan. When he is through with you return to me 
                with his seal, your buckler, your initiate's cloak and this seal. 
                <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He awards you with experience and his seal.</p>
            <p><br>
              Merchant Rytan is outisde the shop with fletching supplies in the 
              South sector. Hail him for the following response:<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Rytan says 'Hello ______, I trust all is well with you today. 
                Come in and have a look around, just let me know if you see anything 
                you like. By the way, I am in need of the assistance of an official 
                Shar Vahl citizen. If you know of any please send them my way. 
                <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I am a citizen'<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Rytan says 'Wonderful! Please, show me your acrylia slate and 
                I'll disclose my errand. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He, unsurprisingly, wants to see your personal acrylia slate (don't 
              worry, he'll give it back). As is usual for questing, make sure 
              you have a container slot free.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Rytan says 'Here's my dilemma, I am low on darts to sell and 
                I need to replenish my supply. I simply cannot break away from 
                the store so I require your help. Fill this bag with xakra teeth 
                and return the sealed bag to me. With those teeth I can make six 
                darts and I'll give you three. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will return your slate, and also give you a no drop, 6-slot 
              bag. Head back down to the pit and collect 6 Xakra teeth off the 
              Xakra worms. Fill the bag with teeth, combine, and hand it back 
              to Rytan.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Rytan says 'Here are the three darts I promised you and a seal 
                of mine. I need more darts desperately, so show me your acrylia 
                slate to take another bag and fill it as you are able. Collect 
                four of my seals and show them to me. I will reward you by revealing 
                my method of dart construction. <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Rytan then hands you his seal, and 3 xakra tooth darts (5/26, throwing, 
              range 75, wt. 0.1, ALL; BAR, TRL, OGR, IKS, VAH). He also hints 
              at his progressive fletching quest. (Not yet documented, but the 
              recipes are listed on the site.)</p>
            <p>Go back to Harbin and hand in his seal, Rytan's seal, your cape, 
              and your buckler.<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Harbin Gernawl says 'Your hard work is pleasing to the Taruun, 
                ______, which now accepts you as an official recruit. Wear this 
                cloak with pride. Your buckler has been treated with a special 
                epoxy and should protect you more effectively now. Show the buckler 
                to Taruun Joharr and he will continue to guide you on your sacred 
                path. I sense a strong spirit in you, young one. May it guide 
                you to greatness! <br>
              </p>
              <p>Harbin Gernawl shouts 'Citizens of glorious Shar Vahl, lend me 
                your ears. On this day your fellow citizen, ______, has become 
                an official recruit of the Taruun. He has pledged an oath to hone 
                his skills to perfection that he may better serve us all. Please 
                join me now in celebrating his commitment to the mighty Vah Shir!

              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Rewards are a the Hardened Buckler of the Beetle (AC 5, wt. 5, 
              VAH ROG, lore, no drop), and your Cloak of the Taruun Recruit (AC 
              5, DEX 1, HP 5, 1% baking mod, weight 5, VAH ROG, lore, no drop).</p>
            <p><br>
              Taruun Joharr is hard to find. Head for the north gate, but just 
              as you pass under the arch, but before you go across the bridge 
              you can go right along the outer city wall but also along the big 
              fall into the pit. Taruun Joharr is not far along the right wall.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Give him the buckler that you just received. Since he keeps it 
              and replaces it with two daggers, you <i>may</i> not wish to do 
              this step until you're ready to dual wield.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Taruun Joharr takes the buckler and spins it in his hand for 
                a moment. Eventually he says, 'I suppose assumin' you were sent 
                here by Harbin isn't too far from the reality of things. I'll 
                try to think of a few things for you to do, but in the meantime, 
                take these daggers and practice until you can use both of them. 
                You need to get out of the habit of toting this shield around. 
                If your enemy is gettin' close enough to hit you on it, you ain't 
                doin' your job right anyway. I'll do what I can to train you from 
                here, but I'm going to need to eat first. It's been a while since 
                my last meal. Take this meal voucher to Cook Yalkiin. Once they 
                fill the order bring it back and we'll start your lesson. Now 
                scoot.' <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>In exchange for your buckler he hands you 2 Daggers that are 4/24, 
              and also gives you a voucher. Cook Yalkiin can be found in the Throne 
              room area on the first door on the left.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><br>
                Cook Yalkiin says 'I'd love to fill this order, but we're out 
                of the meat that he likes. We've been very busy today, so I doubt 
                that any of us will be able to get out to gather more of it. If 
                you could go out and grab us a few slabs, we could not only fill 
                the order, I could put some away for anyone else that may come 
                through today. This sounds like a perfect task for a young Taruun 
                recruit. Fill this bag with the fatty meat from a young Owlbear 
                and bring it back to me right away. I'll get Joharr's sandwiches 
                as soon as you return with the meat.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Go to Hollowshade Moor and kill Owlbear Cubs until you have 6 Fatty 
              Owlbear Meat. Combine and return the bag to Cook Yalkiin. <br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Cook Yalkiin opens the bag and immediately begins to slice the 
                meat into thin sheets. He throws the meat on a few slices of bread 
                and wraps the whole thing up with a hand full of vegetables. 'Here 
                you go, friend!' He says as he hands you what appears to be a 
                lunch bag. 'Joharr should love these sandwiches! The meat that 
                you brought us was great. If you ever need a job as a butcher, 
                just let us know. Take care and tell Joharr I said hello.' <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You gain experience, positive faction with the Guardians of Shar 
              Vahl, and a Food Bag. Take the Food Bag back to Taruun Joharr. As 
              usual, make sure that you have a container slot free.<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Taruun Joharr takes the bag and takes a huge bite of the sandwich. 
                'This sandwich is almost worth the wait.' He says as he rubs the 
                crumbs from his mouth. 'I hope that you've been practicin' with 
                those daggers. Elder Ternq came by while you were away. He stated 
                that I, well... you... need to go scout the caves around the thicket. 
                Gather the skulls of any Shak Dratha that you may... um... run 
                into while you scout. Once you've filled this backpack, return 
                it to me and I'll fill out a report for Ternq. <br>
                [Sat Dec 08 12:32:21 2001] Your faction standing with Taruun got 
                better.<br>
                [Sat Dec 08 12:32:21 2001] You gain experience!!<br>
              </p>

            <p>You receive experience, positive faction with Taruun, and a Worn 
              Scout page (6-slot bag, small, wt 2.0, lore, no drop). Head to Shadeweaver's 
              Thicket and kill Shak Dratha Senthians in the upper to middle caverns, 
              or the Shak Dratha Assassins and Raiders outside the caves. Collect 
              6 Shak Dratha Skulls. Combine them in the bag and return the result

                level of apprentice. I will send someone for your new cloak in 
                a moment. While I am doing that, please use this bowl to prepare 
                some spicy fish stew and take it to Kerr Tiparr in the Hollowshade 
                outpost. It's not often that they get good food out there. If 
                you don't remember the recipe, just ask cook Mylis. When you are 
                done, please return with your old cloak and the empty pot. Always

                to make. If you're looking to make a large pot of it, you'll want 
                to be sure that you have enough ingredients ready from the start. 
                Gather up a flask of water, a jug of sauce, some spices and two 
                wetfang steaks. Cook them in an oven in a large stewing pot. For 
                being so foul, those wetfangs sure taste good. Throw all of that

                are now. Ah well, enough with this chatter. Take this bag and

              <p>Elam Arruk says 'You will need to begin familiarizing yourself 
                with the moor and its inhabitants. As a scout, there is one creature 
                that roams the moor that you are going to need to focus on in 
                particular. These creatures are wolf-like in their appearance, 
                but have no need for sight and show absolutely no fear of the 
                tactics that we usually use to scare off animals. They move in 
                packs and attack swiftly. To learn their behavior, you will need 
                to track a few down. Fill that bag with a few of their tongues 
                and bring it back to me. Once you have seen them, I will be able 
                to teach you more. <br>

            <p>The tongues can drop off any Sonic Wolf in Hollowshade Moor. Fill

                to see the creatures, you have also provided me with lunch. I 
                hope that you learned something from your encounter. Those wolves, 
                or sonic wolves as the Dar Khura call them, have destroyed more 
                than a few scouting expeditions. Over the years, our research 
                into the origins of these beasts has proven fruitful. We have 
                found a means of making a weapon that reacts to their flesh. These 
                items will assist you in making that item. </p>
              <p>Elam Arruk hands you a dagger hilt and a mortar and pestle and 
                says, 'Those items are to be used to not only produce your personal 
                weapons, but to aid any other citizen that may be in need of the 
                component that we, as Taruun, are best suited to produce... the 
                poison. I understand that you are still young and new to poisons, 
                but this will be an easy process for you. You will need only to 
                grind the ingredients up in that mortar and pestle. Then heat 
                the resulting powder in an oven by placing the powder and some 
                water in a poison vial. Be sure not to over cook it. </p>
              <p>Elam Arruk says 'You will need to visit the Library of War History 
                and purchase a book on the construction of this weapon. Read it 
                and construct the weapon. I recall that the scholar that sells 
                the book was also working on a construction kit for the weapons. 
                Please take your finished weapon and your apprentice cloak to 
                Elder Taruun Ternq. I am sure that he will be curious about your 
                progress.</p>

              You now have a new cloak that is 6 AC 2 Dex, 10 HP, 2% Baking as 
              well as a Taruun Hilt Piece<br>
            </p>
            <p>The next step is the creation of the Sonic Wolf Bane dagger, which 
              requires the cooperation of every Vah Shir class. (Each class has 
              a specific part they are able to create, using the quest tools given 
              them by their guild quests.)</p>
            <p>The ingredients for the Sonic Wolf Bane Poison are:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><br>
                Digested Salass Moss: An uncommon drop off any Owlbear in Hollowshade<br>
                Sonic Wolf Blood: An uncommon (bordering on rare for the number 
                of people that need this) drop off any Sonic Wolf in Hollowshade<br>
                Poison Dart Felts: Uncommon drops off Grimling Spiritists in Hollowshade 
                (a good camp is the one with the chief)<br>
                Tortoise Saliva: Uncommon drop off Moor Tortises<br>
                <br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>These must be combined in your acrylia mortar and pestle. The result 
              must then be baked in an oven along with a flask of water and a 
              poison vial.</p>
            <p>Buy the Weapons Assembly Kit from the Arms Historian and combine 
              all 5 pieces from each class and the Taruun Hilt Piece and you will 
              recieve a Sonic Wolf Bane Dagger but not the Assembly Kit. Further 
              details on the Sonic Wolf Bane quests are found <a href="luclin_sonicwolfbane.htm">here</a>.<br>
            </p>
            <p>After you show your cloak and dagger to Elder Taruun Ternq you 
              get a new cloak, which is 7 AC, 3 Dex, 15 HP and 3% Baking. Elder 
              Taruun Ternq then suggests you head out into Hollowshade Moor and 
              hand the dagger to Ahom Guzhin in Hollowshade Moor.</p>
