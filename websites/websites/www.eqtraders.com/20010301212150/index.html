            <p class="black">Hail and well met, citizens of Norrath! Do you want 
              to learn a trade skill? Do you want to sell the fruits of your labor 
              to other players? Are you trying to find specific items to pratice 
              your craft? Or are you just trying to find someone who sells player-crafted 
              items for a reasonable price on your server? If the answer to any 
              of these questions is "yes", then I hope this site will be of assistance 
              to you. As the game changes and grows, so too, will this site - 
              remember to check back often.</p>

                She's ba-a-a-ck! I'm back in town, though it will take me a few 
                days to catch up on everything. I can now say from personal experience, 
                though, that even a 1-hour flight is a total nightmare when flying 
                with an ear infection. (Ugh) Othmir fur is finally dropping in-game. 
                A few new pieces of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
                tailored armor</a> have had recipes/stats verified. A few more 
                stats are in place for imbued jewelry. The enchanted seafarer's 
                weapons for <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">human 
                cultural smithing</a> that have been listed as bugged since the 
                September smithing patch may have been changed/deciphered. (The 
                NPC source for this is now apparently asking for enchanted sheets 
                that are made from HQ ore, instead of the original request for 
                enchanted MQ sheets). And ... cod is still totally, 100% believed 
                to be missing. CodFest 2001 was a bust, fishermen and women have 
                thrown down their fishing poles in frustration, and I'm praying 
                something about it will appear on the SONY boards sometime with 
                a confirmation or an ETA.</p>
              <p>As mentioned below, if you have questions, and can't find the 
                information on the site, please post to the message boards instead 
                of filling up my mailbox. You're far more likely to get a response 
                if you post there. :)</p>
              <p><span class="dates">02/21/01</span><br>
                <b>Patch Day ... and the DenMother runs away!</b> Murphy and his 
                laws caught up to me again, and instead of having a &quot;leisurely&quot; 
                24 hours in which to verify patches to tradeskill stuff before 
                going out of town, I ended up with far less time. (Tunare was 
                down for the count for a while this afternoon, and once it was 
                back up, and I'd fished my way through a couple hundred bait, 
                it was time for me to go down for the count and take a nap!)</p>
              <p>I've managed to verify only a few things today: gator rolls (had 
                been bugged since launch, I think) now work with the in-book <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">recipe</a>, 
                holgresh fur cap and boots are working (email verification from 
                someone on the cap, though it failed; I made the boots, and stats 
                are on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious tailoring</a> 
                page). Some stealth-additions to <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
                jewelry</a> went in, and while I'm very under-impressed with the 
                Karana imbue (and many other imbues from Jan 31, such as Niami's 
                Bristlebane imbue), I'm ecstatic over the Tribunal imbue.</p>
              <p>Sadly, our cod fishing expedition met with no luck. We only had 
                time to test 40 to 60 fish in each of the following zones before 
                we put away our fishing poles in frustration, but either these 
                fish are somewhere really odd in Velious, or they've broken the 
                pattern of all other Velious tailoring recipes, and need a spawn 
                from another continent. (Iceclad, Eastern Wastes, Kael Drakkel, 
                Great Divide, Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Skyshrine, Sirens 
                Grotto and Western Wastes were all fish-tested today.) Soooo, 
                the 40 velium bits and dozen arctic wyvern hides that my guild 
                helped me collect will have to sit in the bank a while longer, 
                and we have an entire suit of tailored armor that still can't 
                be made. If anyone finds cod (and please, no &quot;friend of a 
                friend of a friend of mine&quot; stories) PLEASE post to the message 
                board ... there's a thread in the tailoring section about our 
                most recent attempts.</p>
              <p>A lot of the patch stuff is not yet verified ... and I'm running 
                away!? Yep. I'll be out of town until next Tuesday. <font color="#400000"><b>If 
                you have ANY updates for the site, news on stuff that is or isn't 
                patched as advertised, trivial rates, or even &quot;just&quot; 
                questions, PLEASE post to the message boards.</b></font> Do not 
                make the folks that read this site wait for days on end for me 
                to process my email for an update on something that is broken/fixed, 
                etc. This causes a lot of duplication of effort, and a lot of 
                strain on my mailbox. Once I return, I WILL be removing my email 
                link from most of these pages, due to a massive increase in email 
                that's mostly &quot;simple&quot; stuff that could be handled better 
                on the boards. I can't tell you how many times I get email on 
                things that are stated on the recipes pages, location pages, etc., 
                or have been beaten to death on the message boards, yet still, 
                several folks have to send me email with questions about it. Seriously, 
                folks ... there's a HUGE tradeskill community discussing things 
                on these message boards, and if you're relying on one single halfling 
                for your information via email instead of going to the message 
                boards and relying on all the folks there, you're not only overloading 
                the wee halfling, but there's an increasingly high chance that 
                your questions will not get answered. (Especially if you join 
                the 30+ folks who believe I'm holding back some &quot;secret&quot; 
                to finding the yew leaf ground spawn, and that by sending me email, 
                my answer posted on the recipes page will change. Random means 
                just that ... we can't find a pattern or specific area of Wakening 
                Lands. Asking me over and over again in email won't change that 
                answer. /bonk) For those of you great folks who are reporting 
                in trivial levels and such, much as I LOVE getting such confirmations, 
                if you could start posting that stuff to the message boards instead 
                of mail-bombing me, it makes it easier for others to see the info, 
                and gives me a chance to address it when I'm dealing with site 
                updates, instead of keeping it in unread mail for days on end. 
                :) </p>

                <b>Save that bait!</b> It seems that the lovely cod for <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velium 
                tailoring</a> suffered an odd malady and all went belly up. Please 
                postpone further hunting for the elusive fish until Verant can 
                restock the appropriate body of water with them once again. (Translation: 
                save your scrounging/theories/etc. about this fish until after 
                the next patch ;D)</p>
              <p><span class="dates">02/09/01</span><br>
                I don't like having something negative and grumpy on the front 
                page of my site. Unfortunately, a lot of inconsiderate folks drove 
                me to it. I'm moving <a href="the_rant.htm">&quot;the rant&quot;</a> 
                to it's own page. If you are on the Tunare server read it before 
                you even THINK of sending me a tell in-game. Period.</p>
              <p>For the rest of you newer visitors, who have seen something about 
                the new tailored ranger, monk, rogue, etc. armors, please note 
                the following before you think of mail-spamming me for the recipes. 
                Recipes for these pieces are found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious 
                recipes</a> page. Stats for any pieces that have been made are 
                listed. If you don't see stats for the piece you want, I haven't 
                made it yet, and nobody else who has made it has reported it to 
                me yet. Do not ask me for them, I can't give them to you if I 
                don't have them. If you want something more up-to-date than the 
                recipes pages that I sometimes update several times a day, check 
                the message boards. Do NOT email bomb me asking for more details. 
                There is an entire HUGE community of tradesfolk on the message 
                boards, several of whom can likely answer your questions in a 
                more timely manner than me. To expect me to answer up to 100 pieces 
                of email a day for information that is either clearly printed 
                on the recipes pages, or easily answered on the message boards 
                is silly.</p>
              <p>Those of you who have been loyal followers, and have been showering 
                the boards and my mailbox with your words of support, thank you. 
                I feel a bit better now. Last night was a bit more tolerable, 
                with only one person not wanting to accept my response to &quot;PLEASE 
                visit the website instead of asking me for info&quot;, and sending 
                me another dozen tells while I was, amazingly enough, trying to 
                keep a guildmate of his alive in Kael. Errrmmm. Hopefully word 
                will eventually go out that my tolerance for tell nukes in game 
                is gone. If not, I'll let my &quot;bodyguard&quot; take care of 
                'em. ;)</p>
              <p>A few more of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
                tailoring recipes</a> have been verified, and Bristlebane smiled 
                upon me a bit. There were actually more successes than usual on 
                this extremely difficult and extremely frustrating armor ... and 
                some of the pieces may actually be worth wearing.</p>

              <p><span class="dates">02/04/01</span><br>
                Weekend update: Post-patch news. <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">Field 
                plate</a> boots are now fixed, but imbued versions are still DNC. 
                The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">holgresh fur</a> cap 
                and boots that were to be fixed are also still broken. Some <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
                jewelry</a> combinations were implemented, and we've heard that 
                there is more in the works. There is also supposedly something 
                in the works so that the &quot;missing link&quot; between non-cultural 
                tailoring and the extremely difficult velium tailoring will be 
                implemented eventually.</p>
              <p>This brings me to an interesting point, and yes, it means you 
                get to hear another mini-vent here. &lt;g&gt; I was treated rather 
                condescendinly by someone on my server the other day because I 
                am &quot;wasting&quot; my time on the velium tailoring before 
                my halfing racial tailoring was maxxed. (Mind you, this same fellow 
                then tried to hound me into giving/selling/trading haze panther 
                skins, so that he, with his lesser skill, could have the chance 
                to make these items, but that's another story.) I am working on 
                velium tailoring for one reason, and one reason only ... all you 
                folks. I, at least, am enough of a stubborn redhead to keep trying 
                until all the recipes are verified, and the stats are known. There 
                is nothing more frustrating to a tailor to make repeated expensive 
                and time-consuming attempts at making armor, only to find that 
                when you <i>do</i> end up with a success, that the item you've 
                made is nowhere near worth the work you put into it. By collecting 
                as much information as possible on DNCs and stats, I hope that 
                many of you tailors can focus on trying to make the pieces that 
                <i>are</i> worth your while. (Each set seems to have some great 
                items, and some items that no person over level 20 would want.) 
                For those of you who are going to sneer at me as being &quot;foolish&quot; 
                by &quot;wasting&quot; my time on this stuff, while being hypocritical 
                enough to then try to get me to collect pelts for you ... keep 
                it up and you'll find that while I've been the soul of politeness 
                so far, I am well capable of using /ignore ... and the rest of 
                my guild is too. You ARE making use of the fruits of my research 
                on this site, and as such, you have no right to snipe at how that 
                research is done.</p>
