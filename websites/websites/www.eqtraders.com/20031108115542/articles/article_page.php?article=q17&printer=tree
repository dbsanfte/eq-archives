<h4>Qeynos/Kaladim/Bazaar/Plane of Knowledge</h4>
<p>
<i>While this quest does not require any tradeskill ability, it is the way to force the merchants that sells high quality ore to restock their limited supply. As such, it is of great interest to smiths.</i>
</p>
<p>
This quest can be done with four different vendors: Gliblixl Rocktok in the Bazaar, Yakum Oreslinger in Qeynos, Harnoff Splitrock in Kaladim, and Yeril Imsin in Plane of Knowledge. The text will vary based on which vendor you choose to restock, and the faction portion of the reward will also be different, depending on which merchant you choose.
</p>
<p>
Below is the text from the <i>original conversation**</i> with Gliblixl. Text will vary a bit for the other two, but they all ask for the same items.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gliblixl Rocktok says 'Hail _____! I sell the finest quality ore imported from the mines of Norrath! It's difficult to keep enough ore available with the demands of the local smiths however and could use some [assistance] restocking my supplies.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This has apparently changed, according to recent reports, and he no longer responds with the above text. In order to trigger this quest, you may have to ask him "What assistance?" or "May I offer my assistance?" to earn the following response:
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Gliblixl Rocktok says 'Hooray! Fill this crate with either four Small Bricks of Unrefined Ore or Four Large Bricks of Unrefined Ore from Norrath and I will pay you for your assistance in keeping me in business.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Place either 4 large or 4 small bricks of unrefined ore in the provided (no drop) box and combine before returning it to him. The ore can be found dropping off most goblins in Permafrost, Solusek A, and High Keep. Additionally, it can drop off the Janitor and Sporali in Runnyeye, as well as various mobs in Togiran Mines and miners/tunnelers in the Crypt of Nadox.

The quest results in xp, faction and coin (44pp for the large bricks, 14pp for handing in the small bricks.) Handing the combined box back to one of the four vendors will cause them to despawn and respawn with a fresh inventory of high quality ore.
