            <h3> Proudfoot Platemail - Rivervale Warrior Armor</h3>
            <p>This is one of several youngling armor quests in Rivervale. The 
              resulting armor is lore (other than bracer), no drop and HFL/WAR 
              only. The smithing combines are no-fail, and do grant some minor 
              skill increases. It is a dull gold in color when worn. <i>Please 
              note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often 
              are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Dalorio Blistbobble'<br>
              Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Zonkers! You scared me! Well it is good 
              to meet you nonetheless young _____. Many young Guardians of the 
              Vale often come to me for guidance. If there is something I can 
              help you with in your training you make sure you let Dalorio know! 
              In the meanwhile I will be working on my [trade]. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'What trade?'<br>
              Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Well you see _____, I have been an aspiring 
              blacksmith for quite sometime now. I have spent mostly all of my 
              spare time since I was just a wee whipper snapper like yourself 
              collecting different materials and trying to craft anything and 
              everything of value in our town forge. Blacksmithing has always 
              interested me and that interest is exactly what led to the creation 
              of my [special recipes]. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'What special recipes?'<br>
              Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Well its funny that you ask _____, I have 
              just recently perfected my smithing recipes for Proudfoot Platemail. 
              I would be willing to part with my recipe along with a mold for 
              each piece of this fine platemail to any apprentice willing to [collect 
              the necessary items] to craft it. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'I will collect the necessary items.'<br>
              Dalorio Blistbobble says 'You will eh _____? I am happy to hear 
              of an upcoming Warrior of the Vale willing to collect the items 
              necessary to craft their own armor. I must admit that you could 
              really use some armor because it can get quite dangerous out in 
              the thicket! Now back to business! To craft your own Proudfoot Platemail 
              you will need my magical assembly kit that you will combine the 
              items I ask you to gather for specific recipes. After you have done 
              this you will use the pattern I give you along with the material 
              you have fashioned and combine it in a forge to yield your armor 
              piece. Now are you [ready to get started]? '</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am ready to get started.'<br>
              Dalorio Blistbobble says 'Very well _____, let's get to it! Here 
              is my personal Platemail assembly kit. Inside this magical assembly 
              kit you will combine certain items collected both from the thicket 
              and our great city of Rivervale. It is my hope that while you progress 
              in your training and through the different armor pieces that you 
              will be able to learn of your surroundings both inside and outside 
              the Vale. If you are ready to start fashioning your items simply 
              tell me what armor piece you [want] to make. I have the recipe for 
              Proudfoot Platemail [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], 
              [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. As a side note, make sure you craft 
              your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of collecting the items 
              for it. '<br>

              will need to collect 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Large Yellowjacket 
              Tarsi, 1 Ruined Wolf Pelt and 1 Jumjum Juice then combine them in

              been more and more attacks on our homeland with every attack being 
              that much more brutal and savage then the attack before. I need

              through some twisted alliance brought forth by Lord Pickclaw to 
              mount an attack on Rivervale. I strongly feel that this attack may 
              be more then we can handle. If we are able to find out how they 
              plan to attack us we can make sure that their plan will not be carried 
              out. Once you have obtained 4 pages of war documents from these 
              monsters return them to me and I will reward you greatly for your
