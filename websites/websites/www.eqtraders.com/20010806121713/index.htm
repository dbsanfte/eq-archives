            <p class="black">Hail and well met, citizens of Norrath! Do you want 
              to learn a trade skill? Do you want to sell the fruits of your labor 
              to other players? Are you trying to find specific items to practice 
              your craft? Or are you just trying to find someone who sells player-crafted 
              items for a reasonable price on your server? If the answer to any 
              of these questions is "yes", then I hope this site will be of assistance 
              to you. If you can't find the information you need on the main part 
              of the website, it's likely that you can find the answers you need 
              on the message board.</p>

                Top news from the patch message is that non-quest pelts will be 
                stackable, and that two of the deity-specific pottery idols have 
                been changed. (We know some non-quest tailoring pelts were overlooked, 
                but we're not sure if it was accident or intent - I've submitted 
                an enquiry) about it. At least one of the idols we consider &quot;bugged&quot; 
                has not been fixed (Rallos Zek), and another (Cazic Thule) had 
                a couple surplus classes removed from the list of who could wield. 
                More details as they become available.</p>
              <p>New issues of the newspapers should be available in all starting 
                cities. Please use <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=624.topic">this 
                message board thread</a> to track anything regarding tradeskills 
                that is found in local papers.</p>
              <p>Site updates have been slow due to an RL death in the family 
                last week. I hope to get a bit more caught up on information from 
                the boards, screen shots, etc., as time goes on. So far, the biggest 
                news item since the last front page update, was information on 
                three different imbued versions of the <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">erudite 
                steelsilk</a> armor.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">7/10/01 - Patch Day</span><br>
                As usual, I'm going to be swamped, the boards are going to be 
                VERY busy, and very slow. It looks to be a good patch day tradeskill-wise, 
                but it's going to take time for us to verify everything mentioned 
                in the patch message ... and the stuff that wasn't mentioned. 
                :)</p>
              <p>On the confirmed list, we've got the new weight stats for the 
                <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_leathers.htm">black panther armor</a> 
                (two pieces stayed at their old weight of 0.3, all others had 
                their weight reduced), the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_silks.htm">ice 
                silk lined slippers</a> had their stats updated, spider silk and 
                silk swatches are now stackable, and at least some types of sheet 
                metal and folded sheets of metal are stackable (we've not yet 
                tested all the racial sheets yet). More information will be on 
                the message boards as the day goes on. Meanwhile, I'm going to 
                be working on editing and submitting screenshots to EQ'Lizer and 
                Alla'Khazam's, so that they have the updated stats on the changed 
                tailored items ... and maybe get some more sleeeeeeep.</p>

                Nothing <i>too</i> earth-shattering to report with this patch. 
                Pottery idols are now equippable, for the most part, by the proper 
                races and classes. (I've added in a <a href="secrets/pottery_idols.htm">stats 
                page for the idols</a>, and we're slowly filling in the blanks 
                on it.) One new baking recipe (orange flavored cod) was found 
                in the village newspapers. </p>

              <li>I've added a few new images to the fashion section in the last 
                few days, but I really can't do much with it on top of everything 
                else, so it will be slow to get updates until I find another fashion 
                editor. </li>
              <li>I've added info about mana vials to the FAQ section of the boards, 
                and will try to find time to put up an FAQ section on this main 
                site as well as time permits. Now, if only we could get folks 
                to read the FAQ posts, it'd clear up some of the extra noise on 
                the boards. :)</li>
              <li>There are still folks directly emailing me with questions about 
                things that are better posted to the message boards where they'll 
                get responses from more folks. Please, folks, use the boards. 
                Do not expect one overworked halfling to sit there and personally 
                explain to you the ins and outs of making dyes, for example. If 
                my explanation on the main site isn't clear, then maybe someone 
                on the boards can explain it to you more clearly than I apparently 
                can. ;)<br>

                trying to get caught up on all the message board posts and other

                two weeks, I did manage to sneak in some updates, as well as create 
                an <a href="secrets/imbued_gemlist.htm">imbued gems master list</a>,

                <b>Patch Day</b>. As usual, this means I'll be really busy once 
                the servers come back up, seeing what's changed on the live servers. 
                Also, as usual, it means the message boards will be VERY slow 
                loading, as it's likely to hit the 20K hits in a single day mark 
                today. Patience, grasshoppers. I'll get updates up as able.</p>
              <p>I normally don't talk a lot about what's going on over on the 
                Test server, though we randomly get updates from the Test tradesfolk 
                when something is coming through that will impact the trade community. 
                After all, it <i>is</i> Test, and things can/will/do change often 
                on Test before they hit the live servers. (And I absolutely refuse, 
                under any situation to post recipes/stats on the main part of 
                my site until it's verified as &quot;live&quot;.) However, an 
                accomplishment last night on Test deserves a little cheering. 
                The fleeting quiver has been very much a &quot;holy grail&quot; 
                type item for tailors and archers for 2 years now, and finally, 
                the recipe was put in place on Test. Given the difficulty of obtaining 
                the needed ingredients on Test, and the fact that there is a much 
                smaller tradesfolk community on Test, extra kudos go to Uind and 
                Gyodokan for reporting the first known success on a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=1676.topic">fleeting 
                quiver</a> on Test last night about half an hour before the servers 
                went down. Well done! I'm sure the folks on the live servers will 
                quickly follow suit once the servers are back up. :)</p>
              <p><b>Addendum:</b> The new imbued pottery idols are in-game. Recipe 
                is on the pottery recipes page and has been verified as functional. 
                Discussion and stats are on the message board. Snake meat can 
                now be pickled and made into steaks. Another fish recipe (marinated 
                muskie) has been found that trivials at 142. The fleeting quiver 
                recipe is live, and folks who have tried it today confirm that 
                it's not trivial at skill 209.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">05/22/01</span><br>
                <b>Tailoring Recipes Found</b>. My thanks to Suppina as well as 
                a large number of other folks who took the challenge of the missing 
                recipes and ran with it. We have stats, plus rough trivial levels 
                for an entire new set of silk armor (<a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring.htm">Wu's 
                Fighting Armor</a>) that will get tailors into the 150-range with 
                their tailoring skill. You folks on the message boards have done 
                the EQ tradeskill community proud with your cooperation and information 
                sharing! My one comment on all this, though, is that they just 
                recently stated that the Coldain Tanners Kit could be used for 
                ALL recipes other than the cultural tailoring ... but they don't 
                have enough slots in them for the 3-silk pieces of this armor. 
                Hmmmmmm ... Are tailors stuck needing multiple sewing kits ... 
                again?</p>
              <p>Last week, Aragir also posted results on the enchanted Antonian 
                longswords. It seems we had the right recipes all along -- sort 
                of. (The &quot;ruby&quot; and &quot;emerald&quot; mentioned by 
                the NPC turned out to be &quot;star ruby&quot; and &quot;fire 
                emerald&quot;, respectively)</p>
              <p>New baking discoveries seem to have trickled to a halt for the 
                moment, but it's likely we'll figure out a few more once the dust 
                settles.</p>
              <p>Potters are eyeing a couple new eyes on Test with some interest. 
                There's a lot of speculation going on, but we'll just have to 
                bide our time to see what actually makes it to the live servers.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">05/11/01</span><br>
                <b>What's New?</b> New baking recipes are still pouring in from 
                a horde of happy cooks, and I'm sure it will take a while before 
                we figure out all the new fish dishes. Expect some shuffling to 
                be done on the baking recipes page in a few days to try to better 
                organize the new recipes, but for now, I'm just trying to make 
                sure they all get listed as we find them. Smiths are reacting 
                with a mixture of pleasure and frustration. Enchanted chain jointing 
                is now working for high elves and dark elves, as are their racial 
                chain boots, and stats are starting to come in for many of these 
                armor items. However, human cultural smithing recipes for imbued 
                field plate boots and the enchanted antonian longsword still appear 
                to be nonfunctional. Tailors are still pulling their hair out, 
                as they're trying to find the hinted-at new recipes, and not having 
                much success, as the only new &quot;recipes&quot; that have been 
                found are for the 5th Thurgadin Shawl quest.</p>

                <b>Patch Day!</b> Most folks know the drill - it's going to take 
                time to process everything that went in during this patch to see 
                what affects us. Please be sure to check message board threads 
                before you start yet another totally new thread on a topic that's 
                covered in 6 other places - it makes it really hard for folks 
                to follow what's going on with all the repetition. :) The below 
                information will be updated later today, once we know for sure 
                how things are going on the live servers.</p>
              <p>Here's what I know about today's patch and how it will affect 
                tradesfolk:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a problem making it hard to loot really large NPCs - if 
                this works as stated, it should make it easier to loot Terrorantula 
                for silk.</li>
              <li>Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows - the details are 
                VERY vague on this, and I'm sure everyone will have their own 
                pet theories or ideas on how this &quot;should&quot; work in the 
                forums. Only time will tell how significant a change this truly 
                is.</li>
              <li>Not only the party, but the person looting, will now see a text 
                message saying what the person looted - at the least, this will 
                make those folks hunting cat pelts in the Karanas happier, as 
                you can tell which quality pelt you looted without having to peer 
                at each pelt as you're looting.</li>
              <li>You can move items in and out of containers in your bank without 
                having to remove the containers from the bank - a great boon to 
                space-impaired tradesfolk!</li>

                Unfortunately, the text for these recipes didn't make it in this 
                patch, though, so unless we succeed with some creative experiments, 
                we may not actually see these until the next patch.</li>
              <li>Several fixes were made to bugged recipes (enchanted adamantite 
                chain, enchanted/imbued adamantite leggings, stats on the velium 
                hound moccasins, etc.), but we don't know if they managed to get 
                added to today's patch, or if they're waiting on the next patch.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>I've also added a <a href="learn/learn_velious_nontailors.htm">lovely 
                guide</a> for all the non-tailors out there who want some of the 
                Velious tailored armor, giving information on the relatively difficulty 
                of obtaining the needed items for your local tailor. It will hopefully 
                raise a bit of awareness amongst non-tailors in just why it's 
                so difficult to get a tailor to &quot;just&quot; make and sell 
                them some pieces.</p>

                <b>A quiet week.</b> My mailbox forwarding, and that of my tradeskill 
                guide editor went awry for a while, but they're fixed now. </p>
              <p>It's a quiet week on the tradeskill front since there's no patch, 
                but experimentation and discussion continue on the boards. Slowly, 
                we're getting more <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">stats 
                for various cultural smithing items</a>, as more folks try out 
                various enchanted variations.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">04/27/01</span><br>
                <b>We're back!</b> It was a rollercoaster day for the site, with 
                a lot of ups and downs, but things look stable now. I'll keep 
                my fingers crossed that the hard-working folks at Refplace have 
                got things well in hand now.</p>
              <p>I'll get more up tomorrow, as I'm sort of busy in Hate right 
                now, but a quick note to let folks know that while the tier'dal 
                version of enchanted adamantite chain jointing is misbehaving 
                (Yakatizma's looking into it), enchanted tier'dal plate works! 
                I'll get the appropriate recipes onto the dark elven smithing 
                page tomorrow . For now, you'll find out how I did it on <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=2160.topic">this 
                message board thread</a>, plus stats of the piece I made.</p>

                <b>EZBoard downtime is longer than expected. The new ETA listed 
                on their site is &quot;Wednesday&quot;. Hang in there, folks, 
                you'll get your fix soon. :)</b></p>
              <p>A few quick notes in the meantime. <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">Baking 
                recipes</a> have been updated with several new recipes, as well 
                as food type information and know stat information. Once the boards 
                are back up, I'll ask folks to scan the recipes page and see what 
                I've missed. Since this <i>is</i> a tradeskill site, you'll only 
                find information on there for player-made food, not for any of 
                the purchased stuff. It's also been officially confirmed that 
                right-clicking on foods will NOT give any of the listed stat changes 
                for that food, and will only last half-duration.</p>
              <p>A few pieces of <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">steelsilk 
                armor</a> (erudite cultural tailoring) have been made. Due to 
                the rarity of the spawn, and the extreme expense involved, we 
                don't expect to quickly have complete stats for this tailored 
                plate-class armor.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the changes in enchanting metals for smithing, we're 
                gradually learning more about the various enchanted cultural armors. 
                The <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">armor stats 
                page</a> has been updated and slightly revamped to make it easier 
                to find out what we know.</p>

                <b>Message board downtime. </b>All EZBoards, including the EQTraders 
                Corner boards, will be down tomorrow (Tuesday) from approximately 
                9am to 6pm, PST while they move to a new facility.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">04/17/01</span> <i><b>(Updated)</b></i><br>
                <b>Patch Day!</b> It's that time again, and there are several 
                known tradeskill changes in it:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Durations on food items have changed. We've got a thread on 
                the baking message boards tracking meal/snack status on various 
                goodies. Some foods also have stat bonuses listed, however, these 
                bonuses are NOT actually showing up when you right-click to eat 
                the food.</li>
              <li>Ovens have been added to Grobb. I'll get info on where, and 
                put it on the proper Trade Supplies pages.</li>
              <li>Buying stacks of items off merchants has been implemented. This, 
                of course, only works if the item is stackable. Also, merchants 
                have improved their inventory retention program, and fully count 
                stacks of items that are sold to them, so that they can sell all 
                the items back to someone else. (Before, if you sold a stack of 
                items to a merchant, the merchant paid for them all, but would 
                then only think he/she had one of the item to sell back.)</li>
              <li>World (stationary) trade containers have been fixed. This <i>should</i> 
                fix the crash to desktop problem folks were having on a combine, 
                and solve the confusion generated when folks thought their ingredients 
                were disappearing after an incorrect combine (from a wrong recipe). 
                This likely does NOT address the tailoring issues we're seeing, 
                and once the dust has settled, we'll need to start getting in 
                feedback if the DNC problems are still continuing for portable 
                trade containers such as sewing kits.</li>
              <li><b><i>Cooking spits have had their weight increased to 3. Contrary 
                to the patch message, skewers are still weight 0.1</i></b></li>
              <li>Last, but <i>definitely</i> not least, enchanting metals for 
                cultural smithing no longer requires gems during the enchanting 
                process. This is a great boon to cultural smiths, and should allow 
                us to experiment a bit more easily with some of the enchanted 
                armors and weapons. There's already been much rejoicing over the 
                news that this was on Test, and I expect we'll see a lot of the 
                &quot;gaps&quot; in our enchanted cultural armor stats information 
                filled in over the next week or two.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><span class="dates">04/13/01</span><br>
                <b>Thanks folks!</b> Thanks to feedback from various folks who 
                follow these boards, the QA folks may have nailed down the crash 
                to desktop problem with tradeskill containers. I'm still not sure 
                if the DNC message folks have been getting on valid recipes are 
                linked (i.e., &quot;phantom&quot; items still in the container 
                from a failed combine) or not, but they've at least found part 
                of the problem, and are working to resolve it. For those of you 
                unaware of what I'm talking about, here's a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000032.html">link 
                to the thread over on the SONY boards</a>. </p>
              <p><span class="dates">04/11/01</span><br>
                <b>One Million ... Plus!</b> Thanks to Ragefire not showing up 
                for a few days on my server (just when I'm one of the prime people 
                &quot;camping&quot; for hours on end to try to get him for a guildmate), 
                I'm even more behind on things than normal. However, since today's 
                a banner day, of sorts, it deserves some sort of post. The message 
                boards topped the 1 million hit mark today, since their rebirth 
                a year ago January. (That's a half a million hits just since this 
                January.) I wish I had better stats for the main website, which 
                is tracked separately from the boards, but we only have stats 
                for the last couple of months since I moved hosting providers. 
                If March's traffic is any indication, I'd expect that the main 
                site will get over a million hits this month, on top of all the 
                heavy volume on the message boards. Welcome to the mainstream, 
                folks! It's only going to get busier from here, with all the changes/additions 
                to tradeskills that have been happening.</p>
              <p>Other mini-updates. Thanks to Khrolan and his raids, I was able 
                to test out two more pieces of the ice burrower silk (&quot;ice 
                silk&quot;) armor this week, as well as verify stats on two more 
                pieces of haze panther armor. As soon as I get more haze panther 
                pelts, I'll try to get stat verification for the final piece of 
                that set, then will be trying to avoid my sewing kit except for 
                testing the rest of the ice silk and the velium hound armor as 
                parts are available. It's STILL taking folks about 10 tell bombs 
                to get it to sink in that I'm not tailoring for other folks anymore, 
                but eventually folks will either accept that no means NO, or I'll 
                be clearing out and refilling my /ignore list every half an hour 
                because of all the folks who think I &quot;owe&quot; them civil 
                conversation on tradeskills in the middle of a raid. ;)</p>
