            <h3> Plague Rust Armor - Akanon &quot;Evil Rogue&quot; Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of several armor quests for young gnomes. This specific 
              one is for gnome rogues that follow Bertoxx. Less naughty gnome 
              rogues need to go to <a href="akanon_ROG.htm">this link</a> instead 
              for their armor. All pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, 
              GNM/ROG only. The graphic is &quot;blood red chain&quot; for this 
              armor. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer 
              materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the 
              parts for a second one</i> 
            <p>Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests 
              - you get a note from the quest giver (Kaxon Frennor) which you 
              have to give to a secondary NPC (Rebbie Romblerum), who will then 
              give you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit, exactly the same one as the 
              evil warrior and cleric kits I think, and probably the same one 
              as the shadowknight kit, and LORE so you can't get one of each). 
              Rebbie will then tell you the recipe for each item and give you 
              a pattern (Tattered [xxx] Pattern) when prompted. These patterns 
              appear to be the same items as the evil INT-caster Tattered [xxx] 
              Patterns (i.e. they're interchangeable). The primary quest giver 
              gives out the class-specific weapon quest. 
            <p>Your Location is 2068.29, -504.36, -182.06, Ak'Anon<br>
              You say, 'Hail, Kaxon Frennor'<br>
              Kaxon Frennor says 'Hail Genumkin. I am Kaxon Frennor, master assassin 
              of the Dark Reflection. I train talented gnomes that feel the calling 
              of the Plaguelord, Bertoxxulous, and wish to [serve as a rogue] 
              of the Dark Reflection. Disease and decay are powerful forces in 
              Norrath that crumble kingdoms and silently kill even the mightiest 
              of heros. It is the calling of the Dark Reflection to sow the seeds 
              of destruction as a catalyst to change. What progress would there 
              be if rulers did not die and clockworks did not malfunction, giving 
              way to greater rulers and better clockworks.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i serve as a rogue'<br>
              Kaxon Frennor says 'We are the spreaders of disease, the masters 
              of poison, the death that comes silently from the shadows. You must 
              outfit yourself with the tools of a rogue, crafted from the disassembled 
              remains of clockworks that are finished serving the purpose for 
              which they were built. Take this parchment to Rebbie Romblerum, 
              he will assist you in the construction of a suit of armor. When 
              you have been properly outfitted return to me for your [next task].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what next task?'<br>
              Kaxon Frennor says 'There are many of our kind that do not understand 
              the necessity of the Dark Reflection. The Eldrich Collective and 
              The Deep Muses seek to root us out and have us put to death or exiled 
              from Ak'Anon. In the Steamfont Mountains a Rogue of the Deep Muses, 
              Jibble Blexnik, has been hunting and killing young members of the 
              Dark Reflection that venture from Ak'Anon. Find this self-righteous 
              rogue and eliminate him. When you have accomplished this task bring 
              me Jibble's Stiletto.'</p>
            <p>Rebbie Romblerum is found with Mimtia Zethkog, Windlebeck Tobokog 
              and Glerbella Gibblix, in the tunnels at 2159.36, -592.41, -182.06. 
              You give him the parchment...</p>
            <p>Rebbie Romblerum says 'Hail Genumkin! You must be one of Kaxon's 
              new trainees. Kaxon has asked me to help get you outfitted in a 
              suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our foes. I have 
              assembled a kit for you that will allow you to construct the armor 
              pieces once you have gathered the necessary components. The required 
              components vary according to which piece of Plague Rust Mail you 
              are planning on assembling. Do you wish to craft a [plague rust 
              coif], a [plague rust bracer], [plague rust gloves], [plague rust 
              boots], [plague rust sleeves], [plague rust leggings], or a [plague 
              rust tunic].'</p>
