<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Have you ever 
  seen a woman so in tune with men that she has but to smile appreciatively at 
  them, and they seem to trip over themselves blushing and giving her gifts?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Have you ever seen a righteous 
  fury so strong and cold that witnesses fear they are going to suffer frostbite 
  from it ... if not worse?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Have you ever seen a woman 
  so casual about the profits from her hunts that half of them are given away 
  to folks in need before she can even reach a merchant to sell them? Who will 
  spend countless plat devising quests for the young so that they can feel they 
  <i>earned</i> something instead of just having everything handed to them?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Have you ever seen such 
  a bone-deep despair, that a young lass of 9 trainings would try to suicide against 
  a hill giant armed only with a cracked staff? </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have, my friends, and 
  much, much more, in the form of one woman, Shavanna Spiritdancer.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I remember when I first 
  saw her, when she was a lass of but 6 trainings, running about Rivervale hunting, 
  healing, laughing, teasing. I was an old gnome, even then, but her kind and 
  giving nature touched me and I remember rummaging to find un-wanted loot in 
  my packs as I saw her giving away items to folks more needy than her ... there 
  was just something about her that spurred one to generosity.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The next time I saw the 
  lass, she was in her 9th training, running full-tilt at a hill giant, screaming 
  curses in her native tongue, wielding only a cracked staff. Well, there was 
  no way I was going to let a lovely lass like that suicide -- especially one 
  who'd kissed my bald pate in thanks when I'd given her those gifts on my first 
  meeting with her. So, being the mighty wee wizard that I am, I killed the hill 
  giant in his tracks. Oh, how quickly her despair turned into pure fury as she 
  turned on me. For a moment, skilled elder that I was, I was truly in fear for 
  my life. Then the battle-rage left her, and she crumpled in a curvaceous heap 
  at my feet, sobbing about someone being lost to her forever.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the intervening years, 
  I've been told that it was the last time anyone ever saw her cry ...</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I told her she was going 
  about the revenge thing all wrong, handed her a glowing wooden crook that I'd 
  been trying to sell just to get out of my inventory, and gave her a few quick 
  lessons, telling her bracingly that a Shaman of Justice could oft wait many 
  years to exact the proper judgement on those deserving of justice. Grim determination 
  replaced the look of bleak despair in her eyes at that moment.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From that point until now, 
  on the eve of my retirement from the wizardly arts, I've watched her, waiting, 
  worrying. She's become the mistress of burying her true feelings, covering all 
  with a flirting act that fools most, if not all. Not once in all that time has 
  she given her heart. Rarely, if ever, have her flirtations lead to even single 
  dalliances with a man. Either she has not found any worthy of her true affections, 
  or she still grieves.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mask is a good one, 
  and ofttimes I forget she is anything but a lighthearted shamaness with a kind 
  and flirty streak leagues wide. But every once in a while I see something in 
  her eyes as she watches a hill giant stride by ... and I find myself feeling 
  sorry for the unsuspecting hill giants. I want ringside seats when she comes 
  into her full power and seeks them out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She came to visit me last 
  week, that lovely barbarian lass. If only I was 200 years younger, and perhaps 
  a bit taller, and ... tchah ... no sense worrying about all that piffle now, 
  is there?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She looked lighter, happier 
  ... at peace. The sort of peace few ever find in life. Whatever ghosts had haunted 
  her, whatever grief had been in her past, she seems to have come to terms with 
  it. She looks ... content. Mind you, I don't know if she's truly in love with 
  this young erudite she went moon-eyed about or not, but he seems good for her. 
  Reminds me of your grandmother and I, back about 300 years ago, that little 
  happy glow. We were so in love ... Not like you young folks today, in love one 
  moment, out of love the next. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hey what? </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Oh, the point to all this?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Find her, grandson, as 
  a final wish to me. Ask her to dance for my spirit. She'll know what I mean.</font></p>
