<p><font face="Arial" color="#800000"><strong>Welcome to the Tal Kor Jewelry Academy!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The art of jewelcraft is an expensive, often frustrating, but
interesting hobby. While not terribly profitable (and not at all profitable at lower
levels), it is still a fascinating trade to pursue and will allow you to make items that
are either not readily available from merchants or that are sold by merchants for
phenomenal amounts of money. The Academy's purpose is to guide you as you develop your
skills.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Within these walls you will find information on jewelry components,
gem/metal combinations, and anything else pertaining to jewelcraft. You will also find
the approximate cost of jewelry components. Please note that these prices are <strong>approximate</strong>
and will most assuredly vary depending on your charisma and location.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">All prices are based on merchants from the various cities.<br>

            this lovely academy. It is being adopted into the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com">EQ 
            Traders Corner</a> community, and as time goes on, it will be updated 
            to be brought up-to-date with more details on high-end jewelcrafting 
            and imbued (deity-specific) jewelry. Please be patient, as the changes 
            will be slow and careful. A small halfling with rather large feet 
            will be tiptoeing through and trying to keep the same loving look 
            and feel this Academy has always had while attempting to modernize 
            it as well.</font>

            have been updated to include black sapphire combinations as well as 
            enchanted velium combinations for each gem.</font>
