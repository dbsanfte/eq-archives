The articles linked in here are meant as <I>very</I> basic introductions
to various trade skills in Norrath. Since Norrath is a dynamic world, things
DO change with time, so experimentation is encouraged.&nbsp;For that reason,
I am not readily making available master lists of item combinations
(i.e.,&nbsp;recipes) to the casual browser. (Who knows what I might link
in some hidden corner, if I find a lively spirit of experimentation and knowledge
contribution by my readers?) &nbsp;I also plan on putting in more in-depth
guides, eventually, but not until after things settle down more. As many
of you can guess, admin of this web site, which is a labor of love, severely
cuts into the time when I can actually play and putter with all these skills!
