<span class="headers">Ak`Anon Cleric (Shortnoble) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests. This one originates with Iony Gredlong, in the Cleric's guildhall of Ak'Anon and results in lore (other than bracer) no drop armor that is GNM/CLR only. The armor is sky blue in color. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
