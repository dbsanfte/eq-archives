            <h3> Prime Healers Armor - Qeynos Cleric of Rodcet Nife Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, and will be 
              restricted to HUM, CLR. <i>Please note that while the bracers are 
              not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer 
              before you get the parts for a second one</i> 
            <p> 
            <p>Armor is a Lime green almost wooden looking plate armor. </p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Filian Weagleross' </p>
            <p>Filian Weagleross says 'Pleased to meet you Kemolas, I am Filian 
              Weagleross High Priest of the glorious Rodcet Nife! I have recently 
              taken upon some very [important duties] here in our temple so if 
              your business is not urgent please excuse me.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what important duties?' </p>
            <p>Filian Weagleross says 'My important duties are training the new 
              recruits of our temple. It can be quite perilious for a new adventurer 
              in our world today as I am sure you will soon find out. The Temple 
              of Life is dedicated to ensuring that once our young ones leave 
              our home to venture out into Norrath they are ready for whatever 
              might present itself. If you are a [young cleric of Rodcet] then 
              we can begin your training at once.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a young cleric of Rodcet.' </p>
            <p>Filian Weagleross says 'Your training will be very important to 
              your development as a Cleric of Rodcet Nife so I do hope you will 
              remain focused at all times. Your exercises will take you all over 
              your hunting area and our city to specific [magical items].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what magical items?' </p>
            <p>Filian Weagleross says 'The magical items you need to collect will 
              be necessary for creating your magical armor will be placed in this 
              Prime Healers Mail Kit that will create armor materials.When you 
              are ready to collect the items necessary for creating a piece of 
              armor all you must do is tell me what armor piece you [want] to 
              craft. I can present you with the recipes and armor molds for Prime 
              Healer Initiate [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], 
              [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft Helms.' </p>
            <p>Filian Weagleross says 'To create your helm material you will need 
              to combine 2 Bricks of Crude of Iron Ore, 1 Piece of Rat Fur and 
              1 Chunk of Meat in your assembly kit. Once you have created the
