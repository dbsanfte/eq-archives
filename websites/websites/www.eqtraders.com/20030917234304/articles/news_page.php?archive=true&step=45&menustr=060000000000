<p>
<p>Today's patch contains many tradeskill-related items. I'll post the
appropriate information here, and will update it with comments in italics during
the day as we check things out.
<ul>
  <li>Changed the method of obtaining the Planes of Power 'imbue' spells. Speak
    with the fellow that gave them to you before for more information. - <i>the <b>lady</b>
    that used to handle the tradeins now tells you how to make the imbue spells
    yourself. <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm">Recipes
    on the site</a></i>
  <li>Removed the level casting restriction from Necrotic Divining Device. <i>-
    this is a happy thing</i>
  <li>Fixed the invisible forge in Felwithe <i>- forge is now <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/felwithe.htm">located</a>
    inside Emerald Armor in North Felwithe</i>
  <li>Added Collapsing Fletching, and Collapsing Mortar and Pestle. Added recipe
    books for them.<i> -<a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_tinkering.htm">
    recipes on site</a></i>
  <li>Added Vah Shir Spirit Stone recipe. Check existing recipe note for
    information. - <i>recipe for <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">essence</a>
    and <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_pottery.htm">spiritstone</a>
    on site</i>
  <li>Added a few forges to Crystal Caverns in Frostone. <i>- <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/crystal_caverns.htm">locs
    on site</a></i>
  <li>Added the Ignore Trivial Loot flag to several temper components for the
    Firiona Vie server. <i>- this was prompted by a comment at the Fan Faire
    regarding DE cultural smithing. It will take time to find out which temper
    items now ignore TLC on FV</i>
  <li>Removed the Lore tag from the crafted planar steins. <i>- this is also a
    happy thing</i>
  <li>Added a level limit and recommended level to some Planes of Power jewel
    crafted items. - <i>some pieces were inconsistent and all should have had
    level limits from the start. Updates will be made to the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_jewelry.htm">PoP
    jewelry page</a> as folks report on the various items</i>
  <li>Saltwater Seaweed is now tradable. <i>- it is still nonstacking and
    nonsellable, but at least you can trade it between characters now!</i>
  <li>Paladin and Shadowknight gnomes should now be able to gain skill above 200
    in tinkering.<i> - seems the newest classes for gnomes couldn't quite get
    the hang of advanced tinkering at first ...</i>
  <li>Attempting to create planar sheets of metal will no longer destroy the
    Tanaan Smithing Hammer. <i>- our bank accounts thank you! Those hammers are
    pricey!</i>
  <li>Stacked items can't be combined in a container, they must be separated. <i>-
    no more accidentally combining a stack of blue diamonds when a recipe calls
    for one?! Happy, happy, joy, joy!</i>
  <li>Characters no longer consume food or get the food and drink messages when
    in trader mode.<i> - not directly tradeskill related, but tradeskillers who
    sell stat foods and drinks will no longer worry that their greedy vendor
    mules will eat all their stock!</i><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>And in the not announced, but in the patch category:
<ul>
  <li>changes to the trivial levels for ethereal brewing, smithing and
    tailoring. -<i> they now trivial at skill <=220. Until you have either a
    raw skill of 220, or can achieve 220 modified skill with a +brewing item
    (i.e., 210+ skill and a +5% brewing geerlock), you cannot attempt combines
    on these items. This basically means that these were not meant to be used as
    a skillup path. While this is not a happy thing, I understand why they did
    it. Sorta. Kinda</i>
  <li>class 6 mana batteries are now sold in Plane of Knowledge - <i>yep, you
    guessed it, another happy thing! ;)</i>
  <li>Stationary tradeskill containers were added to Skyshrine - <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/skyshrine.htm"><i>locs
    are on the site</i></a>
  <li>Sirekoth Eshe has reopened his shop in the Plane of Knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll add more comments once I'm done wading through all the posts, and check
some things out in-game

<p><span class="headers">November 17, 2002 - A Word on Imbues</span>
<p>
<p>Several folks have noticed that Noirin Khalen in Plane of Knowledge changed
her hail response over the weekend. While she used to accept ethereal parchments
in trade for a random planar imbue spell, she now returns the parchments and
speaks of a way to make the spells using a planar jeweller's kit and various
other items. Please note, however, that while she speaks of this new method of
obtaining the imbues, this process will <i>NOT</i> work until the next patch
(scheduled for Tuesday). Please hold on to your supplies and experimentation
until that time.

<p><span class="headers">November 10, 2002 - Must Sleeeeeeeep</span>
<p>
<p>The House Ogre and I have safely returned from the San Francisco Fan Faire.
It was a fun, if tiring weekend. While the weather was not the greatest, we did
manage to squeeze some time in at Muir Woods (yes, I hugged a redwood), and
crossed the Golden Gate Bridge (though we couldn't even see the top of the
bridge through the fog). I also met various EQ community leaders, including <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com" target="_new">Allakhazam</a>,
<a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/" target="_new">Baelish</a>, <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/" target="_new">Illia</a>,
and <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org" target="_new">Vaslin</a>; and various
VI personalities I've interacted with electronically, including Absor, Axgoreth,
Frizznik, and Lyndro. (I also, of course, spoke with Yakatizma, but we'd already
been acquainted due to the San Diego Fan Faire a while back.) I met a lot of
great folks from the EQTC boards, though I suspect that by the end of Saturday,
I likely had a slightly glazed look in my eye from all the names and faces that
flashed before me. At long last, I also finally got to make good on a long-ago
promise to bring "Ester the Tester" chocolate. (After, of course,
buying a second bar of the dark chocolate with rapsberries for myself, to assure
it was worthy of eating!) While I had to start camping the line for the 6 pm
Tradeskill panel at 5 pm due to the two earlier sessions being filled to
capacity, I'm going to leave it to someone else to post some of the information
from the panel that I attended (as well as the 2 earlier full ones). I need to
go unsnarl my brain for a bit, spoil my frantic cats, and get some sleeeeeeeep.

<p>
<p>It's pretty quiet on the tradeskill front as we continue to work on verifying
more of the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm">PoP
recipes</a>. Just a couple quick notes before I start packing for the Fan Faire:
<p>1) Reports of the continuations to the Planar Traveller's Manual quest being
fixed may have been premature. Reports are in that there are still issues with
it, so I'd recommend holding off on questing it right now. 2) Members report
Anizok's gauze press is now happily summoning bandages again.
<p>That's likely all the front page updates I'll have until next week, as we'll
be out of town Thursday-Sunday, and any time I do spend dialed in will be spent
handling the boards and updating the PoP recipes pages.

</p>
<p><span class="headers">November 01, 2002 - </span>
<p>
<p>For those of you who have your <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/pop_planartravelersmanual.htm">Planar
Travelers Manual</a>, and are looking <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/pop_aftermanual.htm">to
continue the quest along the Planar Magic or Planar Stealth</a> path, you might
want to hold off on questing, unless you're one of those crazed tradeskillers
working on both paths at the same time. While the appropriate items are now
being returned when you hand in your <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_pottery.htm">planar
stein</a> or <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_baking.htm">hobgoblin
surprise</a>, the next NPC in each step isstill a bit confused and wont respond
unless you have obtained the opposite manual.<i> (Personally, I think they
filled up the steins with something extremely potent and went on a drinking
binge before returning to their posts, but ...)</i> When these have been fixed,
the quests page will be updated accordingly. If what I just posted doesn't make
any sense to you, just note the fact that the quests are still minorly glitched,
and hold off on your questing until they can be fixed. ;)
<p>It appears that the vendor buyback price for some compound bows was lowered
in yesterday's patch, as well as the vendor selling price for ceramic vanes.
Before folks go screaming into the fletching forum (again) about
"nerfs", I want to say two things. 1) VI has stated in the past that
you should not be able to make a profit vendor-selling tradeskill items, and it
appears that at least the bow change was thanks to notes about folks making a
profit making and vendoring these bows. 2) Civil rants, raves and whimpers
belong in the Primal Scream forum, <i>not</i> the Fletching forum, or any of the
other main tradeskill forums. Discuss things all you want, but if folks start
foaming at the mouth, expect posts to be locked. Should it get too out of hand,
we may ask certain reactionary elements to leave the boards, at least until they
can get themselves under control. This community doesn't need to deal with that
level of venom over changes made by VI, m'kay?

<p><span class="headers">October 31, 2002 - Patch Day - (revision of the revision)</span>
<p>
<p>As mentioned on the 29th, today's patch included: greasy diamond of innovation
recipe has been fixed (and someone has already completed the resultant <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_pottery.htm">ceramic
hammer of innovation</a>). <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_tinkering.htm">Anizok's
Minimizing and Maximizing Devices</a> should now be rechargeable with a mana
battery - class six. Anizok's Gauze press was changed to a 20-charge item, and
is rechargeable with a mana battery - class one. <i>However, there's currently
an issue with the proper spell being missing, so the press doesn't work. Hold
onto your horses and your presses, as VI is aware of the problem. When I hear an
ETA for a fix, I'll post something here</i>. (C'mon folks, cut them a break.
Mistakes happen when dealing with patches, and rampaging around screaming about
the "nerf" won't help any.)
<p><b><font color="#800000">Other tradeskill changes not mentioned in the patch
message:</font></b> A new vendor has been added to <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/PoKnowledge.htm">Plane
of Knowledge</a> to carry the mana batteries for class one through class five.
We <i>should</i> also see an increase in the drops of midnight stones with this
patch.
<p>Many <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm">PoP recipes</a>
continue to be verified in record time by a horde of eager adventurers. Unlike
with past expansions, I'm not giving myself (more) grey hair by trying to
personally verify a lot of these items, but rather am working on processing all
the data posted by various folks, and beating the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/info/PoP_drops.htm">PoP
drop information</a> into shape for addition to the database. There are also
several new quest writeups in place, including the newly-solved quest for <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/PoP_planar_armor.htm">PoP
planar armor</a>. I've also roamed over to the Safehouse and the Tinkering
Compendium several times to make sure that we're all working with the same
information on verified recipes, trivials, etc. Thankfully, this has made this
expansion a lot easier on this exhausted halfling, though it's still been
creative finding the time to do site updates, tackle more chunks of this
ever-growing database (the sheer volume of information already in it ... and
still to go ... is very boggling at times), and get in a little play-time before
I go redhead with an oversized rolling pin IRL.
<p>The House Ogre and I will be at the Fan Faire next weekend, though I'll <i>not</i>
be bringing along a "laundry list" of things to tackle in the
tradeskill discussions. <i>(I promise, Yakatizma, I'll leave the rolling pin at
home /grin)</i> Not only am I sure that others there will be more than ready and
able to ask thorny questions, but a) I play email tag with the tradeskill team
frequently when there are issues to be addressed, and b) I need some
"downtime". I know, I know, I'm not really escaping from EQ stuff,
since I'll be at an EQ con, but I'll be away from the computers and away from
the site for a couple days -- and that is a "good thing" for someone
who maintains something this massive day-in and day-out. So, those of you who
are going to be at the Fan Faire, feel free to say hello, but <i>please</i>
understand if my eyes start to glaze over during your favorite tradeskill rant
that I'm one <i>very</i> exhausted redhead right now and am likely to be
sleepwalking half the weekend. ;) Of course, this likely holds true for half the
VI team that will be there as well, given the amount of work <i>they</i> have
put in during the last couple of months.

</p>
<p><span class="headers">October 29, 2002 - Various Updates</span>
<p>
<p>It's been a week since the release of Planes of Power, and, at least from my
perspective, it's been the smoothest expansion launch yet. Those of you
grumbling in the corner, bear with me. Yes, there have been some crashes, and
more downtime than players would like, but all in all, it's been a LOT more
stable, we've been able to confirm that a lot more of the recipes are in, and
working, and so on. While there has been the invariable trolling, and banning,
on the boards, there's been a lot less of the ill-mannered chaos than we saw
with the release of Luclin, even last Tuesday when we had over 100,000 page hits
to <i>just</i> the message boards.
<p>This isn't saying it's perfect, and I'm sure we're going to find nigglies as
time goes on - things that need to be adjusted one direction or another in order
to be "balanced". It's looking good, though.
<p>Speaking of nigglies, and things that need to be adjusted, here's what we
know so far:
<ul>
  <li>The drop rate on midnight stones (needed for jewelcraft, as well as for a
    brewed smithing temper) is being adjusted - expect to see more of them drop
    after the next time Plane of Nightmares is patched.
  <li>After the next server patch, the tinkered shrink and grow devices
    (Anizok's Minimizing and Maximizing Devices) should be able to be recharged
    with a class 6 mana battery
  <li>Anizok's Gauze Press (summon bandage item) will become a charged item
    after the next patch. Before folks go screaming onto the forums and in-game,
    this is still a <i>very</i> useful item. Basically, you can zap out 20
    stacks of 20 summoned bandages for 10pp and change (recharges with a class 1
    mana battery.) This is noticeably less than that many stacks of real
    bandages would cost, and takes up far less space in packs. I'll be
    definitely getting a second one of these made (the first is on my monk) for
    my beastlord, along with a collapsed toolbox for field recharging. Yes,
    those who have sold these for insane prices are going to see less profit,
    and yes, you may have some disgruntled customers. Such is the life of
    tradeskills around the time of an expansion or a large patch. (Such as, gee,
    what happened to prices after a week or two of the PoTC craze? ;D)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, given what my "laundry list" normally looks like a week
after something large impacts tradeskills, things are looking pretty good from
my end. That doesn't mean I'm not dead on my feet, but I'm definitely less
frantic than is usually the case after something like this. Still, I'm very much
looking forward to a "weekend offline" at the Fan Faire in a week and
a half. ;)
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="headers">October 23, 2002 - Several items of interest</span>
<p>
<p>Please bear with me, this will be a longer update than usual, as there are
several things I wish to bring to the community's attention.
<p>It looks like we have a majority of <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm">the
PoP recipes</a> (other than poisonmaking, which still remains a mystery), with <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP_tinkering.htm">tinkering</a>
leading the pack with regards to percentage of recipes already verified. (The
gnomes are having much fun puttering around, from what I've seen, and I've even
decided to join them with a little gnomelet.) I'll be continuing to update
recipe pages several times a day for the next several days, in an attempt to
help folks sort out recipes and <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/info/PoP_drops.htm">PoP
tradeskill drops</a>.
<p>Next, a few things regarding the message boards:
<ol>
  <li>A new version of the EZBoard software has been released, and everyone who
    uses HTML in their signature files needs to be aware of how this will affect
    them. If you're an EZBoard community supporter, you will still be able to
    use HTML in your board sig files. If you have not signed up directly with
    EZBoards to be a community supporter, you will no longer be able to use HTML
    code in your sig files. This is why you're seeing a lot of ugly code in some
    people's posts instead of their old sig files. Read the <a href="http://www.ezboard.com/releasenotes/releasenotes_v70.html">release
    notes</a> for more details, specifically the link about security changes.
    There is also information there about added EZCode functionality for those
    who need/want to convert their sig file into EZCode. <i>(Also note that
    becoming an EZBoard community supporter means that ALL EZBoard Gold
    communities will no longer be charged for your visits to their boards, as
    well as making you ad-free when you visit non-Gold communities.)</i>
  <li>Currently, EQTC is "playing it by ear" with regards to EZBoard
    Gold renewal. The folks at EZBoards were kind enough to give us a 1-month
    extension on our current subscription based on what was in the community
    chest (which is separate from the paypal donations that folks are sending
    donations to in order to help pay for site costs), so we didn't have to
    worry about either renewing, or moving to a new home for the boards in the
    middle of the PoP chaos. This will give us a bit of breathing space to see
    what EZBoards can/will offer us with regards to renewal, or prep for moving
    to php boards via our site host.
  <li>They are looking at the impact of EZBoards on EQ communities such as this
    one. As part of this effort, they're asking feedback from the EQ
    communities. You'll find a link at the top of the message boards entitled <a href="http://beta.ezboard.com/fccfrm13">"IMPORTANT
    FEEDBACK: ezboard & Everquest".</a> Please take a few moments to
    click that link and add your feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, Woody from <a href="http://gucomics.com">/gu comics</a> has asked
that I post the following community announcement:
<p><b><font color="#800000">1st Annual GU Costume Contest</font></b>

<p>
<p>Today marked the day when the Planes of Power expansion went live. While I
didn't expect to be quite <i>this</i> late with my first update, I hope you'll
agree that the time was well-spent.
<p>When VI stated the following in their patch message, little did we know that
this applied to tradeskills as well!
<blockquote>
  <p>One of the new features included in the Planes of Power is a new way for
  NPCs deal with Player Characters. It allows NPCs to recognize certain actions
  taken by player characters. This may mean that an NPC will not be interested
  in talking to you until you've accomplished a certain task or until certain
  events have occurred. So some NPCs may not have much to say to you upon your
  first meeting, but might be more talkative later. This can also apply to
  events and locations that might react differently to a character that has
  accomplished a task than to one that has not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various folk have been running around hailing NPCs in Plane of Knowledge, and
it seems that they've received different responses based on if they were a
grandmaster (or near-grandmaster) in a specific tradeskill, or if they had no or
low skill. So, after seeing what recipes were posted in the PoP Data forum, I
broke out my horde of tradeskillers and tried to fill in the gaps.
<p>With no further ado, you can <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm"><b>find
out what we know of the recipes here</b></a>. You can find <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/PoKnowledge.htm"><b>vendor
information for Plane of Knowledge here</b></a>, and <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/PoTranquility.htm"><b>vendor
information for Plane of Tranquility here</b></a>. There's still a lot of
verification to be done, drops to be found, forages and fish to be cataloged,
vendors to be cross-referenced, etc., but it's a pretty good start.
<p>Please excuse me for a while. I need to go gibber in a corner ... or eat
dinner or something.

<p><span class="headers">October 20, 2002 - Brace for Impact!</span>
<p>
<p>Those of you who have been with EQTC since the launch of Luclin (or before),
know that things are about to get VERY busy around here. The site <i>will</i>
load more slowly as thousands of eager folks try to get the most up-to-date
information on the new recipes, vendors, etc. The boards will also be hit <i>extremely</i>
hard. I, and the rest of the EQTC staff, will be sifting through tons of posts,
trying to cobble together complete and accurate recipe listings and vendor
listings, (as well as dealing with any of the curve balls that real life seems
to like throwing at times like this).
<p>What can the rest of you do to help as Planes of Power launches tomorrow? <i>(Yes,
we know most folks won't get their software until Tuesday ...)</i>
<ul>
  <li>Be patient - the site and boards will likely load more slowly, as you
    won't be the only one eager for information. Excited folks will likely be
    mis-posting anywhere and everywhere in their desire to be "first"
    to report in information, and tempers will get quickly frayed. It <i>will</i>
    take time for information to be processed from the boards and put on the
    site. Reloading 10 times in half an hour won't change that fact, and likely
    will make updates even slower, as we have to wade through that same slow
    loading time to read the information and push updates to the site.
  <li>Be complete and accurate - if you don't provide all the necessary
    information in your post, you can't expect the information on the site to be
    correct. You're also likely making more work for the staff as we respond to
    your post asking for clarification (vendor name, loc, exact inventory, etc.,
    etc.)
  <li>Watch where you're posting - I'm setting up two temporary forums, much
    like we did for Luclin. One forum will be for general questions, comments,
    and conversation. A second forum is ONLY for recipes, trivials and vendor
    data. Any stray conversation in the recipes foum WILL be deleted. As with
    any "data only" sticky threads in the various forums, we will be
    actively enforcing this, as it speeds up the process of getting information
    from the message boards onto the main site.
  <li>Be patient. Yes, this bears repeating ... and repeating ... and repeating.
    If you're relatively new to the site, you may be surprised at what happens
    on the site and the boards in the next week or so. If you've been with EQTC
    for a year or more, you likely can guess how crazed it's about to be around
    here.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's going to be a horrifically busy time for the site, but with the help of
the community, it will hopefully be one of the smoother expansions with regards
to the level of chaos it brings to the site.
<p>For those who hadn't noticed, the Oct. 16 patch had a stealth
"gift" for tradeskillers with regards to a new general AA ability.
Those tradeskillers that are level 51 or higher, are allowed to spend 3 AA
points to train in New Tanaan Crafting Mastery. This allows them to bring a <i>second</i>
main tradeskill (baking, smithing, brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, pottery,
tailoring) above the 200 cap. With the expenditure of more points, GM
tradeskillers can bring others of these skills above the 200 mark as well.
<p>In other news, the talented Verdandi has done some major updates to the quest
page for <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/eighth.htm">the 8th Coldain
Prayer shawl</a>. Those of you working on this quest, or preparing to start on
it may want to print out the newly-updated pages.

</p>
<p><span class="headers">October 16, 2002 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
<p>Today's patch message has a couple items in it that I'd like to highlight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made it slightly easier to get skill increases while doing Tailoring,
    Tinkering, Smithing, Baking, Brewing and Alchemy. Made it slightly more
    difficult to get skill increases with Pottery and Fletching
  <li>Levitation can no longer be cast on Traders in the Bazaar</li>
</ul>
<p>We're trying to keep from having multiple threads in the same forum
discussing the skill increase change, so please try to contain discussion to <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2488.topic">this
message board thread</a>. If you're one of those folks that feels the need to
run around in circles screaming "nerf!" at the drop of any hat, you'll
find there's a <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm58.showMessage?topicID=1314.topic">thread
already up in the Primal Scream forum regarding this</a>. However, remember that
the board posting rules DO apply in there, and we DO enforce those rules, so
watch your manners. On Sunday, I'll likely create two new temporary forums for
PoP talk and PoP recipes, but for now, those of you wishing to discuss/speculate
on PoP before it is released next week will find that we're limiting discussion
to two threads until launch: <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2366.topic">one
thread for discussion/speculation</a>, and one for <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm58.showMessage?topicID=1269.topic">those
of you who feel the need to vent over things that still can/might be changed
before launch</a>. ;)
<p>We know folks get excited when new changes are coming, but hope that you'll
all think about the fact that the upcoming expansion is going to put a HUGE
stress on the site, on the boards, and on the staff. Please do your part to look
for sticky topics and the like before you post "new" information - it
really does save us a lot of time (Time which can then be used getting updates
onto the site quickly, and to continue to chip away at the huge mass of
information we're building into the database.).

<p><span class="headers">October 06, 2002 - Whoops!</span>
<p>
<p>As those of you who filled my mailbox today know, the site was
unavailable/lagging for a bit today. Racknine was nice enough to do some php
acceleration on the server that houses EQTrader Corner and other sites.
Unfortunately, the poor thing had a runaway cache, and brought things to their
knees. It's been fixed, thankfully, so things should be good now.

<p><span class="headers">October 03, 2002 - Message Board Downtime</span>
<p>
<p>EZBoard has had some hardware issues that have resulted in dowtime for the
message boards. I'd not put a message up here, as I'd expected them back up by
now. The newest ETA, however, is tonight. If I get any new updates, I will post
them here.

</p>
<p><span class="headers">September 17, 2002 - Thank you, Refplace!</span>
<p>
<p>I wanted to take a few moments to give my heartfelt thanks to <a href="http://www.refplace.com">Refplace</a>
for the "home" that they gave the site as an <a href="http://www.eqportal.com">EQPortal
Community</a> during some tough times. While load and database issues have
caused us to move over to Racknine for our hosting, I cannot stress enough how
much I appreciate the aid that Rory gave us in our time of need. It is very
likely that EQTC would have had to close it's doors (or be merged into one of
the fee-based sites) well before Luclin launched, if not for the site hosting
home that he provided.
<p>For those of you who are wondering, yes, the site move has increased our
costs, and costs will continue to grow, especially once PoP launches in another
month and a half (Luclin more than doubled our site traffice for a while, and
increased message board traffic 10-fold.) However, we <i>hope</i> to continue
managing to tread water financially, thanks to those of you that are clicking on
that PayPal icon over to the left, and making donations. Time will tell. In the
meantime, we will continue our struggle to keep the site as ad-free as possible.

<p>
<p>With little ado, DNS was changed today to point to our new hosting provider at
Racknine, catching many of us by surprise (I'd expected it to take another week
or so for the paperwork to be finished.) If you can read this message, then the
nameserver that you use has the new information. It also means that you've
likely seen some craziness with nav buttons today, due to a case-sensitive issue
on some links. I <i>think</i> I caught them all, but there may be a couple
holdovers for a day or two as I go over everything with a fine-toothed comb.

<p>
<p>Rumors that the Terrorantula, 8-legged menace of the Southern Desert of Ro,
has been reproducing have been verified. While they may be a bit easier to take
on than their mother, they're still tougher than your average dune tarantula.
Fortunately for all of us, they also drop terrorantula silk, long-prized by the
Erudites for durability in <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">cultural

<p>While we're not ready to give out an ETA on the new database, we <i>are</i>
ready to start asking for more concerted help on gathering information on the
thousands of items that need to go into it. If you are interested in helping,
please visit the <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm74">DenMom's

<p><span class="headers">September 04, 2002 - Patch Day!</span>
<p>
<p>Some days it's the little things in life that make you dance around,
sometimes it's the big. I'll let you all decide for yourselves where you put the
following updates. (Note: more information may be added to this later in the
day, but this is what the sleep-depreived halfling has found so far):
<ul>
  <li>jars of acid stack
  <li>jars of lacquer stack
  <li>low quality rockhopper hides can now be used for making leather padding. I
    also verified that dropping a medium quality rockhopper hide into the sewing
    kit with a skinning knife does yield low quality rockhopper hides. (I've not
    tested high quality hides yet, but I'm presuming the downward conversion is
    working for them as well)
  <li>stormreaper chainwoven skirt now fits properly in the waist slot
  <li>tired of trying to tell half your guild what the starts are on some brand
    new tradeskill item are? You can now give them a hotlink with a few extra
    keyclicks! In main chat, start your message to the appropriate chat channel
    (/gu, /auction, various created chat channels, etc.), alt-left click on the
    item you want to announce, click on the icon of the item in the item
    description box that you just caused to open, and it should drop the item
    name as a hotlink, into your current line of chat text. If these
    instructions make little sense, then find someone less sleep-impaired to
    explain it to you. ;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I'll be knuckling down and beating the database into
submission more (no ETA on when you folks will see it yet, but it will
definitely be worth the wait), and dealing with a lot of IRL stuff, so if I'm
unusually quiet for the next few weeks, don't be surprised. Expect to see me
post <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=2255.topic">more
pleas for information</a> as I <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerjewelcraft.showMessage?topicID=718.topic">get

<p>We're back! I know many of you were pacing nervously earlier this week when
you couldn't reach the site - you weren't alone! Thankfully, the dead router
that caused the outage for us, EQPortal and others was either repaired or
replaced yesterday afternoon. Just in time, of course, for my DSL connection to
die for several hours. (Which is partly why this update is a day late.)
<p>While I haven't received direct word regarding the VI stance on custom UI
mods, <a href="http://eqtoolbox.not.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=56&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0">EQ
toolbox has an interview with a senior editor at VI</a> regarding them. For
those of you working on tradeskill mods, there are multiple threads in the
General Tradeskills Forum regarding them. One thing to note is that if you're
going to do screenshots, direct copies of the data/layout from this site, please
make sure that it <i>also</i> contains the URL to this site in the mod. Not only
will this let folks who use your mod know where to find updated recipes,
trivials, etc., but it will keep you from having an upset redheaded DenMother
chasing after you for redistributing copyrighted information without permission.
;)
<p>Look for news next week on our decision regarding EZBoard renewal. I've seen
the newest "estimates" for a 6-month renewal, and it's going to cost
over 3 times what it cost a year ago to renew for a year. (Yes, we've grown <i>that</i>
much in traffic.) We may decide to renew (in which case we'll be asking for
donations), or we may decide to host our own boards (in which case it we'll also
be asking for donations, but likely have a different target amount, etc.). We're
not sure yet, and while folks have been full of all sorts of helpful suggestions
and commentary, we're going to think on it a bit longer before we make a
decision. Given the hassles inherent with the second option, we may end up
biting the bullet and paying the $1910 to renew ... or have those of you who are
not EZBoard Community Supporters deal with ads when you hit the boards for a
while. ... bleargh!

<p>I received the following from Muse at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com" target="_new">EQAtlas</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>SOE recently began promoting their new book, the Everquest Atlas, and some
  of you have expressed to me some confusion regarding this. Despite the
  similarity between the name of this product and their use of "EQ
  Atlas" to advertise it on the Everquest Live site, the product is not
  related in any way to my site, EQ Atlas (www.eqatlas.com). While we both offer
  maps and descriptions, the specific content is quite different. I hope that
  this announcement will clear up any confusion.</p>
