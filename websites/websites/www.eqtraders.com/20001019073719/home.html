  Find that Dye!</b></font><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#400000">(From Niami) Thanks 
  to feedback from a lot of great folks on the message board, there's now a page 
  with more details on finding <a href="secrets/finddye.html" target="mainright">ground 
  spawns</a> for dye components, including /loc information for evergreen leaves. 
  A few more fishing lures were also confirmed. As always, there's lots of other 
  small changes to numerous pages as we correct/confirm more recipes, and find 
  out stats on more of the new smithing items.</font> 
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#400000"><b>10/13: 
  Smithed Armor and Weapon Stats</b></font><br>
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#400000">(From Niami) Known 
  stats for smithed <a href="secrets/armorstats.html" target="mainright">armor</a> and <a href="secrets/weaponstats.html" target="mainright">weapons</a> 
  have been broken out into separate pages by popular demand. More information 
  is needed for many items, but it's at least a start.</font> 
<P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#400000"><b>10/12: 
  Logo Contest!<br>
  </b>(From Brynne)&nbsp; As noted below, this page is going to be undergoing 
  a complete redesign shortly.&nbsp; And I'm stuck on a good logo for it!&nbsp; 
  So, after talking with Denmother, we're going to hold...drumroll, please...a 
  logo contest!&nbsp; This is going to be open to everyone, but we're giving our 
  regulars here a head's up first.&nbsp; As with any contest, there's some <a href="logorules.html" target="mainright">rules</a>, 
  so read them over.&nbsp; They'll also tell you where and how to send in your 
  submission.<br>
