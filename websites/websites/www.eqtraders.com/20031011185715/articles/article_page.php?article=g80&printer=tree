Gnomes love to putter around. Perhaps that is why they excel at tinkering - finding new and creative ways to build things out of the oddest of items. Regardless, tinkering is their primary cultural tradeskill,and any gnome level 16 or above can reach grand mastery in this skill with a large amount of dedication, and a strong bankroll! For additional information on things tinkering, please visit the gnomes' home away from home, the <a href="http://www.tinkering.org" target="_new">Tinkering Compendium</a>. Additionally, you'll find that a few of the less mechanically-inclined gnomes have also learned the art of fashioning 6 unique INT caster robes.
