            <p><i>One of many new quests for young adventurers, this one is for 
              human Wizards, Enchanters and Mages in Freeport. Pieces are lore 
              (other than bracer), no drop and WIZ/MAG/ENC, HUM only. Robe is 
              orange, other pieces are a red leather graphic. Please note that 
              while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, 
              so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i></p>
            <p>Shana Liskia in the Academy in West Freeport gives out quests for 
              Mages, Wizards and Enchanters. She gives you an enchanted sewing 
              kit and a pattern for each of the pieces that you can get. Molds 
              are given as you ask her about the specific armor piece. These items 
              are reported to look like reddish leather when worn.</p>
            <p>Combine each of the following in and enchanted sewing kit, then 
              combine the result and the proper mold, in the loom, to get the 
              proper armor piece.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Shana Liskia' </p>
            <p>Liskia says 'Hail and well met ______. I am Shana Liskia, Enchantress 
              of Freeport. I have studied my art for years here in our wonderful 
              academy. I am also delighted to meet and teach those that come here 
              to gain knowledge. My specialty however lies in Beguiling so I like 
              to train young enchanters. Are you an enchanter?' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am an enchanter' </p>
            <p>Shana Liskia says 'Wonderful! Let me be the first to tell you that 
              your training here will be top notch and you will learn all that 
              is to be known about being an enchanter should you put forth the 
              willingness to learn. I will walk you through your early training 
              and assist you in your hunting and gathering skills. I have created 
              a [special sewing kit] that I present to all of the new initiates.' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'What special sewing kit' </p>
            <p>Shana Liskia says 'This kit that I speak of is one that is able 
              to magically infuse different components into materials used for 
              creating Arcane Scientists Armor. The components that you use will 
              be collected from numerous different areas and shops in Freeport. 
              You will use these materials along with patterns that I will present 
              you with to create your armor. Once you are [ready to begin] I will 
              present you with your Enchanted Sewing Kit.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am ready to begin' </p>
            <p>Shana Liskia says 'Very well. Here you are ______, in this box 
              you will combine specific component recipes as I mentioned before. 
              When you are ready to attempt a specific piece you must tell me 
              what piece you [want] to craft. For example if you had intent on 
              crafting a cap you would say, &#147;I want to craft a cap&#148;. 
              I can offer you the recipes for Arcane Scientists [Caps], [Bracers], 
              [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. I must also 
              suggest that you attempt your robe last due to the difficult nature 
              of collecting the correct components.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft the cap' </p>
            <p>Shana Liskia says 'A cap will keep you safe from any attackers 
              as well as the elements. To create your cap material you will need 
              to combine 2 Woven Spider Silks, 1 Snake Fang, 1 Chunk of Meat and 
              a Cloth Cap in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper 
              material take it to a loom along with this mold to fashion your 
              very own Arcane Scientists Cap.'<br>

              to get my necklace back. Return to me when you have my necklace
