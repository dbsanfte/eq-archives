<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Joril Stoutbear 
  </b> <font size="-1">- barbarian ranger (warrior)</font></font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Read the story: 
  <a href="joril_story.htm">A Wolf of Everfrost </a></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril’s parents 
  were slain by an Orc war party on the tundra of Everfrost. He is ridden with 
  guilt at his inability and inexperience to lend them aid. He has vowed to avenge 
  their deaths by bringing vengeance to the Orcs and will seek them out in all 
  the lands of Norrath. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He also mistrusts 
  Dark Elves. While on a journey to Faydwer, he entered Crushbone to battle the 
  Orcs that dwell there. He was captured, beaten and tortured at the hands of 
  Ambassador Dvinn, Dark Elf Emissary to the Orcs. Joril managed to escape the 
  dungeons and made his way to Kaladim and then on to Freeport, where he remained 
  and nursed the wounds of his body, heart and soul. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He had left 
  Everfrost for the love of a young elf maiden. He followed her all the way to 
  Kelethin. Once there, she became too involved with her own hunts and friends. 
  He rarely saw her and eventually he came to the realization that he had been 
  disillusioned. After the escape from Crushbone, he returned to Freeport, broken-hearted. 
  He began to drink heavily, trying to drown his sorrows and his homesickness. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">During a moment 
  of sobriety, he was befriended by Aerynea and Genneth of House Anarawyn. They 
  unknowingly pulled him from the brink of the dark chasm he faced. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He went on 
  several hunts with this new group of friends and once again, knew the joy of 
  battle! He gained valuable experience and knowledge. But he was still homesick. 
  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eventually, 
  he had gained enough experience and risen high enough in rank to attempt a return 
  trip to his beloved Everfrost. With the help of some adventurers, he made it 
  to Highpass without incident. The adventurers went on to Rivervale and Joril 
  decided to push on towards home. He made it through Highpass but then ran into 
  problems in East Karanas, where he was beset by lions. Some adventurers came 
  to his aid and he passed into North Karanas. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He ran and 
  ran into the night and finally he came to the familiar lands of Qeynos Hills. 
  He ran on to the entrance of Blackburrow, home of the wicked Blackburrow Gnolls. 
  He ran past the guards and wound his way through the passages and out into the 
  cold and snow of Everfrost. He whooped with joy for he was home! Joril can be 
  found running and hunting the tundra of his beloved land. He continues to practice 
  tailoring and has begun fletching as well. He constantly seeks out Orcs and 
  sends them to Innoruk. He is still plagued with visions and nightmares of his 
  days of captivity. His heart is still heavy with the loss of his once dear elf 
  maiden. But under his dark and brooding visage, he is a kindly soul. He feels 
  a special affinity for young adventurers and will do what he can to aid them 
  when asked.</font></p>
