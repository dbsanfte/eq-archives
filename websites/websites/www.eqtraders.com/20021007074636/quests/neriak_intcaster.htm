            <h3> Unholy Sillk - Neriak INT Caster Armor Quests</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of many new race- and class-specific armor quests. 
              The resultant armor is for dark elven INT casters only, and is no 
              drop. The tailoring combines are no fail. There are reports that 
              some of the combines may still be bugged (sandals require sleeves 
              piece, etc.), but I've yet to have anyone verify if things are working 
              properly after the last couple of patches)</i></p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal'Raeloen is in the middle of the entrance room in 
              the Spurned Guildhouse:</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Who dares to address me while I am 
              clearly busy reviewing my daily research. I sure hope this is important 
              Legion, I do not have time to waste on just any initate of House 
              Spurned. Not a single day goes by that I do not come face to face 
              with cannon fodder that is not even worthy of a headstone in our 
              burial grounds. If you wish to [prove yourself] then I might be 
              in a generous mood. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to prove myself'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'I must admit this is not the first 
              time I have heard someone say that nor will it be the last, however 
              I am wiling to give you a chance. First thing we will need to do 
              is get some clothes in your back if you wish to survive for any 
              amount of time. If you are a young Wizard, Enchanter or Magician 
              of House Spurned then I will present you with a [mystical sewing 
              kit]. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what mystical sewing kit'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'The Mystical Sewing kit that I have 
              created is one that is able to fashion a material used for crafting 
              clothes worn by all Initates of House Spurned. All that is required 
              are Cloaks worn by Lightwalkers that plague our Forest to this very 
              day. If you are to take my task and seek vegenence on this inferior 
              group of Arcane lightwalkers you will pride your house along with 
              gathering one of the [key ingredients] for your armor. I have heard 
              rumor that they have tried to generate some kind of magic from a 
              source shrouded by our forest. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what key ingredients'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'You will be given different combination 
              recipes for whichever armor piece you wish to craft. You will combine 
              the specific items in the Mystical Sewing Kit that I will give to 
              you when you are ready. After you have combined the correct items 
              in your sewing kit you will fashion together a Bloodstained Cloth 
              of the Spurned. At that time you will put the pattern that I will 
              give you for each armor piece you request in the loom along with 
              this cloth to craft your Armor piece. I will also suggest that you 
              craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the 
              items. Do you [understand] the instructions I have given you? '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i understand'<br>
            </p>
            <p> Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Very well Taerlaeri, here is your 
              Mystical sewing kit. I have the patterns and recipes necessary to 
              craft Spurned Initiate [Skullcaps], [Bracers], [Sandals], [Sleeves], 
              [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. When you feel you are ready to 
              gather the items necessary to craft your armor simply tell me which 
              piece you want to craft. The items that you will need to collect 
              will mostly be found in the Forest but some will be here in town. 
              As I said before seek out the Arcane Lightwalkers to collect the 
              cloaks that you will need to make the armor materials. I look forward 
              to seeing what you will make of this opportunity.'<br>

              you to progress in your training at the rate you have Taerlaeri. 
              I also knew there was something that seperated you from our other 
              initiates. For your final test I will need you execute 3 specific 
              Orc Chieftans in the Nektulos forest. Bring me the Prayer beads 
              of all 3 Orc Chieftans. These Orc Chieftans are the heads of each 
              Orc camps and will be heavily guarded so I would suggest bringing 
              any friends you have made that are somewhat proficient on the battlefield 
              to assist you. They have caused my house many problems and it is 
              time that they are put to rest. You have come to far to fail me 
              now Taerlaeri. I hope to see you soon, alive that is.'<br>
