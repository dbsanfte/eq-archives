<p> Each bow consists of: 
            <ul>
              <li>   Bow Staff (Hickory, Elm, Ashwood, Oak, Darkwood) </li>
              <li>   String (Hemp, Twine, Silk) </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>Optional: 
            <ul>
              <li>Tool (Whittling Knife or Planing Tool)<br>
                - Whittling knives can only be used on Elm or better bows<br>
                - Planing tools can only be used on Ashwood or better bows<br>
                - Tools are returned to you on combine failure, but not on success.</li>
              <li>One or more Bow Cams<br>
                - One cam may be used on Oak or better bows<br>
                - Two cams may be used on Darkwood bows</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p> The base statistics on a Rough bow using hemp string of each type 
              are:<br>
              Hickory: 10/50/50 (trivial ~35)<br>
              Elm: 13/51/75 (trivial ~80)<br>
              Ashwood: 16/58/100 (trivial 126)<br>
              Oak: 21/65/125 (trivial ~185)<br>
              Darkwood: 25/68/150 (trivial >202)<br>
              <br>
              <b>-Component effects-</b><br>
              <br>
              Each possible component included is additional modifier to the bow, 
              reducing<br>
              the damage and delay (but not affecting range, which is only determined 
              by<br>
              which staff you use)<br>
              <br>
              Strings:<br>
              Hemp: -0 / -0<br>
              Twine: -1 / -4<br>
              Silk: -2 / -8<br>
              Strings do not seem to affect bow difficulty<br>
              <br>
              Tools:<br>
              Whittling Knife: -1 / -4<br>
              Planing Tool: -2 / -9<br>
              These seem to only affect bow difficulty on elm and ashwood bows<br>
              respectively; I believe it works similar to arrows in that the most<br>
              difficult staff/tool determines the difficulty of the combine attempt. 
              So<br>
              making a shaped oak is no more difficult than making a rough oak. 
              I haven't<br>
              fully tested this however, so I could be wrong.<br>
              <br>
              Cams are -1 / -5<br>
              Cams give the best bonus but are also the most expensive and add<br>
              significantly to the difficulty of the bow. I recommend finding 
              a tinker<br>
              you like and having them supply you with cams, as you can get them<br>
              significantly cheaper than store-bought in this way. These seem 
              to always<br>
              add to bow difficulty, however, again, I haven't fully tested this.<br>
              <br>
              <b>-Naming-</b><br>
              <br>
              A bow is named "<tool type> <staff type> <cam type> 
              Bow"<br>
              <br>
              Tool types:<br>
              None: Rough<br>
              Whittling Knife: Carved<br>
              Planing Tool: Shaped<br>
              <br>
              Staff types:<br>
              Hickory, Elm, Ashwood, Oak, Darkwood<br>
              <br>
              Cam types:<br>
              None: Recurve<br>
              One: 1-Cam<br>
              Two: Compound<br>
              <br>
              The string used has no effect on the bow name.<br>
              <br>
              <b>-Selling-</b><br>
              <br>
              I find I usually am only able to sell the most damaging and the 
              best bow of<br>
              each type--nobody seems to want one in between. <!-- Most bows --> These 
              are listed here:<br>
              <br>
              Hickory + Hemp: 10/50 range 50<br>
              Hickory is an exception in that nobody wants fast hickory; the ratio 
              is<br>
              actually worse than the slower one. I usually keep a couple of these 
              in the<br>
              bank to give away/sell cheap to newbies.<br>
              <br>
              Elm + Hemp: 13/51 range 75<br>
              Elm + Silk + Whittling Knife: 10/39 range 75 - these sell well to 
              people<br>
              looking to improve their archery skill as they are very fast and 
              relatively<br>
              inexpensive. I usually keep 2-4 of these in the bank.<br>
              <br>
              Ashwood + Hemp: 16/58 range 100 - these seem to be somewhat popular, 
              and I<br>
              keep 2 in the bank on the chance someone wants one.<br>
              Ashwood + Silk + Planing Tool: 12/41 range 100<br>
              <br>
              Oak + Hemp: 21/65 range 125<br>
              Oak + Silk + Planing Tool + Cam: 16/43 range 125<br>
              <br>
              Darkwood + Hemp: 25/68 range 150<br>
              Darkwood + Silk + Planing Tool + Cam + Cam: 19/41 range 150<br>
              <br>
