              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I wanted to 
              take a few moments to give my heartfelt thanks to <a href="http://www.refplace.com">Refplace</a> 
              for the &quot;home&quot; that they gave the site as an <a href="http://www.eqportal.com">EQPortal 
              Community</a> during some tough times. While load and database issues 
              have caused us to move over to Racknine for our hosting, I cannot 
              stress enough how much I appreciate the aid that Rory gave us in 
              our time of need. It is very likely that EQTC would have had to 
              close it's doors (or be merged into one of the fee-based sites) 
              well before Luclin launched, if not for the site hosting home that 
              he provided.</font>

              you who are wondering, yes, the site move has increased our costs, 
              and costs will continue to grow, especially once PoP launches in 
              another month and a half (Luclin more than doubled our site traffice 
              for a while, and increased message board traffic 10-fold.) However, 
              we <i>hope</i> to continue managing to tread water financially, 
              thanks to those of you that are clicking on that PayPal icon over 
              to the left, and making donations. Time will tell. In the meantime, 
              we will continue our struggle to keep the site as ad-free as possible.</font>

              ado, DNS was changed today to point to our new hosting provider 
              at Racknine, catching many of us by surprise (I'd expected it to 
              take another week or so for the paperwork to be finished.) If you 
              can read this message, then the nameserver that you use has the 
              new information. It also means that you've likely seen some craziness 
              with nav buttons today, due to a case-sensitive issue on some links. 
              I <i>think</i> I caught them all, but there may be a couple holdovers 
              for a day or two as I go over everything with a fine-toothed comb.

              newest &quot;estimates&quot; for a 6-month renewal, and it's going 
              to cost over 3 times what it cost a year ago to renew for a year. 
              (Yes, we've grown <i>that</i> much in traffic.) We may decide to 
              renew (in which case we'll be asking for donations), or we may decide

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Today's patch 
              is quite large, so it will likely be a while before we catch and 
              mention everything in it that impacts tradeskills. While I sift 
              through the many posts on the subject, here are a few things of 
              note:</font>

                file before you can buy <i>or</i> sell using the new bazaar trader 
                functions.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Jaggedpine 
                zone has been released (it is an optional patch, so you must actively 
                ask for it under the Advanced options when loading EQ). The baking 
                forum already has a <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1820.topic">thread

                quests pages for all of these.</li>

                with this patch.</li>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That looks 
              to be about it on the updates for today, other than the decomissioning 
              of the May 8 recipes page at long last. (All recipes stemming from 
              the May 8 patch should now be on their permanent recipes pages.)</font>

              chased into virtual extinction by the introduction of Timorous Tuna 
              into their spawning grounds back in November, have been seen once 
              again in Erud's Crossing on Test server. This is wonderful news

              enjoy the use of faithstones that their other healing brethren have 
              been using. Hopefully it will be re-introduced onto the live servers 
              with the next patch. We're also hoping to see a few other item tweaks 
              next patch, such as to the stats of the Cazic Thule armor and weapons, 
              stackability of Tae Ew meat, etc.</font>

              oomph permit, I'm going through all <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">the 
              armor stats pages</a> to see what's missing for the older smithed 
              armor sets. As I'm finding missing data, the relevant stats page 
              is having question marks added in the appropriate spots, and on 
              the more major information, I'm <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=6540.topic">whimpering 
              for help</a> on data that I can't find elsewhere. After I tackle 
              all the armors (I'm about a third of the way through the cultural 
              sets now), I'll tackle the smithed weapons. Those of you with a 
              solid player-made weapon collection are more than welcome to compare 
              what's on the weapon stats page with the information on your weapons, 
              and post with missing information in that same message board thread.</font>

              scenes on a daily basis, especially in narrowing down smithing trivials, 
              adding stats for the newer tradeskill items, etc. A few weeks back, 
              I also had to split apart the cultural armor stats from the main 
              armor stats page. This has caused quite a bit of confusion, and 
              it's currently not the most elegant or intuitive layout, but it 
              will have to do for the near future. For now, all smithed cultural 
              armor stats can be found a) via the nav buttons on the left-hand 
              side of the <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">main 
              armor stats page</a> and, b) via a link at the TOP of each cultural 
              recipes page for that culture's stats. I apologize for the kludgy 
              feel of this, but it's going to be a while before I can tackle nav 
              issues.</font>

              dual-wielding computers for quite a while now, as it allows me to 
              work on site updates at the same time I am performing research in-game, 
              wield both my accounts at once to have easier access to tradeskill 
              mules, etc. Unfortunately, the setup I've been using for the last 
              couple of years is not ergonomic, and hasn't been very good for 
              my chronic back problems. We finally made arrangements to have both 
              my office and Ngreth's office redone, with setups that should make 
              them much more comfortable workplaces. We've been planning this 
              for a couple months, and yesterday the movers arrived to box up 
              everything in my office, so the folks could come in today with the 
              custom setup for my office. Ngreth's office was to follow next Tuesday. 
              Unfortunately, some wires were crossed somewhere (I blame Bristlebane, 
              may all his toe fur fall off!), and the installers showed up today 
              with <i>Ngreth's</i> office setup, not mine. They're not even done 
              building mine. Soooo ... Ngreth and two installers are busy disassembling 
              Ngreth's old office right now and packing it up, most of my office 
              possessions are taking over the guest room, my cats are frantic 
              and hiding from the chaos, and I ... am working off a card table 
              set up in my almost-empty office. I'll be working off this setup 
              until Tuesday morning, at which time I re-disassemble everything 
              and pray there are no more surprises in store. (edit: hubby's office 
              is taking 2 days to complete, so I expect mine will as well ...
