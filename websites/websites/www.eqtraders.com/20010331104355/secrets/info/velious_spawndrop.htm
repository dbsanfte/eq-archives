              Spawns/Drops </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Arctic wyvern hides</b> - off arctic wyverns in Cobalt Scar. 
                They agro on Claws of Veeshan faction, but no faction hit is taken 
                for killing un-named ones.</li>
              <li><b>Black panther skins</b> - black panthers wander in Wakening 
                Lands. Their pelts are a random drop. They are an agro mob.</li>
              <li><b>Cobalt cod</b> - fished in Cobalt Scar. Apparently now the 
                only fish now caught there</li>
              <li><b>Cobalt drake hides</b> - rare drop off cobalt drakes in Cobalt 
                Scar. They are tied to Claws of Veeshan faction, but there is 
                no faction hit for killing the unnamed ones. These creatures have 
                an AoE attack/debuff. Do NOT kite them, or you will get not only 
                yourself but other hunters killed due to the AoE agro list. The 
                othmir will also run up to kill these things if they are hit by 
                the AoE, and due to EQ ignoring the Z axis (height), it's very 
                easy for the othmir to be hit by the AoE.</li>
              <li><b>Coldain Velium Temper</b> - is only purchased in Thurgadin 
                (near the mines) at this time. It is NOT brewed by players, there 
                is no recipe for it.</li>
              <li><b>Crystalline silk</b> - drops off various Velious spiders. 
                It is stackable. Remember that to form swatches of this silk, 
                you must combine the pieces of silk <i>unstacked</i>.</li>
              <li><b>Drake eggs</b> - are a rare forage in Skyshrine. They also 
                are a rare drop off named drakes in Skyshrine. They are considered 
                food, so be very careful that you do NOT eat these on your way 
                to the brew barrel! </li>
              <li><b>Haze panthers </b>- wander in Wakening Lands, and are generally 
                invis. They are a rarer spawn than normal panters, they randomly 
                drop pelts and eyes (for tinkering). They are agro, as are many 
                other things in this zone. Anyone trying to track theseshould 
                have see invis.</li>
              <li><b>Holgresh fur</b> - drops off holgresh in Wakening Lands. 
                These are spellcasting monkeymen and very agro.</li>
              <li><b>Ice burrower silk</b> - drops off ice burrowers (they look 
                like HUGE leeches) in Western Wastes. They are a level 60+ mob.</li>
              <li><b>Othmir fur</b> - drops off various othmir (ottermen) in Cobalt 
                Scar. They are social, so be careful when pulling. Do NOT kill 
                Bloogy Shellcracker or Blumblum Swigwater. They are merchants 
                and not only will not drop anything, but they carry items sold 
                nowhere else in the lands. Please respect your fellow tradesfolk 
                and let those two live. The othmir are friendly/indifferent ... 
                until you start killing them. (You will take othmir faction hits 
                for harming them.)</li>
              <li><b>Tigeraptors</b> - Roam the northwest section of Wakening 
                Lands. You will also find a fixed camp of them just north of the 
                tunnel to Skyshrine in this zone. They are agro mobs.</li>
              <li><b>Velium hound fur</b> - drops off velium hounds in Western 
                Wastes. It is stackable.</li>
              <li><b>Velium ore</b> - is dropped off various golem-types in Velious 
                (Icewell, Skyshrine, etc), orcs in Crystal Caverns and other various 
                Velious mobs. The small and large blocks are light pink in color, 
                and you can oftentimes find some in merchant overstock in Thurgadin 
                and Skyshrine. </li>
              <li><b>Yew Leaves</b> - are a random ground spawn in Wakening Lands. 
                They appear as hard-to-see green diamonds on the ground. Locations 
                for these have not been consistent, but some folks have reported 
                slightly better luck finding them near the sifaye camp.</li>
