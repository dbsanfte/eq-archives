  I've just spent the better part of an hour scrounging some information on the 
  new poisons that went in with the last patch. Many new <a href="secrets/poison.html" target="mainright">recipes</a> 
  have been listed, most still need research before they are complete. If there 
  are any rogues out there that can provide more feedback (information on where 
  to find listed items, names of some of the poisons, required vial/suspension 
  combinations, etc., please <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">let me know</a>.)</font>

  For those of you who are listed in the Marketplace section of the website, please 
  email me with any updates or corrections to your listing (or ask me to remove 
  it if you're no longer providing the items/services). I am now providing dates 
  on any new additions/corrections to the listings, so that folks will be able 
  to tell if an ad is current, or if it's been gathering dust for a year or so. 
  (Note that old ads will not be backdated, as I've not kept the hundreds of pieces 
  of email that went into creating the Marketplace listings.) Please remember 
  to include not only your character name, but also your server name. A good quarter 
  of the listings I receive require extra back-and-forth email to get such &quot;little&quot; 
  details that were forgotten the first time around.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I got my requisite 
  once or twice a month insulting email today, and as usual, the person in question 
  couldn't even form a proper sentence, or remember what capitalization was for. 
  I hate to say it, but where <i>do</i> these children get the gall to criticize 
  the hard work of a group of people (for yes, many of you have contributed to 
  this site, making it yours as well as mine) without having a single productive 
  thing to say? <i>&lt;shrugs&gt;</i> They got their 10-second claim to fame in 
  my rant regarding their unsigned letter, and it's been quite happily trashed 
  as not having a single redeeming value. <i>(For those of you with constructive 
  criticism, yes, I'm willing to listen, but outright insulting email with not 
  a shred of information that would back up the claims ... pfaugh, tell me your 
  character name and server so I can /rofl then /ignore you. ;D)</i></font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meanwhile, 
  those of you who are actively testing things and sending back feedback, thank 
  you. There's only so much time in a week, and your feedback makes this site 
  better for everyone. I think we're definitely onto something with the varying 
  trivial levels (June 8 news below), based on notes compared by several people. 
  So, if you get a slightly (off by 4 or less) different trivial level than one 
  mentioned on one of these pages, don't worry. It may just be that your race/class/int/wis 
  combination has an easier/harder time learning than the one who tested that 
  batch of trivials.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>June 08:</b> 
  I'm starting to chase down quests that require trade skills, and include them 
  on the appropriate trade skill recipe pages. I've added an unverified recipe 
  for embalming fluid to the brewing page, and shadow silk and a Cabilis tapestry 
  quest to the tailoring page. Once the dust settles a bit more in my new home, 
  I hope to go do yet another zone-by-zone exploration to re-verify trade supply 
  locations, update the jewel listings with more details, and see if I can figure 
  out where I last saw tall beers ... and somewhere in there actually get to play 
  the game some as well. ;)</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many thanks 
  to all of you who've been providing feedback and details on trivials, etc. for 
  me as it saves me a lot of extra time and effort.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been 
  noticing some odd stuff with trivials, and will need to do some time-consuming 
  testing to verify. My RL hubby has an erudite wizzie with a ridiculously high 
  INT, and trivial levels *seem* to be a bit lower on some things (we were working 
  the wizzie up in brewing when we noticed it). When my hubby and I have some 
  time, I'll probably try testing the wizzie vs. a dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks character 
  on another trade skill (tailoring or baking) and see if they get different trivials 
  for things. If anyone else has witnessed this phenomenon, please let me know.</font>

  Halflings and brewers rejoice - a new <a href="secrets/brewing.html" target="mainright">brewing 
  recipe</a> has been added for the &quot;halfling stouter&quot; (Well, I oopsed 
  and the recipe wasn't visible for a few days. It's up now, and I've sampled

  email from MeleKahn and <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/games2/everquesttailoring" target="_new">Xaxnyd</a>, 
  I've finally got enough of a nudge to put up the <a href="secrets/tailoring.html" target="mainright">tailoring 
  recipes</a> page I had mentioned on the message board. Several more player-merchants 
  were added to the Marketplace, including our first ad for someone on Morrell-Thule. 
  I also did some minor updates to many of the recipes pages, including some reminders 
  about trade skills and a) stacked items and b) water. Geimhreadh, a ranger on 
  Tribunal, has also provided me with some lovely clarifications on trivial levels 
  for arrows. I hope to have that information on the fletching page soon.</font>

  enjoying the positive feedback and all the lovely contributions I get for this 
  website. This has been quite the &quot;labor of love&quot; on my part, and it's 
  good to know that others enjoy and use this information as well.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On a lighter 
  note, the giggle of the week comes from a trade skills message board post (I 
  forget where I found the post now, but it gave me a good snicker), where someone 
  complains that on their PvP server, when they were killed by another player,the 
  killer looted not their armor or weapon, but a stack of 20 snake eggs. Now that 
  killer is a trade skill junkie! ;)</font>

  looking for someone to make trade items for them, but have not found anyone 
  able/willing to make things for them. Of course, no listings will appear until

  As Isolde mentioned in a message board post, someone has discovered the recipe 
  for at least two of the clay deities that have stumped potters since the beginning 
  of the lands. While the deities are not equippable (i.e., they're broken still), 
  it gives some hope that we'll eventually see these items in the lands. Experimentation 
  continues, and details can be found on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/000998.html" target="_new">Sony

  Finally, shamen can train in it properly, as of the patch this week. Supposedly 
  skill increases can now be gained in it as well. It's a start, though the potions 
  are still far too expensive, in my opinion, for what you get in return.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Marketplace:</i> 
  We've added several new player-merchants. Based on email from the last month 
  or so, please remember a few things when sending in email: If you don't include 
  your server name when sending in an ad, it's rather hard to post it. &lt;g&gt; 
  Let us know if you want an email link in the ad, or if you only want potential 
  customers to contact you in-game. Last but not least, if your server isn't listed 
  in the marketplace, it's not because I forgot it, but because nobody has sent 
  in an ad for that server.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Trade supplies 
  locations:</i> Please remember to eyeball the appropriate page before you send 
  email saying you found something, as I've gotten a lot of mail lately for things 
  that are already listed on the site. Please remember to provide enough details 
  on where you found something that is not listed so that I can find it in order 
  to get the details not included in the email.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Stance 
  on recipes/formulas:</i> This site has always left the posting of cheats/recipes/formulas 
  to other sites. My reasoning behind this was that, without player experimentation, 
  we don't find the new and undiscovered recipes. I've provided some links here 
  and there throughout the site for recipes and such for those who want to learn 
  things without costly experimentation. When I return, I <i>might</i> directly 
  link in some of the recipes that I, and other contributors to this site, have 
  found. However, this is a 1-person site that has tried to stay ad-free (other 
  than the remotely hosted message board) and low-maintenance. On top of all other 
  considerations, the amount of extra time I'd have to spend per week on handling 
  corrections/additions to those recipes, handling often irate and incoherent 
  email asking &quot;why do you have these recipes and not those recipes that 
  I really want?&quot; and a myriad of other issues, makes me very hesitant to 
  expand the offerings of this site. I love helping folks learn new things about 
  tradeskills, but I love playing even more. Thanks for your understanding on 
  this.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>November 15:</b> Tinkering 
  has been the only tradeskill to undergo a lot of change lately in-game, with 
  several new &quot;recipes&quot; discovered for the would-be tinkers out there. 
  I still hear a lot of complaints on the tinkering mailing list, so I know things 
  aren't happy there still, but at least they've figured out how to make a few 
  more things.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Unfortunately, 
  they seem to be focusing enough on testing things out, that I've still not found 
  anyone willing to write a good &quot;how to&quot; article for this site.)</font>

  in listings for the Marketplace, and I've done full re-explorations on a few 
  more zones. The site will slowly flesh out more. I'd love to see some re-writes 
  of some of the trade skill articles that were written many months ago, but nobody's 
  sent anything in for quite a while. I'll rewrite some of mine as time goes on, 
  but I'm getting ready for a month without internet from mid-December to mid-January,

  your server listed in the Marketplace section, it means that I don't have any 
  player advertisements for that server. (Or someone's simply sent me &quot;I'm

  who carry quiver and backpack patterns now carry mask, gorget, belt, cloak and 
  shoulderpad patterns. Why we need a second gorget pattern, I don't know, but
