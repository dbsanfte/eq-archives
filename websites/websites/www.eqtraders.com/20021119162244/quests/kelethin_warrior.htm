            <h3>Emerald Novice Armor - Kelethin Warrior Quest</h3>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Kelethin. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ELF/HEF,WAR 
              only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Please note that while 
              the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make 
              your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Josylyn Greenblade'<BR>
              Josylyn Greenblade says 'Greetings Dobbila. It is my duty to teach 
              young Fier`Dal the arts of defense and fighting so that they may 
              become skilled members of the Emerald Warriors. There are many [threats] 
              facing our forests and our home Kelethin, thus we warriors must 
              be prepared both physically and mentally to defend our people. It 
              is wise for all young Emerald Warriors to acquire a [suit of armor] 
              to protect them from the weapons of our enemies.'</P>

              Josylyn Greenblade says 'You will require this specially prepared 
              Mail Assembly Kit to assemble a suit of Emerald Novice Armor. The 
              required materials vary depending on the piece of armor you seek 
              to craft. Once you have been properly outfitted return to me and 
              I will present you with another [task]. Do you seek to craft [Emerald 
              Novice Gauntlets], [Emerald Novice Boots], an [Emerald Novice Bracer], 
              an [Emerald Novice Helm], [Emerald Novice Greaves], [Emerald Novice

              Josylyn Greenblade says 'Although our city of Kelethin gains much 
              protection from its construction in the treetops of the Faydark, 
              like all things it has weaknesses in its defenses. The Crushbone 
              Orcs often attempt to ignite the trees with the fires of their torches. 
              Young Emerald Warriors are often stationed on the forest floor beneath 
              Kelethin to watch for these orc arsonists and stop them. Go now 
              to the forest floor and should you catch one of these orcs slay 
              him and bring me his orcish torch.'
