              and sweat...by Janus Xanathis, Necrobane (Tunare server)</span></p>
            <p>There are books you can read, and other documents to view that 
              can tell you HOW to use the skill of the hammer and the forge. I 
              am not going to do that today. What I am going to do is tell you 
              WHAT to make when your body is layered in sweat and grime, and the 
              smoke of the bellows is against your face. If you follow this plan, 
              you shall have the skill to create the armor that everyone wants, 
              in only as long as your gold holds true. For once you start selling 
              the armor... gold is not something you need to want for again.</p>
            <p>First off, let me tell you this. To walk on the road to become 
              a master of this skill requires much time, and a greater amount 
              of gold. Unlike skills such as baking, or jewelcraft, in which you 
              can start to recoup some of your gold loss at a lower skill, you 
              cannot do that with the hammer and the forge.</p>
            <p>How many people do you know of walking around town shouting for 
              skewers, or metal bits?</p>
            <p>Exactly.</p>
            <p>But as I said above, once you get the skill to start creating the 
              banded armor that sells so well, you will start to gain your gold 
              back, and you shall get many an order for more.</p>
            <p>With that said, what is the quickest road to gaining the skill 
              to become an armor-smith, you ask? Well, I shall tell you.</p>
            <p>The easiest jump, on the road to creating glorious armor, is to 
              save up your trainings for four levels. Once you have all twenty 
              trainings, dump them all into Smithing. Since you won't have the 
              skill to kill the monsters that have the loot that you can sell 
              for the amount of gold you'll need... until you are in the low teens... 
              saving up the trainings shouldn't be a problem.</p>
            <p>But, if for some reason, you need all of your trainings, there 
              are other ways to get to the twentieth level of skill.</p>
            <p>Two to be exact.</p>
            <p>You sharpen the rusty weapons that are taken from the dead hands 
              of monsters that hold them... or you make the metal bits that are 
              needed for some of the later items.</p>
            <p>I don't want to replace the part of the book, but, some basics 
              to know when you are doing anything with the forge.</p>
            <p>NEVER stack anything in it. If it calls for multiples of something 
              that stacks, put them in different slots.</p>
            <p>The last item you will always be placing in the forge, is a flask 
              of water. Hunting down madmen in the desert of Ro is a good way 
              to gain the huge amounts of water that you will need for this skill. 
              Whether you are making metal bits, or a banded helm... each step 
              of the way has a single flask of water as the last item to place 
              in the forge.</p>
            <p>Also, not matter if you succeed, or fail, when you are using the 
              forge ... All items you place in it will be lost. If you succeeded, 
              you will have the item you were creating. If you failed, you have 
              nothing, but some more skill on the road to becoming a hammer master.</p>
            <p>Once you have been ranked as having a skill of the twentieth level, 
              you will see the message that making the metal bits, or sharpening 
              the weapons is beneath you. It's quite uppity to tell you this, 
              but what it means is that you will gain no more learning from doing 
              these tasks. So, you now switch over to making a different item....</p>
            <p>A metal sheet.</p>
            <p>But can't you buy those, you ask? Why yes, you can, and they are 
              about the same price, if not lower, to buy then they are to make. 
              So when you are making the more difficult items that require the 
              sheets to make, simply buy the sheets, that way you don't have to 
              worry about the random failure in making them. BUT... they are the 
              easiest thing to make to get you up the ladder of skill at this 
              point. Making metal sheets will get you to rank fifty in smithy. 
              Again, you will fail, more then you succeed at first... and you 
              will make a LOT of sheets by the time you get to fifty. But a good 
              note is that you can sell them back to the vendors that you are 
              buying the parts that you need to make them from. You won't get 
              back all of your money... maybe half... maybe three quarters... 
              but it's still something back.</p>
            <p>Once you get to the level in which the metal sheets are gaining 
              you no skill... what should you make next?</p>
            <p>Banded Armor?</p>
            <p>Sadly... not yet. You can try... and you will fail... greatly. 
              And you may be able to make a piece every twenty or thirty tries. 
              But your learning will not go up that fast, and the money you will 
              loose will be insane.</p>
            <p>The next item that we go to create is the skewer. This is another 
              item in which you can sell it back to the vendor and you will make 
              some of your money back. At this point down the road of the hammer 
              and forge, you are spending quite a bit of money per item to create. 
              Skewers are not that bad, overall. Only a gold, or so, for each 
              mold, and then the amount it takes to make the metal bits you need, 
              and a single water. You don't get nearly that much back when you 
              sell them, but every little bit helps.</p>
            <p>How high can making skewers get you? I, myself, don't quite know. 
              As of this writing, I have been listed as having a skill of eighty 
              in smithy. It has yet to tell me that skewers are below my skill, 
              but I expect to see the message any time now. I shall update this 
              document when I find that information out.</p>
            <p>If you are at eighty... NOW are you going to try to make the banded 
              armor?</p>
            <p>Aye. You can.</p>
            <p>I, so far, have been able to make five banded helms, and two banded 
              shirts. The shirts I did at with my skill of eighty. Two tries per 
              shirt. I know I was lucky to only have a single failure per item. 
              But it goes to show you that having the patience to walk the long 
              road will pay off. With the going rate being about forty plat for 
              a shirt, if not more... You can see that even with a few failures 
              per item, you will be making your gold back, and more.</p>
            <p>Don't just worry about getting to the skill to make banded, and 
              stopping there. There are rumors around that smiths shall soon have 
              the ability to start to make plate, or a type of plate armor. I 
              have also heard that you are going to need a skill up around one 
              hundred and thirty, if not more, if you want to pull this off.</p>
            <p>All I can say is... start making your banded wares... and continue 
              to makethem.</p>
            <p>Also... out of any of the skills... none are as physically rewarding 
              as this one. Having spent hours over the hot coals, pounding away 
              with your hammer... and creating an item that will help save someone 
              from those extra slices and blows... is also a very good feeling 
              to have.</p>
            <p>Of course, so is feeling the weight of your purse after you just 
              sold off a full suit to someone.</p>

            <p><span class="headers">What<a name="What"></a> is smithing all about? 
              - by</span> <a href="mailto:smedis@noxware.se" class="header">Larien</a> 
              <span class="headers">(Lanys T'Vyl server)</span></p>
            <p>Many months ago, I started on a jewelry career with a dark elf 
              Enchanter. It turned out to be extremely expensive, so I decided 
              to put all trading aside for a while and concentrate on hunting 
              with my friends instead. Then I started a new character on the fairly 
              new server Lanys T'Vyl, a troll shadowknight called Gorth. Before 
              The Age Of Gorth, I mainly played spell casting characters, but 
              as Gorth grew stronger and more potent, I got more and more aware 
              of the potential for a blacksmith. Well, Gorth is as stupid as he 
              is strong, and I wanted a totally different type of character for 
              a smithing career. So, one late night around New Years Eve, Larien 
              was born in the distant island of Odus.</p>
            <p>Larien is a highly intelligent enchanter, which makes him learn 
              quickly. His skill level increased rapidly, and has now reached 
              142. Another important factor for a smith is wisdom. The higher 
              the wisdom, the less you fail. Larien uses enhancing items such 
              as a Black Iron Medallion that improves his intelligence and wisdom 
              by 3.</p>
            <p>As an Erudite, Larien soon discovered that the worst place to be 
              in for a smith is Erudin. So the first thing to do was to make the 
              long journey to Freeport. In Freeport you can find all components 
              you need to become a Master Smith. You find sharpening stones and 
              ore in North Freeport, close to the Bard's Guild. You can buy rusty 
              weapons in a shop in East Freeport, and another shop there has almost 
              all the molds you need. To reach a skill level of 142, Larien used 
              the following stategy:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Train in the Guild until 21.</b> Easiest way. I often have 
                a lot of unused skill points on my characters, because I usually 
                practice my skills while I'm fishing. So I have a lot of skill 
                points available for getting a head start on trades. </li>
              <li><b>Sharpen rusty weapons until 31.</b> I got sharpening stones 
                from North Freeport and went to East Freeport to buy rusty weapons 
                there. Rusty 2H swords will get you to skill level 31. To sharpen 
                a rusty weapon, find a forge and left click on it. Put a sharpening 
                stone and a rusty weapon in the container that shows up and click 
                on 'Combine'. If you succeed, you will lose the stone and the 
                weapon and get a tarnished weapon instead. If you fail, you will 
                only lose the stone. Note that you can hold down the <i>CTRL</i> 
                key while left clicking on a stack of sharpening stones to pick 
                only one at a time. </li>
              <li><b>Made scalers until 41.</b> This is when you start making 
                those millions of metal bits you've probably heard other people 
                curse about. To make metal bits, you will need two small pieces 
                of ore (which you find in North Freeport) and a flask of water. 
                <i> <b>NEVER STACK ANYTHING</b></i> in the forge; always put the 
                two small pieces of ore in separate slots in the forge and the 
                flask in the third slot. Hit Combine. When you have made about 
                one million of metal bits, head over to East Freeport and buy 
                scaler molds. Put one metal bit, one scaler mold, and one flask 
                of water in the forge to make the scalers. </li>
              <li><b>Made lanterns until 68.</b> Same as for scalers, but the 
                recipe is: metal bit, lantern mold, bottle, and a flask of water. 
                You can find bottles in Trader's Holiday in East Freeport, the 
                merchant next to the one who sells the molds. </li>
              <li><b>Made skewers until 115.</b> Metal bit, skewer mold, and a 
                flask of water. </li>
              <li><b>Made pots until 122.</b> Metal bit, pot mold, standing legs 
                mold, and a flask of water. When Larien reached a skill level 
                around 120, he started making banded armor to get more money for 
                the practicing. He quickly got back the 100pp (about) he first 
                spent on practice. </li>
              <li><b>Made small sewing kits until 135.</b> Metal bit, needle mold, 
                thimble mold, and a flask of water. You get the needle and thimble 
                molds from North Ro, at the Inn. </li>
              <li><b>Made banded armor to 142.</b> No more metal bits! Instead, 
                you buy metal sheets in East Freeport. At this time, most banded 
                armor are trivial to make for you, except gauntlets, mantle, leggings 
                and cloak. I have heard that cloaks will get you to 168. After 
                that, there is nothing more that can increase your skill level. 
                Because most items are trivial to you now, your intelligence aren't 
                as important as your wisdom, so start maxing out wisdom with magic 
                items! To make <i>MEDIUM</i> sized banded armor, you get the molds 
                in East Freeport. To make <i>SMALL</i> armor, you can go to Neriak 
                or Rivervale to get the molds. To make <i>LARGE</i> armor, you 
                have to go to Ferrott or the Karanas.</li>

            <p class="headers">Notes on Advanced<a name="Advanced"></a> and Cultural 
              Smithing</p>
            <p><i>~By Niami DenMother, with thanks to all the folks on the message 
              board for sparking this document with their questions and comments</i></p>
            <p>There has been a lot of excitement, and confusion, over the new 
              cultural smithing. Hopefully this guide will help to clarify some 
              of the more commonly asked questions.</p>
            <p><span class="headers">What is cultural smithing?</span> Cultural 
              smithing is race-specific smithing. It must be performed at a specific 
              cultural forge, by a smith of that same race. Enchanters cannot 
              fool cultural forges by using illusion. (<a href="../secrets/recipes_smithing_cultural_main.htm">Cultural 
              smithing recipes can be found here.</a>)</p>
            <p><span class="headers">I heard someone mention dyes</span> - can 
              I dye my banded/cultural/etc. armor? Currently, only fine steel 
              plate armor (shortened to "fine steel" by many) can be dyed. Some 
              of the cultural armors have colors of their own, but this is not 
              done via the dying process. Dye making for fine steel is a multi-step 
              process that adds significant time and expense to the smithing process. 
              (More <a href="../secrets/recipes_dyes.htm">information on dyes 
              can be found here</a>. Recipes for <a href="../secrets/recipes_smithing_advanced.htm">fine 
              steel plate can be found here</a>.)</p>
            <p><span class="headers">What about this imbue and enchant thing?</span> 
              Any race that has cultural smithing have some "normal" cultural 
              recipes, and then either imbued versions of the recipes or enchanted 
              and enchanted/imbued versions of the recipes.</p>
            <p><b>Imbuing</b> is the process of calling the blessings of a specific 
              god down upon an item, limiting it to use by followers of only that 
              deity. While we originally thought that there would be imbued items 
              for pretty much every race/deity combination, this is not turning 
              out to be the case. (For example: barbarian followers of the Tribunal 
              have imbued armor, barbarian followers of Rallos Zek do not.) Imbuing 
              is performed by a cleric/shaman/druid on the chosen gem of that 
              deity. (<a href="http://havan_ironoak.tripod.com/gems.htm" target="_new">Gem 
              list from Havan Ironoak</a>, will be reformatted for the site, with 
              permission, as time permits) The imbued gem can then be used by 
              a smith of any religious background, provided that the racial forge 
              in question accepts that gem as a valid recipe. The end result will 
              only be able to be worn by a person who meets the race/class AND 
              deity restrictions of the end result. (Exception to the above info 
              is the Solusek Ro imbue, which is performed by wizards of Solusek 
              Ro.) Races that have non-enchanted imbued items include: barbarians, 
              iksar, ogres and wood elves, plus some Freeport human recipes. These 
              groups have no enchanted versions of their armor/weapons.</p>
            <p><b>Enchanting</b> is the process of granting magical bonuses to 
              an item without deity restrictions. Several races have enchanted 
              versions of their armor and sometimes weapons. These items can often 
              also be imbued, though, again, seem to have some odd limits to what 
              gems will work, leaving many gaps in that race's armor for different 
              valid deities. Each enchanted ore requires a level 49 enchanter 
              to cast the spell as well as a large brick of the proper type of 
              ore. If an enchanted folded sheet is needed, then all three large 
              bricks that go into the making of the block must be enchanted.</p>
