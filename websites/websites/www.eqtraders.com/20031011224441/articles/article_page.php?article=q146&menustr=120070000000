<span class="headers">Halas Shaman (Justice) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Balgros McMichael' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''Hello, Dubhainnle is it? Have you come to begin some [training]?'' </p>

<p>You say, 'what training?' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''I can provide you with instructions on how to create a set of beginning [armor], fit for any Shaman of Justice.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'what armor?' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''During your travels you will no doubt run into danger. It is best to have a sturdy set of armor to protect yourself. Take this Justice Plate Assembly Kit. You will use it to create the various parts of your armor such as [helm], [bracers], [armplates], [boots], [legplates], [gauntlets], and [breastplate]. When you combine components in your kit, make sure they are un-stacked. Let me know what piece you wish to craft and I will give you instruction.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'craft a helm' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''A helm is it? That is a fairly easy piece to start with. To craft your Helm of Justice, you will need two Small Pieces of Ore, one Gnoll Pup Scalp, and two Bone Chips. You should be able to find most of these items in Everfrost. The ore is most likely sold here in town. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Helm of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new helm.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'craft a bracer' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''To craft a Bracer of Justice, collect one Small Piece of Ore, three Bone Chips, and one Ruined Wolf Pelt. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Bracers of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new bracers.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'craft a armplate' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''To craft Armplates of Justice, collect two Small Pieces of Ore, two Polar Bear Skins, and one Patch of Gnoll Fur. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Armplates of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new armplates.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'craft boots' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''To craft Boots of Justice you must find two Small Pieces of Ore, one Spiderling Legs, and one Polar Bear Skin. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Boots of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new boots.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'craft legplates' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''Legplates of Justice offer great protection to one who is just starting their adventuring career. To craft your legplates you must find one Small Piece of Ore, two Polar Bear Skins, and two Bone Chips. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Legplates of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new legplates.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'craft gauntlets' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''To craft Gauntlets of Justice, you must collect one Small Piece of Ore, four Bone Chips, and one Polar Bear Skin. Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take the Gauntlets of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new gauntlets.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'craft breastplate' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''The Breastplate of Justice is perhaps the most difficult piece that you will have to construct. To construct your breastplate, you will need to find three Small Pieces of Ore, two Polar Bear Skins, and one Spider Venom Sac.' </p>

<p>Once you have combined these items in your Assembly Kit, take this Breastplate of Justice Material to a forge along with this mold to create your new breastplate. Once you have completed your breastplate, I have another [task] for you should you feel ready.'' </p>

<p>You say, 'what task?' </p>

<p>Balgros McMichael says ''Prove to me that you are ready to move on and continue your training elsewhere. In Everfrost there are many dangers. One danger are the Snow Orc Troopers. Find four Wrath Orc Wristbands from the Snow Orcs in Everfrost and hand them to me. Do so and I will reward you and your training with me will be complete. May The Tribunal watch over you, Dubhainnle.''</p>
