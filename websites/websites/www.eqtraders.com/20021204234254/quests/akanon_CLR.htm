            <h3>Ak'Anon Armor Quest</h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests. This one originates 
              with Iony Gredlong, in the Cleric's guildhall of Ak'Anon and results 
              in lore (other than bracer) no drop armor that is GNM/CLR only. 
              The armor is sky blue in color. <i>Please note that while the bracers 
              are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first 
              bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Iony Gredlong' </p>
            <p>Iony Gredlong says 'It is very nice to meet you ____. I am Iony 
              Gredlong Priestess of the Underfoot. I coordinate all the training 
              for new clerics here in the Deep Musing. If you are a [cleric] then 
              I might just have some tests for you that will challenge your wisdom 
              as well as your fighting abilitys.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a cleric' </p>
            <p>Iony Gredlong says 'Well you would certainly be eligible for my 
              training then young ____. I have a number of armor recipes that 
              I give to young clerics to make sure that when they leave the comfort 
              of the Steamfont Mountains they are ready for whatever battles they 
              may face. If you are [interested in creating your own armor] then 
              all you must do is simply ask and I will give you instructions to 
              get started.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am interested in creating my own armor' </p>
            <p>Iony Gredlong says 'I am always happy to see an eager young one 
              like yourself! Brell certainly takes pride in all young gnomes that 
              draw power from him to give life so you should consider yourself 
              very special. To create your own armor you are going to collect 
              [various items] from Ak`Anon and Steamfont. You will then combine 
              them in this assembly kit. Once you have made a material you will 
              place it in a forge along with molds that I will present to you 
              to create your armor.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what are the various items?' </p>
            <p>Iony Gredlong says 'There are numerous items that you will need 
              to collect and combine in your kit. I will present you for the recipe 
              for Shortnoble Platemail [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], 
              [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to 
              attempt a specific piece please let me know what piece you wish 
              to [craft] and I will give you the necessary mold along with the
