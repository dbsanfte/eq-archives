In todays headline news, Cazic Thule CEO and ruler of fear plane based company
Microterror is under scrutiny today by The Tribunal and some of the other
gods, for holding a strongarm monopoly on the Fear industry.
<P>
Innoruuk leader of world renowned company Nethate, and popular for another
marketing slogan "Got Evil?" didn't have much to comment on Cazic Thule strong
arm in the industry except: "Man this Cazic Thule guy, he's got his own dimension
and all, while us little guys are trying to make an honest liveing spreading
hate and fear amongst the other races, but he's killing off all out crops".
<P>
So we tried to get an exclusive interview with Cazic Thule so headed to the
Fear Plane. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by this ugly thing that
teleported us to a random location, where we were backstabbed fot 666 damage,
died and lost our corpses.. So we decided to see what the other gods had
to say.
<P>
Bristlebane was in his office, he offered us a beer and had dancing fools
entertain us. after a few hours of entertainment we decided to ask him what
he feels about Microterrors rule on the Fear market. he had these words to
share: "Eh? what? oh yeah man it pretty unfair dude., this cazic thule guy
is like totally not cool. Want another beer?"
<P>
We tried to talk with Erollisi Marr but she just gave us a hug and made us
feel good about ourselves.
<P>
On lighter the lighter side, Tunare's "Elf Life Cereal" is doing well on
the market and making many young and Elder elves happy.
