            <h3> Crown of Deceit: Illusion Wood Elf Crown Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This quest requires the Planes of Power expansion, as well as warmly 
              or ally faction with the Frogloks of Guk. It also needs one tradeskill-made 
              item to complete (a velium mastodon fur cloak, that is not trivial 
              at 250 tailoring), as well as an enchanter-made mana vial. 
            <p>Find Sage Ballic in Plane of Knowledge.
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Sage Ballic'<br>
              Sage Ballic says, 'Greetings friend. Welcome to my place of private 
              contemplation. I relax here and leaf through my old studies, admiring 
              at creations from the past made by races we thought would never 
              amount to anything. My favorite tomes to look at are those that 
              deal with Frogloks.<br>
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'What frogloks?'<br>
              Sage Ballic says 'A surprising race to study is the Frogloks of 
              Antonica. While we may think their magic was weak, it was at one 
              time so powerful the Gods reached down and smote them for their 
              creations. Balls of energy that made life into magic! Their High 
              Enchanter even made a mask that transformed the wearer into a Teir'Dal! 
              Quite an interesting race worthy of some study if you ask me, someday 
              I shall like to go and see these frogloks, especially to learn more 
              knowledge of the magical mask.<br>
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'What magical mask?'<br>
              Sage Ballic blinks and looks at you. 'I have told you all that I 
              know, for more knowledge you will need to seek it's creator. The 
              enchanter is more than likely very old, the mask having been made 
              at the height of the power of the Froglok Race. Here take this picture 
              book to aid you in your quest.' Sage Ballic hands you a book.</p>
            <p>He gives you a Lore No Drop book, which you bring to the Old Frog 
              in Upper Guk. You must have positive faction with the Frogloks of 
              Guk in order to get him to respond, and using sneak to hand in the 
              book does not work.</p>
            <p>The Old Frog is located in the hallway around the corner just past 
              the priest room if you are traveling from the direction of the Squire 
              spawn. He does have a placeholder (details not available) and his 
              respawn time is unknown, but relatively short. Hand him the book.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>an old froglok backflips and says, 'Frroooaaaaaakkkk! I'm in 
                this book! You see me! Owww that flip hurt my old bones! Frroooaaaaaakkkk! 
                Look there is a picture of my maaask from long ago! Frroooaaaaaakkkk! 
                I keep book! You taaake this recipe! Maaaybe more! I'm in book! 
                Frroooaaaaaakkkk!'<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He gives you a recipe to make Elf Essence. Combine the following 
              four items in a mortar &amp; pestle:<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>woodelf parts<br>
                dark elf parts<br>
                recipe <i>(the one he just gave you)</i><br>
                celestial essence</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Further text is not available at this time, but he needs four items: 
              reet froglok crown, elf essence, vial of purified mana, and a velium 
              mastodon fur cloak.</p>
            <p>The recipe for the elf essence is above. The reet froglok crown 
              drops off reets in Sebilis. The vial of purified mana is an enchanter-cast 
              spell that needs 4 rubies and a poison vial as material components. 
              The velium mastodon fur cloak is made by a skilled tailor by combining 
              4 velium mastodon furs (drop of mastodons in Western Wastes), <a href="../location/thurgadin.htm">platinum 
              thread</a>, cloak pattern, and another <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm61.showMessage?topicID=7.topic">vial 
              of purified mana</a>. This tailoring combine is not trivial at 250 
              skill.</p>
            <p>Hand in the crown, the cloak, the mana vial and the elf essence 
              to receive your very own:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Crown of Deciet<br>
