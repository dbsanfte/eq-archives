<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The one book on brewing 
  is an <I>excellent </I>guide for learning the skill to near mastery levels. 
  Unlike most skills, this one was one I didn't even bother to put <B>one</B> 
  point into (not even to "prime" the skill!). The same it true for alcohol tolerance, 
  but it would seem the this skill isn't as useful as I thought it might be for 
  a magician-- a few drinks and I've got the intelligence of an ape (and a dumb 
  one at that)! However, I recognize that there are a few <B>very</B> potent elixirs 
  one can mix for warriors (who have little use for intelligence in the heat of 
  battle!) who can benefit <B>much</B> from the bonuses alcohol can give to them 
  at high tolerance levels! </font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> There is at least one 
  recipe I know of for a brew that cannot be found in any tavern in Norrath (to 
  the best of my knowledge!), and I know more will be found eventually. To date, 
  it is not a very profitable skill to have, as the common brews one begins with 
  can be had for <B>far</B> cheaper than they cost to make. This may change at 
  a future date, and perhaps the harder-to-find or otherwise unfindable brews 
  will make it a more profitable undertaking. </font>

<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You're going to need to 
  locate several things, before you try brewing. First, you need recipes. The 
  book you can buy so far is the "Brewer's Limericks" book. The only location 
  found so far for this is Kaladim. (There is a quest in Halas/Everfrost for more 
  advanced brewing recipes.)&nbsp;Then, you need a brew barrel. These can be found 
  in pretty much every town. They are that odd things that look like a barrel 
  with a hose leading from it to a white trashcan. &nbsp;Then you need containers 
  for the finished product. Casks, bottles and the like can usually be found in 
  inns and taverns. But wait, there's more. That's right - other ingredients. 
  Some recipes will need ingredients that you can purchase at a few select shops 
  in Norrath. Other recipes will requires foraged goodies, or creature loot (rat 
  ears, snake scales and other such yummy stuff).</font> 
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Ok, you've located everything 
  and are ready to try. Wade through those Brewer's Limericks, try to translate 
  them into the ingredients needed, pop them into the brew barrel, and press combine. 
  (You can also take the easy way out and visit the recipes section of this site 
  for recipes if you don't want to chase books all over.) If you fail, you will 
  get back the bottle/cask, but you will lose all the other ingredients.</font>
