            <p>Welcome to one of the largest and most complete websites for EQ 
              Tradeskills!</p>
            <p>This is mainly a 1-person website, but content has been, and will 
              continue to be, fueled by input from the active tradeskill community 
              on the message boards. Please remember to read the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm56">Visitors 
              Corner</a> message board threads before posting onto the boards, 
              as there are some rules of the road that guests are asked to follow, 
              not only to keep things focused on tradeskills, but also to cut 
              down on the massive workload involved in maintaining and updating 
              this site.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Who's Who?</b></p>
            <p>I call this &quot;mainly&quot; a 1-person site because my RL husband, 
              known on the message boards as <font color="#400000"><b>Ngreth</b></font> 
              (<font color="#400000"><b>&quot;The House Ogre&quot;</b></font>) 
              has done much of the physical web design for the current site, and 
              he helps maintain order on the message boards. Aiding us in message 
              board moderation is also the lovely lady-rogue ... erm scout ... 
              <font color="#400000"> <b>Khevrynne</b></font>. With their staunch 
              assistance, we manage to keep the message boards <i>relatively</i> 
              &quot;troll free&quot; (the definition of troll is found below), 
              and it allows me to focus more on site updates, in-game testing, 
              etc. (For the curious, my average time spent on the site, the boards, 
              in-game testing, merchant verification, etc. is 20-40 hours per 
              week, depending on patch status. During a launch such as Luclin 
              or Kunark, this amount jumps to 40-80 hours a week for the month 
              following release)</p>
            <p>For the main website, <font color="#400000"><b>Verdandi Snowblood</b></font> 
              is the keeper of knowledge with regards to the Thurgadin Shawl quests. 
              If all goes well, <font color="#400000"><b>Candlelight Dreamspinner</b></font> 
              will be tackling the oft-neglected Fashion portion of the site, 
              and <font color="#400000"><b>Baldil Anla'shok</b></font> has just 
              volunteered to tackle tradeskill pricing guides and stray cleanup.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Why Did I Do It?</b></p>
            <p>Just why did I make this site shortly after the launch of EQ anyway? 
              Partly for myself, since I was gathering some of this knowledge 
              for my own tradeskilling and partly to help others working in the 
              trade skills. With the fact that many recipes are not available 
              in-game, or are still incorrectly listed in-game, having a site 
              that actively tests and verifies recipes and stats has become a 
              more important tool for saving the time and energy of tradesfolk. 
              I know most of us would prefer to spend our precious in-game time 
              actually tradeskilling, instead of spending that time running around, 
              finding recipes, collecting parts, and THEN finding out that all 
              that time was wasted because the recipe they found was wrong!</p>
            <p>While we've managed to keep this site ad free and fee-free since 
              the launch of the site a month after EQ went live, we're at the 
              point where we're going to have to accept donations in order to 
              keep the site running. However, we wish to make it clear that the 
              donations help keep the site running and accessible - they do not 
              grant special status on the boards, and we're still going to be 
              strict on our insistence that <i>everyone</i> follow some rules 
              for the road on the message boards.</p>
            <p>The following was something I wrote a while back, and while I've 
              edited it slighly since the donation button went up, the gist of 
              it is still the same. While I regret having to spell things out, 
              the sheer volume of traffic around here requires that I <i>do</i> 
              spell it out, so folks can't say they weren't warned ...</p>
            <hr>
            <p><b>Beware the Redhead's Wrath</b></p>
            <p>Since the start of this site, demand has grown, tradeskills have 
              hit the mainstream, and there are often weeks I just can't keep 
              up with it all. On weeks like that, please excuse the random redheaded 
              outbursts. Generally it's sparked by the 0.1% of the folks on the 
              boards and in game who are selfish snerts and decide to either stomp 
              about complaining about the things I have or have not done to this 
              site, or ones who just decide they have to be &quot;trolls&quot; 
              on the boards in a bid for attention. (And no, this does not mean 
              that I am against the troll race within the game, but in real-life 
              folks who decide they need to ruin things for the sake of ruining 
              them.) Unfortunately, as time goes on, and tradeskills become more 
              popular, that 0.1% becomes a larger physical number of folks, and 
              they just don't seem to understand they're not welcome here. </p>
            <p>I never thought I would have to so baldly state the below, since, 
              when tradeskills were small, and tradesfolk were considered hobbyists 
              instead of folks who could make &quot;l33t&quot; stuff (&quot;elite&quot; 
              for those of us who don't speak d00d speak), the 0.1% was small 
              enough in actual numbers to be easily ignored. The rest of us had 
              fun exchanging recipes, celebrating our successes, and commisserating 
              over the more creative failures. Unfortunately, 0.1% of the new 
              user base is not such a small number anymore, so perhaps they will 
              listen to the following. (Meanwhile, I hope those of you who are 
              here because you enjoy tradeskills and want to learn more realize 
              that I'm not doing this to be a selfish wench, but to preserve my 
              sanity while continuing to provide a valuable resource for the ever-growing 
              tradeskill community). It's likely, however, that the folks who 
              really <i>SHOULD</i> read this are the very ones who will ignore 
              it, and the clearly-stated rules on the message boards, and continue 
              to have to be slapped down when they act up and try to ruin it for 
              everyone else.</p>
            <p>So, here it is, plain and simple ... my site, my rules. If you 
              don't like this, you have two choices. 1) siddown, shuddup, use 
              the resources here that you need but keep your kvetching to yourself, 
              or 2) go somewhere else. If you think you can do better, please 
              put your time and money where your mouth is, and leave the rest 
              of us alone. We're a strong community here, and while we try to 
              welcome all the eager newcomers, troublemakers get run out of town 
              quickly.</p>
