      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meek's mother, Zehleia, 
        had been a very skilled high-elven bard with a strong curiousity, as well 
        as an unrivalved compositional skill. Often, she would travel the lands, 
        drinking in new sights, new sounds, new experiences, to add to her songs. 
        Rarely did she travel with companions, as she believed that her bardic 
        abilities would keep her safe. Few could resist the allure of Zehleia's 
        songs, or bear to hurt one who could, it seemed, make the very rocks sing. 
        Until she tangled with the slavers ...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While they found 
        her songs alluring, they found the thought of cash for the songstress 
        even more alluring. Especially when it was known that Ambassador Dvinn 
        was looking for a pet songbird and would pay handsomely.</font></p>

        Zehleia went, home to filthy orcs, abused slaves, and the foul dark-elven 
        Dvinn. Blessed with vocal and physical beauty, it was small wonder that 
        she attracted as much attention as she did. Nor was it surprising that 
        she bore a child in that foul pit. A child that was not pureblooded anything, 
        and as such was given the designation of &quot;half-elf&quot;. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">During the long pregnancy 
        Zehleia gave much thought to her unborn child, and to it's fate in this 
        accursed land. Much as she did not wish to bring new life into slavery, 
        she could not bring herself to terminate the life within her, even if 
        there had been means available to her. She was watched constantly, since 
        she was one of Dvinn's most prized possessions, and was oft paraded out 
        to official visitors and made to perform on cue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, since there 
        was always a demand for her original songs, many of the times when Zehleia 
        appeared to be in a songwriting daze, she was in a spellwriting daze instead. 
        A spell that was woven into each and every spell she sang to her child, 
        both in the womb, and after the birth. Delicate, unnoticed strands of 
        magic, meant to protect the child from drawing too much notice. Meant 
        to make the child have a flaw that would prevent the wee Meek one from 
        turning into yet another pet bard.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She left out one 
        crucial thing in forming the spell, however, as the child had a singing 
        voice that made Dvinn willing to overlook her obvious flaws. Unhappy, 
        but willing to overlook the flaws nonetheless. <b><i>Two</i></b> pet bards 
        of phenomenal skill. Largesse for the status-hungry Ambassador. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Too late did Zehleia 
        try to modify the spell set upon her daughter. Dvinn had gotten more careless 
        in his handling of her now that he had a supposedly more malleable child 
        to mold in place of the self-confident mother. Her powers were weakened, 
        and not up to modifying without destroying the spell already in place. 
        Too weak. Too late.</font></p>
