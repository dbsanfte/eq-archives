<I><B>The thread started with this request:</B></I>&nbsp;
<P>
"Anyone know where you can get Expulse Neighbor for the guys next door who
like<BR>
to blare the bass on their stereo almost 24/7? How about Banish Low Frequency?
<P>
"Expulse Feline for when the cat gets onto the keyboard?
<P>
"Anyone?"

"I just wish Icould cast alliance on my wife. &nbsp;She is red and scowling<BR>
most mornings."
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
"For this I would suggest the Rolled-up Newspaper of Nandubar. Damage 5<BR>
delay 24. It's a 1H Blunt weapon. There is the Magestic Squeeze Bottle of<BR>
Zarr. It contains 10 charges of Dampen Feline. A DD spell from the Fear<BR>
Line of Spells. But has a -10 CHA stat."
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
"Expulse Feline is a Bard song. It requires a piece of glass, a piece of<BR>
styrofoam, and enough courage to shout 'Boo!' at the cat. Note that you<BR>
get severe faction hits with OwnedByTheirCat."
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
"Anyone know how to cast Summon Pizza when my ethereal link has been cut<BR>
by some demon? All I get is 'beep... beep... beep...'. And I'm receiving<BR>
disturbing "You are hungry" messages from my stomach."
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
"OK I discovered the items for summon cash----green ink, Swiss paper and<BR>
printing plates. Most of these items can be found in the Plane of Felony
at<BR>
the Organized Crime Guild. You will take a severe faction hit for casting<BR>
it though."
<P>
<BR>
"Charm Spouse.<BR>
Pet of Cooking and Cleaning<BR>
Fear Children (to get them off my computer)<BR>
Summon Cash<BR>
Masseuse Animation<BR>
Summon Children. &nbsp;Expensive spell, but the best mana-damage <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;ratio in existence (God help us.) The casting of this spell
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;is rather entertaining too."
