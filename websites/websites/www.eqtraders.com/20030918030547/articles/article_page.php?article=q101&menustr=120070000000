<span class="headers">Neriak Rogue (Ashen Bone Mail) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Neriak. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer) and no drop. This starts in the rogue guild in Neriak 3rd Gate. Details on the armor received are not yet available. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Selzar L`Crit says 'What have we here? Another hopeful member of the House of the Ebon Mask? You've got much to learn before you will be of much use to our House or the secret operations that support both the thrones of our King and Queen. First you need to outfit yourself in a suit of [armor], Branaddar.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what armor?' 
</p>
<p>
Selzar L`Crit says 'Seek Kanthu M'Rekkor and give him this request parchment. When you have outfitted yourself in a suit of armor return to the House of the Ebon Mask and I will grant you [another task].' 
</p>
<p>
(hand in the parchment to Kantu M`Rekkor, also in the Rogue Guild) 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Kanthu M`Rekkor' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'Greetings, Branaddar. So you are one of Selzar's new recruits. You are to assist in the construction of the armor you will don as a new Rogue of the House of the Ebon Mask. I have assembled a kit that is used in the crafting of Ashen Bone Mail. You must travel beyond Neriak into the Nektulos Forest for the [materials] that compose the armor.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what materials?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'Many species of dangerous creatures, the restless dead, and halfling invaders from Rivervale inhabit the Nektulos Forest. You must defeat these creatures and halflings in order to obtain the materials. The materials you seek depend on the piece of armor you desire. Do you desire to craft [gloves], [boots], a [bracer], a [coif], [leggings], [sleeves], or a [tunic]?' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what gloves?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft Ashen Bone Mail Gloves you require two [silk thread], a ruined ash drakeling scales, and two halfling finger bones. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Glove Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what boots?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft Ashen Bone Mail Boots you require two [silk thread], two ruined ash drakeling scales, and two halfling foot bones. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Boot Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what bracer?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft an Ashen Bone Mail Bracer you require a [silk thread], a ruined ash drakeling scales, and a halfling ulna bone. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Bracer Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what coif?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft a Ashen Bone Mail Coif you require two [silk thread], a ruined ash drakeling scales, and a halfling skull. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Cap Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what leggings?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft Ashen Bone Mail Leggings you require three [silk thread], ash drakeling scales, two halfling tibia, and a halfling pelvis bone. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Leggings Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what sleeve?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft Ashen Bone Mail Sleeves you require two [silk thread], ash drakeling scales, and two halfling humerus bones. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Sleeves Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what tunic?' 
</p>
<p>
Kanthu M`Rekkor says 'To craft an Ashen Bone Mail Tunic you require four [silk thread], pristine ash drakeling scales, a halfling sternum, and a halfling ribcage. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Tunic Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
Back at the original quest giver:
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what another task?' 
</p>
<p>
Selzar L`Crit says 'Ah, you are eager to advance further within the House of the Ebon Mask. Although it is my duty to aid your training, do not allow your arrogance to blind you to your lowly position in our House. I can see that you have not yet learned to temper the use of your tongue. Your next task is to assist the construction of a [weapon] and [bow] worthy of being wielded by a Rogue of the House of the Ebon Mask.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what weapon?' 
</p>
<p>
Selzar L`Crit says 'Beyond the mouth of Neriak lies the Nektulos Forest. There the Halflings of Rivervale have set up camps at ancient druid holy sites in an attempt to cleanse Innoruuks corruption that is spreading through the Nektulos Forest. Slay these trespassers and bring me a Large Snake Skin, a Halfling Fibula bone, and a Halfling Clavicle bone.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what bow?' 
</p>
<p>
Selzar L`Crit says 'The Halfling Druids from Rivervale that frequent the ancient druid ruins in the Nektulos Forest are guarded by Leatherfoot Warriors. The peck druids perform the rituals that they hope will prevent Innoruuks corruption from spreading deeper into the Forest and the lands beyond. Should you slay the peck warriors guarding the druids and obtain a Leatherfoot Short Bow, take the bow, a Black Mamba Skin, and a Lock of Zombie Hair to Andara C'Luzz at The Bleek Fletcher in the Neriak Commons near the headquarters of the Indigo Brotherhood.'
