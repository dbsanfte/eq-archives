<BR><BR>
We have a lot to plan, and a lot to do. I've felt for a while that dark forces were returning, and so it is to be. Until 
now I have had little success learning the Army of Darkness' plan. Wandazula's letter has given us a very 
important quest, and it's one that falls close to our own hearts. If what she says about Raenewae is true, then this 
dark elf Tnayr must answer for his death. In the past I've had little chance to stop his kind in their endeavors... the 
raids on our cities and innocent citizens... but I will NOT stand by while the friends of my childhood are 
systematically slain in the name of some horrendous god. Nor will I stand by and watch Felwithe meet this sad 
fate.
<BR><BR>
We must find Lumina Thex, the knowledge variant, and speak to her. Karana has blessed us with influence here. 
Aeluminadria, I am uncertain your part in this... or if Tnayr is even clear on who you are. We will attend this 
wedding of Tnayr's on Friday, though I don't know what will come of it... if we can stop him then, so be it. With 
hope, we will find these answers from our allies attending. If nothing else, we can try to dissuade his bride-to-be 
from helping Tnayr further his plans. The Shadow Striders, as always, fall under our jurisdiction and responsibility 
to control.
<BR><BR>
The news of Neriak's invasion has not been overlooked. In fact, it would be a brilliant counter strike to at least 
hinder the dark army's plan. I will watch for the date and announce it.
<BR><BR>
Some of you know what took place recently in Befallen, some of you don't. It took me a while to figure out the 
events from all sides. I wish now I'd paid more attention to Faileas' "insane rants", because he tried to warn me. I 
apologized to him. This is my report on the event:
<BR><BR><I>" ...After my brother's capture and imprisonment, during which all weapons and armor were taken from him, 
save the Armor of Souls which I cannot remove, his dark elven apprentice somehow broke into the Temple of 
Marr in which these items were guarded. She recovered all of these, including his sword which was later seen in 
her possession. Over time this sword began to speak to her, as it contained the soul of one of Faileas' victims. To 
this day, I still do not know if she was aware of it's identity. The soul belonged to my late father, Durante 
Imshee'Cro, necromancer of Bertoxxulous. He and the dark elf formed a pact in which his soul would be released 
in return for great power. Apparently she did not trust him completely, and planned to use one of the druid amulets 
of my family as backup. This was to take place in Befallen, and the Shadow Striders she felt loyal to her were sent 
to gather ingredients for the ritual. The others, suspicious of her actions, gathered themselves for a journey to 
Qeynos where they would sneak a meeting with Faileas. It was during this meeting that my second knight Sturmm 
Brightblade was attacked by Talisson Bonedancer. We still have not found what became of him.
    <BR><BR>For reasons unknown to us all at the time, (save for Faileas himself, who seemed to have gone mad) a ghost 
began to haunt Qeynos. I had received a few reports of this, but did little investigation since it seemed harmless 
compared to the Bloodsabers' ongoing violence. With a cryptic poem Faileas ordered his followers to find this 
ghost, haunting the ruins of our home in Qeynos Hills. It was by chance, and Wind Rider cunning that we figured it 
out also. The ghost belonged to my mother, Eayst Cheyl. She had risen the moment my father was in danger of 
being released... in other words, the moment I had taken my brother's sword from him after the war.
    <BR><BR>I do not understand soul magick, nor do I wish to. For the sake of stopping Faileas I may be forced to. The 
bindings on his sword were held by his presence, and Eayst Cheyl knew this, as well as what was about to 
happen. I was forced to vow not to assist my friends in Befallen, and to keep Faileas away also... lest we both fall 
under our fathers' influence. She told the Wind Riders in no uncertain terms to take the sword from Envy and 
place it in some kind of time capsule that my brother had buried as a child. Getting the sword from her was the 
problem, but one that had it's solution as well. Faileas and his followers prepared some kind of dagger, using my 
blood and Malgorm's tears. No, at the time I had no idea what was going on, so I did not give it freely to Shizo. 
I'm sure they used some cleverness on Malgorm for his tears too. Upon fighting their way into Befallen, Mayana 
cut Envy with this magick dagger, who then was forced to drop the sword. Malladin simply placed it in the box 
they'd found, and returned it to Eayst Cheyl. She disappeared, at peace now that her husband's soul rests with 
hers.
    <BR><BR>It was extraordinarily odd to fight alongside Shadow Striders, and I know many of mine will agree. However it 
gives a renewed sense of hope for those..."</I>
<BR><BR>
That obstacle overcome, we returned to our usual vigilance. Aeluminadria Thex was being held somewhere in 
Cabilis at the time this was written. There is a vague plan to ask some of our newfound Iksar allies to help her 
escape. This must be done before Friday's wedding. Sturmm Brightblade also, must be saved from whatever 
Talisson has done with him. Phenix Stormryder, who became a Shadow Strider in some fit of madness, should be 
taken back to Surefall Glade/Qeynos. Perhaps familiar surroundings will remind him of what his true goals are.
<BR><BR>
We have some new faces amoung us, so please make them feel welcome. Septus, Biggnash, Tallie, and Byrdie 
are only a few.
<BR><BR>
Until I receive more information, Farewell. May Karana's wisdom rain upon us.
<BR><BR>
Sugan Imshee'Cro<BR>
Knight of Storms

(ooc- Malgorm and I are trying to plan a quest event for this Sunday night, the 16th, at 11pm EST. (8pm PST) 
However, this event will involve PvP between our guilds, and so no Wind Rider will be included unless they <B>Tell
Me Beforehand</B>. I will then give Malgorm the list of names, and the event will be planned based on that. Please 
let me know if you want to participate. Thank you.)</DIV></TD>
