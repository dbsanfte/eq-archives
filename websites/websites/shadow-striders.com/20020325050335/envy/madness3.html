<P><B>Madness III</B>
<P>Having all of the main passages memorized, Envy navigated the endless tunnels to a part she normally tried to avoid. In the depths of this 'wing' was what seemed to be a kitchen of sorts; or more appropriately- a sick parody of a kitchen. Down this far, the lit torches ended and there was no light. The place was huge, but she'd always avoided it because of the smell. Rotten chunks of flesh and other organic materials were everywhere that food was supposed to be, and seemed to be upkept even though no one came down to add to the mess. Some body parts were recognizable in various stages of decomposure, while elsewhere questionable heaps of molded and slimed jelly dripped from stone slabs onto the floor. Bloodstains were everywhere; both wet and dried. But there were no flies. If there had been, they would have died and rotted too.
<P>Eternal decay. You see, in this place one could sense the unholy bond between Bertoxxulous and the Imshee'Cro. The very air nearly shimmered between planes in the darkness.
<P>Envy covered her nose and mouth with a cloth, preferring her gore fresh and warm. Scanning the huge counters and ovens of the room, she kept seeing movement from the rotten stuff in her peripheral vision. Although wary, the knight let it go for the moment as one of Legacy's many illusions. She began to pick her way between the first two counters towards the door on the far left side of the kitchen. Turning around twice to watch her back, Envy warily perked her ears in a catlike fashion. But no sound was to be heard, save the random messy splat of nameless ooze to the floor.
<P>She reached the heavy wooden door and leaned close to listen without touching it, as she'd noticed it was damp with some greasy black substance. Satisfied, the dark elf pushed it open noiselessly with the toe of her boot. As the sight spread itself before her, Envy's eyes grew wide. Another kitchen, very much like the one she still stood in… but this one was occupied. Slow moving human and half elven corpses stood or roamed between counters, seemingly caught forever in the act of preparing a great feast. There was very little skin left on them, and a few were nothing more than skeletons with tatters of muscle hanging and randomly dropping to the floor. The charred, featureless remains of two burnt humans stooped near a huge oven on the far end, tending a silent blue blaze. Envy noticed a glowing figure in the corner near them. A ghostly female hovered near the stone counter, her back turned. She seemed untouched by the entropy, but probably because she had no flesh to corrupt.
<P>The human ones were huge compared to the dark elf. They all moaned in slow strange words; why Envy couldn't hear them before was a mystery. In all of this, she picked up a small voice from her close right and jumped. Part of a head lay on the floor, it's one remaining withered eye darting around, trying and failing to focus on her.
<P>"Heeeeelllppp meeee…." It wheezed in the common tongue. The Teir'Dal wondered if this was perhaps the fate of the kitchen's previous visitor. The thing tried to speak again, but there was a pop and it's jaw clattered off the hinges and lay still. It's 'tongue' lolled helplessly from side to side. Envy shook her head in disgust, having no intentions to help it in any way.
<P>A large cleaver swung right past her face and buried itself deep in the muck-softened wooden door. One of the zombies had been behind the door as it opened, and now that it noticed her the others turned slowly to face her as well. The thing behind the cleaver was enormous; in Envy's judgement a male barbarian. He tugged the cleaver free and a large part of the door fell off. She leaped back and drew her sword, quickly tucking the cloth away so she could brandish it with both hands. As the undead barbarian lunged for her again, she sidestepped and swung her sword low, easily severing his legs at the knee. The tower of flesh fell forward loudly, most of him falling apart on impact with the ground. Pieces of him struggled to drag themselves back to her, but in vain. Envy turned with a snarl to the room where the other drudges stumbled her way. She placed herself in front of the doorway to try and take them singly.
<P>The first met a quick release from unlife as Envy lopped off it's head and kicked the body into the rest behind it. The next few were rather easily taken as well, but soon she found herself fending off three in turn, and was forced back. Envy brought her hateful sword Innen down on a half elf and was surprised when it glanced off her skeletal arm in a block. The dark elf cursed in her tongue as they flooded into the first room and piled close. Bony fleshless fingertips scraped Envy's smooth blue skin as the half elf groped at her clumsily.  She tried to crush them away with the pommel of the sword while other zombies latched on too, prying and scratching to find out literally what she was made of. She could feel the wetness of raw flesh trying to pull her down, to pull her apart. To steal the life she had and feed off it. Envy welcomed the rage and hate it brought her.
<P>The shadow knight screamed an arcane phrase at a pile of bones lying close, and they rose to unlife obediently. The thing knocked off one of her attackers and she struggled free, pulling a few of the zombies' limbs with her. She turned and tore into them with ceremonious fervor, laughing in the rush it was to feel death so close. Crumbling from her assault left and right, the horde of undead drudges was reduced to twitching additions to the mess already there. Envy panted hard as she observed her handiwork, and nodded to the summoned pet standing silently nearby.
<P>She agreed with Lord Faileas that along with pure practitioners of the necromantic arts, Dark Knights were undisputed masters of unlife. Like all slaves, they had to be put in their place once in a while. Envy was only too happy to oblige.
<P>Suddenly there was a flash of pain. Envy looked down to see a nasty gash in her side, and heard her pet attack something. A closet of darkness in the second kitchen was starting to leak more of the undead from whatever rooms lay below. She heard them on stairs, drawn by her life like moths to a…
<P>"No-" she objected, and leapt over the mess to kick the closet door closed. There was a stone stopper that could be pushed into place over the door, and Envy tugged and pushed hard to budge it. Finally it gave way, slowly falling over into the iron hook with a heavy, decisive thud. The zombies didn't have a fraction of the strength needed to get through. 'Let them beat themselves to pieces trying.' she thought.
<P>Her summoned pet gave a cry of defeat from the other room, and Envy saw it shatter from the blade of the zombie that had cut her. She took the opportunity to hack the thing apart before it could face her again. Wincing from the wound on her side, Envy examined it with brief worry. It hurt a lot more than it should have--</DIV></FONT>
