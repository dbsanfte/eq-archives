								<B>History:</B><BR><BR>
The Final Autumn
<BR><BR>
"M'lord, M'lady, the new shipments have arrived," a young warrior by the name of Rem
reported.
<BR><BR>
Lady Ve`Dui nodded, and placed her three-year old daughter down on the cold floor to join
her twin brother Rethe as he pursued a hobbling broken-winged Vampire bat who was vainly
trying to escape the young Teir`Dal's grasp.
Lord Ve`Dui looked down upon his two children, his helm cradled in his arms, and gave a nod
of approval as the twins each grabbed one of the bats wings, and tugged hard; splitting the
screeching creature in two.
<BR><BR>
Lord Ve`Dui bent down, chuckling, and patted his daughter on the head.
The little girl looked up, and smiled wickedly at her father, her tiny fangs gleaming.
"You be a good girl now, Yavie, and make sure your brother doesn't try to eat the bat this
time."
<BR><BR>
Yavie giggled, and glanced over at her brother who was waving his half of the mutilated bat
wildly in the air, cackling madly. 
<BR><BR>
Lord Ve`Dui laughed, and walked to the doorway to join his leather-clad wife. Lady Ve`Dui
smiled wickedly at her husband, and together they walked arm in arm to the Neriak Commons
to examine the new shipments...
<BR><BR>
~~
<BR><BR>
"Line up, fools!" Rem snapped, lashing his whip at the twenty new imported slaves from the
continent of Faydwer.
<BR><BR>
Reluctantly, the broken-spirited slaves did as Rem said, and stood cowering in a line
awaiting Lord and Lady Ve`Dui.
<BR><BR>
They knew that today was their judgment day. Only half of the imported slaves would be
kept. The others would be used in Necromancy experiments, and some would be used in the
next sacrifice to Innoruuk.
<BR><BR>
"Ah! M'lord, M'lady! These are the shipments," Rem said, gesturing towards the dirty and
beaten array of Woodland Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, and a High Elven couple.
Lady Ve`Dui nodded in approval, and walked along the line of slaves, sorting them. 
"You've outdone yourself, Rem," Lady Ve`Dui said as she picked out nine slaves, and then
stopped before the High Elven couple.
<BR><BR>
"I try, M'lady, I try," Rem cackled.
<BR><BR>
Lady Ve`Dui smirked at the proud fair-skinned elves, and tilted her head in thought. 
The female high elf snarled at the Teir`Dal woman, and began yelling some choice curse
words in a language not even Rem could understand.
<BR><BR>
"Shut her up, Rem," Lady Ve`Dui said calmly, and Rem lashed his whip at the pale slave
woman.
<BR><BR>
The woman flinched, but remained silent after that.
<BR><BR>
The High Elven male glared at Lady Ve`Dui.
<BR><BR>
"I don't care what you do with me, but let her go!" he growled.
<BR><BR>
"I'm afraid that isn't an option for either of you," Lady Ve`Dui cackled. "You see, one of
you will die... and one of you will become a servant of the Teir`Dal. Now, which path you
follow is determined by your own actions as of this moment... I myself would have no
problem in killing the both of you. But, our slaves are most times short-lived. Therefore,
we need as many as we can successfully capture. And the decision on whether or not you die,
is decided by one thing now..."
<BR><BR>
Lady Ve`Dui cackled, and turned to her husband. Lord Ve`Dui gave a small nod of his head,
and an issue was ordered.
<BR><BR>
"Rem, go fetch my children... it is time they learned to make their own decisions..."
<BR><BR>
~~
<BR><BR>
A few moments later, two young Teir`Dal children entered the area. 
Rethe toted his half of the mutilated bat, and Yavie held tight to a small Kerran doll,
which had been her mother's as they stood in front of the two High Elves, their mother
standing behind them.
<BR><BR>
"Pick one," Lady Ve`Dui said simply.
<BR><BR>
Yavie walked up to the female High elf, and bared her fangs. Rethe followed behind Yavie,
and glanced at the woman.
<BR><BR>
Yavie tilted her head sideways, and cackled, then walked to the High Elven man, and bared
her fangs at him.
<BR><BR>
"Which one should we give to Innoruuk, Yavie?" Lord Ve`Dui spoke, his voice filled with
amusement at the thought of his daughter being able to choose a perfect sacrifice for the
Lord of Hate.
<BR><BR>
"This one, Daddy," Yavie said, pointing a finger at the male. "Give this one to Innoruuk."
Rethe walked over to Yavie, and nodded in agreement.
<BR><BR>
"There you have it! Your fate has been sealed," Lady Ve`Dui said, and laughed coldly,
shoving the High Elven woman in line with the other nine slaves she thought useful.
"Aiya!" the man called out to his wife, as she was placed with the others.
<BR><BR>
Aiya looked sadly at her husband, knowing this was the last time she would see him.
"Love..." she sobbed, and watched as Rem roughly placed shackles on the High Elven man's
wrists and feet, and hauled him away with the other unfortunate souls being sacrificed to
the god of hate.
<BR><BR>
Aiya turned an icy glare upon Yavie.
<BR><BR>
Yavie growled at the woman, and stuck her tongue out, turning away to follow her brother,
who was in pursuit of another bat.
<BR><BR>
And as Aiya was silently lead away to her cell, she swore to herself she would have revenge
on the young child, who was now responsible for the death of her husband... and wondered
what would become of her own child back in Felwithe...
<BR><BR>
~*~
<BR><BR>
The days passed slowly for Aiya, as she sat locked away in a crowded cell with the others
that were slaves. Each day, when she wasn't forced to work at the Maiden's Fancy, she sat
in her corner of the cell pondering how she would get out and find her way back to
Felwithe.
<BR><BR>
A few voices talking excitedly within the cell caught Aiya's attention, and she turned to
see one of the enslaved gnomes holding up a faded book to the other slaves, and explaining
exactly what it was.
<BR><BR>
"This is it! This is our ticket out of here, and back to the surface! This is our ticket
home!" the gnome chattered on, his voice growing louder with every word.
<BR><BR>
"In this book, are spells! Yes, yes, spells! Enchantment spells, wizardry spells... even a
couple of the necromancy spells! Friends! We must train ourselves in this art! Become
powerful! And break out of 'ere!"
<BR><BR>
A few of the slaves cheered, but even more seemed doubtful about what was being planned.
"An' just how do you suppose we get out of 'ere using these... these spells?" a red-haired
elf asked of the gnome. 
<BR><BR>
"We use some of the spells that channel evocation... to blast a hole in the wall... and
then we-"
<BR><BR>
"And then what? We just walk out?" a dwarf asked, annoyed.
<BR><BR>
"We would get caught before we made it to Nektulos. So you see, we are doomed to spend the
rest of our existence here. Throw away that book, there is no hope for us," the pessimistic
dwarf continued, arms folded over his chest.
<BR><BR>
The gnome clutched the book tightly, looking troubled. After all, the dwarf was right...
<BR><BR>
"Actually, we can just walk out of here," Aiya spoke, standing up.
<BR><BR>
The gnome eyed the pale elf curiously.
<BR><BR>
"What do you mean, we can just walk out of here?"
<BR><BR>
Aiya glanced around at the other slaves, who stood huddled around the book-toting gnome. 
Aiya quickly grabbed the book from the gnome, and began flipping through pages.
<BR><BR>
"Here!" she cried excitedly, and pointed to a spell scribed in the book. Illusion Dark
Elf...
<BR><BR>
The gnome took a look at what Aiya had found, and snatched the book back, standing atop a
small crate inside the cell.
<BR><BR>
"There you have it! We will walk out! ...as Teir`Dal!"
<BR><BR>
~~
<BR><BR>
Days passed, and the slaves crammed inside the cell spent what precious minutes they had
learning and memorizing the spells. And those that couldn't were already working on their
own ideas.
<BR><BR>
Aiya sat once more in her corner, the book in her lap as she memorized what spells she
could... Having chosen seven spells, she flipped through the pages, looking for a perfect
final spell. And there, on the fifth page she saw it. Memory Blur.
<BR><BR>
Satisfied, Aiya closed the book as passed it to an anxious gnome.
<BR><BR>
He grabbed the book quickly, and began looking through a few spells involving evocation. 
When he was done, he passed the book on and closed his eyes, murmuring a few words, and
suddenly sparks shot from his fingertips, catching a wandering beetle on fire.
<BR><BR>
The creature squealed in pain and flipped over on his back, ceasing to move after that. 
The gnome chuckled to himself but his mood quickly turned as he looked up. Standing just
outside the cell, was Yavie. She had seen the whole thing.
<BR><BR>
~*~
<BR><BR>
The little Teir`Dal girl growled at the slaves, baring her tiny fangs at them as she
clutched her doll.
<BR><BR>
"Don't let her escape!" Aiya hissed, as Yavie turned to run. The little girl had but taken
two steps when one of the elven slaves grabbed her ankle, pulling her to the ground. She
gave a small yelp, and kicked wildly but the elf held tight.
<BR><BR>
"Time for justice, little one," Aiya said, smirking and then turned to the gnome.
"We move, now!" Aiya whispered to the gnome.
<BR><BR>
The gnome nodded, and began his own casting. This time, it was an icy blast that came and
froze the bars solid and making them brittle.
<BR><BR>
A dwarf came charging from behind Aiya, throwing his weight against the bars. With little
effort, the bars splintered and snapped and the enslaved beings evacuated the cell.
"Let me go!" Yavie cried out, but the elf would not.
<BR><BR>
"Hush!" Aiya said to the Teir`Dal child, and picked her up, the other elf releasing her
grasp on Yavie's ankle and fleeing behind the other slaves.
<BR><BR>
Yavie squirmed in Aiya's arms, kicking and trying to get away.
<BR><BR>
Aiya just grinned, and began casting a spell of her own. Yavie watched in surprise as
Aiya's flesh changed and darkened, and her form grew smaller.
<BR><BR>
And a few moments later, Aiya stood as a Teir`Dal. Yavie's eyes went wide, and she felt
something she had never felt before. Fear.
<BR><BR>
"Rethe!" the little girl screamed, calling for her brother.
<BR><BR>
Aiya laughed, and tightened her grip on the little girl, running through Neriak to catch up
with the others.
<BR><BR>
Suddenly, the enslaved gnome turned and flames once more poured from his fingertips. In
moments, the cells and all of the Ve`Dui manor was engulfed in flames.
<BR><BR>
All Yavie could do was watch helplessly from the enchantress' arms as her home burned. And
all she could hope was that her family would get out alive.
<BR><BR>
~*~
<BR><BR>
A few days later, Yavie found herself inside a place she had never seen before.
White marble walls surrounded her, and sunlight shown brightly through the windows.
<BR><BR>
She hissed, the sunlight hurting her eyes terribly. She shut her eyes tight, and
opened them after a few minutes, blinking and looking around.
<BR><BR>
This wasn't home. It was far from it.
<BR><BR>
As she looked around, she noticed she wasn't alone. There, standing in the far
corner of the room, was Aiya. And beside her stood a small girl, an exact replica of the
enchantress... Ninquelote; daughter of Aiya...
<BR><BR>
 ~*~
 <BR><BR>
"Well, look who's finally awake," Aiya said smirking.
<BR><BR>
Yavie hissed at Aiya, and scooted backwards in her own corner.
<BR><BR>
"Get away!" she shrieked, when Aiya came closer.
<BR><BR>
Aiya laughed, and approached anyway, her daughter following behind her.  She paused
for a moment, seeming to be deep in thought.
<BR><BR>
"Mommy? What is that..." Ninquelote asked quietly.
<BR><BR>
"That, my dear, is a Teir`Dal. Vicious creatures. And that particular one is why
your father didn't return with me..." Aiya spoke, her tone filled with sadness.
<BR><BR>
"What are you going to do with her, Mommy?"
<BR><BR>
"Justice must be done for the pain she has caused me, my dear... The code, however,
prevents me from killing her directly. And pain is said to be enjoyed of her kind. So, I
suppose there is only one thing we can do."
<BR><BR>
Aiya glanced at the young Teir`Dal, and Yavie bared her fangs, growling in response.
<BR><BR>
"She will be stripped of her form," Aiya said simply, grabbing the Teir`Dal girl
and took her to another room, where the process would be done.
<BR><BR>
~*~
<BR><BR>
Yavie's hands were bound by shackles, as were her ankles. She was made to stand in
front of a large firepot. 
<BR><BR>
She dared not to move, as she didn't know what powers either High Elf was capable
of.
<BR><BR>
Aiya reached into a large sack, and dug around. Finally, she pulled out what seemed
to be a small jar of pixie dust, a griffon feather, water from the Oasis of Marr, an asp
poison sac, and various herbs. 
<BR><BR>
Slowly, she stood over the fire pot and placed each item in, chanting in a tongue
not yet known to Yavie.
<BR><BR>
The fire glowed a brilliant blue, then white as each item was added.
<BR><BR>
Aiya then turned to Yavie, and unshackled her wrists, holding them over fire. Yavie
struggled, but the fire did not burn her.
<BR><BR>
"Look into the fire, child..." Aiya whispered.
<BR><BR>
Yavie didn't want to. The light from it stung her eyes. But for some reason, she
did anyway.
<BR><BR>
Quickly, Aiya pulled out a dagger and slit into Yavie's wrist. The little girl
flinched, but still stared into the fire, mesmerized.
<BR><BR>
Three drops of the Teir`Dal's blood dripped into the flames, making them crackle
and blaze crimson.
<BR><BR>
Then Aiya took her own wrist, and slit it, letting three drops of her own blood
drop into the fire. The fire then turned back to blue, and then white.
<BR><BR>
Aiya glanced at Yavie, who was still watching the flames, and began an incantation
of some sort, each word she spoke bringing the flames higher.
<BR><BR>
Yavie felt a strange warmth surround her, and for a moment her gaze was broken from
the fire. She stepped backwards, and a pain erupted from the inside out, causing the little
girl to drop to her knees, screaming at the top of her lungs.
<BR><BR>
Her skin burned, as if it was on fire, and her head roared with what sounded like
barking. She glanced bleary eyed at herself, watching her flesh change.
<BR><BR>
The once blue-black skin crackled and faded into a tan color, her hair went from
snowy white to that of golden leaves, and her eyes dimmed slightly, turning a pale sky
blue.
<BR><BR>
Yavie continued to scream, as the searing heat ran through her body once more, her
vision blurred with crimson tears.
<BR><BR>
She remained in that position for two hours, each wave of pain hitting her harder
than before. And then suddenly, the pain stopped.
<BR><BR>
She took one deep breath after another, and slowly rose from her knees, and glared
at Aiya, and then at Ninquelote. 
<BR><BR>
Aiya moved forward to Yavie and placed a hand at the back of her neck, murmuring a
few words in the common tongue.
<BR><BR>
"As long as our bloodline shall flow, her real life... she shall never know..."
<BR><BR>
With that, all Yavie's memory was wiped away and a runic symbol glowed from the
back of her neck. The transformation was complete. But the curse had only begun...<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> From all reports a great asset to our way of life. Though, I have
								noticed a few oddities... she's probably not a true Feir'Dal.<BR><BR>
								<B>Envy's View:</B> Yavie, all the way! There are so few people who can make such a smooth
								transition from that Day to Evening look, and she pulls it off nicely. I bet she makes a
								mean drink, too, assuming it isn't flat out poisonous.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> I can't understand her lack of respect for life. But I suppose that
								looks good on a dark elf's resume. Why would she want to impress them?<BR><BR>
