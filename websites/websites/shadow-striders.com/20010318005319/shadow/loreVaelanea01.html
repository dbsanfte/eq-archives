                      Vaelanea had lived a fairly normal life for a Teir'Dal. When she came of age
                      she chose the path of the warrior, and followed the calling of Rallos Zek.
                      Vaelanea was trained in the art of stealth, hiding, one handed slashing
                      weapons, and dual wield. She preferred to dual wield axes, but she was
                      deadly with any weapon. Now she wore blackened ringmail leggings that
                      stopped at about mid-thigh, an exposing black ringmail bikini, and black
                      ringmail arm sleeves that stopped just short of her shoulders, compared to the
                      leather outfit she wore when she wore when she first met Darain. After meeting
                      Vaelanea, Darain recruited Vaelanea into his guild, the Shadow Striders. He
                      convinced her to become his personal assassin, sent to kill certain members of
                      the Shadow Striders arch-enemies, the Wind Riders. She trained hard every
                      day so she would be strong enough for any assignment given to her by Darain.
                      Then it came…
<BR><BR>
                      "Vaelanea?" the human boy said.
<BR><BR>
                      "Yes?" she hissed.
<BR><BR>
                      "A message for you from Lord Darain." The thought that Darain sent her a
                      message made her wonder. She quickly snatched the scroll from the boy's
                      hand and told him to run off, which he did, stumbling from fright as he fled. It
                      had better be important enough to interrupt her resting in her favorite tavern.
                      Vaelanea rolled open the scroll…
<BR><BR>
                      "Vaelanea" it started out "I have your first assignment. I feel it is time to show
                      the Wind Riders that we have some muscle now. I have chosen the son of the
                      wood elf whore, Lillaie to be the first. His name is Kinor, a barbarian. Can you
                      imagine that? A barbarian son of a wood elf. He has publicly spoken out
                      against the Shadow Striders, causing us much annoyance. This annoyance
                      must be stopped. Execute him, and don't forget to let him know it was by MY
                      order!"
<BR><BR>
                      "This will be quite a challenge" she muttered. Barbarians were not only very
                      large, but made for awesome warriors. She wondered if she would be able to
                      overcome his brute strength. "It ought to be a glorious battle indeed" she said
                      out loud as she walked out the door of the tavern into the late afternoon light,
                      leaving her drinks and food unpaid for. Not like anyone would have the
                      courage enough to confront her about it anyway, they all knew she would cut
                      out their tongue or some such awful thing.
<BR><BR>
                      As Vaelanea walked to the gates of Qeynos she noticed a small blonde wood
                      elf talking to a large barbarian. She used her skills of stealth to quietly slip into
                      the shadows. She stood there, invisible in the shadows, listening to them talk.
                      She learned that the little wood elf was Lillaie. She appeared to be a druid as
                      well. She hated druids. Not because of their want to protect nature, but
                      because she hated having to make spellcasters angry with her. They could
                      freeze her legs and blast away her life with spells while she stood there
                      helpless, she hated that feeling. She shivered at the thought. The barbarian was
                      Kinor too. Excellent, this job would be much quicker then she expected. Lillaie
                      and Kinor wandered close to her and stood there, still chatting away.
                      Vaelanea felt this would be a good time to make her presence known. Like a
                      flash of lightning, her hand sot out of the darkness, axe in hand. The hilt of the
                      axe solidly connected with Lillaie's temple, instantly rendering her unconscious.
                      Vaelanea stepped into the light just enough for some of her figure to show in
                      the dusk light.
                      "Kinor" she said. "I have been ordered by Lord Darain to execute you for
                      crimes against the Shadow Striders"
<BR><BR>
                      "The Shadow Striders?" Kinor said. "Evil being! Prepare to join the dead!" he
                      screamed at her as he charged at her, sword in hand. She simply moved
                      sideways, making him slam into the wall she was standing against.
<BR><BR>
                      "Maybe this won't be so hard" she thought as she swung her axe down against
                      the leather armor Kinor was wearing. It wouldn't protect him much against her
                      axes. He stood up and swung at her backhanded. She ducked but ended up
                      ducking right into a kick, which sent her flying backwards into some wooden
                      crates against a wall. She was badly dazed but recovered quickly. Kinor was
                      right there, swinging down at her with his sword. She managed to roll to avoid
                      the sword, but wood debris stung her skin. She rolled forward off of the crates
                      and scurried away far enough so that she could stand for Kinor's next attack.
                      He kicked at her again, but once again she dodged, but she wasn't able to
                      avoid his shield, which he swung right into her. Vaelanea's side screamed with
                      pain from being hit with the shield. She stumbled backwards in pain and felt
                      dizzy. She began to doubt if she could take this barbarian, but then things
                      turned. As Kinor charged for his next attack she hooked his sword with one of
                      her axes, while elbowing him in the belly, knocking the wind out of Kinor. As
                      he stumbled backwards in both surprise and pain she came forward, kicking
                      him in the chest and nearly knocking him down. She swung her axe and
                      connected with his left arm, the one holding the shield. She nearly tore it off but
                      she wasn't at the proper angle, so the bone stopped the axe. As he reeled in
                      pain she turned to check on Lillaie. She was still out cold. Good, this would be
                      easy. She raised her axe to swing down at Kinor again when a voice called
                      out.
<BR><BR>
                      "Vaelanea!"
<BR><BR>
                      She turned to look. It was the human, Niceen, along with Prescott and the
                      Teir'Dal, Tajitz, all Shadow Striders. As she was turned Kinor tripped
                      Vaelanea, knocking her down onto the cobblestone, hard. She was seriously
                      dazed and had no idea what was going on. Luckily she had badly hurt Kinor
                      because he could have easily ended her life while she laid there before him. His
                      arm was seriously slowing him down. By this time a decent crowd started to
                      gather, different people cheering for one of them or the other. Vaelanea stood
                      as Kinor was up to a crouching position.
<BR><BR>
                      "Hah! Look at the blood pouring from him!" Niceen shouted.
<BR><BR>
                      "I will not die so easy!" screamed Kinor. He shoved his right shoulder into
                      Vaelanea's soft belly, lifting her off of her feet and launching her into the
                      opposite wall with a loud crunch. She was hurt now, bad. Nothing too serious,
                      but she couldn't keep fighting like this. As she tried to regain her thoughts she
                      saw that Niceen and Tajitz and grabbed Lillaie and tied her arms behind her.
                      She was still out, but it was better that she not be able to do anything when she
                      awoke. Vaelanea looked back to see Kinor but all she saw was his leg
                      connecting with her chest. She grunted in pain. He kicked her over and over.
                      She was losing and she knew it, she would be knocked out unless she did
                      something. With a rush of adrenaline she screamed at Kinor. With his next
                      kick she grabbed his foot and smashed the blade of her axe into it, shattering
                      his ankle. Kinor screamed in pain as he limped backwards. Vaelanea stood,
                      breathing hard with adrenaline, her body covered with Kinor's blood, her
                      mouth oozing her own blood. She was grinning evilly, evil enough to scare
                      even the Shadow Striders standing by, watching. She took two steps forward
                      and with both hands swung one of her axes down into the middle of Kinor's
                      chest, tearing it open. Kinor fell to the ground chest down, his own blood
                      pouring from his mouth and wounds. He was about to die and he knew it. The
                      last thing Kinor saw was out of the corner of his eye, Vaelanea standing over
                      him, her axe dripping with his own blood, and the blood from hr mouth
                      dripping onto his face. Vaelanea kicked him as hard she could in the head,
                      ending his pathetic life. As she did Lillaie awoke.
<BR><BR>
                      "NOOOOOOOOO!!!!" she screamed. "You murdered my son! You will die
                      for this wench!"
<BR><BR>
                      Instead of answering Lillaie, Vaelanea knelt down and lifted Kinor's head so
                      his lifeless eyes were staring at Lillaie. Vaelanea looked up at Lillaie, blood
                      coming from her evil, grinning mouth, and proceeded to slice off Kinor's head
                      as her trophy. That look was the look that would haunt Lillaie's dreams
                      forever…
<BR><BR>
