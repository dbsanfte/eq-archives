                      “Mr. Moonblaze?…Mr. Moonblaze? Sir? Are you awake? It’s time for you
                      to get up, check out time ya know?” The maid attending the Lion’s Main inn
                      that morning was making her rounds, waking up the patrons who were to be
                      checked out that day. But we will take a look at one of these patrons...A
                      special one, an adventurer...This adventurers name is Tretery Moonblaze,
                      swordsman of the Emerald Warriors of Kelethin. He needed to get up this
                      morning, twas important that he made it to where he was going today on time.
                      So, waking up and putting on his clothes, he got his travelling equipment and
                      started out on his way, stopping at the front desk to pay his fee of 2 gold for
                      the nights stay. He made his way for the Karanas, for today, he was heading to
                      take his final trial of the Emerald Warriors, he was going not to the Karanas,
                      but beyond them, beyond Rivervale and Kithicor, he was headed to Nektulos
                      Forest, the unforgiving home forest of the evil Dark Elves. His goal was to slay
                      the front lines of their guards, to open up a path for the rest of the Emerald
                      Warriors to plow thru, to head for Neriak, the home city of the Dark Elves.
<BR><BR>
                      He began on his way, heading past the beautiful Surfall Glade and the beyond
                      Blackburrow, thru the hills of Qeynos, and thru the Karanas, thru the forests of
                      Kithicor, and finnaly, into the common lands. Finding one of the many inns in
                      the area, he placed his many pieces of armor on the ground, putting each piece
                      on, with the help of his squire, Malondar, he soon had all of his armor on,
                      magic surged thru his magical armor, crafted by the centaurs in the Karanas,
                      but still bearing the mark of the Emerald Warrior.
<BR><BR>
                      He waited at the inn for maybe 2 hours before the rest of his party had
                      arrived...his party was gathered together by many great elves of the area,
                      Golden Elves, Sylvian Elves, and half breeds. His party’s members
                      were….Tretery Moonblaze, Sylvian warrior of Kelethin, Tamakazura
                      Hoshino, master wizard of the golden lands, Fuin Silversky, ranger of Kelethin,
                      and Eeya Tigerlily, mystical bard of freeport, a half breed. Together they began
                      to talk over their strategy to systimaticaly eliminate one guard at a time, if that
                      was possible... They knew some of the watch patterns of the guards, the
                      figured they would eliminate them first, since they were sure that there
                      combined force was enough to overcome anything...mind you that’s just what
                      they thaught. They soon worked out their plan. They would take out the
                      guards near the birdge, they knew that was a heavily guarded place,
                      sometimes up to four guards at a time loomed there, and even, sometimes, the
                      feared Dragoon V’Tai was assigned for duty there, the knew to try and avoid
                      all dragoons, because a fight with them will surely end in a loss, or more.
<BR><BR>
                      Well, with their plan worked out, they moved into the forests of
                      Nektulos…Every step they took, the could feel more and more evil building up
                      around them, this forest was truly the most evil place on Norrath. As they
                      walked thru the dark, damp forest, they saw many evil sights, weak
                      necromancers, warriors, and shadow knights just watched as the experienced
                      elves of Faydwer walked by them, they did nothing, and the party of
                      adventurers paid no mind to those who they passed, except for one, one
                      wearing light leather armor, magic seemed to course thru him, he looked
                      powerful, almost frightening the ranger, he jumped back behind Tretery. The
                      rest of the party stood their ground, as the Dark Elf walked ever closer to the
                      them. As he came within maybe 3 yards of Tretery, he began to speak with a
                      deep, but yet whispery voice, “Turn back, this is not a place for your kind, or
                      for mine...but, if you want to continue on your quest, let me aid you, trust me”.
                      Tretery looked at the dark elf strangely, and then furiously, how could one of
                      these evil ones walk up to him and want to help, how could he be trusted?
                      Tretery said in response, “Why? Why would of you want to help us? I will not
                      trust you until you show just cause why we should.” The dark elf stood for a
                      second, then said, “fine, if it is just cause you want, then it is just cause you
                      get.” With a whisp of his hand, the dark elf suddenly appeared different, he
                      now looked as if he were a gnome, and he said, “now, now I have dropped
                      my disguise, I am a gnome, a gnome from Faydwer, Ak’Anon by town,
                      Faydwer by continent, Norrath by world.” After he changed, he seemed to
                      talk like a gnome, fast, and annoying, he must have been an enchanter, for they
                      are the only ones who can do such things. Tretery said in response, “well,
                      now, maybe we can trust you now, but how do we know you are not a dark
                      elf posing as a gnome?” The gnome looked puzzled, and quickly replied,
                      “what? You don’t trust me? Humph, how could you not, look at me, gnome,
                      gnome and more gnome, short and proud, smart and intelligent, now, trust me,
                      my name is Cislitil, Cislitil Bislitil, and I have been waiting for some time for a
                      group such as yours to come.” Tretery looked at the gnome and thaught that
                      he might as well trust it, so, he invited him to join the party, and so, they went
                      on, to the bridge, to eliminate the guards, and open a path for the Emerald
                      Warriors!
