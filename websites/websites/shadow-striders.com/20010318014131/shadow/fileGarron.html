								<B>History:</B> Garron is a Teir'Dal Wizard who hails from the dark city of Neriak.
                          Garron, like his fellow members of The Spurned, pratices one of the arts
                          held to be "false" in Neriak: those of the Wizards, Enchanters, and
                          Magicians. Garron's parents were both members of The Dead, that
                          society within Innoruuk's children that follows the "true" art of
                          Necromancy, and are more highly accepted than The Spurned, hence the
                          name, The Spurned. When his parents found out about his desire to
                          practice Wizardry, they were dumbfounded and speechless. After a long
                          silence, Garron's parents told him he could not train with The Spurned
                          and would instead be a Shadow Knight of the Dead, by his father's will.
                          What they did not know was that it was too late. The area around where
                          Garron was standing lit up brightly, and suddenly Garron was teleported
                          into the Tower of the Spurned. This has been his only home and the
                          Wizards' Guild his only family ever since. Garron later heard his parents
                          had not even bothered to look for him, had simply disowned him. He had
                          counted on that.<BR><BR>
                          Garron, with not even his family to love in his early years, is almost
                          completely devoid of emotion, even that one that rules most Dark Elves'
                          lives, Hate. Garron's mind is too rational to accept Emotion as package
                          and parcel with Reason, and because of this he almost completely
                          ignores his heart and follows the analytical side of his mind intead.
                          Garron's only true objective in life is to lear. Garron wishes to be a
                          Master of the Tower of the Spurned one day, but he knows that can be
                          achieved only by learning great wisdom and lore. Garron spends not as
                          much time in the Tower as some of his fellows, preferring to be out in the
                          worlds outside Neriak, discovering and absorbing information as fast and
                          thoroughly as he may. Garron's favorite quote is "Information is my
                          forte", and indeed it is. NOTHING is more important to Garron than
                          learning and knowledge. He would gladly sacrifice his life, if only he
                          could know the secrets of the world before he died. <BR><BR>
                          Garron, outwardly, is not cold to most, but not warm to any. He states
                          fact. He argues about controversial subjects. He is a true intellectual and
                          seeker of knowledge. He will never speak of his distant past, but speaks
                          much of the future. And NEVER will he admit that he feels anything. I
                          quote:<BR><BR>
                          "I feel no hate, nor love. Both are weaknesses, and that would make
                          YOU weak." <BR><BR>
                          As a final note, Garron, while travelling North Ro one night, came upon a
                          large gathering of people outside the tunnel connecting the Desert with
                          the Commonlands. Intrigued at this congregation, Garron investigated.
                          He soon found it was a battle of wills and words between the Shadow
                          Striders and the Wind Riders. After Lady Envy defeated a Druid in a
                          duel, Garron began to talk a little to the Dark Magi Malgorm, not really
                          with any intent to join, just out of curiosity. And the rest is history.
                          Garron has had a certain reverence for Malgorm since the very beginning.
                          And Malgorm has even hinted that Garron could become his apprentice
                          some day. Garron wishes this to happen and tries harder to please the
                          Dark Magi than any other Shadow Strider.<BR><BR>*note: Malgorm has since left the Shadow Striders, but Garron remains<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> This one worries me. His eyes are constantly moving with quiet passion, but his face remains cold. He could still be loyal to Malgorm...<BR><BR>
								<B>Envy's View:</B> It is sad to see a Tier'Dal without Hate. But Garron is talented, no doubts there.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> I've dealt with him before. He's like all the rest.<BR><BR>
