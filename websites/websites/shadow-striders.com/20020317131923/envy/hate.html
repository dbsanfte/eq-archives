<P><B>Hate.</B>
<P>In my days, I've seen many of my kin interpret in various ways what it truly means to serve Innoruuk, and to truly hate. I've seen many of them mistake it for rage. For mindless destruction. For vengeance, prejudice, and even, (Gods forbid) Love.
<P>The truth lies in utmost simplicity. To truly serve the dark father, one must have an affluent creativity, for hate is an art. Most believe the Teir'Dal are born with such talent, but this is not always the case. To a certain extent, most Teir'Dal serve Innoruuk's will, but true hate is born of our victims… mindlessly, involuntarily, beautifully and without hesitation.
<P>I cannot fully respect someone who lives only to kill, and does it with intent of serving the Will of Hate. Death, much like orgasm, is a release. Death is mercy. I do not serve a god of death, nor a god of mercy. Innoruuk is the God of Hate. Suffering causes hate. Therefore, by prolonging the life of my victims, I gain more for my cause. Those who try to tell me otherwise turn into pawns in my eyes, regardless of their "fighting prowess". Such a feeble concept of judgement by ability to kill is only to be pitied. They may hold weak life in their hands, but will never grasp the soul. This is failure.
<P>The arrogance of such people is both annoying and laughable… it's almost as if they do not realize how simple it is to return life to a body they defeat in physical battle. Nor do they realize how many are of their skill; they are not unique. That power is easy to attain. Like followers of Rallos Zek, these types live only for the victory of a fight… they surely cannot appreciate the subtler irony of preserving a life, only to force it to servitude. Much more can be gained by reducing the morale of a victim, removing his or her freedom, or worse. Then, not only do you hate, but so do they. So do their families. So do their friends. Control is complete.
<P>The lesser gods of darkness, I find, do well as tools for my God. The fear of Cazic-Thule is a power in itself, but not to be the goal. Many times have I used fear to dominate my prey, but more often than not such domination provokes resistance and a clash of wills. When it suits me, I deal with this by battle. Fear does not work on those able to physically kill me, I've noticed. My prey often underestimates my abilities this way… assuming that since they are "safe" from my scythe they have nothing to fear. I need not relay my delight in this.
<P>War and fear go hand in hand. With proof of fighting prowess, it is sometimes possible to accomplish my goals. Far too many confuse tactics of Rallos Zek with those of Innoruuk however. A victory in battle is small compared to devouring the light of one's soul. I enjoy the effects of war. The torn families. The bruised emotions… it leads to hate. As long as the line is defined, it has my respect.
<P>Bertoxxulous. In my early days, I considered him weakest of the servants to Hate. I was proven wrong. Lord Faileas has shown me the beauty of the dark disease, be it in the form of a flesh-eating plague, or the subtle madness that can dominate a brain… this god is almost always underestimated to his gain. However, I cannot conceive belief in the disease being the end instead of the means. Lord Faileas is an intelligent man, even compared to my own people… I believe he is salvageable.
<P>I'll not go into details on the other deities pretending to hold power. For the most part, they are pathetic, blind, and stupid. Servants to our servants.</P>
