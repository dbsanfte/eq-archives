<BR>“Keeping in touch with Norrath’s traveling heroes”
<BR><BR>
EDITOR’S NOTE: Dear readers, thank you for viewing The Wind Riders Trail, Volume 2. Following the success of volume 1 I had planned to continue this publication on a regular basis, but was met with resistance from several parties who objected to how they had been portrayed in the articles. Because the events following a special edition of our paper were so severe, I, your humble editor was put out of commission for an extensive period of time by a concentrated version of the infamous Threefold plague. I meekly apologize for my part in spreading this disease and ask for your prayers on the path to full recovery. Since the disappearance of one Faileas Imshee’Cro, I am pleased to say that my health has returned enough to present you with this second edition of The Wind Riders Trail. I hope to have a special editorial written as a follow-up, since it just wasn’t perfect by deadline. From the bards here in the Wind Riders, we hope you enjoy it and May the Four Winds Guide You!

<B>TEIR’DAL BARONESS ATTACKS KATTA</B> <I>- By Sirynn Windweaver</I>
<BR>If asked several weeks ago, a citizen of the lunar city Katta Castellum might say their greatest threat lie in the Coterie of the Eternal Night, a deadly vampyre aerie encroaching the city from nearby Tenebrous Mountains. No one expected an attack from a very different type of vampire, one who’s encounters with the Wind Riders have become the stuff of legend: Baroness Nauria D’Lurien. 
<BR><BR>
Few details about the baroness’ army can be obtained as Katta Castellum officials are still very secretive about this crisis. Understandably defensive with Norrathian newcomers who might be seduced into aiding their Sanctus Seru enemies, the city guards its critically injured leader Lcea Katta in particular. The Wind Rider team sent to assess damage and offer recovery aid was not able to visit her, but were reassured that she will survive.
<BR><BR>
While many argue that little could be done to prevent this devastating attack on our allies, some maintain that D’Lurien’s motives could have been foreseen and Katta defense reinforced appropriately. Wind Rider Sugan Imshee’Cro is one of these, who has recently taken it upon herself to prevent as many such attacks as possible by crusading against all vampire kind. 
<BR><BR>
“This is unforgivable,” Imshee’Cro commented on what her reaction to this situation would be, “but Nauria will survive only long enough to regret it. I’ll make sure of that.”
<BR><BR>
In charge of delivering any emergency supplies to Katta Castellum are Taneah and Elendur Extraordinaire.
<BR><BR>
<B>GENESIS WEAVER FEARED DEAD</B> <I>- By Shallah Brenh</I> 
<BR>There is no tragedy like the loss of a great leader to bring down an organization’s morale, or infuse it with the passion they need to avenge a martyr. The question is, with the disappearance and assumed demise of their beloved Genesis Weaver Jerhyn Darkrain, which will the Wind Riders’ reaction be?
<BR><BR>
Darkrain has had a long history of loyalty and bravery as a Rider, but an equally mysterious one. Never one to wear his heart on his sleeve, the Genesis Weaver often faced personal conflict and unknown adversaries alone. Evidence of his death include the blessed swords Swiftwind and Earthcaller, which Darkrain was never known to part with, and were found covered in his own blood. A dark rider seen in the Qeynos/Karanas area is suspected to have some relevance to his disappearance. 
<BR><BR>
Wind Rider intelligence is currently uncovering connections between this suspect and the Shadow Striders, as well as the suspect’s involvement in framing Darkrain for several crimes in the past. Eye witnesses say this dark rider bears a striking resemblance to Darkrain, and may be either an illusionist or an unknown blood relative.
<BR><BR>
Urging all members to get involved in the possible recovery of Jerhyn Darkrain, Wind Rider officials hope that someone discovers his diary for further insight into what they’re up against. Only this chilling excerpt could be quoted from a sighting of the book sometime before his disappearance: “I know there's little time left for me, though I've no idea how I know. The Shadows are coming for me, and I may as well have sent them an invitation.”
<BR><BR>
If he truly has passed on to Tunare’s realm, Darkrain was survived by his ex-wife Madie and assumed living sister, Genasis Darkrain. He was 110. In either case: Wherever you are Jerhyn, please be assured that we will uphold your honor.
<BR><BR>
<B>PoC PRISONER SIGHTINGS</b> <i>- By Luvdara Moonwisp</I>
<BR>Many unsettling things can be witnessed on Norrathian and Luclinite soil alike, but unexpected contact by those recently trapped in the Shadow Striders’ dreaded Plane of Corruption stirs up more suspicion and turmoil than usual. At first believed to be cut off from our reality entirely, several Wind Riders insist that the voice of priestess Celenne Goldleaf, aka Risper Goldenleaf, could be distinctly heard over the guild badges several weeks ago. Although no particular quotes could be taken from those that experienced this phenomenon, all are in agreeance that Goldenleaf was either talking to herself about her surroundings, or perhaps describing them in the meager hope that her friends could hear.
<BR><BR>
Also briefly sighted was the figure of Faileas Imshee’Cro, Lord of the Shadow Striders, exiting a cave in Tenebrous Mountains around the date of the attack on Katta Castellum. Investigated by his sister Sugan, the sighting was reported by a Katta citizen who believed the Shadow Lord had some involvement in the assault. While that was later dismissed, the cave was discovered to be the same Grimling cave that Sugan was rescued from after being captured by Coterie vampyres.
<BR><BR>
Some experts theorize that these phenomena could signify a weakening in the Plane’s stability, and could entail anything from its prospective reopening, to its self-destruction. Others argue that these sightings are more supernatural and conclude that the Plane has already broken down. Many Wind Riders agree that this cannot be the case, since no one wants to believe they’re seeing ghosts of the deceased. No conclusive evidence as of yet.
<BR><BR>
<B>SIX HAMMERS FELT BY WR FOES</B> <I>- By Vaughan Drakewing</I>
<BR>One fine afternoon the very foundations of the Wind Rider guild were rocked by a pair of barbarians. I don’t speak of the physical guild, and weapons were unnecessary for this, though the symbolism of hammers fits the scenario perfectly. Six in fact, that have been quite influential in WR affairs since the day Eldrikir Arban decided the Tribunal’s –and his– muscles needed to be flexed in passing judgment on Shadow Striders.
<BR><BR>
It all started when Genesis Fate Taneah began receiving disturbing letters and gifts from a secret admirer, who turned out to be the Shadow Strider known as Lexior Deraven. This harassment paramounted with Taneah’s kidnapping. When Deraven returned a near fatally wounded Taneah to Misty Thicket, he was taken into custody and later severely punished by Arban without consultation of Wind Rider authorities. This event, which was overseen by legendary Heyokah Ursi Horribili, was extremely controversial because of Deraven’s decision to return Taneah himself, his young age, and the severity of his punishment.
<BR><BR>
Since that incident, the Tribunal’s power has been felt through Horribili in at least one other instance. When it became apparent that Neriak noble and Black Market dealer Sylaena D’Scorpio had somehow gained control of twin children Tzan and Melenau Silverheart, she wasn’t about to let it go unquestioned. Soon after a mysterious confrontation between D’Scorpio and Horribili, and then Arban as well, the children were returned to the Wind Rider guildhall and the waiting arms of their guardian, Willoewind Gypsyrose. Who says happy endings don’t happen?
<BR><BR>
While the lines of jurisdiction between Wind Rider duty and the Tribunal’s universal justice may be occasionally debated, the two things both doctrines agree upon is the importance of upholding the innocent, and staying out of Mrs. Toepopal’s way.
<BR><BR>
<B>MOURNING MOTHER CAUGHT IN CROSSFIRE</B> <I>- By Willoewind Gypsyrose</i>
<BR>While visiting the grave of her deceased son Fentaur Arkenday, Qeynos local Kassidy Arkenday was taken hostage and eventually slain by a Teir’Dal assassin. The assassin had tried to escape Rivervale patrols and spotted the woman among the tombstones of the Wind Rider compound’s graveyard. Placing a blade to her throat and slowing backing his way to the Wall of Cetelt, the assassin was soon surrounded by camouflaged druids and rangers. 
<BR><BR>
One of the rangers gained a clear shot at the assassin and took it, knowing that if he’d made it to Runnyeye with his hostage, the chance of the hostage’s survival was miniscule. While his aim was true, the Teir’Dal’s immense hatred kept him alive long enough to steal Kassidy Arkenday’s life, without hope of resurrection.
<BR><BR>
After the monk Fentaur Arkenday died in service during a Wind Rider mission on Kunark several years ago, his mother had been supported by the guild and made her journey from Qeynos to Misty Thicket often. Her funeral procession commenced last Sunday in Misty Thicket, where Kassidy Arkenday now rests in peace beside her brave son.
<BR><BR>
<B>ALLIANCE OF LIGHT SEEKS JUSTICE</B> <I>- By Sanion Arkenday</I>
<BR>Thought destroyed by infamous Shadow Strider Magi Claddagh Ven’Lovelorn, the Alliance of Light’s officer Sir Dardras Draganclaw is now believed by many to be alive. Seeking justice for the attempt on the paladin’s life, the Alliance is encouraging an open bounty on Ven’Lovelorn, with rumors of great treasure as reward for capturing her alive. Flyers announcing this hunt have been posted all over Norrath. As well as describing her crimes, the messages also detail how dangerous the suspect is. Great care should be taken by any party interested in capturing this criminal.
<BR><BR>
<B>INSANE DRUID ARGUES WITH MIRROR AND LOSES, TURNS TO WOOD ELF HOTTIE FOR COMFORT</B> <I>- By Thryn Taciturn</I>
<BR>While most of the Wind Riders know better than to question anything Exodus Crusader Querus Allighari does, there comes a time when the subconscious need for explanation overwhelms the innate fear of Q’s strangeness. One such rare occurrence took place in the Wind Rider guildhall recently, where Allighari was allegedly discovered by Taneah losing a fistfight with his own reflection. Evidence to confirm this was offered by the upset housekeeper Mrs. Toepopal, which included shards of an expensive mirror as well as Querus’ own blood, apparently “dripping all over a perfectly clean floor, ayup”. 
<BR><BR>
While we can’t confirm or deny the ayup, witnesses tend to otherwise agree with Mrs. Toepopal.
<BR><BR>
Instead of immediately confessing his unquestioned insanity, Allighari just babbled excuses and was soon found to be housing a strange invisible wood elf female, who has since become known as simply “Miryana”. As Allighari’s luck would have it, his ex-wife Calris happened in just as Miryana was revealed by the ever alert Aeluminadria, and assumed the worst. And who wouldn’t, honestly?
<BR><BR>
While most are satisfied today with Miryana and Querus’ denial of any covert relations, this reporter still suspects conspiracy, for conspiracy’s sake. We can’t have little wood elf hotties without having conspiracy somewhere, and I’m sure no one wants to get rid of little wood elf hotties.
