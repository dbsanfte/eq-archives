								<B>History:</B>
I, Talisson BoneDancer, do tell you now of the story of my family and the trials of mine, and my brother Veederann's life. I tell in hopes to find out more information for our hunt, and also to possibly be aided in this when the time is right.
<BR><BR>
I was born Talisson BoneDancer the oldest son of Lycaster, my father and Mercress, my mother. My father was a powerful Necromancer, but practiced in secrect most of what he knew, for he knew that of even the Necromancer guild would shun him and he would have to leave the city of Ak 'Anon forever. His wife, Mercress, was a wizard, and very proficient in her arts as well.
<BR><BR>
Now, being a Necromancer, my father held no particular malice toward the Dark Elves, or at least those that were civil. He would on occasion transact business with them deep in steamfont so as not to arise the wonderments and anger of the guards around the area. One day when my brother and I were young, my father had some of his business to transact with a Dark Elf, and was about to journey our to the land and do so. Then suddenly he stopped and  asked my mother to come with him. He usually never did so, but there had been the occasion when he had wanted her along for support and back up in case things went awry.
<BR><BR>
That was the last that I saw of my mother.
<BR><BR>
When my father came back he was a wreck. I questioned him as to what was wrong but to no avail, he would not answer, he just continued to rifle through his desk screaming "Where is it? where is it? It is going to be ok, I just have to find it!"
<BR><BR>
then he said the words that put ice into my blood forever. "I can make you better My Mercress, I will bring you back. The dead are not as dead they think!"
<BR><BR>
I was stunned. Had I heard my father right? My mother was dead, but not only that he was going to bring her back from the dead. I knew that my father was powerful but I did not know how powerful.
<BR><BR>
Suddenly he stood up, and shouted. "Ah-hah!" I have it! I have you my sweet, you will be in my arms again!" And with that wrinkled piace of paper, he waved his arms and disappeared, making the traditional popping sound associated with a gate.
<BR><BR>
That was the last I saw of him, but not the last I heard about him. In the space of a day, I seemed to have lost the only stability in my life. My family, all exept for my younger brother were dead.
<BR><BR>
I heard later from the tales of travelers and people who claimed to be there what happened. I have spent almost the entire family fortune paying for information. I spent the rest paying for mine and my brother's training, following in my father footsteps in the art of necromancy.
<BR><BR>
I heard from the people I payed our family fortune to that when my father had gone to conduct business, he was met by the dark elf he was expecting. My father had been preparing bone tunics, and also certain necro components that this Elf wanted to purchase, all worth quite a bit of money. He had the items and was willing to make the trade, but he wanted to see the money first. when he asked this, the elf made a motion with his hand ove rhis shoulder, saying " I should think that you will find this more worthwhile." and as he stood there grinning, five Troll Shadow Knights appeared holding Mercress. She had been hiding in the rocks a little way away and above them. Now she was in the grip of these mercenaries, putting my father at a disadvantage.
<BR><BR>
"Now," Said the elf, " you will give me the items or they will rip her apart." He grinned. "Please do feel free to resist, as I would love to see what makes little gnomes tick!"
<BR><BR>
My father laid the items on the ground and backed slowly away from them. "Take them! You will not get a fight from me! Just give me my wife!"
<BR><BR>
the Dark Elf went and picked up the things my father had left him and examined them closely. "Yes, very nice, gnome! you do good work! but since I cannot have the two of you coming after me when I am gone..." He turned and motioned to the Trolls behind him. The Largest of them, GumDrup, smiled with glee, reached down between the two trolls holding my mother and grabbed the top of her head. "NO!!" my father and mother screamed at the same time, Lycaster already in the throes of a spell to try to stop Dumdrup. With on hard yank the troll had pulled her head clean off. Her eyes were still looking at Lycaster then, pleading for help and realese from these fiends. That is how they stayed, locked in sadness, terror and pleading. "NO!NO!NO!NO!NO!" He screamed and completed the spell he had started. A green haze appeared around GumDrup and he started to sweat. His skin started to blister and peel. Lycaster concentrated and cast again, this time drawing a cloud of darkness over the
troll. Grumdrup lurched and backed away from Mercress's corpse, and grabbed his head. "Gumdrup BURN!!" He shouted and fell to his knees. Lycaster cast one more time, causing the flesh of the stinky troll to start to explode in tiny pocks of greenish steam. "NO! Grumdrup BURN!" he screamed in pain and fell to the ground a steaming lifeless hulk.
<BR><BR>
"Very good," The dark elf said, "but that was just one. there are twenty more. When you are ready, come to Neriak, we will be waiting! oh, and be sure to say hello to my Brother, D'vinn B'Dynn!"
<BR><BR>
Lycaster sobbed in grief. His wife, his beautifull wife of two hundred fifty years was dead. Then, a look crossed his face. He had been studying a way to bring people back, a resurrection, but something that a Necromancer could perform. He had heard it called Lych before, but he was not sure. Everything he had heard of lych was not this.
<BR><BR>
Quickly he went back to his home, perhaps for the last time, and searched frantically for his notes. If he could just preserve her body until he had the right components.... He hunted frantically knowing that time was of the essence. "Ah-hah!" she shouted and started to mumble again as he found what he was looking for. He turned and cast quickly so he could get back to his wife before anyone else could. Just as her started to cast, he saw his sons, Talisson and Veederann siting there in fear and disbelief as they watched their father dissapear. "I will return soon my sons," he thought to himself, " I will return with your mother."
<BR><BR>
His first stop was Crushbone, where D'vinn currently resided with Emporer crush, serving as an Ambassador there. Once he got there he Summoned a Skeleton to him for service. He quickly rounded up the Ambassador and His new pet held him fast. "Ambassador, I have a message for you," he said quietly. "Your brother says hello."
<BR><BR>
The Ambassador grinned. "D'bianz? What has he been up to? no good I suspect."
<BR><BR>
"Where can I find him?" Lycaster snarled and raised his hands and began to chant. "If I cannot ask you, then I will ask your corpse> I am sure you are familiar with the old addage 'Dead men tell no lies.' Well, I have found it to be true, again and again."
<BR><BR>
The Ambassador's eyes widened with fear. "He'll not be pleased that you are looking for him. He is at the ruins of Neriak, with his Mercenaries. You should watch yourself, he is not one to be trifled with."
<BR><BR>
"Let me deal with that" Lycaster said, and stepped back. Suddenly he was gone again in a spell that The Ambassador was not expecting. His wife had taught him how to Teleport, but He had never used it, or had the ability to do so. But a driven man can do anything, and he did. He cast the spell that had been held so secret by the wizards and teleported himself into the Nektulos forest, just outside of the Dark elf city of Neriak.
<BR><BR>
Once he was able to see again from the blinding sparkles of the spell he saw the fog and darkness around him. He heard behind him a pounding on the ground almost as if someone was dropping stones closer and closer to him. He quickly gathered the shadows in around him and then turned to look. Just in time, for he had to jump out of the way of a Stone Golem guard patrolling the area. He stood quite still waiting for the rock giant to pass.
<BR><BR>
Once the Golem was out of the way he started to cast again, this time in search for the dead. "Where there are ruins there are usually dead." He thought to himself, and quickly found the direction he needed to go. He made sure that nothing could see him again and started across the damp landscape. Within minutes he heard the harsh voices of trolls and their raucous laughter. He could not make out what they were saying but that did not matter. Soon they would be dead, and he could take their hearts for some of the components for his spell. Soon He would have his wife back. Soon.
<BR><BR>
He crept up on the hill overlooking the ruins. There down next to the ruins sat twenty trolls some dressed in full bronze, quite dirty and not taken care of, and some just in whatever they could patch together. The one that stood out the most was the Dark elf that D'vinn had given a name to: D'bianz B'Dynn.
<BR><BR>
He stood up. Lycaster had never been one to run away from danger or to flee in the face of bad odds. He clapped his hands together as he cast the spell to summon a pet. The sound of the gnome in the middle of the spell and the laughter of the new skeleton standing next to him startled the trolls into a surpised battle stance. D'bianz, did not rise but turned to see what was going on. Then he laughed. "Ah, my little gnome-meat! You have come after all!" He shouted and laughed. " I take it that you wanted to be the appetizer for my trolls!" And with that the trolls rushed toward where he stood.
<BR><BR>
Suddenly the skeleton that he had summoned rushed toward them. He had a few tricks up his sleeve that they were not counting on. He had cast the summon spell by using the dreaded War Bones, and in doing so called up a demon inside so powerful that he could barely control it himself.  The skeleton found his first target and started to maul the troll. Nost of the rest of the trolls gathered around seeing their comrade-at-arms getting so severely and quickly beaten, and started to help. The rest continued to run towards Lycaster, who was continuing to cast spell after spell. The closest troll suddenly flashed white with light and then his skin turned dark. As he stood in place screaming, the trolls right behind him ran into him with their weapons, not seeing that he had stopped, or more correctly had been stopped. Lycaster then reached out again and his hands glowed green. A cloud appeared over the rest of the trolls, Making them more afraid of the little gnome than anything in t!
heir lives. They turned and ran, leaving their skewered friend behind.
<BR><BR>
One of the trolls that had been beating on the skeleton then came after Lycaster. "Gudbonz gon ta krunch da Nafu!!" he said referring to the little gnome He took his morning star and made a swipe faster than Lycaster was expecting. It caught him on the side of the arm, crushing the shoulder, and making it almost impossible to cast, not only from the pain, but he could barely move the arm. Lycaster concentrated harder and then reached out again, but this time to cast a spell on himself. Using another set of War Bones, he made himself into a skeleton, standing the same height as the troll. But Gudbonz was not deterred. He swung again. Lycaster the skeleton caught the swing with some ease, and parried it, glancing off of the bony arm that he now had. He reached out and cast again, this time using the shadows to move himself away from the troll and close to D'bianz.
<BR><BR>
D'bianz had been expecting this, in fact he had been waiting for it. He pulled out a sword that glowed a magical blood red hue, and before Lycaster's form was complete, he put the blade into the middle of it. Lycaster could not stop it. I could not even scream. As he finished forming from the spell, the looked down. Deep within his stomach was buried this magical blade. There was no blood, at least not yet. He looked behind him and saw the end of the blade sticking out behind him. D'bianz grinned. "You thought you were going to win, didn't you? Just because you have all the magic of life and death, you thought you could win." He spat on the ground. "Now, mensch, you cannot even save yourself. You cannot even prevent your own death!" and with that he twisted the blade in Lycaster. "Pray gnome! Pray to your God! Call upon me the powers to strike me down!"
<BR><BR>
Lycaster grinned, painfully. D'bianz had given him the idea, he had spoken his own death. Not by his hands, but by the hands of his sons, Talisson and Veederann. "I call upon Bertoxxulous, my lord and master! I call upon thee to see my pain and to revel in it!" He shouted the words as blood dribbled from his mouth. D'bianz stood there stunned. He had never heard such a death before. Lycaster continued "I call upon you, my Lord to revel in my pain, but not my death! For the sake of your servant, let my death instead be felt and seen by my sons! Make them yours! I give you my sons, Bertoxxulous! I give you my sons! Let them avenge me, let them be your vengeance!" D'bianz blinked. Who did this gnome think he was? He twisted the blade again wrenching the gnome's body around causing more pain. "You fool!" He spat at Lycaster, " do you really think that you will be heard?" He laughed shortly, and then yanked the sword upward, slicing Lycaster in two. He then handed the sword to one !
of the trolls that had come up behind him, who began immediately licking the blade clean. "Even in death you are small and pitiful." D'bianz spat on the corpse, and then stalked away.
<BR><BR>
Little did he know that his call had been heard by Bertoxxulous himself, who did just as he was bid to do, not for the gnomes sake, but for the pain that it would cause. The pain of inflicting two necromancers upon the world that were out for vengeance would be most delightful.
<BR><BR>
Both Talisson and Veederann screamed at the same time. The pain that they felt was immense, beuond anything that they had experienced in their short lives. "What is this?!?!?!?" Talisson screamed at  no one in particular. Then He saw, and he could see that his brother saw too. He saw the sword in his father and in the hands of the Dark elf. He saw the twist, and then felt it in his own gut and body as D'bianz pulled the sword through his father. "I swear," gasped Talisson as he wretched from the pain, " I swear that I shall not rest or die dead until my father is avenged!"
<BR><BR>
Then the words that changed the lives of many forever were heard. "Good, My Son, good!" The words were heard just in his ears, and Talisson froze in place. He just knew who it was, there had been no one to tell him. It was the voice of his God, Bertoxxulous.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> I've known this one for some time. An ambitious necromancer that claims Bertoxxulous as his father and former leader of the Scourge. I respect his power, but question his "lineage."<BR><BR>
								<B>Envy's View:</B> Have to respect any gnome capable of the things he is capable of.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> This gnome will meet a wretched end one day. Anyone one foolish enough to play with Bertoxxulous will.<BR><BR>
