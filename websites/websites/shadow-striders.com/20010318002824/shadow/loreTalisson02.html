                      Today My Lord called me to chastise the undead at the place known as
                      Chessboard. He spoke of their foolishness in trying to play a mortal game
                      known as "chess" and told me that I was to show them the error of their ways,
                      but also that I was to learn a valuable lesson while I was there.
<BR><BR>
                      I made haste to this place from Lesser Faydark, and found as I entered the
                      Dwarven lands of Butcher Block that there was a nasty little dwarf standing
                      there by then name of Gand Truelink. This dwarf is a merchant in the area, but
                      he has taken it upon himself to pursue all those that he deems unworthy to
                      cross his lands. Luckily, my Lord had instructed me to travel in the darkness of
                      the shadows, and so he did not see me as I crossed into his lands. Someday
                      dear Gand, you will see the error of YOUR ways, if I have to drag you kicking
                      and screaming by the scruff of your beard to the pits of hell to do so.
<BR><BR>
                      As I approached chessboard, my head and heart started to pound, not as it
                      normally does when going to battle for my Lord, but with a strange rythim the
                      eminated from the area. I calmed myself enough to summon my pet to my side,
                      for I knew that this would not be an easy task that I had ahead of me.
<BR><BR>
                      Finally, I struck. The undead were numerous and I was not sure that I would
                      prevail. I cast spell after spell, channeling all my energies and mana into it,
                      stiking them down so that the only thing that would cover the area would be
                      stone and bones. I was doing well, and was feeling a little proud that I was
                      doing such a good job, that my task given to me by my Lord was almost
                      complete. But as with all there is always a surpise in store. 
<BR><BR>
                      The undead king appeared. I was not prepared for this! He towered over me,
                      like a monument to the dead standing there and mocking my presence. How
                      dare he! I am not some poor sap to be mocked, I am Talisson, I am a Son of
                      Bertoxxulous! But... wisdom spoke to me and told me that I should recuit the
                      mensch around me and harness their strength for my own purposes. 
<BR><BR>
                      I went over to them and explained that I needed to complete this task and they
                      understood. One among them, a Dwarf by the name of Geirmund was more
                      than willing in words to get rid of the beast, but not by his hand. the fool! Does
                      he not see, that all of use together could take the undead king down and
                      reduce it to nothing more than bone chips? 
<BR><BR>
                      I was tired from my previous battles though, and so I aksed for a moment to
                      gather myself together, and to meditate. Several others needed to do the same,
                      to put themselve into the state of mind it would take in order to overcome this
                      obstacle. There was a fellow necromancer there, willing to help, but I am not
                      sure that he has spoken with out Lord in a while, as he did not appear to be as
                      prosperous. But who am I to judge a brother in the arts? He was willing to
                      help complete the task set forth by our Lord, and that was enough.
<BR><BR>
                      Finally I was ready. I stood up, and looked around, approving of the power
                      that I had accumulated with just a few words. Ahh, the power of man, the
                      power of the arm and sword... Nothing compared to the power that my Lord
                      grants me. I made sure that everyone was ready, and got a general respons of
                      yes... Yes! I can complete the task given me!
<BR><BR>
                      I race off with my pet in tow and channel a bolt of energy so furious as to
                      speak of my intentions of sending this creatur to another realm with a single
                      blow. It turned to me.... and it laughed! It LAUGHED at me!!! how dare it!
                      My anger and fury reached new bounds as I stretch forth my hand to
                      command my pet to stike it down as I channeled more energy and mana into
                      my spells and through my body than in any of the previous battles here, trying
                      to ensure my success. Out of a corner of my eye, I noticed my fellow
                      Necromancer doing the same. I cast again and again striking the king with
                      everything I had. Then, I looked closer... WHERE IS MY BACKUP????
                      Where are those that were to lend their arms and backs to send this thing to
                      another realm? I called over my shoulder, but there was not response. I
                      shouted louder, but all I got was the laughter of the king, telling me what a fool
                      I was for thinking that I could defeat it.
<BR><BR>
                      Then the unthinkable happened. My pet was struck down in a harsh blow by
                      the King and suddenly it was upon me! Already weakened from the spells it
                      had cast, I was unable to run or defend myself from the onslaught. Geirmund!!!
                      your Dwarven Head will be served to my Lord! Just before I am to meet my
                      Lord Bertoxxulous in person, I hear His voice telling me, "My son, you have
                      done well, but you are not done yet. I have further tasks for you, and I need
                      you to stay. But you need to be punished for failures. You will die here, be
                      assured, and I will allow you the pleasure of your death. But, you will go back
                      to a place of My choosing, to try again."
<BR><BR>
                      "My Lord!", I cried as I was hit again and again my the merciless hand of the
                      undead king. Then as My lord said I was slain, by the very hand - the bones
                      that I had come to claim had claimed me instead.
<BR><BR>
                      I found myself in the passageway to the dwarven lands again standing there
                      without anything that my lord had provided me. GEIRMUND!!!! The pain that
                      I shall enjoy giving you shall be mintue compared to the pain that my Lord shall
                      give you when I present your SOUL to him!
