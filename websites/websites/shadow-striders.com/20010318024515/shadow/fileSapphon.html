								<B>History:</B> As a long-time student in the arts of Enchanting in Erudin, Sapphon was
                          hailed as one of the
                          brightest snd most promising students in the new crop of "Craft
                          Keepers". Sapphon had thought
                          he was only as good as any other student, but his superiors were
                          convinced he was something
                          special. Sapphon was given much attention by the best tutors the City of
                          High Men had to offer,
                          and he and his family were dined on fine food and drink courtesy of the
                          Tower of the Craft
                          Keepers. Few had a life as good as Sapphon's teenage life, and yet all
                          that he wanted was to get
                          away from it. Strangely, he would rather have been a normal, everyday
                          student than one held in
                          such high esteem and honor. "There is nothing I can do that anybody else
                          cannot." he would
                          always protest. However, it seemed that no one would listen to him, not
                          his parents, not his
                          teachers, not even his friends, who held him in awe and reverence. 
<BR><BR>
                          Sapphon was studying one night, preparing for a ritual sorcery to be held
                          tomorrow in which
                          he was to be the lead student and assistant to the Instructorum (as
                          always). He heard a rap on his
                          door, three quick taps. He looked over at the Gnomish cuckoo clock on
                          the wall. It was almost
                          2 in the morning! Who on earth would be disturbing him at 2 in the
                          morning!? Quite annoyed and
                          not quite understanding, Sapphon went to the door of his tiny candlelit
                          study and opened it wide. 
                          No one was there. It was obvious someone was playing a trick on him.
                          But what was this? he
                          was being lifted into the air and pushed back farther into the room! He
                          could see nothing yet he
                          was being lifted by his shirt by strong hands... invisible hands. He was put
                          down near his desk, and
                          the door was shut and locked. Sapphon was too scared to think or cry
                          out, much less attack the
                          invisible intruder, even though the study was tiny and there were only so
                          many places he could be. 
                          Suddenly, the problem solved itself. Standing before him, seemingly out
                          of nowhere, was a short
                          (to an Erudite) elven figure with strange white hair. And.. blue skin? It
                          took Sapphon a moment to
                          remember the tales he had heard of evil elves that lived underground in a
                          city far away on Antonica
                          that were hateful towards all and who killed the goodly elves and humans
                          because of their hatred
                          for them. Sapphon recognized that the white hair and dark skin of this Elf
                          would make him fit the
                          description of a Dark Elf perfectly. Sapphon managed to mutter,
                          "Wh-wh..y have.." before the
                          wicked elf clamped a hand over the High man's mouth. Sapphon's eyes
                          went wider than he would
                          have thought possible, had he been able to look in a mirror. The Dark Elf
                          was going to kill him. 
                          Murder him in the night and leave his bloody corpse where no one would
                          ever find it. 
<BR><BR>
                          But the wicked elf drew no weapon, and indeed he seemed not to carry
                          any. He spoke in a
                          harsh whisper characteristic of all Dark Elves, and he said these words:
                          "Sapphon, student
                          Enchanter, I presume? Don't try to answer, I don't have to presume, I
                          already know I'm right. 
                          Just sit back, relax, don't be so frightened, and don't make too much
                          noise." And with that the elf
                          removed his hand from Sapphon's face. Sapphon began to mutter again,
                          "Who..." The Dark Elf
                          interrupted him, "My name and who I am is not important. As you can
                          see, I am Teir'Dal, what
                          the stories and myths of your language call Night Elves. And that's all we
                          are is stories and myths
                          in this part of Norrath. I too practice the magical arts, as you do. And
                          most importantly, I am not
                          here to hurt you or kill you. I am here to offer you something." 
                          "Offer me, some-thing?" Sapphon stammered. 
                          "Yes, offer you something. I am here to offer you a chance. I know you
                          are eager to get out of
                          here, and end this life you currently live. Dont ask how I know, I just do.
                          Anyway, if you tire of
                          your current lot as the next promising wage mage for the City of Erudin,
                          then I offer you a chance
                          for something better, something more...meaningful. I offer you
                          membership in the Shadow
                          Striders. I can take you away, out of here, out of Erudin, off the
                          continent if you want. I can
                          begin you a new life, as one of the proud, one of the Striders. You can
                          travel, see the world, visit
                          Kelethin or Ak'Anon (although don't expect me to go with you THOSE
                          places), where that nice
                          clock you have was made. Tell me, have you ever seen a gnome? No?
                          That's what I thought. 
                          Would you like to?" 
                          "Yes...yes. I would like to see a gnome, I think..! But why do you offer
                          me this choice, if you can
                          call it that, with all these benefits? What do YOU get out of it?" 
                          "I offer you this choice because the Shadow Striders need new blood,
                          and you are one of the
                          most talented Enchanters in Erudin. We do not kidnap people, we only
                          take them willingly into
                          our ranks, so you, with your current dissatisfaction in life, were a perfect
                          choice." What Garron
                          did not mention was that dissatisfaction could lead to evil, which was, of
                          course, his true goal. 
                          "OK," Sapphon answered with hardly a thought about his teachers,
                          parents, or even his friends,
                          "I'll go with you!" 
                          Garron laughed inside his mind. This was going to be a difficult one... 
                          "By the way, now that you've agreed, my name is Garron. Pleased to
                          meet you." 
                          Sapphon watched as the elf cast an invisibility spell on himself, and heard
                          his voice say "Lead the
                          way to the docks, I'll follow you invisibly. The sentinels don't exactly
                          appreciate the horror stories
                          they tell their children coming true...." 
                          Sapphon gathered some small items, some platinum pieces, and closed
                          his door for the last time.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> Typical for an Erudite, his ego sometimes gets the best of him. But I have no
								trouble seeing his talent. He makes a better spy than many rogues I know.<BR><BR>
								<B>Envy's View:</B> I believe Sapphon's arrogance is second only to my own. He's been of great service to
								me though. How it must be fun to choose your face for the day... wouldn't I know?<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> Mere human? What did you call me?! How rude!<BR><BR>
