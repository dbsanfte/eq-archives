<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Rooks has always had a sour tase in his mouth as far as the dark
elven race was concerned. Perhaps it was better stated that he did not agree with their
society, for one of his dear friends and guild mates, Smokeyes, was of dark elven blood.
She, however, had a spark of kindness and a joyous spirit not associated with the rest of
the dark elven collective. The incident in his youth only further deepened his hatred for
the focus on death and hate held by the dark elves. He has been part of several missions
to rid the world of the Necromatic arts and the embasitors of the dark elven people who
conspire with the orcs of the surface world. Then, one fateful day would change his life
forever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the help of his most learned magic weilding friends, Rooksarii
discovered that there was a tiny inscription upon the medalion written in Elder Dragon
that read simply&quot; Talonbane&quot;. With this, Rooks felt it was as good a name as any
to take, it was the closest thing he had to a proper surname from his parents. So the
world would soon come to know Rooksarii Talonbane, son of Erollisi Marr and of the city of
Freeport, and it would seem, no one else. With his acceptance into the Watchkeepers,
Rooksarii was not only united with his old friend Drubone, but he found a family of like
hearted people willing to give him a family that he had never really known before. Thus
Rooksarii may have in a way fufilled his quest, he had found his family, a purpose and a
home. However, life would get a lot more difficult once he discovered the truth of his
existance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guild held a seige on the gates of Mistmoore castle which
included Rooks. A great deal of the guild members were involved in this seige, which began
in the Estate of Unrest. There were reports that the number of undead within the estate
was quickly rising. The guild decided to play its part in the defence of the land by
investigating the matter. While in Unrest, the members of the party discovered that the
rise in the infestation of tormented souls within the fallen mansion was the work of the
Necromencers of Mistmoore castle. Rooksarii and Berren served as the scouts. Berren had
taken part in many missions to break down the integrity of the castle&#146;s defenses and
thus knew the area well. Rooks was chosen due to his abilety and willingness to sneak into
the perimiter unnoticed, gathering useful tactical information on the possitioning of
sentrys. The two fought off many of the enterances lower ranking gaurds, enabling the two
of them to gather all that was needed for a low end assault on the complex. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, the plans were laid and all blades were sharpened.
With the help of Crispinskyhawke, Genneth, Berren, Larch, Jae, Sparrow, Cyg, adn of
course, Rooks, many of the ranks of the Mistmoore gaurds fell, and the group discovered
that the Necromatic forces within the castle&#146;s walls were planning a full out
invasion of all the cities of Fadwyer.</p>
