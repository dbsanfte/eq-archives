While it is not strictly required to stay in character at all times, we do require that you have a history for your character as well as a good idea of how that character would react in a given situation. </b></FONT>
<p><FONT face=Arial><b>2.
        To the extent that it is possible, Watchkeepers shall aid
        other members in their endeavors. This may mean helping
        to retrieve their corpse from the depths of a dungeon or
        gathering to defeat a foul beast. Guildmembers will offer
        these services outside of our guild to our allies,
        friends and strangers. </b></FONT></p>

      ><b>3. Your character
        must have attained their 5th rank in training before they
        may apply. Each character will be required to complete
        quests and provide a written history for their character
        before the initiation process is completed. </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"
          
      ><b>4. Your character
        will start out in the guild as an initiate under a
        probationary period. During this time you should try to
        make an effort to get to know your fellow Guild members
        better. You will wear the guild title during this period,
        but will not considered a full-fledged general member
        until the official induction ceremony takes place during
        a regular guild meeting. Once a general member, you will
        gain voting rights as well as the right to sponsor
        applicants to the guild. </b></font></p>

        that you add a character description to your character in
        game by changing your camera view F9 key and clicking on
        yourself and adding the description to the black box that
        pops up with the shown inventory. All Guild members must
        provide a background story for themselves…. a
        history of who they are and perhaps how they came to be
        with WatchKeepers. Initiates must provide this history
        before becoming full members. </b></font></p>
