        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe
        watched his father, Talious GoldHawke, walk the walls of
        the Fort. &#147;How strong he is,&#148; Khlebe thought to
        himself, &#147;Nothing can touch him, and I know they
        have tried.&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe&#146;s
        father was a paladin of the Elven noble house of
        GoldHawke. Once the Family were the rulers of the large
        forests, but, like many in his family, love was the
        strongest factor in his life. He had often told Khlebe,
        &#147;Love is beyond all, beyond person, beyond even race.&#148;
        This was the philosophy that had been the downfall of his
        family. His sister, Amellion, was the first. After her
        graduation from bardic college she had fallen in love
        with a barbarian. She told her father that she cared not
        about his race; that his heart was pure. After her
        wedding to the man, she went to live with him on the
        plains, which had allowed the family to save some face.
        She had never liked being a noble. She was sad about
        leaving her family behind, but her love for her new
        family and friends was strong. House GoldHawke had yet to
        see the hard times that were ahead. With the death of
        Talious&#146;s father, Quyinus, the family&#146;s hold on
        everything started to fall. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">While
        defending an elven village, Talious and his company of
        elven fighters had destroyed a gnoll onslaught that was
        also being hunted by a group of humans. After the battle
        as he was healing the injured, he met Alderia, the female
        cleric who was healing the humans. Just as his sword had
        pierced the armor and bodies of the Gnolls so did the
        beauty of the human cleric pierce his heart. He would
        have done anything for this woman no matter the cost. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Soon the
        lovers where wed. The noble houses of the Elves would not
        stand for the thinning of their blood, but the GoldHawkes
        had defended their homes too many times to just outcast
        them. So they did the next best thing. They took several
        families that had brought shame to the nobles and had
        them build a fort near the plains. &#147;To protect all
        and show the power of the Elves&#148; they were all told.
        Each of them knew why they had truly been sent there, but
        few cared; it was much better than their alternative. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Talious
        had found it fitting that he had chosen the plain.
        Knowing that both sides of the battle would be more at
        ease if he choose the exact location, he choose a place
        not too far from his sister, feeling it only fitting as
        he had done the exact thing he had chastised her for. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">While at
        the fort, the couple was blessed with a child. When the
        child was born, the elven cleric who helped with the
        birth noticed a birthmark. The birthmark was in the
        location the child would have normally had the house
        tattoo of the golden sparrow placed. The mark was an oak
        leaf on top of a storm cloud. The people at the fort took
        it as a sign that the gods had not agreed with the
        thoughts of the Elves who had banished them to the plains
        for betraying their blood. They believed it showed that
        the gods as well believed in love over everything. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">As the
        child, Khlebe, grew he was not allowed to learn the
        combative ways of his parents. Each of them knew the
        storm cloud and sign of the oak was the sign of the
        druids. His parents taught him the ways of the gods. Then
        one day when visiting his aunt, he met his cousin
        Crispinskyhawke. At first the younger Khlebe did not like
        his cousin. Khlebe believed his cousin to be too serious
        and too tall. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">While the
        children where playing Khlebe had dared Crispin to climb
        a large tree nearby. Crispin climbed the tree with no
        problem yet on his way down, his hands slipped and he
        fell from the middle of the tree. Crispin was barely
        injured and could have easily been healed by his mother,
        but Khlebe was afraid. He knew his aunt had warned them
        both not to climb the tree. No matter who took the blame,
        they would have both been in trouble. Khlebe rushed to
        Crispin and laid his hands on him to check his wounds,
        when to both of their amazement, Crispin was engulfed in
        a pale blue light and his wounds healed. Neither said
        anything to their parents knowing that it would have
        revealed their misdeeds. What both did not see was that
        Khlebe&#146;s mother was watching them from a distance,
        and was herself ecstatic by what she had seen.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe was
        an only child and the other children of the fort where
        training to be warriors, clerics, and even some rangers.
        He was only allowed to play with them for short times as
        they had their training and his family did not want him
        to see the violence. Several teachers in the way of a
        druid taught him. The druids would stop in on their
        travels and teach before going somewhere else, which gave
        Khlebe a wide base of knowledge to work from. After a few
        years of training, he was allowed to play more with the
        rangers than anyone else. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;Khlebe
        your mother requests your presents,&#148; the voice broke
        his concentration. Khlebe turned to look at the young
        cleric his mother had sent to fetch him and bowed. He
        climbed out of the tree he was in and walked to the main
        heart of the fort. &#147;Over here son,&#148; his mother
        called. He entered the room where his mother was sitting
        with seven robed figures. As he approached, his mother
        his eyes carefully scanned the seven hooded people. Out
        of the hoods he only recognized one person. Larsk Juton
        was a friend of Khlebe&#146;s father. He was a ranger and
        one of the protectors of Surefall Glade. In the space of
        honor, normally held by his father, sat another of the
        hooded members with Khlebe&#146;s mother to his right.
        &#147;Well young one, how do you fare today?&#148; this
        man asked? &#147;F..Fine thank you&#133;. Ah..&#148;
        stuttered Khlebe. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;Oh
        yes my boy call me Kalefao, Kalefao Pineroot. I am the
        head druid of these lands,&#148; the old man introduced
        himself. &#147;Your mother here tells me you have been
        training as a druid.&#148; Khelbe nodded. &#147;Then I
        have a question for you.&#148; Khlebe looked right at the
        old man. He had always been good at riddles. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;If
        the Tree of Life has all races and all religions, why
        must each fight?&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe
        felt all the blood leave his face. This man, this druid,
        had asked the one question Khlebe had always asked
        himself. Khlebe almost fell to the floor, how could this
        man ask the one question he had never been able to answer.
        He opened his mouth to tell the man he did not have an
        answer but the words were not what he had expected. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;Just
        as the grass and the weeds fight for light and rain to
        grow each branch competes with the other to get the most
        nutrients from the roots, the most sun from the sky, and
        the most rain from the heavens, just to produce the
        sweetest fruits.&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe
        stood there sounding like the wisest man on the planet
        but looking like the fool of fools. He himself did not
        understand how he answered, but the men at the table just
        moved their hands to remove their hoods. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;Very
        good young one. Now why does the good always have to have
        evil and vice-versa?&#148; the old man continued without
        even a breath. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe&#146;s
        mouth still open due to his jaw dropping at his last
        answer again started the words coming from him as if on
        their own, &#147;As a coin has face and a tail each can
        not exist without the other else the coin is a fake.&#148;
        </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">For over
        an hour the exchange went on. Khlebe just stood amazed at
        his own answers and the depth of the questions. After it
        was over, each of the robed figures stood chanted a spell
        and the air was empty. Only he and his mother stood in
        the room. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">After that
        day things where different. Khlebe was allowed to play
        with whomever he wished. He soon made a friend with a
        paladin in training named Samious Stongsword. One day
        Khlebe and Samious decided to go explore the woods near
        the fort. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;Khlebe
        wait up!&#148; yelled Samious, &#147;I cannot move as
        fast as you in these woods.&#148; &#147;Be quiet,&#148;
        whispered Khlebe, who appeared next to him as if from
        nowhere. &#147;We are close to the ogres.&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;Tu
        Late l&#146;ttle one!&#148; an ogre growled as he reached
        out with his club to knock his prey over. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">With as
        much speed as he could manage, Samious pulled his short
        sword, and Khlebe started to cast one of the two spells
        he had learned. The two worked together nicely but even
        with teamwork such as theirs, they where way out matched
        and the both knew it. Khlebe saw Samious go for the ogre&#146;s
        knee so he cast his small flame spell right in the
        monster's eyes. The fire bit into the eyes of the large
        beast and the sword bit hard into the knee. The beast
        fell and quickly Samious then removed the head of the
        monster in a mighty and desperate blow. Both looked at
        each other in disbelief and amazement. Suddenly the sound
        of laughter filled the air as from behind the two lads
        two more ogres and one female ogre mage looked on. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;That
        my son! You useless soft-skins!&#148; The female yelled.
        &#148;Now pay you for that, yes?&#148; She started to
        cast a spell. Khlebe tried to use a spell to effect her
        concentration, but she was too far into her spell for his
        effort to work. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">A fearful
        skin-crawling scream pierced Khlebe&#146;s ears as he
        watched Samious&#146; body shrivel and fall. Then to
        Khlebe&#146;s horror it started to move again. Looking
        into the eye sockets he saw the lifeless movements and
        lackluster expression of a zombie. Before he could act,
        though, the group of monsters were attacked by rangers
        who had appeared as if from nowhere.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe,
        with speed born of fear, ran back to the fort. When he
        reached the hill by the fort, he realized something was
        wrong. The gate was open and there were no flags on the
        spires. When he reached the gates, several of his druid
        teachers and some of the rangers he knew met him. Khlebe
        saw around him the signs of death. Bodies and blood were
        everywhere. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">&#147;Khlebe
        there was an attack while you were gone. They all fought
        but there were just too many of them,&#148; said one
        ranger. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">One of the
        druids added, &#147;Too many gnolls and then the hill
        giants did not help either.&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe had
        been taught to hate gnolls from birth, but even now he
        only disliked them. He only truly felt hate for the hill
        giants and the orges he just gotten away from. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Looking
        through the rubble he saw that even with the help of some
        druids, bards, and rangers that had come, the fort never
        really stood a chance. He saw his father&#146;s sword
        shattered on the ground; his shield once shiny with the
        crest of a golden hawk, in slivers. He also saw his
        mother&#146;s flail in pieces. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">One of the
        rangers stepped forward, it was Larsk Juton. &#147;Khlebe,&#148;
        he began, &#147;We lost several this day, including the
        old man. I know that officially the elves would still
        take you in because of your lineage, and the humans would
        take you due to your mother. But I would ask that you
        come with us back to Surefall Glade. Finish your druid
        training there and become a member of the Jagged Pine
        Folk.&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe
        knew that the Elves would never treat him as an equal,
        and no matter what he did, the humans would always think
        he was snobby. &#147;To be a whole person the only answer
        is to go with you. I am half elf, and half human but I am
        a whole druid.&#148; </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">You will
        have to return with one of the druids, as I have to take
        some bad news to your cousins. I will be glad to see you
        when I return in a few days. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img

        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4">Khlebe
        nodded. When Larsk returned, he learned that the gnolls
        had also slaughtered his aunt&#146;s family. Larsk didn&#146;t
        know if it was a related attack. Crispinskyhawke, his
        cousin, accompanied the ranger, and both he and his tall
        cousin followed the man to Surefall Glade, Crispin to be
        a ranger, and him to finish his druid training. </font></p>
