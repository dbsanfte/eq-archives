        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">I always thought
        humans were great folks. Ha! I was raised by a couple of
        &#145;em. What else could I think? The Tathers were great
        people. Never found out why Mordant Tather opened a shop
        in Neriak, never really asked, though. His house sure
        beat the streets. The foreign quarter was tough, no place
        for a weak lil&#146; urchin like myself. He probably
        saved my life...he wasn&#146;t the first. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Living with him in
        the foreign quarter was quite an experience. I became
        stronger (yes), wiser (perhaps) and bold enough to take
        what most could dish out-and I fell in love for the first
        time. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">It must have been
        the crowds, the turmoil, the sheer mayhem of it all that
        lit the first spark of desire...the mere fact that there
        was something more-something bright, beautiful, and
        dangerously alluring outside the walls of Neriak. From
        living in the diversity of the foreign quarter I fell in
        love with my vision of the outside world. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">The arrangement
        with the Tathers didn&#146;t last. Tried to learn to be a
        tailor. Please! How could he expect it from me? &#147;Moody&#148;
        he said, &#147;impulsive&#148; he said, &#147;stubborn&#148;...ack!
        And then I started stealin&#146; from the customers...that
        didn&#146;t help things. I was out on my ear fifteen
        years after he took me in. Said all debts were paid...my
        father couldn&#146;t have expected more. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Out on the street...penniless,
        hungry. Fate smiled on me and saved my life once more.
        Rutraz gave me a job at the Maiden&#146;s Fancy. Said I
        was a head turner. Never mind that I couldn&#146;t serve
        drinks to save my life, he could make money off me
        regardless. I resented him every day for it. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">There was one man,
        Tani N&#146;Mar, a regular of the Fancy. He&#146;d tell
        me stories of the world that would send my head spinnin&#146;.
        Spent hours talking of the places he&#146;d been, people
        he&#146;s met. He genuinely cared. He paid Rutraz a
        severance and took me to the Hall of the Ebon Mask. I was
        saved again. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">I began my
        education. Yes, the Hall used me...a little robbery,
        battery, extortion...whatever it took to keep the wheels
        of commerce turning. But I used them as well-immersing
        myself in the skills that would keep me alive on the
        outside, never losing my first love. And Tani was there,
        every step of the way...dishing out more kindness than
        any other of my people could manage. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Finally, after a
        time longer than suited me, I was tested by the Guild
        Headman, Eolorn J&#146;Axx. Brutal, calculating,
        unrelenting-all are words too kind to describe the man. I
        passed the test, added to my scars and was ready to begin
        my journey. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Tani wished me a
        hearty farewell. I stopped to see the Tathers one last
        time...did I see pride in the old man&#146;s eyes? But
        before I left Neriak, the display in a gem sellers shop
        caught my eye. What harm would there be in lookin&#146;? </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Therein I met a
        remarkable lady-Amberyl-A Teir&#146;Dal enchantress of
        abundant wealth and a gem master of unequalled skill. We
        talked for hours. Her compassion and great spirit lent to
        my own strength. I realized at that point that the world
        is a place made of beautiful things and people. I
        understood that my survival had always depended on the
        greatness of others. Fate had graced me far too many
        times...I owed a debt. Others should know the same favors
        fate had bestowed on me. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Amberyl heard my
        words and understood. She told me there might be others
        with a similar hearts. With a smile she told me, &#147;Seek
        my friend Crispinskyhawke. Talk to him, he might have
        work for you.&#148; </font></p>
