        Gildarion Greenarrowe looked out of the frostcovered
        cabin windows as he paced to and fro on the worn
        floorboards. A tiny shriek made him stiffen and rush into
        the adjacent room. &quot;-I didn't say you could come in
        yet&quot;, the old wrinkled midwife said, trying to look
        stern as she swaddled a tiny infant in a blanket. &quot;-She
        is a pale and scrawny looking thing&quot;, she continued
        as she handed the baby to its mother. Eirien Greenarrowe
        looked into the babies deep blue eyes as it stared wide
        eyed at her. She smiled lovingly as she said: &quot;-She
        is small and pale but she has defied winter, hence her
        name shall be Niphredil.&quot;<br>
        </font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Niphredil was
        born in Surefall Glade but she moved with her parents to
        Kelethin at the age of one. She grew up learning the
        ranger skills from her father, Gildarion Greenarrowe, and
        the druid skills of her mother Eirien. Her father wanted
        her to become a master archer and fletcher like himself
        but Niphredil was too restless for fletching and much
        preferred her sword. It was agreed that Niphredil should
        study to be a ranger and she chose the long sword as her
        main weapon despite her parents having wished something
        else. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Niphredil
        was coming of age to begin study at the ranger guild,
        tragedy struck. Her mother was slain by Orcs. Her father
        was struck by grief and hunted down every Orc in
        Crushbone leaving Niphredil to mourn alone. She was
        totally deviated at first but soon began to recklessly
        kill any beast she could find. Her father eventually came
        to his senses and returned home to find his daughter
        blinded by hate and fear. He then decided to send young
        Niphredil to the rangers of Surefall Glade to study.
        Niphredil was first hurt that her father was sending her
        away, but her father told her a tale from his past. He
        had been married once before and had another daughter.
        They had been slain on an exploration to Everfrost in the
        far north. Loosing his second wife had been near
        impossible to bear. But he still had Niphredil. She was
        more precious to him than anything. He assured her and it
        was for her best that he sent her to Surefall. Niphredil
        marveled at the tale told and the strength of her father
        and consented. He made Niphredil swear to let go of her
        vengeance, at least for the time being, and promise to
        keep herself safe and study hard to become a ranger.
        Niphredil promised to do so, but secretly made an oath to
        herself to hunt down every Orc in Crushbone when she
        earned her second name. Until then she would study hard
        and help those in dire need. </font></p>

        <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Niphredil
        arrived in Surefall with mixed feelings of grief,
        homesickness and awe. But her curiosity soon got the
        better of her and she studied hard, especially her long
        sword skills and she enjoyed the freedom she owned. She
        explored every nook and cranny of Qeynos and the
        surrounding plains and hills. However she never
        accompanied her ranger friends on their swims, for which
        she was much teased. Niphredil was terrified of water,
        almost having drowned as a child. She reached her 4<sup>th</sup>
        rank fairly easily as her restlessness struck again. She
        was bored with gnolls and began to sit around the gates
        to Qeynos listening of the tales of foreign lands. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One fine day,
        as it was raining, Niphredil caught sight of a young
        druid helping people by the gates. Niphredil held her
        breath as she gazed at her. She looked exactly like
        Niphredil. Niphredil was intrigued and kept studying her
        intently. The young druid must have sensed Niphredil&#146;s
        attention because she turned around and looked Niphredil
        straight into the eyes. From that moment on Niphredil
        just knew that this young woman was her supposedly long
        dead sister. She overcame her fear and walked up to the
        druid and hailed her nervously. The rest was like a
        fairytale. Noor, as the druid was called, had felt the
        same for Niphredil and laughing and crying they found out
        each other&#146;s stories. Niphredil and Noor traveled to
        see their father and the rejoining was a joyous and
        tearful one. Noor promised their father too keep an eye
        on Niphredil and the sisters swore never to let go off
        each other again even though their paths might go in
        separate directions from time to time. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then
        Niphredil has traveled the lands of Norrath from north to
        south, west to east causing her family much worry. She is
        still restless, bound by her oath to her father as well
        as her own secret oath of vengeance, but she is eager to
        help friends and strangers alike and since she met her
        sister she often smiles again.</font></p>
