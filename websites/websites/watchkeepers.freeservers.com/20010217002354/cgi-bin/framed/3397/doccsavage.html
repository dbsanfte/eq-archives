        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Not much is know of
        Doccsavage&#146;s true origin. All that is know is that
        his father, Clark Savage Sr., washed up on the shore of
        North Ro holding his baby son, Clark Savage Jr., in his
        arms. Wreckage was found indicating they were on a
        schooner named the &#147;Orion&#148; the like of which
        had never been seen in Norrath before. When pressed for
        answers the elder Savage would only say that they came
        from another land and would say no more. It is also
        rumored that Docc&#146;s father and mother where hiding
        out on the schooner from enemies and that Docc&#146;s
        mother died during childbirth. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Clark Savage Sr.
        made his way across the land with his baby boy and
        learned all he could about this strange new world. He
        eventually ended up in the city of Freeport where he
        immediately sought out the Paladin guild at the &#147;Hall
        of Truth&#148;. Clark Savage Sr. entrusted the Paladin&#146;s
        there to raise his son as true Paladin. He also had
        amassed quite a bit of platinum by selling strange
        devices that he had salvaged from his ship&#146;s
        wreckage and used these funds to insure that Clark Jr.
        would have the best teachers available for the path that
        he had chosen for his son&#146;s life to follow. The
        calling that the elder Savage set out for his boy to
        follow was to &#147;fight the unjust&#148;, &#147;protect
        the innocent&#148;, and rid this world of evil in all it&#146;s
        forms. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Some wonder what
        had motivated Docc&#146;s father to choose such a strange
        profession for his son. Was it guilt at a pass misdeed
        that he had committed and was seeking retribution through
        his son? Was it revenge on those that had caused them to
        go into hiding and transferring blame for the death of
        Docc&#146;s mother? His true reasoning was never revealed.
        He placed young Clark in the Paladins care, sent various
        teachers in other vocations to the hall to enhance young
        Clarks training, then left to explore this new land. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Clark Jr. was a
        remarkable specimen. Even as a baby it was evidenced that
        he would grow into great stature and have tremendous
        athletic ability. He excelled at all aspects of his
        Paladin training: sword fighting, bashing, spell casting
        and became a master at all. But it was his excellence and
        joy at learning the healing powers and &#147;Lay of Hands&#148;
        technique that all Paladins learn that earned him the
        nickname &#147;Docc&#148;. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">After growing to
        manhood, word came to Docc of his father mysteriously
        perished during an expedition to the dungeon known as
        &#147;Runnyeye&#148;. Seems Docc&#146;s father was
        attempting to negotiate a &#147;peace treaty&#148; with
        the goblin king. Clark Savage Sr. was working for weeks
        on this attempt and as it seemed it would finally take
        place with a meeting with the king in the dungeon, it
        turned out to be a deadly trap set by the king which
        ended Clark Savage Sr.&#146;s life. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Though he visited
        infrequently, Docc loved his father dearly and
        immediately set out for revenge on the king. He met a
        dark elf by the name of Krute who had turned his back on
        his kind&#146;s evil ways. Docc and Krute fought their
        way into the dungeon and slayed the foul goblin king.
        Docc realized then that the profession chosen for him by
        his father was necessary to protect the innocents from
        the evil that was lurking throughout this land and he
        would now travel the land in search of such evil, wiping
        it from the face of this world. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Docc is a physical
        giant, 6&#146; 7&#148; in height, 285 pounds he towers
        over most but is built of such symmetrical proportions
        that this is not readily evidenced unless he is standing
        next to something to compare him to. His skin is tanned
        very deeply from all his training and adventures in
        strange lands. This, and his stature have earned him the
        nickname &#147;The Man of Bronze&#148;. These features
        alone are startling enough until you see his eyes, they
        are like twin pools of gold constantly being stirred by
        tiny whirlpools. The likes of which have never been seen
        in this land except for Docc&#146;s father. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Through Docc&#146;s
        strange upbringing he has developed some traits, that to
        strangers, appear odd. Docc rarely will speak of his
        plans or his thoughts for fear that the information would
        put his friends in harm&#146;s way. &#147;Words have to
        be jarred out of Docc,&#148; says his friend Monk Mayfair.
        For the same reason Docc travels alone most of the time
        and his whereabouts are unknown. But when evil rears its
        head or his friends are threatened, he will suddenly
        appear, as a &#147;bronze juggernaut of vengeance&#148;
        as one person described it as Docc saved them from the
        hungry goblins in the bowels of HighKeep. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">Docc continues in
        his strange profession and the innocent and good of
        Norrath are thankful for it. Be it his strength as a
        warrior or his kindness and caring as a healer, all of
        the land is lucky to have Docc about. That is except the
        evil and cruel ones that lurk the land, many who cringe
        at the mention of his name. He has survived many surprise
        attacks on his person by these evil ones. &#147;Get
        Savage out of the way and the going will be good,&#148;
        some have said. This has been the downfall of many an
        evil-doer who thought such a way. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="4"><img
        src="line4023.gif" width="593" height="19"></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0">How a person can
        stand up to the rigors of such a life is testament to
        Docc&#146;s stamina and drive. Lesser men would have been
        driven mad by this intensive training or perished from
        such a violent profession. But Docc is not a lesser man
        and will continue to fight the good fight until his final
        days. </font></p>
