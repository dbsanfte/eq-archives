        <p>&quot;Crispinskyhawke! Come out of the rainstorm this
        instant.&quot; Crispinskyhawke opened his eyes. He was
        completely soaked from head to toe. Around him the Karana
        winds were pushing the rain across the plains. He turned
        to look at his mother, Amellion, standing in the doorway.
        Already he stood taller than her wood elf frame, and
        already his body hinted that he might even be a bit
        taller and stronger than the average half-elf was. He
        pushed brown hair back out of his eyes.</p>
        <p>&quot;But father said I should stand out here in the
        rain. It would help make me a stronger warrior.&quot;
        Admittedly he was a bit chilled, but he figured a warrior
        would have to endure these sorts of hardships.</p>
        <p>&quot;Crispinskyhawke!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Coming mother,&quot; mumbled Crispinskyhawke. He
        saw the lithe form of his adopted sister darting in the
        background. He knew then who had told on him. He
        privately grinned to himself; it looked like a tickle
        torture was in good order when they were alone.
        Crispinskyhawke trudged inside the small lodge. Amellion
        wrapped a bear hide around his shoulder and sat him down
        to eat some porridge. Amellion then sat back down with
        Genneth to continue their bardic lessons.</p>
        <p>Genneth had first came to stay while her mother was in
        the city to help with the epidemic outbreak. Genneth's
        mother was a powerful bard and agreed to help. She sent
        Genneth to stay with Amellion who she had been friends
        with since bardic college. Her mother eventually
        succumbed to the disease herself despite her most
        powerful songs. Crispinskyhawke's parents immediately
        adopted her into the family and treated her as their own
        daughter. For Crispinskyhawke, she was a new person to
        help share his adventures.</p>
        <p>He watched as his mother taught Genneth fingering on
        the flute. His mother had bright red hair and was petite
        like all wood elves. Her eyes twinkled bright green and
        showed wisdom, patience and understanding beyond her
        years. But her true power lay in the fact she seemed to
        know things before they happened.</p>
        <p>The door flew open and a voice bellowed out, &quot;Amellion!
        It has been a long day and I am hungry!&quot; A tall
        barbarian dressed in leathers and chainmail stood in the
        doorway. His face was decorated with a blue hawk on the
        right side. He wore a polar bear-head cap on top of his
        head. Gondydd flung many lion skins on the floor by the
        doorway and hung his claymore up on the wall.
        Crispinskyhawke quickly and quietly slipped the fur off
        his shoulders so his father wouldn't think less of him.
        Gondydd slapped Crispinskyhawke on the back and sat down
        by him.</p>
        <p>&quot;Crispinskyhawke, my boy! You are growing to up
        to be a big strong warrior. Someday I take you back to
        Halas and train you in the Wolves of the North Guild
        there.&quot; Gondydd sized Crispinskyhawke up and patted
        him on the back </p>
        <p>Amellion ushered Genneth to the table and poured the
        rest of the family porridge from the kettle over the
        fireplace. As she brought her own bowl, Gondydd grabbed
        her around the waist and pulled her to his lap.</p>
        <p>&quot;Ahhhh, my blossom I sorely missed you on the
        plains today. Tomorrow you must come with me.&quot;
        Amellion answered Gondydd with a kiss. Crispinskyhawke
        and Genneth looked at each other and rolled their eyes.</p>
        <p>After they ate, the family sat off to the side of the
        house and listened to his mother play the flute. Once in
        awhile his father would bellow out a tune with the song
        Amellion was playing. Amellion just smiled and kept
        playing. Soon Genneth was curled up besides
        Crispinskyhawke asleep. As his eyes grew heavy he started
        at his father's claymore and dreamt how he one day would
        have a sword just as fine. Maybe even a claymore.</p>
        <p>********************************************************</p>
        <p>&quot;Please stop!&quot; Genneth cried gasping for air</p>
        <p>&quot;Nope. You shall pay for telling on me.&quot;
        Crispinskyhawke said as he continued to tickle Genneth.
        He had Genneth pinned on the ground and was tickling her
        unmercifully.</p>
        <p>&quot;Please. It hurts to breathe&quot; Genneth
        laughed as tears started to pour out of her eyes.</p>
        <p>&quot;Say uncle&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Uncle, please stop&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Hmmm, I don't know&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Uncle, Crispy please, I won't tell again. I
        promise.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I suppose.&quot; Crispinskyhawke finally got up
        and stood off to the side. Genneth weakly rolled on the
        ground trying to get her breath back.</p>
        <p>&quot;So what have we learned here?&quot;
        Crispinskyhawke asked peering at his sister.</p>
        <p>&quot;You&#146;re mean&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke ignored the retort and looked at the
        horizon.</p>
        <p>&quot;What are you thinking? Genneth asked propping
        herself up on an elbow.</p>
        <p>&quot;I think I am going to prove to father I am a
        warrior today.&quot;</p>
        <p>Genneth made a face, &quot;Oh?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Yes. I am going to kill a young lion and skin it.
        Father and mother will be proud and make me a patchwork
        tunic out of it,&quot; he proudly announced.</p>
        <p>Genneth wrinkled her nose, &quot;With what? Father won't
        let you touch his claymore, not that you could lift it.&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke's eyes twinkled. &quot;I have a one.&quot;</p>
        <p>Genneth sat up<font color="#FF0000">.</font> &quot;Where
        did you get one? Mother will kill you if she finds you
        with one.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Follow me<font color="#FF0000">.</font> I hid it
        nearby.&quot; Crispinskyhawke said pulling his sister up.
        He led her to a cluster of rocks. He knelt down and
        pulled one up revealing a long object wrapped in rat furs.
        With the greatest care Crispinskyhawke pulled the wrapped
        furs from their hiding place. Unwrapping them he revealed
        the rusty short sword.</p>
        <p>Genneth smothered a laugh. &quot;That is your sword?&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke looked hurt. &quot;I had to kill a
        skeleton for this.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Crispin, dear brother of mine. A lion will chew
        you up and use the sword to clean its teeth with.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Fine, I will put it back.&quot; Crispinskyhawke
        wrapped the furs back around the sword.</p>
        <p>&quot;Come on Crispy, we need to finish our chores
        before mother and father get back.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Ok.&quot;</p>
        <p>**********************************************************</p>
        <p>While Genneth got distracted cleaning the small
        cottage, Crispinskyhawke snuck off and went back to his
        sword. He had also put together a small pouch of food for
        his journey. He&#146;d show his sister who could take a
        lion<font color="#FF0000">,</font> and his father would
        be proud of him.</p>
        <p>He followed the riverbank looking for footprints that
        looked close to a lion paw. Once or twice a bear or wolf
        would come near him but paid him no heed. Eventually he
        heard the roar of a lion. Crispinskyhawke crept closer to
        make sure it was a smaller lion. He took a sharp breath
        in excitement. It was a young lioness all alone. He
        scanned the area with his sharp eyes to make sure they
        were no other dangers around. He glanced back as the
        young lioness started to move away from him.
        Crispinskyhawke took off running after it. The young
        lioness went over the hill and Crispinskyhawke quickly
        followed it, closing in on it swiftly.</p>
        <p>When he topped the rise of the hill, he took one look
        and tried to stop and start backpedaling. Lions. Lots of
        Lions. Big lions. A pride of lions.</p>
        <p>He had already started his descent, though, and could
        not get his footing. Crispinskyhawke quickly slid down
        the hill grabbing the attention of every lion in the area.
        The young lioness he had been chasing whirled around and
        pounced on his legs. He had managed to hold on to the
        rusty short sword and slap the broad side of it across
        the lioness&#146; nose. The young lioness growled in
        surprise. Crispinskyhawke scrambled on his back up the
        hill as fast as he was able. One of the big lions came up
        and raked its claws on Crispinskyhawke&#146;s<b> </b>leg,
        pulling him back down. Crispinskyhawke screamed in pain.
        Red blood soaked his leggings. He tried to swing the
        sword at the lion, but the lion just slapped the sword
        out of his hand. The lion then bit down on his sword arm,
        crushing the bones in the forearm.</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke didn't realize it, but by this time he
        was screaming in continuos pain. All he could think of
        was that Genneth had been right, and he was never going
        to see his family again. He looked around to see if there
        was a way out, but the pride of lions was circling around
        waiting for some hidden signal to rush in and finish him
        off. He looked back and saw that the big lion had backed
        off and was going to let the young lioness take him.
        Crispinskyhawke groaned; he could see no way out of this
        and wished his parents could save him.</p>
        <p>The young lioness took one step forward and then fell
        to the ground with an arrow embedded between her eyes.
        Another young lion was suddenly surrounded by plant life
        that had grown up around it, preventing it from moving.
        The pride stopped circling and sniffed the air. The air
        grew cold and still as a cloud formed overhead.
        Crispinskyhawke and the pride then saw the source of the
        disturbance.</p>
        <p>The man stood tall in leathers. He was calmly slinging
        the bow back on his back and drawing a sword made of
        ebony stone. The first two young lions rushed him and
        then dropped dead as lightning came down out of the air
        and struck them. A lioness of bigger size came in behind
        the young lions to attack the stranger. She rolled by in
        a charred ball of fur as she was engulfed in a ball of
        flame. The big lion that had attacked Crispinskyhawke
        earlier decided to finish off the weaker prey first
        before dealing with the stranger. Crispinskyhawke tried
        to struggle out of the way but his legs hurt so much he
        could not move.</p>
        <p>A stinging swarm of insects appeared and surrounded
        the big lion. It roared in defiance and rushed the
        stranger as if it knew he was the new source of
        discomfort. The stranger easily dodged the first blow and
        struck with the sword. Again the big lion tried to attack,
        but the stranger parried and struck back, tearing the
        lion's throat open and slaying it. By this time the young
        lion was free of its ensnaring trap but sensed it was
        outmatched alone and started to flee. The stranger, in a
        blurring motion, drew his bow and fired two arrows off,
        dropping the young lion in its tracks.</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke was surrounded by tiny blue bits of
        energy that closed up some of the wounds.</p>
        <p>&quot;Rest easy my young friend. You&#146;ve been
        through quite an ordeal,&quot; was the last thing
        Crispinskyhawke heard before drifting into blackness.</p>
        <p>***********************************************************</p>
        <p>He awoke next to a small fire and the humming of the
        stranger's voice. Crispinskyhawke looked over and saw the
        stranger making some arrows. The stranger seemed to sense
        his stirring and looked over.</p>
        <p>&quot;I am afraid I could not fully heal your legs
        there young adventurer,&quot; he said nodding toward
        Crispinskyhawke's legs.</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke looked down to see many bandages
        wrapped around his legs. He looked at his arm and noticed
        it was fully healed.</p>
        <p>The stranger spoke again. &quot;I am afraid a ranger
        only has so much mana. I used what I had at the time to
        save you arm. Your legs should be fine, just badly
        scarred.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Ranger? I have heard of rangers but never saw
        one.&quot; Crispinskyhawke said weakly.</p>
        <p>The stranger chuckled, &quot;Well lad we are around,
        just scattered about the land of Norrath.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;So tell me? Does such a brave lad have a name
        and a home?&quot; the stranger asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;Crispinskyhawke, my father is Gondydd the
        barbarian warrior of the plains.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Ahhhh, Gondydd. Been a long time. Well rest well
        young Crispinskyhawke. Tomorrow we shall take you home.&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke drifted back off the sleep too weak to
        argue, but he had new dreams that night.</p>
        <p>************************************************************************</p>
        <p>Despite caring all the lion skins, a backpack of loot,
        and his armor and weapons, the stranger had no problem
        carrying Crispinskyhawke also. It was like he had the
        strength of ten men. To top it off<font color="#FF0000">,</font>
        the stranger was moving at speed that he had only seen
        his mother run at while singing and was not even laboring
        with breath. Crispinskyhawke felt ashamed for being
        unable to walk himself, but he just wanted to be home
        safe again.</p>
        <p>Very shortly the two reached the homestead of Gondydd
        and Amellion. Crispinskyhawke's parents rushed out of the
        house upon hearing the hail from the stranger. Gondydd
        gave Crispinskyhawke a stern look but said nothing;
        Amellion<font color="#FF0000">,</font> on the other hand<font
        color="#FF0000">,</font> burst into tears. She started to
        sing her healing song to soothe her son&#146;s wounds all
        the while crying at the pain he had put her through.
        Through it all Crispinskyhawke fell asleep again after
        being fed broth and having his wounds re-dressed. Genneth
        pitched in and helped where she could. Crispinskyhawke
        was glad she didn&#146;t say, &quot;I told you so.&quot;
        She just looked worried and scared.</p>
        <p>************************************************************************</p>
        <p>The next few days Crispinskyhawke received lectures
        from Gondydd and Amellion about running off to do such
        foolishness. The ranger stayed awhile since it seemed he
        knew Gondydd and Amellion from earlier adventures.
        Crispinskyhawke came to learn his name was Larsk Juton.
        Crispinskyhawke sat around and listened to the old
        friends&#146; reminiscence about days past. Genneth doted
        on him, but was sure to remind him why he was being doted
        on. Crispinskyhawke ignored her the best he could and
        studied the ranger and listen to every detail he said.
        This was not lost on Larsk Juton or Gondydd who often
        furrowed his brow in concern. The next day Larsk said his
        good-byes and left.</p>
        <p>That night the family sat around the fireplace working
        on sewing the lionskins into leather armor. Amellion was
        humming a favorite tune of hers. Gondydd was drinking his
        favorite ale out of a crude stein. Genneth kept poking
        Crispinskyhawke just for good measure.</p>
        <p>Gondydd spoke up, &quot;Crispinskyhawke my boy, I been
        thinking. After you heal up, I think we will take you to
        Halas and see what the Wolves of the North guildmaster
        has to say about training you in the near future.&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke cleared his throat, &quot;Actually I
        want be a ranger father.&quot;</p>
        <p>Gondydd spewed ale across the room. &quot;WHAT?!&quot;</p>
        <p>Amellion stopped humming and closed her eyes<font
        color="#FF0000">.</font> Genneth tried to look as small
        as possible. Crispinskyhawke wanted to dig a hole and
        hide but knew he had to stand strong.</p>
        <p>&quot;You want to be a <i>what</i>!? Why not a warrior?
        That is all you wanted to be.&quot; Emotions raged across
        Gondydd's face as he tired to sort through them all. </p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke felt miserable for even saying
        anything. &quot;Sorry father, I have been thinking about
        it<font color="#FF0000">,</font> and I just feel more at
        home in nature. The animals don't seem to mind me, well
        except the lions. And I want to cast spells.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;So why not conquer nature then my boy. You are
        strong, brave of heart, good smarts. Besides warriors don't
        need spells. We are strong of heart and mind,&quot;
        Gondydd said<font color="#FF0000">,</font> thumping his
        fist on his chest.</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke looked at the floor in silence.</p>
        <p>Gondydd tone softened, &quot;Tell you what my boy,
        tomorrow I will let you practice with my claymore.&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke looked up, his eyes brightening.</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh Gondydd, I am not sure that is wise.&quot;
        Amellion said in a soothing tone.</p>
        <p>&quot;Nonsense blossom, Crispinskyhawke is a strong
        lad. He needs to learn the value of a two-handed sword.&quot;
        Gondydd sternly looked at Crispinskyhawke, &quot;And if
        he is going to sneak off with a sword again, I want him
        to be able to use it.&quot; </p>
        <p>Gondydd then looked at Genneth, &quot;You too Genneth.
        No children of mine are going to be defenseless in this
        world.&quot;</p>
        <p>Amellion just smiled for some odd reason and let the
        matter go. Gondydd then picked the two children up and
        gave them a big bear hug. Genneth and Crispinskyhawke
        squealed and the rest of the evening was spent rough
        housing with Gondydd.</p>
        <p>*********************************************************************</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke and Genneth were spending the
        afternoon hacking each other with wooden swords Gondydd
        had fashioned for them. Crispinskyhawke&#146;s was a two-handed
        one, while Genneth's was the size of a bastard sword.
        Gondydd and Amellion had gone to High Hold Keep to sell
        their leather armor to the citizens there.
        Crispinskyhawke had to swear that he&#146;d stayed home
        while they were gone. </p>
        <p>Not that he could go far, he muttered to himself. The
        scars on his legs were stiff and it was hard for him to
        walk, let alone run fast. Genneth hit up side his arm
        drawing his attention back to the battle at hand.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hah, won again Crispy. This is fun.&quot;
        Genneth said laughing gleefully. &quot;I could be a
        warrior<font color="#FF0000">, </font>too.&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke rolled his eyes, &quot;I was thinking
        about stuff that was important. Besides you can't be a
        warrior. You are going to be a bard.&quot;</p>
        <p>Genneth open her mouth to retort and then stopped.
        Instead she said, &quot;Greetings Larsk Juton.&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke turned around with surprise on his
        face. </p>
        <p>&quot;Larsk! Good to see you....&quot; Crispinskyhawke
        faltered. Larsk looked grim and very somber.</p>
        <p>&quot;Let's go inside children. We need to talk.&quot;</p>
        <p>The bottom fell in Crispinskyhawke's stomach. He knew
        it couldn't be good news.</p>
        <p>Larsk Juton sat the two children down and told them
        the bad news. Gondydd and Amellion had been ambushed by
        gnolls on the way to High Pass. All that remained was
        their bodies and Larsk had buried them where they lay.
        Crispinskyhawke felt his world come to a crashing stop.
        All he knew<font color="#FF0000">;</font> all he loved
        was gone, never to be seen again. Then he felt something
        new. A burning hatred. A desire to see all gnolls die. He
        swore revenge on those who would take all he knew away
        from him. Genneth hugged Crispinskyhawke and cried. He
        hugged her back. They were all each other had left in the
        world. Her parents were gone and now his were, too.</p>
        <p>The next few days Larsk helped the two put affairs in
        order and then escorted them to Qeynos. Crispinskyhawke
        said his good-byes to Genneth as she went to stay at the
        bardic college in the city. At the crossroads in the
        Qeynos Hills Larsk Juton stopped and lay his gear on the
        ground. He looked at Crispinskyhawke<b> </b>and studied
        him.</p>
        <p>&quot;Crispinskyhawke you are at the crossroads of
        your life right now. I know your father's desire for you
        to become a warrior at the Wolves of the North Guild in
        Halas. But without his support and recommendation they
        will not take you. Now the Knight's of Truth warrior
        guild will take you in Qeynos. </p>
        <p>&quot;Or there is a third option. Protectors of Pine
        in Surefall Glade will take you in. You have good
        aptitude with nature. I can sense this in you. I am going
        there now. My guildmaster has asked me to teach the
        recruits, and I would be honored to teach the son of
        Gondydd. The choice is yours&quot;</p>
        <p>Crispinskyhawke looked up at the sky and thought for a
        moment of all he had lost. He looked into Larsk Juton's
        eyes.</p>
        <p>&quot;I want to be a ranger.&quot;</p>
        <p>*******************************************************************</p>
        <p>Epilogue: As the two entered the glade of Surefall,
        Crispinskyhawke saw a silver-headed half-elf out of the
        corner of his eye enter the tree of the druids.
        Crispinskyhawke felt a stirring in his heart. He wondered
        if he would be able to meet her sometime and get to know
        the young half-elf.</p>
