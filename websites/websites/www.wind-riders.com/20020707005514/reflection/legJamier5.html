                      The Ballad of Sorrow

                      <P>Jamier struggled against his chains; Not that he was afraid to die for Silverann
                      and Stormangell and the child that Cattiebrie carried; but the fact that he
                      couldn’t stop remembering the Red headed paladin that meant so much to him.
                      The basement of the estate of Unrest offered him no light but he could see the rat scurry
                      past. He could smell the cold dank smell of death from the victims before him.
                      All these things didn’t bother him. Everything seemed small in comparison. He
                      closed his eyes to concentrate on other things, but it didn’t help. No matter
                      what he did he could see her face.</P>

                      “Why my god must you torture me so?” he said in a raspy weakened voice.
                      As he expected there was no answer

                      <P>Jamier thought he must be dreaming as he saw Sugan standing atop a balcany
                      with a High elven Paladin. The Paladin was holding her and she was wrapped
                      tight in his protective arms. He saw her lips move to mouth the words “I love
                      you Canelon.” He grimaced as the paladin bent low to kiss her.</P>

                      The sound of a scurrying rat reawoke Jamier to his senses. He thought if he
                      could spit on the vile thing to rid himself of its stench he would. Instead he
                      knew he was forced to live with it. His mind drifted again as he saw the
                      Paladin on one knee. He smiled as he watched him sing to her. Her soft red
                      hair flowing in the breeze as she swayed the the soft tunes of the high elven
                      voice.

                      <P>Jamier tried to relax as he too listened to the soft words and sensual tune that
                      seemed to sooth the soul of even the most savage of beasts. But the song was
                      short lived. He agonized as he saw sugan screaming for release as she was
                      engulfed in shadows. Her eyes glowed with a demonic power. He saw the
                      beloved windriders in turmoil as they fought what seemed to be in a futile
                      fashion for her imrprisoned soul.</P>

                      “God! I can watch any more please make it go away!”
                      Jamier was only left with his silence and the dream

                      <P>He saw her standing there, alone only half a heart, the other half with an elf that
                      can no longer be seen. Jamier felt her pain her loneliness but he was helpess to
                      comfort her. He so longed to wrap those arms around her and tell her that in
                      time the pain will pass. He kept reminding himself it was just a dream.</P>

                      The warrior stuggled to pull himself to his feet. He looked towards the heavens
                      pleeding for release. Then suddenly he heard it. The sound pierced through his
                      soul and heart like an envenomed knife.<BR>
                      He knew it to be the voice of the paladin he loved so much. He saw her there
                      standing high atop the balcony her arms stretched ready to jump into oblivion.

                      <P>“NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!”<BR>
                      Envy’s laughter broke the silence. The evil silvery laughter that sends shivers
                      down any mans soul as she swiftly kicked him in the essence of his manhood.
                      “Silence Waela scum!”..</P>
                      He doubled over in pain but that did not stop him. The sobs flowed freely but
                      it was not for the physical pain he felt. It was for the spiritual torture he felt
                      unlike he has ever felt in his young life. He knew this wasn’t a dream ; this was
                      very real.

                      <P>“MY GOD! Please! Let her hear the song! Let her hear the song!”
                      Jamier prayed as he took the last of his energies and began to sing. Praying,
                      imagining that it would ride the winds to her ears. His physical tortures
                      commenced but it did not end the vioce that carried with the power of the
                      heavens. He could not let her die.</P>

                      He heard Silverann’s voice “Mother Listen to the song” ..”yes! Yes!” he
                      started laughing as he saw Sugan’s step halt to listen to silverann. “song? I hear
                      nothing..” he tensed at those words.
                      <P>Silverann was patient. “keep listening mother open your hearts to the winds.”
                      Jamier didn’t quit singing, he sung the songs of Joy, pain, laughter, anger,
                      sorrow, victory. Most of all he sung the songs of winds, life and storm. “I..I..I
                      think I hear it..” Sugans voice came across the barriers of time and space. She
                      stepped down from the balcony. She heard the song. He fells to his knee’s
                      praising his god that she lived.</P>

                      “Jamier I am coming for you!”
                      Her voice kept him hanging on to his own spark of life.

                      <P>He opened his eyes. That has all passed a long time ago now. But the memory
                      made the bright shiny freckeled face that he loved so much more beautiful as
                      he looked upon her.
                      The heat of the lavastorm mountains posed no discomfort as long as he knew
                      she was alive. It was only yesterday that he told her he loved her. He knew it
                      couldn’t be returned. But that didn’t stop him from loving her.</P>

                      “Milady?”
                      <P>Sugan turned around to face him, still sweating from the night of battle.
                      “Yes Jamier?</P>

                      “I had a promise to keep of we lived…and we are both alive and well”
                      Sugan looked worried.

                      <P>Jamier leaned over and kissed her softly , tenderly, savoringly upon the lips.</P>

                      “I will always love you”

                      <P>He could only pray that the moment will not be forgotten with time as they sat
                      watching the sun rise across the lands promising new adventures with the new
                      day.</P>

                      Hey could only pray that he would have a thousand more years with each
                      smile she sent warmly upon him.

                      <P>Yet he knew deep down in his hard that her road was a hard one. And that
                      her experience, her song , was just one voice, one moment in a dance that will
                      last a lifetime ; in Sugan’s ballad of Sorrow.</P></DIV></TD>
