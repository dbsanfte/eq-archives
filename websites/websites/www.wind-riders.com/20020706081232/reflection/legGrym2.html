				                 "When Light fights hardest to keep the Dark at bay, that is the time the Shadows grow strong."


        <P>Night in Freeport is a relative thing.  Yes, the sun had long ago set and darkness filled the sky.  But the city did not sleep.  In fact, there was easily as much activity during the hours of darkness as there were during the "day".  None the less, it was indeed night in the bustling town.
   </P>
     The dark skin and tall, lithe features marked the woman as an Erudite.  As much identified by the traditional, hooded cowl as by the features it tried to hide from view.  Despite her being far away from the place of her birth the Erudite woman did not seem out of place here.  Although noted as "a city of men", Freeport was long a place of
meetings and business for all the races of Norrath.  As long as the could look past their differences long enough to realize the profits available.  Greed can be the greatest peacemaker of all.
 
       <P>The dark woman moved quickly and quietly through the busy streets.  She had all the look of someone on an urgent mission.  But one look at her eyes told the truth.  Her eyes were that of the hunted. 
    </P>
    "The docks."  She muttered to herself.  "They said he was often seen at the docks.  Some one there will surely know where he can be found."
 
       <P>She noted a signpost ahead and smiled weakly as she knew she neared her destination.  As she turned toward the direction the sign indicated a slight breeze blew into her face.  The scent of the salt air, seafoam and dead fish was unmistakable.  A few hurried steps placed the Erudite on the wooden planks of the Freeport docks.  She looked around at the area, taking in the Sights.  A gathering of hopeful travelers had gathered on the dock next to the one she stood on.  They mulled about and talked, not-so-quietly, about lands afar, the tedium of sea travel and the tardiness of ships.  After a quick look at the crowd the dark skinned women decided it did not hide the one she sought.
</P>
        "How hard can it be to find a troll in this human city?!"  The woman from Odus asked herself in frustration.

        <P>A fishmonger who was hurrying to market with a smelly load of goods stopped suddenly as he heard the tall woman speak.  "Ye're lookin' fer the funny troll?  The one they call Grym?"  The odiferous merchant asked through missing teeth.
</P>
        Taken aback at suddenly being addressed, the Erudite stammered. "Grym?  If you mean Grymtooth, that is exactly who I seek.  Do you know where he can be found?"

        <P>The rank little man let his sack of fish drop to the ground with a wet thud.  He looked the tall, dark woman in the eyes and proclaimed, "Well, if'n this Grymtooth is our Grym, than that sorta information ain't free.  If'n ye know what I mean?"
</P>
        "I see." Replied the woman.  "Pray tell, good sir.  What is the going price for such information?"

        <P>The fishmonger grinned broad, showing the full extents of his lack of dental hygiene.  "Well!  See'n as I like ye an' all...  I'd be a-thinkin' that would cost ye, say, one gold coin!"
</P>
        The Erudite did her best to put on a show of how outrageous the price was.  "One gold coin?!"  She exclaimed.  "Why that is robbery I tell you!  Right here in the streets of this fine city I am being robbed!"

        <P>The smelly, little man seemed to be taking delight in his wringing of a gold piece from a tourist.  "Ye can cry about it all ye want!  That's the price I'ma askin'!  I won't take a copper less!  Ye hear?"
</P>
        With a sigh of defeat, the woman produced a gold coin from her pouch and handed it to the fishmonger.  "Very well," she began, "here is your fee.  I should hope the information is worth such an exorbitant price!"

        <P>"Oh it is!" Said the man as he greedily clutched the coin in his grubby hand.  "Look see over yonder?"
</P>
        The Erudite looked at where the man pointed.  "I see an inn"

        <P>"That there is the Seafarer's Roost.  Many of you outlander-types like ta hang out in there."
</P>
        The woman looked back down at the pungent man.  "That is where I will find the troll, Grymtooth?"

        <P>"No."  The man said pointedly.  "Ya see them there steps a-leading down to the underdocks?"
</P>
        The tall woman nodded here head.  "Yes."

        <P>"Ye go down them steps and look around."  The fishmonger began. "Ye'll see a door that a-leads to the storerooms."  Go through that there door and then go down the ramp to the lower part."  With that the he looked around suspiciously.  Then leaned in closer to the Erudite female.  "All I can tell ya from there is ta feel around the walls."
</P>
        The woman blinked and looked at the man wide-eyed.  "That's it?"

        <P>"Yep!"  The fishmonger said grinning.  "An' that's all I'ma gunna say too!  Good luck ta ye missy!"
</P>
        "Wait!"  Cried the woman.  But she was talking to the now distant back of the small, smelly merchant.

        <P>Resigned to continue her search, she set off for the far side of the docks in hopes of finding the one she sought.  She proceeded down the damp steps as directed by the fishmonger and quickly found the door.  The barbarian fisherman standing nearby only glanced at her momentarily as she opened the door and stepped inside a surprisingly
well lit room.  A few steps found her on a platform overlooking a small warehouse.  A ramp did indeed lead down to the lower level.  Once down the ramp, she looked for a means of egress.  None were readily apparent.  Moving under the platform she began to look behind some of the stacked crates and barrels.  It was while trying to squeeze her body between two such stacks that she inadvertently found the exit she
sought.</P>

        The illusionary wall that she had stepped through hid a small landing and a set of stone steps leading down to a door.  Feeling flushed with success, the Erudite moved quickly down the steps and opened the door.  She was disappointed with what she saw.  A dimly lit cavern greeted her.  More goods were stored here and there but the was no sign of the troll.  The woman resolved herself to continue searching unabated, as there were several exits in view from where she stood.

        <P>As she started for one of those exits something caught her eye. There was something odd about some of the crates and barrels here.  It took her a moment to place it.  But, after a moment of examination it came to her.  The cargo stored here had no excise stamps on them.  This must have been a smugglers cache.  Smuggling was illegal.  Almost as illegal as, say, the open practice of Necromancy.
</P>
        "Perfect!"  She smiled.  "I must assume the regular occupants of these caverns will not mind me showing my true colours." With that the woman began chanting words of power and tracing mystical symbols in the air as she flung a few fragments of bone to the ground.  The bone chips began to tremble as the tempo and volume of her chanting increased.  Suddenly, as the chant reached a crescendo, the pieces of bone flew together and erupted into a full-sized, humanoid skeleton.

        <P>A hollow voice emanated from the skeletal figure.  "How may I serve you, my mistress?"
</P>
        "Guard me with all of you abilities."  The woman ordered.

        <P>"I exist only to serve you, my mistress."  The bones replied.
</P>
        Feeling more secure now that she could utilize her powers without fear of recrimination, the woman set off to continue her search of the caverns.

        <P>Two exits, besides the one she came in through, were visible from where she started.  One was a natural tunnel leading from the area.  The other was a door set into the surrounding stone.  The door piqued her interest more so she stepped to it first.  Opening the door revealed a small chamber carved into the rock.  Several bunks were present as well as another door and a dark elven female wearing a rapier.  The dark elf placed her hand on the weapon but made no move to draw it.  She simply nodded at the Erudite and stood ready.  The Erudite woman looked about and turned back to the ebon-skinned elf.  "Do you speak the tongue of the humans?"  The Erudite asked the elf.
</P>
        "I do."  Replied the dark elf.  "What can I do for you stranger?"

        <P>The Erudite let go a sigh of relief and smiled at the elven woman.  "My name is Neuvau.  I am seeking a troll by the name of..."
</P>
        "Grymtooth Grumbletummy."  The dark elf finished.

        <P>"Yes!  You know him?!"  The taller woman asked excitedly. "Please!  I have traveled a great distance to find him.  Can you tell me where he is?"
</P>
        "Hold on stranger."  The elf started.  "We of the Coalition and Sir Grymtooth have a little agreement.  Part of that agreement is keeping each others secrets.  I don't know you and Grymtooth has never mentioned you.  I'll not tell you anything about him unless I have proof as to your intentions."

        <P>The Erudite woman suddenly found herself very angry.  To come so far and be denied that what she sought was unacceptable.  Summoning the last of her patience she calmed herself as best she could.  Neuvau was no fool.  The elven woman was small and lightly armed.  But she had the look of an experienced fighter.  Besides, she probably had several friends within earshot.  Neuvau knew she could not gain what she wanted through force.  Tact and decorum would have to prevail.
</P>
        "I see."  She began, putting on her most disarming smile. "Very well, I can accept that.  I can see that my friend has surrounded himself with trustworthy folk.  If it is not too much of an inconvenience, I would like to wait here for Grymtooth to return."

        <P>"Hey," the dark elf started, "it's a free city.  Just stay out of the way and no one will even pay attention that you are here.  But I'll give you fair warning.  This is our home.  It's Grymtooth's home as well.  Start something in our home and I guarantee, we'll finish it."
</P>
        Neuvau nodded at the elf as she sat down on one of the bunks. "I understand completely.  I shall be the perfect guest."

        <P>The dark elf beamed an impish smile. "Great!  As long as we all get along!"  That said she turned to some paperwork scattered across the small table next to her.
</P>
        Minutes turned to hours.  Soon Neuvau found herself nodding off where she sat.  Starting awake for the umpteenth time, she decided to stand and stretch some.

        <P>"Look," the dark elf began, "why don't you get some sleep.  I'll tell you this much about Grymtooth: Sometimes he's gone for days at a time.  We don't ask him where he's going and we don't ask him when he'll be back.  He comes and goes as he sees fit and leaves us to our business.  He is also a very friendly and helpful sort that don't mind helping us move heavy stuff around when he's here.  For all I know he's gone off and gotten himself killed in one of those damned, fool crusades of his.  You may be waiting a few more hours or you may be here forever.  I don't know.  What I do know is that you are safe here.  You behave yourself and help out some around here and you can stay as long as you like.  Okay?"
</P>
        Neuvau was beginning to like the bluntness of this dark elf.

<P>"Very well.  I shall sleep then.  Do not mind my guardian, it will not stray from this spot.  If Lord Grymtooth does not show tomorrow I shall assist you any way that I am able."
</P>
        The dark elf gave the impish smile again. "Great!  Sleep well!"

        <P>Although the guards at the South Gate of Freeport were not all that pleased to see the troll, the merchants in the area waved and greeted him by name.
</P>
        "Hail and well met Grymtooth!"

        <P>"How was your journey Grym?"
</P>
        "What's news Grymtooth?"

        <P>"Hey everybody!  Grymtooth is back!"
</P>
        "Heya Grym!"

        <P>The troll beamed at the friendly homecoming he received from the common folk of the city.  "hi dere everybuddy!  how izz yuze all doin' tuday?!"
</P>
        In turn he visited all of them to sell them this item or that that he had taken from the corpses of the evil beings and horrible monsters that he had done battle with.  As usual, he gave every merchant an exceptionally good bargain for each item.

        <P>After his ritual "selling of the loot" he headed for the northern section of town.  There he visited the bank to exchange and deposit the money he had made and to secure items that he had chosen to reserve as gifts for his friends.  His next stop was the Hall of Truth to speak with his friends in the Order of Truth about what he had been
doing and what he had seen or heard and to catch up on all of the latest news and gossip.  He sat and dined with the Knights and exchanged tales of this and that until the wee hours of the morning.  After all involved had stifled more yawns than they could count, they decided to part company and retire for the night.  Before heading back to the caverns he called home, Grymtooth decided that a quick dip in the clear waters that surrounded the Hall would feel quite good.  It did indeed.  Other than a bite from a pesky piranha, the soak had been completely refreshing.  The piranha, on the other hand, had made a fine snack. 
</P>
        After lying on the soft grass for a short while Grymtooth caught himself dozing off.  Deciding that a naked troll lying on the lawn of the Hall of Truth would not be a good thing for the morning shift to discover, Grymtooth donned his gear and headed for east Freeport.

        <P>The eastern sky was beginning to lighten as the troll opened the door to the warehouse and stepped inside.  A short hop and a few stooped steps under the platform brought the troll onto the landing behind the illusionary wall.  Grymtooth opened the lower door and stepped into the smuggler's cavern.  He was not surprised to see nobody about.  It was usually quiet in the caverns.  It was part of the appeal.  The troll opened the door to the bunkroom and ducked to step inside.  He was getting ready to greet the lovely dark elf maiden that usually occupied it when he stopped mouth open in mid-word.
</P>
        "Greetings Lord Grymtooth."  The Erudite spoke in perfect trollish.  "I have been waiting some time for your arrival."

        <P>Grymtooth gawked for a moment longer before responding. "Neuvau!"  He stammered. "wutt izz yuze doin heer?!"
</P>
        Neuvau blinked at the stooped troll and then stifled a slight chuckle.  "You know, of course Lord Grymtooth, that I do understand your native language as well as speak it?"

        <P>Grymtooth half-frowned at the dark skinned female and then stepped fully into the room.  "Yes.  I do know.  I just get so used to speaking the common tongue that I sometimes forget that there are a few non-trolls out there who can speak trollish."
</P>
        "Oh please forgive me m'Lord!  You speak common so well that I hadn't noticed it was you!" Neuvau chided in mock obsequiousness.

        <P>"Oh HA-HA!" Grymtooth returned.  "Hey, don't think I can't notice YOUR accent when you speak trollish!"
</P>
        The Erudite blinked moistly then replied in trollish.  "meez gott da akzent?"  That said, Neuvau could no longer contain herself and broke into a fit of laughter.

        <P>Grymtooth just stood silently waiting for her to regain composure.  He had to admit to himself though, that was pretty funny.
</P>
        After a few moments of guffaws from Neuvau she finally composed herself well enough to speak.  "Well,  before we go any further, I must give you this."  She then retrieved a neatly wrapped package from inside her satchel and handed it to the troll.

        <P>"What is it?"  Grymtooth asked while taking the package.
</P>
        Neuvau just stood there expectantly.

        <P>Seeing no answer to his question forthcoming, Grymtooth set down his pack and his axe and began opening the package.  A smile quickly came to his face as the removed paper revealed a jar of candied beetle eyes.  "Ummmmm!  These look good!"  The troll salivated.  "Thank you! But, you're not a troll.  The custom does not apply to you."
</P>
        "They're not from me actually," began Neuvau, "they are from your great-grandfather.  I am here representing him."

        <P>Grymtooth looked up from the now open jar as he chewed on one of the disgusting delicacies.  He offered the jar to Neuvau.  "Want one? This is a really good batch!"
</P>
        Neuvau paled at the offer.  "Uh, no thank you."  She gagged. "I, uh, just ate."

        <P>Shrugging, the troll carefully placed the lid back on the trollish confections and turned back to Neuvau.  "Okay," he began, "you're here on Grampy's behalf.  I can understand that.  What does he need?  And why is it so important that not just any messenger can deliver it.  You took a great risk coming here."
</P>
        "I realize this."  Neuvau replied.  "But I do so on the half of Rankul the Scabbrous.  He is my current mentor and it is the duty of all apprentices to follow the orders of their masters."

        <P>Grymtooth nodded in understanding.  "What is the message then?"
</P>
        "I do not know."  Said as she turned once again to her satchel. "Master Rankul would not disclose the nature of the message to me.  It is for your eyes only.  He even went so far as to ward the letter from tampering.  If the seal is broken by anyone but you, the letter will disintegrate into nothingness instantly."  She handed Grymtooth a neatly folded paper as she finished speaking.

        <P>Grymtooth gingerly took the letter from the Erudite's hand and looked at the wax seal upon it.  It was indeed the seal of his Great-grandfather.  Looking at Neuvau and then back to the letter, Grymtooth broke the seal.  With a quiet hissing sound, the letter
quickly turned to a fine powder in the troll's large hands.</P>

        Neuvau blinked and then looked at Grymtooth.  "But..."  she stuttered, "But, it was not supposed to do that!  I don't underst..."

        <P>Grymtooth silenced her panic with the raising of a finger. "It's alright."  he soothed.  "You were right.  But it was not for my "eyes" only.  It was for my "mind" only.  The message is in my thoughts now."
</P>
        Neuvau placed her hand on her chest in an effort to calm her racing heart.  "Thank the Plaguebringer!"  She sighed as she sat down on the edge of the nearest bunk.

        <P>"No rest for the wicked Neuvau."  Grymtooth said.
</P>
        "Excuse me?"  Asked the Erudite.

        <P>"You have new orders from Grampy."
</P>
        Neuvau listened intently.  "Go on."

        <P>"You are to return to his home in Innothule immediately.  I will follow shortly.  I have business to attend to here first and then I will meet you both there."
</P>
        "But..."  Neuvau began to protest.

        <P>"No questions!"  Grymtooth barked.  "Grampy says now and he says it is of the greatest urgency!  You will depart as soon as you are able."
</P>
        Taken aback by the usually jovial troll's sudden change in demeanor, Neuvau could only squeak acceptance of the new orders. "I will leave immediately."

        <P>"Good."  Grymtooth said as he dumped his pack to take stock in his supplies.  "I will be a day behind you.  Two at the very most.  It cannot be avoided.  Grampy will understand."
</P>
        "May the Plaguebringer overlook you in favor of another Lord Grymtooth."  The Erudite said as she gathered the last of her things and headed out the door.

        <P>"May the Twins grant you a safe journey Neuvau.  I will see you soon."
</P>
        Neuvau picked her way through the tunnels under east Freeport carefully.  Her skeleton guardian followed closely behind.  She had only been this way once before in the last week and was still not comfortable with the route.  But, it afforded her an easy exit from the city without having to pass through the gates and by the ever-present Militia.  As she stepped from the tunnel into the larger chamber she looked about for the exit tunnel she needed to take.

        <P>Suddenly, her guardian exploded in a shower of flames and smoking bone fragments.  The blast knocked her to the ground and she could feel several small cuts begin to bleed.  Fear raced through her mind as she quickly came to her feet and readied a counterattack.  She knew of nothing that could destroy her guardian with such ease.  She looked about for the source of the attack.  Steeling herself for further assault she called out to her would be attackers. 
</P>"Show yourself coward!"  she raged.  "Do you so fear the wrath of a follower of Bertoxxulous?!"

        <P>She was answered with silence.  A few moments passed and Neuvau began to feel that perhaps she had stumbled upon a trap left for someone else.  She began to relax a little.  Then the pain of her injuries set in and she took stock in them.  After a few minutes of ministering to her wounds she began to head for the tunnel she had picked out before the excitement.  She made it three steps before she could move no more. She was frozen in place.  It was as if her feet were fused with the stone of the floor.  Panic began to set in as a cold chuckle echoed throughout the chamber.  In desperation she began to cast a spell of attack in the direction she thought the laughter came from.  The spell began to take shape and then was gone.  It was as if the magic was sucked from her body.  Not knowing what else to do, Neuvau began a prayer to her god.
</P>
        "Greetings Neuvau."  A voice spoke from the darkness.

        <P>"Who are you that you attack a servant of the Plaguebringer and an apprentice of Rankul the Scabbrous?!"  She cried out.
</P>
        "Who am I?"  The voice mused.  "Who am I?  Now that is an excellent question!  Who am I indeed!"

        <P>"I am defeated!"  Neuvau proclaimed.  "At least show yourself so that I may take the image of my slayer to the afterlife!"
</P>
        "Oh now how can I refuse a request such as that?"  The sarcastic voice replied.

        <P>Neuvau squinted at the darkness in an attempt to see better.  A figure slowly began to resolve itself from the darkness.  As it grew more distinct Neuvau's eyes widened in horror.
</P>
        "No!"  She exclaimed.

        <P>The creature in the form of a man approached the helpless necromancer.  Neuvau could not contain her fear and trembled uncontrollably.
</P>
        "Th-th-th-the D-d-d-dem-m-mon!"  She sobbed. "M-m-m-malg-g-gorm!"

        <P>Malgorm smiled as only Malgorm can.  "Ah, it is good to be recognized!"
</P>
        The Demon stepped forward and gently placed his palm against Neuvau's cheek.  Neuvau could do nothing more than sob.

        <P>"My dear Neuvau," Malgorm began, "I have one, last message for you to deliver."
