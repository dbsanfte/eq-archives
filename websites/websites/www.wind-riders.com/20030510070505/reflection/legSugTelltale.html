                 <P>The Heart of the Winds shuddered from the sudden chill gust, and Sugan Imshee'Cro's
                 eyes turned to the direction of the black clouds of her beloved plains involuntarily.
                 Female logic told her it was a dark omen. Normally, Karana's blessings cheered her,
                 but something was wrong. Canelon Lightweaver, her guardian and recently admitted
                 Suitor, looked warily up from searching the dead scarecrow at Sugan. Cane squinted
                 to read her eyes, but to no avail.</P>
                 "Sugan, what's the matter?" He asked with concern. Cane's shift from the ground to
                 her side was instantaneous; graceful, even for a high elf. She seemed to shrink away
                 from his touch though. He frowned worriedly.
                 <P>The girl's blue green eyes widened slowly, and her hand wandered up to her forehead.
                 The whispers in her thoughts grew a bit louder every day, but for all of today she was
                 making out the words. Frightening promises... in a voice she knew quite well. They all
                 sounded like Faileas.</P>
                 Her twin brother Faileas, who'd abandoned her long ago for the path of their birthright.
                 Even their name meant cursed blood. To be an Imshee'Cro was to serve
                 Bertoxxulous. And as everyone knew, it was avoidable only by death... and, of
                 course, by Sugan and her strong willed Paladin heart. Thus far, anyway.
                 <P><I>"s-s-suuuggaan.."</I> the dark whispers chanted, <I>"h-heeedd your callinggg.. and jooiin
                 the sshadows. come. back to. me"</I> Sugan closed her eyes tightly and willed it away.
                 That always worked. But instead, the next wave dizzied her. <I>"you cannot resisssst it"</I>
                 She grasped her head at the temples and curled up, whimpering. "Faileas, go away"
                 she begged. Canelon didn't know what to do. He knelt beside her, stroked her hair
                 and tried to reach her face. "Please Sug, what's wrong? Tell me..."</P>
                 Sugan shook herself. "Failea-oh Karana, It's Faileas- it's his voice, and I can't-"
                 <P><I>"i am not faileasss"</I> The breezy voice hissed. And as soon as it had come, the voice
                 vanished.</P>
                 <P>It began to rain.</P>
                 Sugan froze, as if testing the air for something, and then slowly unfurled herself. She
                 took deep breathes and looked with wide eyes at Cane. "I don't know, Cane. That
                 was strange." The girl straightened herself and took on an air of slight indifference.
                 <P>Sugan was a tomboy, and always tried to keep herself as tough as her barbarian friend
                 and officer, Ralnia Lionkin. It was thoughts of her protective Ralnia that kept her
                 together now. "I'm fine now though, thanks. Shall we?" Sugan calmly smiled.</P>
                 The high elf looked skeptical, but silently followed her lead. Sugan finished searching
                 the dead scarecrow for sellables, and stalked off deliberately. She was heading for one
                 of the guarded traveler's towers, known to locals as "Towertoo". The evening grew
                 darker, as the sun behind the storm left the land to an early night.
                 <P>Once at Towertoo, the knights met up with a surprise. A childhood friend of Sugan's
                 by the name of Surge was milling rather aimlessly, grumbling about the stupid dim
                 lantern he possessed. After Sugan laughingly gave him a spare stone of light, she
                 noticed the haggard condition he was in. The young warrior looked like he'd come
                 from a three-day vacation at Unrest. She questioned him. Surge started into a tale of
                 woe about relationships, and also the nightmares he was having of his family's death by
                 grizzly...</P>
                 Canelon watched carefully as Sugan comforted her friend Surge. There was still
                 something uneasy about her movements; her tone of voice, he noticed. He smiled
                 grimly at a joke...
                 <P>"No, that's all past and done. You need someone better for you anyway, Surgeo~"
                 Sugan grinned, exposing Surge's weak spot.</P>
                 "Hey!! Don't EVER call me that! I hate that name!" Surge grinned back, adding:
                 "Sugar".
                 <P>"Surgeo!" "Sugar!" "SURGEO!!" "SUGAR!!" ...the retort continued. Somewhere
                 during this the evening's rain came to an end.</P>
                 "At least Surgeo's your real Na-" Sugan halted, her vision flashing negative. The black
                 wind howled...voices came back.
                 <P><I>"s-s-suuggaan imssssshee'cro"</I> it slithered, <I>"ccome to me..i am nnot yourr
                 bbrotherr..faileasss iss herre with mee. waiting for you"</I> Sugan's armor seemed to
                 be pulling her somewhere. To the city; to Qeynos and it's sewers and it's decay ridden
                 temple of the plaguebringer. The girl staggered in discord a few steps for what she
                 thought was the tower entrance. Surge's jaw dropped; Cane jumped to steady Sug-</P>
                 "Who are you then?!" Sugan screamed, "WHO?"
                 <P>The voices answered at the same time Canelon grabbed her arm, <I>"i aam you"</I></P>
                 Sugan moaned softly, which became a loud cry of anger as forgotten fears became a
                 reality. She knew what had happened. All along, really. With haunted tear-filled eyes
                 and shaking hands, she turned to Canelon and took off her ring. Sugan held the silver
                 promise ring in front of the elf's angelic face and whispered, "I can't be with you."
                 <P>Cane grew unbearably weak as Sugan dropped his ring to the ground. She turned
                 away muttering, "I was fooling myself to think I ever could..." He watched in shock as
                 the tormented girl ran into the night. Then, pausing only to pick up the precious ring,
                 Canelon followed her.</P>
                 Whether it was the laughing night winds or the dancing shadows, he found no trace of
                 Sugan.
