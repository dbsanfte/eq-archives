                      <P>Jamier stood in the blistering hot sun of Ro looking in horror at the undead
                      walking freely about the land.
                      “What do you see poor misguided one?” the voice spoke in a slow tactical
                      whisper. Jamier turned to see a face an exact replica of his own. The eyes
                      vacant and emotionless. The wizard stood there with an almost leering smile on
                      his face as he robes flowed in the desert winds. Bracing himself for the
                      unknown he clasped tightly at his sword. “I see darkness”. Jamier turned his
                      back to the wizard disturbed by his appearances.</P>

                      “My mistress would find it amusing that one of your kind should wear the
                      badge of the wind riders”. Jamier stiffened almost not knowing what to expect.
                      “Oh yes! What did you find malcron?” a voice whispered. A sensuous voice
                      that tantalized Jamiers male spirit and yet repulsed him at the same time.
                      “Oh look it’s a poor misguided one.” Jamier for a moment felt fear as the Dark
                      elven woman sniffed closely about his neck. The first thing he noticed were the
                      eyes so unnatural so iridescent hidden behind the arcane skull shaped helm.

                      <P>“Milady envy!” he saw the woman turn and kneeled reverently before a
                      shadowknight Jamier sensed had great power. Jamier closed his eyes as he
                      memorized the curves of the black armor. Behind her stood Arithorn a wind
                      rider from the day before now wearing the flag of the Shadows.The ever
                      feared shadows.</P>
                      “I do not fear you” Jamier whispered but it came out weak.

                      <P>Jamier found new strength as Annaconda showed even though she was a thorn
                      in the young mans side. Jamier lashed at arithorns honor. The barbarian pulled
                      his blade; the lady Envy stayed her slave’s hand. Jamier was confused by the
                      barbarian’s insane gleam in his eye. Suddenly Envy spoke the name
                      “Silverann”, and Jamiers mind became clouded to the events.</P>

                      Jamier awoke to his senses alone with Laele and malcron sitting next to him.
                      “What are you milady?” he finally asked. She only smiled as she drew malcron
                      close and began to feed upon his life’s blood to Jamier’s horror. “I can teach
                      you so much misguided one.” Jamier felt drawn and repulsed his eyes filled
                      with wonderment and horror. She scoffed at him with a noted of seductive
                      mockery. He knew he wanted it.

                      <P>Jamier pricked his finger with his dagger and painted her lips red with his
                      blood, she sucked his finger greedily and licked her lips craving for the taste of
                      more. He felt himself pull into kiss her. The taste of his own blood and
                      malcron's still on her lips. She invited him. She reached her arms out to
                      embrace him. “My god!” he thought, “what am I doing!” He pulled back
                      quickly.</P>

                      “I smell your fear young one.come follow me into the shadows” Jamier with
                      every attempt stood his ground. “Follow me Warrior!” the wizard beckoned
                      him. He followed them both to his west commons homeland.

                      <P>Jamier was confused he felt desire he felt rage. The stood before an orc camp,
                      Jamier watched in awe at the wizard’s power. They both taunted him with the
                      darker desires he knew lay deep within him. Jamier found his lips meeting the
                      lips of malcron's. He stood shocked and pulled back. He was afraid he didn’t
                      know what was happening to him. Laele Laughed, as she looked at malcron
                      “Kiss him!” Malcron stepped forward and with grace grabbed Jamier’s hair
                      and tilted his head back. Kissing him deeply and yet without passion. Malcron
                      stepped back as Laele smiled. “See you can never hide what you are Jamier”.
                      Jamier choked at her voice. “You are tier’dal and nothing can erase that”
                      Jamier knew he enjoyed it and could only lie to himself at the moment.</P>

                      Jamier’s eyes opened again shaking the memory “you may defeat me lanys,
                      but in doing so you will only make me grow stronger!” His words at the
                      moment lacked confidence and she knew it.
                      <P>“You are Tier’Dal Jamier in the name of innoruk I shall pray for your accursed
                      soul!” Her voice almost matched that with the flashback of Laele. “NO! I have
                      faith in my god I shall take the Paladins sword where he fell and carry on!”
                      …The laughter that came from her made his body ache. “AND YOU WILL
                      LIE ATOP OF HIM JAMIER!” her voice echoed through the nektulos
                      Forrest. Jamier knew he was about to die a part of him feared it. Another part
                      denied it. His eyes met that of Envy’s …her smile matching those of the
                      countless others as they chanted in the revival of innoruks dark child. Hey
                      could only pray. His eyes remained glossed for the challenge before him. It
                      was true he felt the pull of evil. Then he remembered why he was here. He
                      glances back in his mind at the paladin Sugan. Her smile her dream. There was
                      strength inside of Jamier yet.</P></DIV></TD>
