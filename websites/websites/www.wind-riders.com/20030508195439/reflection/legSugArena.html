                 <P>...I gathered Kinor, my champion, and Samasa, my healer and left for the Arena. Right
                 outside by the campfire was Faileas, (who came to ensure I walked away safely, as
                 per family respect) with his follower, Vuer, and Silverann. I was also surprised to see
                 Serenade... Upon entering the arena, we were met by followers of the Demon who
                 warned us away. Although unsettling, we had not yet heard from Malgorm himself, and
                 so continued on. The Disciples raised swords to us at first, so we retreated... but then
                 Malgorm spoke from the throne, ordering them to escort us to him. The group of us
                 took a great risk by doing so, for we spotted many of Malgorm's men placed in the
                 distance. </P>

                 The demon stood before the seat of honor in the arena, and glared at us as he spouted
                 his sermon of hate and disease. My brother traded words with him, as they had
                 differences of oppinion lately on the path of their god, Bertoxxulous. Faileas claimed
                 Malgorm was tainted with the hate of Innoruuk's teachings, and that his vision of mass
                 death was contrary to what the plaguebringer desired. Malgorm almost gleefully
                 agreed, claiming a newfound hate and respect for the god, Innoruuk. 

                 <P>I of course was sickened by such a discussion, but with such odds there was little
                 chance my words would be heard. Then the demon went on to tell a little of what he
                 found in the texts of the Book of Azzothoth. This book apparently contained much of
                 the history of House Imshee'Cro, as well as chronicles of the curse and the demon
                 Azzothoth himself. (So far, I've been rather unsuccessful in finding peices of this book
                 myself, or stopping Malgorm from finding it.) He has two of the three parts... and told
                 us that they revealed that He was the original bearer of the curse. If this is true, it
                 means that once, long ago, Malgorm was a man who made an impossible bargain to
                 resurrect his dead love, and ended up losing his soul and cursing the family. Our
                 ancestor. </P>

                 We didn't have much time to let the shock sink in however, because the Demon
                 ordered his minions to attack us, only raising a sword to Faileas if he chose to fight
                 them. Of course Faileas did in my defense, so the Wind Riders and Shadow Striders
                 for once battled on the same side. I was lucky enough to escape the melee, but
                 noticed my companions were not with me. Faileas was staggering out of the place with
                 barely a tinge of life, and near him one of the Disciples started chanting into a spell I
                 new would be his death. I caught my brother from falling, and with a quick prayer to
                 Karana, summoned spirit to restore his health fully. Seeing that I intended to go back
                 for Kinor and Samasa, Faileas pushed me away, and went in for them himself. By this
                 time Wind Riders were gathering near the doors, awaiting orders and daring anyone to
                 threaten me there. The fighting stopped. 

                 <P>With an amused tone, the Demon demanded that I surrender or Kinor and Faileas
                 would die. The two of them stood rooted in place by magicks. Kinor was seething
                 with barbaric rage, cursing Malgorm with every breath. Faileas stood with darkened
                 eyes, calmly and coldly scheming his vengeance. I felt my blood turn to ice at the
                 thought of surrender, but there was no other way. The two of them were escorted past
                 me as I walked once again to the throne of blood. Then Malgorm stopped with a
                 sudden idea, and called for Faileas to come and face me in battle... to redeem himself
                 with my death. Faileas refused in no uncertain terms, then suddenly Serenade
                 appeared beside me. I begged him to go, but his reply was lost in the chaos when the
                 demon ordered us all to die. </P>

                 Serenade and I fought them off as best we could, as he tried to help me out of there.
                 What happened after this is recollections of others, because I lost all strength soon
                 after. I remember feeling the sting of many spells, and fighting off the magick that tried
                 to bind me to the ground. It seems I was knocked unconcious when mysteriously
                 Malgorm had a change of plan. He blinked beside us, picked me up, and teleported
                 from the battle. As I had disappeared, the Wind Riders standing nearby assumed I
                 was dead when I fell, and attacked immediately. Events in the bloodsoaked arena after
                 that are unclear. I awoke in North Karana to see Malgorm smug with amusement, but
                 also some shock. I'm wishing now that I'd had more life in me, so I could have found
                 out why. I do not know why my life was spared. 

                 <P>Perhaps the Demon found a reason for me to live. Perhaps it was that he wanted to
                 take it himself, but didn't get a chance... As Silverann showed up soon after. There
                 were some words exchanged, and I was beginning to make the Demon angry with the
                 hope that he could be saved. Seemingly out of nowhere Kinor flew into Malgorm, and
                 they battled. Someone helped me escape. I would have given anything now to have
                 taken Kinor's place. He saved my life by giving his own... Malgorm killed him, but was
                 weakened enough from the fight that he had to disappear. </P>

                 We gathered around Kinor's body in fear, for I'd heard his spirit say the Tribunal
                 called for him. If that was so, he could not be resurrected by the powers of a cleric.
                 Samasa fell pale at his voice too, and there was much sadness. His father Clanaugh
                 was also there when Kinor's spirit presented itself before us, and said his goodbyes.
                 He asked Samasa to move on, and told us not to lose hope, for he had a purpose
                 where he was. With faith that someday maybe he would return, we all bade Kinor a
                 sad farewell.</DIV></TD>
