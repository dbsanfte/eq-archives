							"Keeping in touch with Norrath's traveling heroes"
							<BR><BR><b>PALADIN MURDER BLAMED ON DISMAL RAGE</b> Early this morning the body of Marr's Paladin, Abratham Delhen, was found deep in Freeport's sewers, nailed to a wall. Apparently the man died a quick death after a struggle, however upon divining resurrection, clerics discovered that Delhen's soul was missing. The Hall of Truth has decreed this unspeakable crime against them was an act of those ungodly villains, Innoruuk's Dismal Rage.
							<BR><BR>What the Hall of Truth failed to mention though, was the note found with Delhen's body. Some discreet Wind Rider detective agency unearthed this important clue about the paladin, which may lead to his questionable character… and the anonymous vigilante who killed him. According to the note, (which is now in the possession of Lady Sugan Imshee'Cro,) Delhen was one of a mysterious circle of corrupt paladins who sought to end evil's tyranny by striking at the "source": torturing & killing young children and women in the families of known villains. When asked to comment about this note, the Hall of Truth said it was a fraud created by the Militia to stir trouble.
							<BR><BR>Rumors say that a High Priest of the Marr Temple received a similar note along with the detailed battle plan against the marked women and children, though no one can confirm or falsify this yet. <i>- Kokiri Windrider</i>
							<BR><BR><b>DARK PRINCE'S ATTACK ON FELWITHE</b> Thought both dead and harmless at times, Neriak's Prince Darain Thex made his vile comeback against the high elven city of Felwithe. Ignoring fair warning by Exodus Weaver and long-time hunter of Thex, Phenix Stormryder, the city's guards regretted their decision later when the army of darkness swept through them with black magics and blacker swords. It was an unfortunate night that came with little time for reinforcements to be called upon. 
							<BR><BR>Damage to the city itself was considered massive, and when forces arrived there was nothing for them to do but lend their hands to recovery. Jerhyn Darkrain headed up the Wind Rider salvage team, though only a few remain as the city seems underway to its recovery. Currently, Stormryder continues his search for justice against Thex. Reminiscent of the demon Malgorm Azzothoth's wrongdoings, Thex' deed will be one that is mourned and sought for vengeance throughout the annals of time. <i>- dictated by Glaring Sparkles</i>
							<BR><BR><b>FESTIVAL OF BRELL</B> Come one, come all! It's the thousandth anniversary of 'The Festival of Brell'! Imagine an entire city full of merry dancing, ale like a river flooded, and drunken dwarves… and you'll know what Kaladim will look like during this most festive of celebrations! There won't be a dry palate in the house, so if you fancy a break from everyday life then Butcherblock is the place to be.
							<BR><BR>Wind Rider Querus Allighari stands watch over the jovial city as rumors say Darain Thex will make his next attack there. Whether dwarven King Stormhammer heeds the warnings remains to be seen, but be assured that the Wind Riders will be alert to events as they unfold. <i>- dictated by Glaring Sparkles</i>
							<BR><BR><b>WR CHILD FOUND DEAD</b> Recently the body of a gnomish child, Camelai Icewind, was found on the doorstep of the Wind Riders' North Freeport guildhall, stabbed to death. Camelai was the adopted daughter of seeming reformed killer and barbarian Arithorn Icewind, who rescued the girl after an attack on Ak'Anon killed her parents. The man who found her body, Asharam Silverheart, claimed to see a smallish shadowy figure lay her at the doorstep and escape despite his attempts to apprehend him or her. The young Icewind girl was unable to be resurrected because, as it was explained by Wind Rider clerics, children rarely have the chance to attach themselves well enough into life to be called back.
							<BR><BR>Several questions arise regarding this horrific incident: did some zealotous faction kill young Camelai as a message to her backslidden father? Or perhaps, as she was placed near the guildhall, as a message or threat to Wind Riders? Or, as damnable as it may sound, was Arithorn Icewind himself the murderer? And who was the shadowy figure? Investigations will tell more, but one thing is certain… It will be a sad day made on Camelai Icewind's funeral. <i>- Kokiri Windrider</i>
							<BR><BR><b>PLAGUE WORSENS</b> The Bloodsabers: a malicious group of deviants that live below Qeynos, conspiring the downfall of Antonius Bayle, and worshipping that vile plaguebringer, Bertoxxulous. For a while it was thought their plague of vengeance had lifted, but the remission was brief and now it's returned… <i>with</i> a vengeance. Any farmer on Karana's plains can tell you that the Bloodsabers' threefold plague began as a result of their dark priest, Mordavin Telase, being executed for his crimes. What the farmers can't tell you, is how anyone plans to stop it. 
							<BR><BR>The first tier of this plague comes in the form of rabid animals, something Qeynos natives have dealt with for years now, but in contained instances. Take it from this reporter though, being chased by a Rabid Griffon is nothing to laugh at. Recent attacks by diseased animals have gone up in North and West Karana by at least forty percent.
							<BR><BR>Poisonous mist floating in the skies above the plains is the second tier. Whenever it rains, this poison is brought down on crops and people alike, causing incurable illnesses and shortage of food. The pinch is being felt as far as Freeport, as the price of rarer delicacies have skyrocketed, and even common food is foreseen as becoming under stocked.
							<BR><BR>Third and perhaps scariest of the tiers is Pestilence. Huge, disgusting insects erupt in swarms across the lands, tearing apart whatever they come across and spreading yet more disease. In recent times these attacks have increased in power and number, leaving anyone's guess as to what will come of Karana's sacred lands should this plague continue. <i>- Sirynn Windweaver</i>
							<BR><BR><b>KING ORDERS QEYNOS HELPERS KILLED</b> According to a publication in Neriak, which came into our possession through anonymous means, King Naythox Thex has decreed that any Teir'Dal found helping the people of Qeynos during their time of distress will be put to death. What this means for the Wind Rider dark elves, who were already either hunted or on dubious grounds in their homeland, is more trouble.
							<BR><BR>Only Kathlean, (former Shadow Strider Katt Z'Ress,) was available for her feelings on the matter, but this reporter's not yet gotten the courage to go and speak to her. In the meanwhile, lets offer all our support and prayers to the Teir'Dal Wind Riders like Kathlean, Jere, Nilenya, and Jeramy in this fearful age. <i>- Kokiri Windrider</i>
							<BR><BR><b>WR GIRLS STILL SICK OR MIA</b> Lady Shenira Annua'Ledra, wife of Latharos D'Narin, is still at large after her attack on Ninna Shu'Raven. The brutal attack was in response to the assassination attempt at her wedding, which resulted in the murder of Shenira's unborn child. Sources say that Lady Annua'Ledra was victim of a kind of mind poison, which has caused her to falsely blame Wind Riders for betrayal and seek aid from the necromancer Talisson BoneDancer; the same man who organized the attack by Shu'Raven in the first place. Since falling in cohorts with the vile Shadow Striders, Lady Annua'Ledra has committed several crimes, the most well known being her murder of Querus Allighari. Allighari is thankfully alive now, though still suffering the partial loss of his soul. Knight of Storms Sugan Imshee'Cro has gone in search of the rogue child of Karana and given orders that anyone apprehending Lady Annua'Ledra should come to her. Miss Imshee'Cro has also enlisted the help of Karana's Warder, Raenewae Stormryder.
							<BR><BR>Not a trace has been found yet of Disciple of Storms Laneni Grimfist, avid Wind Rider and once-wife of Thryn Taciturn. Gallah, the fiancée of Elryn Omniscience and loving mother, was assigned to look into her disappearance, going even so far as to question Faileas Imshee'Cro of the Shadow Striders, but as yet remains answerless. Grimfist has been missing in action for many months now, the only clue coming from Lord Faileas himself during a confrontation in the plagued Karana plains, where he spitefully asked "how she was".
							<BR><BR>Though various failed or half-successful saves were attempted, the sister of Wind Rider Elistat Soulwhisperer has once again been swept into the Shadow Striders' fold. Formerly an Everhart of Kelethin, Areanna Shadowhart stands again as one of Faileas Imshee'Cro's apostles, although witnesses report a dazed, lost look crossing her face. Continued efforts by her brother and the rest of the Wind Riders will be made to stop this obvious evil blinding the innocent Areanna, and bring her back to us.
							<BR><BR>Has Areanna Shadowhart's mind been poisoned in the same manner as Lady Shenira Annua'Ledra? Is Laneni Grimfist one of three victims in some heinous plot by the Shadow Striders? Hopefully these questions and more will be answered in the near future. <i>- dictated by Glaring Sparkles</i>
							<BR><BR><b>ALLIANCES FORMED</b> People of Norrath are banding together in the face of evil. One can always be assured of good news when alliances of this nature are made, and in the Wind Riders' case it is no different. Recently, Lady Sugan Imshee'Cro has gone to lengths to secure the friendships of the diverse group Dreamweavers, an organization of stereotypically evil people fighting for good called Dark Paradox, and a regiment of Jaded Flame of Athanasia nicknamed "Warriors of the Jaded Flame".
							<BR><BR>Kathlean of the Wind Riders was the contact for our newfound allies the Dreamweavers, who seemed exhuberant at the prospect and hope to hold an event to further extend our friendship soon. Master bard and Genesis Weaver Thryn Taciturn was the one who referred Dark Paradox to us, although the alliance has some doubt associated with it, possibly because of the dark nature of their guildmembers. Only one example, Phenix Stormryder disagrees with the act of trust, although has accepted the decision on wary terms. 
							<BR><BR>The latest alliance with Warriors of the Jaded Flame is also a rather shaky one, as it was brought to attention by former Wind Rider Jereel Hunter. He and Lady Sugan tore at each other with heated words, as Hunter accused her of never taking enough action to prevent or avenge crimes, and she claimed he was ever too bloodthirsty and blind in his quest for misguided justice. Will this one work out? Only time will tell. <i>- Sirynn Windweaver</i>
							<BR><BR><b>MYSTERY OF VERYS UNFOLDING</b> It has been months since reformed necromancer Verys Shadowcat was brutally murdered by Neriak loyalist Shadow Striders. It has been weeks since seemingly the same Verys Shadowcat walked out of the Temple of Marr, mysteriously returned to life. Her friends and colleagues noted several small changes, but no real differences were shown until one evening when Shadowcat arrived under the pretence of aiding fellow Wind Rider Latharos D'Narin. 
							<BR><BR>D'Narin was confronting the infamous, and recently revived Shadow Strider Envy T'Druis about her knowledge regarding the criminal Talisson BoneDancer, when without warning, Shadowcat took up for the enemy. She then went on to reveal that she was not Verys at all, but in fact another Teir'Dal necromancer whose soul had been returned to life through the dead woman's body, in the same fashion as scorned Demi-goddess Lanys T'Vyl. During this revelation, in which the lord of the Shadow Striders Faileas Imshee'Cro appeared, D'Narin took the opportunity to escape. We learned that the identity of the Teir'Dal in Verys' body is one Verianos Thex, a duchess of Neriak and arguably the mother of Envy T'Druis.
							<BR><BR>Later, Kathlean answered the question that still remained. What happened to the real Verys? Apparently, the druidess Calris was sent to us with those answers already within her. Young Calris has had several clues that indicate she herself is the real Verys Shadowcat, including but not limited to dreams of the past, picky kitty Bast's friendship, and knowledge of Neriak in unexplained clarity. Upon discovering this, Lady Sugan offered to find a spiritualist or shaman who could help unlock the reasons behind this transition but Calris declined, stating that she'd rather discover these answers naturally, all in due time. <i>- Thryn Taciturn</i>
							<BR><BR><b>STORYTELLING A SUCCESS!</b> On the night of Tuesday the 12th, Wind Riders gathered alongside friend and foe alike for the traditional Peaceful Storytelling. This tradition began with the Sisterhood long ago, and was recently reawakened by them as well; unbeknownst to the gathered, on the very same night! Many good stories were told within the two circles of the Tunnel of Ro, along with dark beatific poems from Aleksy of Ancienne Noblesse, Lady Sugan's sadly unsuccessful magic trick, and even a cut-loose dance! 
							<BR><BR>Willam Darkbow of Kelethin inspired this dance and called upon my musical talents so that the ladies present could frolic to his free-spirited lyrics. It was one of the highlights of the evening, despite a kick in the shin I received from Lord Faileas, who refused to bless us with his dancing. Let's hope that next time, the Shadow Striders bring more entertainment and less elf blood, as the Iksar Zebkanir flaunted drinking. <i>- Sirynn Windweaver</i>
