								<B>History:</B>  The earliest memories that I have are of waking up and seeing Azianya for the first time. I had been fighting a hill giant in the Northern Plains of Karana, and he knocked me out. Azi saw this, and saved my life. 
					Unfortunatly, the blow had caused a loss of memory. I did not know who I was, where I was from and who my family was. Azi took me in, and eventually, we fell in love. 
					<BR><BR>The story is typical. We saved up and bought a small piece of land and settled down there.
					I did not search for my past, maybe because I secreatly knew there was something wrong, or maybe because I loved Azi too much to leave her. I spent the next three years of my life with her, and we had a son, Dairlynn. 
					But this life of bliss soon ended.
					<BR><BR>As Azi went to put Dairlynn to sleep, soft knock came from the door. 
					I got up, and went to answer it. There was standina young human, who was slightly taller than me, with an eyepathc and hair as light as the grains Azi and I grew. 
					<BR><BR>'Can you spare space in your barn for a stranger?'
					<BR><BR>I looked out to the west, and saw a storm on the horizon. The barn would be leaky and drafty tonight, barely fit for the animals inside it.
					'Come inside my friend. The barn is no place for you tonight. We have an extra room that you can sleep in'
					<BR><BR>With that stranger smiled evilly. He moved with such speed that he did not seem to move, he was at once in front of me, and then behind me.
					He pulled out a blunt weapon and before he knocked me out, said, 'It is time for you to re-pay your father's debts'
					<BR><BR>I heard Azi and the baby scream as he clubbed me.
					<BR><BR>When I next came to, the storm was upon us, and the strange stood over my wife, who was crouched ont he dark soil. He drew his sword, about to bring it down...
					'Monster!' I shouted as I hurled a spell at him.
					<BR><BR>He turned to me, and sniggered. He began casting a spell, and I felt my life drain away.
					I knew I could not beat this knight of the shadows, so I tried to envision one my spells to get Azi and I out of there.
					I began casting, hurrying through the delicate ritual.
					<BR><BR>The knight was faster. He shot a bolt of posion at me, and I was stunned.
					I was forced to watch, powerless as he drove his sword through my wife's stomache.
					Then I noticed movement in his arms. Was he carrying an extra set of clothes?...
					<BR><BR>No, he had Dairlynn with him!
					<BR><BR>He turned to me, 'Your son shall make a fine apprentice. Thank you for your donation to our cause.' 
					<BR><BR>With that he ran of to the west laughing. 
					I ran to Azi's side. She was dieing. I tried to heal her, but it was to no avail.
					<BR><BR>'Quit it. I am to far gone. Just keep up the search for our son'
					<BR><BR>'No. I refuse to let you die' I felt helpless...
					<BR><BR>'Querus, I love you. Just do one thing' 
					<BR><BR>'Yes?'
					<BR><BR>'Don't stop living. Go on without me. Find another love, another happiness, but don't forget our son and our life' She gave a feeble cough, and then breathed her last.
					<BR><BR>I looked at her in disbelief. Her blood mixed with the rain, satiating the thisty earth. I took up a shovel, and gave her a burial according to the Feir'Dal traditions, even though she was human. I walked away from her grave knowing that I would find my son again.
					<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> A most helpful person, Querus. Too helpful, in fact... sometimes I wonder what he's sacrificing to be so much help.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> An annoying little thing who manages to teleport at all the wrong times. *smiles* But at least he knows when to give up peacefully.<BR><BR>
