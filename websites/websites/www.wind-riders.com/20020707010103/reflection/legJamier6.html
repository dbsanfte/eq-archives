                      Fearful Hearts

                      <P>Jamier waited by the western gate for Sugans arrival. He watched as the
                      western gates bustled with the sounds and cheers exaulting the death of the
                      Fears Lady vox of the Permafrost keep. The cheers sounded across the world
                      as crier went from city to city praising the brave knights who put and end to
                      her rain of terror. Jamier smiles at the tales but suddenly stopped as he felt
                      something lurking, watching him from the darkness of the shadows. His palms
                      began to sweat with uneasiness. Suddenly he jumped to a tap on is shoulder
                      and turned with grace. It was the lady Sugan giggleing at the reaction of the
                      knight. Jamier blushed.</P>

                      “I am so glad you came, please follow!”
                      His voice as usual ever so soft as he grabbed her hand and led her thru the
                      passages to the top of the guard tower.

                      <P>Jamier sat down on the hard stone and paused for a long moment deep in
                      thought. Sugan sat with him curious as the what the Dark Elf had to say. Jamier
                      looked nervous, almost worried, then finally he spoke.</P>

                      “we have been always able to tell each other anything right?”

                      <P>Not knowing brought this on sugan replied

                      “I would like to think so”</P>

                      Jamier knew what he had to say and was afraid to say it. He couldn’t help but
                      to feel he would be rejected.
                      “I have a confession”

                      <P>Sugan looked up.</P>

                      “M’Lady I am afraid, I am not as brave as you think I am”

                      Sugan really wanted to hear this now.

                      <P>“I am afraid of the shadows, to fight them to face them is like looking into a
                      mirror at myself and to see the reflection of everything that I hate.”</P>

                      Jamier continued to tell her the full story of the priest he killed, about Xellos
                      his brother seeking revenge for the death of his twin chrystallis. Each moment
                      he reflected only helped to force a single tear from his eye. Sugan reached
                      over and wiped the tear gently with her finger. She also was deep into
                      remembering her own torment.

                      <P>“It doesn’t end there” he continued to pause, obvious as to what he was
                      worried about what he had to say next.</P>

                      “Jamier Tell me!” her vioce insistant to hear more.

                      <P>“My father is within the Striders”</P>

                      “Who is he Jamier?” a note of almost urgance coming from the the paladin

                      <P>Jamier drew his knees to his chest and closed his eyes.</P>

                      “I….I…I..am afraid” he stuttered.

                      <P>Sugan looked a little desperate
                      “Tell me now Jamier!”</P>

                      Jamier found the strength as he softly whispered the name “Darain”

                      <P>Sugan sat back clenching the hand the held Jamier’s tear into a balled fist of
                      anger. She for a moment began cursing in high elven praying that Jamier
                      wouldn’t be able to understand. How can she tell him that she swore to kill his
                      father. How can she tell him her of her plans to let the cursed shadowkinght
                      rest in a pool of his own blood. She despised Darain with all her heart. She turned
                      around after a deep few moment in thought and took Jamiers hand.</P>

                      “perhaps he can be saved” her vioce trying to sound hopeful.

                      <P>Jamier knew he couldn’t be saved.

                      The both just sat there in long silence , afraid to talk, afraid to move, afraid to
                      say anything. Jamier leaned his head up against the wall listening to the
                      continueing shouting and commotions from the streets below.</P>

                      “Jamier?”

                      <P>Jamier squeezed her hand. “Yes M’lady?”</P>

                      “I wanted to give you something very old and very special”

                      <P>Jamier looked at the prayer beads that sugan had given him and silvently
                      wrapped them around his hand as if they were to guard his heart.</P>

                      “Faileas and I made them for my mother when we were children, she always
                      wore them around her neck. She said that since they were made with such
                      love they were endowed with a great healing power”

                      <P>Jamiers eyes lowered at the words, a sense of unworthiness about him</P>

                      Sugan only squeezed his hands and whispered
                      “Paladins need all the healing they can get”

                      <P>Jamier didn’t feel like a Paladin. There was no halo of holiness about him. All
                      he ever wanted was for it all to stop. He must have mumbled something under
                      his breath. Sugan was looking at him with concern.</P>

                      “Wha..Wha..What do you mean you wish it all to end?” her voice almost
                      quivering

                      <P>Jamiers eyes widened .. he shook his head “No no M’lady..I never meant it
                      like that.”</P>

                      Jamier took her other hand into his own. “Someday I pray for a day where I
                      can wake up and watch the sunrise knowing I didn’t have to spill blood. To
                      have a good woman standing behind me. To watch children play, laugh and
                      sing free from the fear of shadows and darkening skies. To have a farm in the
                      rich lands of the Karanas.”

                      <P>Sugan just sat there letting the silence overtake her for the moment.</P>

                      “Jamier?”

                      <P>“Mmm?” he looked back up into her soft green eyes.</P>

                      “How many times can a person love?”

                      <P>Jamier almost didn’t know how to respond, he knew her pain.</P>

                      “Sweet princess, Someone like you and your soul can never stop loving. I
                      think the question should be phrased differantly. How many times can a person
                      be hurt before they stop living?”

                      <P>Sugan looked deep into his eyes searching, yet only found love and admiration
                      that this Dark Elf had for her.</P>

                      “I would want nothing more than to see you happy. I would give my left
                      testicle to see you happy”

                      <P>The tense moment was broken with Sugan’s laughter at the elf’s Comment.
                      Suddenly she fell silent as she heard him say.</P>

                      “I saw him, the Paladin in my dreams, the one that you love so much.”

                      <P>“your dreams?” she asked almost afraid to know</P>

                      “Yes I dreamed that you were going to leave us without saying goodbye”

                      <P>Sugan leaned back reflecting.</P>

                      “oh Jamier, your song, I heard your vioce so clearly!”

                      <P>“My voice was just one of many of the thousands that you affect just by a
                      mere passing, we are all connected, our songs to make the ballad of life.”</P>

                      She looked back into his eyes
                      “yes Jamier but yours was the loudest!”

                      <P>The moment was interupted with Kinor shouting their names “Jamier! Sugan!”</P>

                      Sugan jumped up with excitement as she exitedly ran down the steps
                      “Come Jamier! Our friends await!”

                      <P>He remained standing there..his hand streched for hers, but she was gone, and
                      he was left yearing.
                      His mind wandered to Ralnia’s rebirth, Sorcere’s prison. His hand balled into
                      a promising fist around Sugan's prayer bead necklace.<P>

                      “Oh what fearful hearts the shadows bring!”

                      <P>His eyes closed cherishing the few moments they had, knowing that they
                      haven’t even seen the beginning.</P></DIV></TD>
