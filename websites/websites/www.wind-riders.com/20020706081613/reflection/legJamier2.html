                      Jamier sat outside the hut, watching the sunrise over the West Commons. His
                      mind was filled with a deep enchanted moment as he played the lute and
                      listened to his Mothers Mystical song create a blue glitter of flashing lights to
                      surround them. He was dazzled by his mother, her music her Wisdom. Her
                      music always seemed to create a sense of healing deep within the soul. The
                      moment remained savored as he reached over and held her hand, and she
                      pulled him closer stroking his soft white hair. “Mother, where is Chrystallis?”
                      he asked in a concerned voice about his twin. “He is in Freeport child, learning
                      and studying as he should be. You know I sent him to the Priests of Marr.”
                      Mother seemed to never be worried; she had always trusted them. “I know
                      mother, I just worry he hasn’t come home or visited in nearly a year.” She
                      pulled Jamier tighter. “shhh.my love, you worry too much.i am sure he is fine
                      just overwhelmed with duties and initiation into the priesthood” she said with a
                      warm smile. She reached over and mussed up Jamiers hair and lightly tapped
                      him on the bottom. “Scoot scoot! Go and get yourself some breakfast” she
                      said with a tone of humor.

                      <P>Alaana Loved each of her son’s despite their dark elven color. It broke the
                      Wood elf’s heart that she couldn’t return home to kelethin with them. It had
                      been years since she had broken free of her bonds of slavery in Neriak. Often
                      she was humiliated by the tortures she suffered, but she wouldn’t trade her
                      son’s for all the platinum in Norath. She sighed as she watched the youngest
                      Jamier trail off into the hut. She was proud of him despite his ignorance the
                      surface world customs. He out of all the children seemed to have the most
                      understanding. A feeling of malcontent spread over her, always she will be
                      looking over her shoulder for their father, the shadowknight who wants them.</P>

                      Jamier Barged through the door Knocking Sarnael into the bowl of eggs he
                      had set out for breakfast. “Hey watch it!” it was obvious his older brother was
                      a little upset. Jamier laughed teasingly at his brother covered in eggs and the
                      flower caked all over his face and green robes. “Watcha making a new spell
                      with eye of newt?” he said still tauntingly. “You just watch where your going!”
                      Sarnael said with a growl as then enchanter handed over another bowl to his
                      pet to mix. Sarnael was the oldest of the sons, and perhaps the one most
                      sympathetic to their mothers problems. He is old enough to understand the
                      hardships set before them. He had helped his mother sneak the twins out of
                      neriak, and for that he knew he would be cursed. He didn’t care he was
                      agnostic. There is no god other than his studies. He set the plate of hotcakes
                      before Jamier and smiled at their mother standing in the doorway behind him.
                      He reached a hand out towards his mother and beckoned her to sit down. The
                      all sat down quietly as she spoke a moment of thanks and prayer. Jamier
                      couldn’t help but to stare at the empty chair of Chrystallis.

                      <P>After the active breakfast, Alaana picked up the dishes and watched as
                      Sarnael pulled the young Jamier away for his studies. She could only laugh at
                      Jamier's protests and excuses. “Yes” she thought to herself. “This is my
                      family”. Her laughter was interrupted by a knock at the door. She opened it,
                      looked and stopped cold in her tracks. ‘Arial!” she shouted with glee as she
                      wrapped her arms around the travel worn Paladins neck. The day was filled
                      with promises of karana.</P>

                      The boys listened that evening to tales of adventure and dragons as Sarnael
                      stoked the fire and Jamier sat in awe looking at the paladin’s flaming sword.
                      Jamier closed his eyes only dreaming of such a world of wonder that this man
                      had seen. The laughter, the comedy the tears. Jamier knew at that moment he
                      wanted to see it all. His heart ached for the lust of such experiences.

                      <P>The moment was stopped short as Alaana turned to set a glass on the table
                      and it slipped from her hands, shattering with a loud sound into a thousand
                      pieces as she fell to her knees her head reeling in confusion her side she
                      clasped tightly in pain. Jamier stood to his feet like a rabbit “Mother!” he
                      rushed to her aide. She could only stare at him unable to speak as she felt her
                      conscious mind slipping from her. Sarnael came with a wet cloth to wipe her
                      face. The Paladin kneeled down and looked grave. “We must get her to the
                      temple she is burning with fever!” The paladin shouted, as he wasted no time
                      wrapping her tightly in furs and strapping her to his horse.</P>

                      Sarnael and Jamier wasted no time in following. For the first time in his
                      Jamier's memory they were leaving the commonlands. But deep down Jamier
                      felt this was about to be the adventure he prayed for but didn’t want. They
                      walked for hours before they came to the city gates of western Freeport. It
                      was all that Jamier could do to hold back his tears of worry. He felt the
                      resident stare at his dark skin with contempt as he followed quietly behind the
                      paladin. “Ariel! Jamier! Sarnael! Over here hurry!” the voice shouted from the
                      crowds. Jamier looked up in surprise. It was Chrystallis. Chrystallis lead them
                      through a steady streamline of mazes. Then into the sewers. “Wait here Jamier,
                      and Sarnael.I will tend to her.” Mother trusted Chrystallis and why shouldn’t
                      they. Jamier and Sarnael waited half the night in silence, Praying for their
                      mothers well being. Chrystallis came out of the room shaking his head
                      solemnly. Jamier stood up in disbelief “NO!”…He rushed into the room to see
                      his mother lying there motionless. He reached for her hand it was cold, ever so
                      cold. Jamier laid his head softly onto her chest his horror confirmed. Not a
                      heart be could be heard. Jamier just clutched her tightly with all his strength
                      letting the sobs flow freely as Sarnael clasped his shoulder tightly trying to pull
                      him away. The sunrise of this morning wasn’t so bright as he watched the light
                      stream over the blazing flames of his mother’s body.

                      <P>Sarnael beckoned Jamier to come with him to the commonlands, but the boy
                      refused. He was determined to stay in Freeport a while with Chrystallis.
                      Sarnael could only shake his head and leave, he had to at least settle things
                      with their estate. Jamier just sat in the corner rocking for the day. Chrystallis
                      tried to convince him to eat, but Jamier refused to feel the pains of hunger.
                      Chrystallis was interrupted as a high elf came running in with a child. Jamier
                      looked at the little girl crying and clutching her arm. “She fell from a tree, can
                      you help her?” the high elven father looked with great concern. “All will be
                      well” Chrystallis replied in a soothing voice. Chrystallis raised his hands in
                      prayer as Jamier watched the little girl slip into the realm of death. A feeling of
                      confusion came over Jamier a s he heard the father scream “Ohh god no!” with
                      a Word of Smite the High Elf fell dead. The Mystical energies still swirling
                      around Chrystallis. “All will be well in the name of Bertoxxulous.” He said with a
                      reverent sadistic smile.</P>

                      Jamier stood to his feet in horror. “Chrystallis! How could you!” Jamier's
                      hands shaking as his voice filled with tears and sobs. Jamier could barely see
                      through his eyes, blinded by his own tears as his anger overwhelmed him.
                      Jamier reached for the sword on the wall and struck with all his might. Driving
                      the blade deep into His twin’s heart. Screaming in internal pain as Chrystallis
                      fell to the floor dead.
                      <P>A Haunting laughter came from the shadows, Jamier looked up to see the
                      figure cloaked in darkness. “You did as I anticipated my son!” Jamier froze but
                      only for a moment as he recognized the Hate filled voice of his father. Jamier
                      Bolted as he heard the shouts from the sewers to the streets “MURDERER!
                      MURDERER!” he ran his hands still dripping in his brother’s blood.</P>

                      Jamier didn’t know how far he ran, he knew he was no longer in the city, the
                      blood had dried, and the sword he had dropped long ago. Exhausted and lost
                      he fell to his knees at the ruins of an altar. He crawled into the fetal position
                      and cried, but there was no sense of comfort for him in the chill of this night.
                      “Jamier!” the voice echoed around him, loud and inhuman. Jamier thought he
                      was hallucinating. “Jamier! Stand up!” Jamier pulled himself to his feet the tears
                      still flowing freely. He looked around but saw none. Suddenly an inhuman
                      creature in a brilliant suite of armor appeared before him. “Jamier I offer you
                      the chance to avenge your mother…Do you concede to my will?” Jamier was
                      scared …he looked around and even pinched himself for a sense of reality.
                      The offer to do something about it was tempting. “I.I would do anything sir!”
                      he said with a stutter. “And so you shall Jamier D’phoenix!” Jamier sceamed
                      as out of nowhere a flood and wave of blood washed over his body. He could
                      feel himself drowning as his head reeled in pain with the visions of a thousand
                      wars. Jamier screamed again as he felt the pains of Weapons piercing and
                      slashing him, it felt like he was dying. “My god! Save me!” suddenly it
                      stopped. It all stopped and there was nothing but the sound of the morning
                      crickets. He stood there, his eyes blazing in a suite of blue armor. Bathed and
                      dripping in blood. Looking like the prince he was meant to be. It was at that
                      moment that the Obsidian knight was born. Jamier stood in silence. It didn’t
                      make the pain go away. He felt the sacrifice as he noticed he couldn’t hear his
                      mother song. There were no longer any spells to fill the boy’s mind. Only a
                      sword and blood.

                      <P>Jamier walked for days in a daze. His hunger ignored by the sense of reality.
                      The days turned into a month. And finally the gates of Freeport faced him
                      where he had murdered his brother. Jamier was about to turn away then he
                      saw her. Standing there…solemnly. He closed his eyes and heard something
                      he never heard before in his life. It was a song that could only be created by
                      the winds. He opened his eyes to notice there was no music. It was only in the
                      soul. Something urged him. He was drawn to her like no other.
                      “Do not turn around milady. Do not look!” Sugan's body stiffened, as she
                      smelled the scent of a Dark elf. “Milady I seek sanctuary!”</P>

                      “Yes!” Jamier thought that is how it all began. As he reopened his eyes to see
                      Lanys standing before him. He had grown a lot since the death of his mother.
                      He lifted his blade ready for the duel. He only smiled as the daughter of
                      Innoruk cursed his name. He was ready.</DIV></TD>
