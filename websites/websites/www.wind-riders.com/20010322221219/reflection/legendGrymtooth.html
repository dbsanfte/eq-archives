				                 <P>The troll looked about warily as his armored foot sunk into the muck of Innothule Swamp.  His nostrils were assaulted by the fetid odors of rot and decay.  Unidentifiable croaks and growls were heard clearly over the constant gurgling of the foul bog.  As he took all of this in, what must have been a smile crossed his face.  Grymtooth was home.</P>
								
								Gripping up his mighty axe, Grymtooth set off into the swamp.  The plates of his battered armor clinked together in time with the pace of his jog.  The sound was a warning to all that could hear it. A troll warrior was coming, best to get out of the way!
								
								<P>After less than an hour the troll slowed to a walk as he began searching the base of gigantic dead tree.  A few moments later he had found what he was seeking.  The moss-covered skull of a froglok lay hidden in a tangle of roots.  Grymtooth grinned as he stuck his gauntleted fingers into the eyesockets of the skull.  A barely audible click was quickly followed by the sound of creaking wood and scraping stone, as a previously unseen door yawned open before the warrior.  Light trickled out of the portal into the dismal gloom of the swamp.  A robed silhouette stood framed in that light.
								</P>
								"Welcome Grymtooth Grumbletummy."  the shadowed figure spoke in perfect trollish.  "You have been expected."
								
								<P>The troll squinted one eye at this unknown speaker, "Who are you that stands in the entrance to my grandfather's home and speaks my name as if I know you?"
								</P>
								The figure stepped softly out of the light.  As the shadows concealing the creature slid back, Grymtooth was surprised by what he saw.  A very young, female Erudite stood before him, her hands concealed together in the sleeves of her robe.
								
								<P>"I am Neuvau," the small human began, "apprentice necromancer of Bertoxxulous and student of Rankul the Scabbrous.  I bid you welcome into his home and health whilst you stay."
								</P>
								"Huh..." grunted Grymtooth, "I had no idea that my grandfather had taken on Erudite students.  Very well. Lead on Neuvau, I accept your invitation!"
								
								<P>That said, the small, dark-skinned human turned and started back into the tree with the large troll warrior close behind.  Neither bothered to look back as the door closed of it own accord.
								</P>
								The  inside of the tree revealed a much different scene than the swamps outside.  The massive trunk was hollow and contained a set of spiral stairs leading down.  Small motes of  reddish light hovered motionless at odd intervals here and there, dimly lighting the staircase.  Neither of the strange pair spoke as they followed the stairs down.  Eventually, the cramped stairway gave way to a large spacious chamber lit by more of the small red lights.  Although dim to human eyes, Grymtooth could see the room quite clearly.  It was roughly circular with several passages leading out.  A small fire burned in a stone hearth, taking the chill off the room.  Thick furs of various creatures lay covering the flagstones of the floor.  Several pieces of comfortable, troll-sized furniture were neatly placed about the room. Grymtooth noted that there were also smaller furnishings as well. Furnishings more suited to the small body of a human.  Grymtooth's
								musings were abruptly halted by the snake-like whisper of a voice he recognized only too well.
								
								<P>"Greetings my child." Rasped the voice.  "It is good to take in your scent once again!  Step into the room so that these old eyes can get the full measure of you."
								</P>
								Without speaking, Grymtooth complied with the wishes of the voice.  As he stepped into the room he looked to his right.  The stairs fell behind revealing another troll.  A very old and withered troll.
								Its green eyes glowed dimly in the darkened part of the room where it sat.  Grymtooth smiled as the troll came into view.
								
								<P>"Grampy!!"  Grymtooth exclaimed as he dropped his axe and strode toward the old troll with arms outstretched.
								</P>
								"Come give your old great-grandpa a hug young one!" Said the older troll as he stood to greet Grymtooth.
								
								<P>The two came together in the warm embrace of family reunited. After a moment the two separated as the older troll spoke.  "It is so good to see you child!  I have heard much of your adventures since you left!  But second hand tales are never as good as the original!  You must sit with me and tell me everything that has transpired since you tricked those fools in Grobb into letting you go explore.  I want to hear everything now, so leave nothing out!"
								</P>
								"Oh Grampy!" chuckled Grymtooth. "I have so much to tell you! But first we must follow troll tradition!"
								
								<P>The grandfather troll frowned, "Hurumph! A pox on troll tradition!  Troll tradition shall be the end of us all!" With that the old troll spat on the floor.
								</P>
								Grymtooth just grinned from ear to ear in response to his grandfather's tirade. "None the less, I will not enter the home of another troll without bringing him something to eat." he said.
								
								<P>"Bah!" crabbed the old troll. "I'm not hungry!!"
								</P>
								That brought a quickly stifled burst of laughter from the other room.
								
								<P>The old troll glared in the direction of the sound.  "What are you laughing at in there young apprentice?!  Do you think you have become familiar enough with your betters to laugh at them?!  Eh?!"
								</P>
								"I beg forgiveness Master Rankul!" said Neuvau as she stepped from the other room, wiping her hands on a dishtowel.  "I only thought of a humorous anecdote whilst I was preparing your dinner."
								
								<P>Rankul eyed his student sternly.  "Hmmmm, very well."  The troll spoke. "I shall not punish you, this time!  Now get back to your chores!"
								</P>
								Bowing, the young Erudite backed out of the room.  At the archway to what must have been the kitchens, the student paused, "But Master Rankul, since you are not hungry, perhaps I can go about my studies for the evening instead of finishing your dinner."
								
								<P>Grymtooth burst into laughter as his grandfather sat dumbfounded and gaped at the small human.  Neuvau found herself laughing as well. Grymtooth was laughing so hard that he had fallen on to the floor and was rolling around, holding his stomach in pain.  Never before had the Erudite seen a troll laugh so hard.
								</P>
								Rankul rolled his eyes at the two. "Who let these hyenas into my home?" was all he could get out before he too was laughing.
								
								<P>After a moment or two, Grymtooth composed himself enough to stand up and retake his seat.  Still chuckling, he reached down and opened his pack which he had set by his chair.  He removed a package wrapped in a large leaf and tied with a string.
								</P>
								"Hungry or not,"  he said as he handed the package to Rankul, "I brought you this."
								
								<P>The old troll took the package and began unwrapping it carefully.  His eyes brightened in a smile as the contents were revealed. "Woolie spider crunchies!"  he exclaimed.  "You remembered!!"
								</P>
								Rankul gingerly plucked on of the disgusting treats from the package and gave it a sniff.  "Ummmm,  fresh ones too!"  he stated as he popped the candied spider-part into his mouth.  His eyes rolled back in joy as he savored the arachnid delight of his favorite snack.
								
								<P>After finishing the trollish confection, Rankul began rewrapping the package as he looked up at his great-grandson.  "I believe you were going to tell me of you adventures thus far?" he half stated, half questioned.  "I'm all ears child.  Enlighten me!"
								</P>
								With that Grymtooth began.  He told of his early adventures on the commonlands.  Of the hatred and mistrust he had encountered.  He told of how he befriended many of those would be foes.  He recalled his battles with the Deathfist Orcs and the constant fighting with the Cutthroat Dervishes.  He spoke of the undead horrors of the desert and the evil of Neriak.  He revealed his less than happy trip to Faydwer and the hatred he encountered there.  He spoke of his chosen mate, Sephrana, and his surprise at his affection for her.  But mostly he spoke of his new family, The Wind Riders.  He told of their fight against the evil of The Shadow Striders.  He proudly spoke of their victories and raged at their losses and defeats.  He told of those he had grown close to and those he had yet to get to know.  And he spoke of his leader, Sugan.  He tried to explain the closeness he felt toward her, but found he couldn't.  He tried to describe her bravery, but fell short each time. He tried to understand he love for her brother, but was left baffled still.  When he had finished his tale his grandfather just sat silently and smiled at him.
								
								<P>"That is all Grampy," said Grymtooth, "I have told you everything that has happened since I left Innothule."
								</P>
								"So you have child," spoke the old troll as he pushed himself out of his chair. "So you have."
								
								<P>Grymtooth looked expectantly up at Rankul as the old troll stretched and straightened his spine.  "Well?" he queried.
								</P>
								"Let's eat!" stated Rankul as he limped toward the dining area.
								
								<P>Dinner was not a quiet affair.  Although Grymtooth was a little puzzled by his grandfather's lack of reaction to his tale, he enjoyed the comforts of a home cooked meal in true troll fashion.  Small talk erupted during the meal as it so often does.  Grymtooth found out more about Neuvau and her apprenticeship with Rankul.  He was surprised that she was not a shaman like his grandfather, but a necromancer.  He found it odd that a human necromancer would seek apprenticeship with a troll shaman.
								</P>
								"Your grandfather knows more about spreading disease and causing suffering than most humans will ever learn."  Neuvau responded.  "Many of my order seek him out for that knowledge."
								
								<P>"How do you even know of Rankul the Scabbrous in your homeland?"  Grymtooth asked.
								</P>
								Neuvau chuckled, "I had best let your grandfather explain that! It is not my place to say."
								
								<P>Grymtooth looked across the table to his grandfather.  "Well?" he said.
								</P>
								Rankul finished gnawing on a large bone and dropped it on his plate.  He looked down at his fingers and then began wiping them on his napkin.  "Neuvau, leave the dishes for now." he said as he meticulously cleaned his hands.  "Get a bottle of the '37 and three glasses and join us in the parlor."
								
								<P>Neuvau nodded in acknowledgment and rose from the table to comply.
								</P>
								"Grymtooth," Rankul said as he dropped the napkin in his plate, "please come with me."
								
								<P>Grymtooth knew that, despite the politeness of the statement, it was not a request.
								</P>
								A few moments later found Grymtooth, Rankul, and Neuvau in the study of the old shaman.  Grymtooth and Rankul took a pair of large, comfortable seats as Neuvau poured each of them a glass of a dark red wine.  She returned the decanter to it's place on the tray and took her seat facing the two trolls.
								
								<P>Rankul sniffed the bouquet of the wine as he held the glass with both hands, and closed his eyes in contemplation.  "Grymtooth, my child," the old troll began, "I cannot begin to tell you how proud I am of your accomplishments.  That fact that you have not yet seen two centuries of life makes them even more impressive!"
								</P>
								"Thank you Grampy," Grymtooth murmured, "I have always sought your approval."
								
								<P>Rankul took a large sip of his wine and smiled at the young warrior.  "I must tell you that I am particularly impressed by the fact that, as a troll, you have not only become a member of the famed Wind Riders, but gained the friendship and trust of most of the other members!  Very good my child!  None, other than you could have done it. Do they know of your heart?
								</P>
								Grymtooth looked at the ground, "I tried to tell them Grampy, but they just laughed."
								
								<P>Rankul placed his hand upon Grymtooth's shoulder, "Never you mind that child.  Their ignorance shall not harm them this time.  You know what is in you heart and you follow the love and light of the Twins.  That shall be their saving grace!"
								</P>
								Grymtooth looked at his grandfather with confusion.  "I don't understand Grampy.  What do you mean?"
								
								<P>The old troll began to take another sip of wine and thought better of it as he drained the glass in one gulp.  He then motioned for Neuvau to hand him the bottle.
								</P>
								As the young Erudite stood and passed the bottle to her master, she began to speak.  "What Rankul is trying to say is, although they do not recognize the true magnitude of your soul, it is that very lack of knowledge that may keep them safe from harm."
								
								<P>Grymtooth looked from his grandfather to Neuvau and back again. Confusion dominated his expression.  "Uhh...  Okay."
								</P>
								"As you may have noticed, my child," Rankul began, "Neuvau is Erudite.  What you may not know is that Neuvau is not from Erudin."
								
								<P>"I am from an outcast enclave of necromancers that worship Bertoxxulous and do his bidding."  stated Neuvau, " Just as your grandfather does."
								</P>
								Rankul paused to fill his glass again and then continued, "Grymtooth, the followers of the Plaguebringer are divided.  The followers of Innoruuk have been spreading hate amongst us."
								
								<P>"Before, we were more than a match for the weak followers of Hate." Neuvau interjected.  "Now that we are so divided we may not be able to withstand an attack.  We are at a very vulnerable time."
								</P>
								"I would never think to directly involve you in this, my child." continued Rankul.  "I love you far too much to force you down a path you didn't choose for yourself.  But The Shadow Striders are our enemy too. I would help you to help Sugan overcome her weakness.  You must help her to end this.  Sugan must slay Faileas once and for all!"
								
								<P>Grymtooth looked from Neuvau to Rankul and then furrowed his brow in consternation.  A moment passed in silence as the troll warrior took a sip of his wine.  He swallowed as he set the half empty glass on the serving tray.
								</P>
								"What can I do?"  Grymtooth asked more to himself than to the others in the room.  "I have given my word to Sugan that I would never take Faileas' life."
								
								<P>"And so you should not!"  Rankul piped in.  "Faileas is not your destiny.  Sugan is a very strong human.  Her will shines bright like the stars above.  Her brother is her only weakness.  She cannot kill one of her own blood. Yet."
								</P>
								Grymtooth looked at his grandfather sternly. "How do you know all of this Grampy?"
								
								<P>The old troll looked at his great-grandson with surprise.  The look quickly softened into a warm smile. "My child,"  Rankul began, "I am almost two thousand years old.  I know a thing or two about information gathering!  Fear not; I am not invading your privacy.  I have spies that bring me information regularly.  If I want to know something about someone, I find out."
								</P>
								Grymtooth looked at Rankul, stunned, "I had no idea Grampy!"
								
								<P>Rankul chuckled, "Grymtooth, the TRUE followers of Bertoxxulous do not want to see the end of all life and light in the world.  That would mean that there would be nothing left to suffer!  How silly is that?!"
								</P>
								The young troll looked puzzled for a moment, then burst into laughter.  "To tell you the truth, Grampy, " He said between laughs, "I had never thought much about it!!"
								
								<P>Neuvau took the decanter from Rankul, "You see Lord Grymtooth, The Shadow Striders must be stopped.  The followers of Innoruuk are so consumed by their hate the they do not see what is coming.  They do not understand the consequences of their actions."
								</P>
								Rankul became dead serious as he turned back to Grymtooth. "My child, you have done something no other troll has ever done.  Not even me.  You abandoned Fear."
								
								<P>Grymtooth looked back at his grandfather. "I do not see how this relates.  How is my release by Cazic-Thule going to help defeat The Shadow Striders?"
								</P>
								"You may be the only creature on all of Norrath that is totally free of Fear." began Rankul. "You must now show Sugan how to overcome her fears."
								
								<P>Grymtooth nodded, finally understanding.
								</P>
								"There is one other you must help as well." said the old shaman.
								
								<P>"Oh?" asked Grymtooth. "Who might that be?"
								</P>
								"The one called Jamier." answered Rankul.
								
								<P>"Hur!"  Laughed the warrior. "He is as strong a warrior as I am!  How can I possibly help him?!"
								</P>
								"He is the key to Sugan."  Explained Rankul. "His love and influence can overcome her fears.  But beware!  He is filled with the rage of the Warlord!  Even I am powerless to predict his actions.  He could be as big a liability in your quest, as an aid."
								
								<P>"Hmm..."  said Grymtooth as he rubbed his chin.  He then noticed that he was still in his armor. "Uhh...  Grampy?  I need to get out of this stuff."
								</P>
								"Hmm?" questioned the old troll as he looked up from refilling his glass. "Oh!  Yes, of course!  Neuvau will show you to your room."
								
								<P>"Great!" said Grymtooth, excited at the prospect of getting out of his armor.  He stood, grabbed his axe and his pack and turned to follow the young necromancer.
								</P>
								"Grandson."  Rankul spoke.
								
								<P>Grymtooth stopped and turned to face his grandfather, "Yes Grampy?"
								</P>
								"I hope you understand what is at stake here."  Rankul stated.
								
								<P>"More than I care to." Grymtooth said as he stared at Rankul. "Sometimes ignorance is bliss."
								</P>
								"Ignorance is also a tool used by the weak."  The old troll countered.
								
								<P>Grymtooth just stared blankly back at Rankul, taking in the wisdom of the old shaman.  He then turned to look for his room.
								</P>
								"Grymtooth." came the voice of the Rankul yet again.
								
								<P>The young warrior froze, his back facing his grandfather.  "Yes Grampy..."
								</P>
								"Welcome home, child."
								
								<P>Grymtooth visibly relaxed as a smiled came to life on his face and he once again began his search for his room.
