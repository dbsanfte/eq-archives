				<P><B>The Lord of Shadows</B> - as told by Kokiri, the young bard<BR>
				 Upon entering the old swing doors of the humble inn, you smell the familiar,
                 comfortable scents that most humble inns boast in the evening... hot food, good ale,
                 smoke and women. The lanterns flicker, the barmaids move about serving as usual;
                 however the thing that makes this scene odd is when you notice everyone in the tavern
                 gathered to one corner. All of them, listening to a young female forest elf tell what must
                 be an interesting tale, although spooky from the tone of her voice.
                 Not one to miss out on the latest news, you order your hot food and good ale; pulling
                 up a chair to hear the story.</P>

                 "Lord Faileas, The Dark Knight of Shadows, and ruler of the evil Shadow Striders. To
                 look upon him is to know death, but not before pain. Not the pain of his blade slicing
                 your throat, but of his blood. Within him is the curse of Imshee'Cro. This is his tale:

                 <P>Faileas, and his twin sister Sugan were born into a loving world. Their mother, a moon
                 worshipper named Eayst Cheyl, loved these two joyful children, and gave them all that
                 she could. Usually more. Their father, a seemingly humble man, worked hard so that
                 his children would not go without. However, twins were not expected, and even one
                 child can burden a home. But both parents did all that they could.</P>

                 When the twins reached the age of six, they were told a very disturbing secret. Years
                 before their father was born, a Necromancer cursed their bloodline for an unpaid debt.
                 Now, every desendent would hear the calling of Bertoxxulous, and would be
                 consumed by the darkness. Their father, loving his family, but not able to resist the
                 calling, left them. His hopes were to live under the Plaguebringer, research for a cure,
                 and save his family. He would not succeed. The Darkness swallowed him, and he
                 became a powerful Necromancer, and servant of the merciless god. He remained
                 hidden for several years, living in the city's vast aquaduct system.

                 <P>The twins continued to grow, each seeming to be very happy. Eayst knew what was to
                 become of her children, and fearing for their souls, she went to an old druid priestess.
                 She begged the druid to help. The old woman agreed, and a ritual took place.
                 Unknown to them, that ritual did not produce the desired results. The aged priestess
                 could not drive the evil out. She could only displace it.</P>

                 A few more years passed, and all seemed well. The twins were now twelve years old,
                 and their father's leaving was a distant memory. Nothing prepared them for the evening
                 their father came back. He rode a black monster that could loosely be called a horse.
                 Its heavy stride sounded like thunder as it walked toward the house. A cloaked figure
                 dismounted. Slowly, it walked toward the front of the house. Before he could reach
                 the door, it opened. Eayst stepped forth, armed with a short sword, prepared to
                 defend her children from this man. He merely laughed. A pair of bone chips fell to the
                 ground, and with a short, whispered command from the father, two skeleton warriors
                 grew from the bone chips. The unnatural servants grabbed Eayst, and restrained her
                 from attacking. The father walked into his old home for the first time in six years. His
                 children were at the right age. He had come for them. He looked towards the corner
                 where they were cowering. 

				 <P>"My children. Soon, you will learn the glory of Bertoxxulous," said the father. Two
                 more bone chip fell to the floor and spawned more mindless warriors. The father
                 whispered his commands, and the two new skeletons lifted the children, and carried
                 them out of the house. The father followed. Eayst could do nothing as she watched her
                 family being taken away. As soon as they were out of sight, her skeleton keepers
                 crumbled to the floor. All that could be heard was the coming storm, and the screams
                 of a mother who had lost her only children.</P>

                 The father lead them halfway to Qeynos, when they were stopped by four Paladins.
                 The father attacked without warning, knowing they would never tolerate him in their
                 land. He managed to kill the first three, but he could not finish off the one remaining.
                 He made a quick retreat, escaping the Holy Knight of Thunder, carrying his crying son
                 with him. The surviving Paladin carried Sugan to her home. Eayst was sitting in the
                 doorway, motionless. Sugan ran up to her mother, hugging her, and telling her of the
                 brave Knights. Eayst offered the Paladin shelter from the coming storm, but he
                 declined, prefering to feel the power of Karana. He left a lasting impression on Sugan
                 that night. For many nights after, Sugan dreamed of becoming a Paladin, and finding
                 her brother.

                 <P>Meanwhile, Faileas was subjected to many horrors at the hands of his father. He was
                 shown to the Shrine of Bertoxxulous, and he was tested by many. It was discovered
                 that he still possessed the curse, and more. The evil the druid priestess tried to banish
                 never left Faileas, and it seemed to have been amplified from the evil that had been
                 banished from Sugan. Faileas was shown to the High Priest of Bertoxxulous in
                 Qeynos, and it was determined that he was to become a Bloodsabre. His training
                 began that day.</P>

                 Sugan came home everyday after finishing her various chores. 
                 Every once in a while, the Paladin that saved her would come by, telling her glorious
                 stories of his Knighthood. She did so dream of being a Paladin. Her mother didn't
                 speak much anymore. Eayst sat in her home, silent, for most of the day. The meals
                 would get cooked, and the general upkeep of the house was done. But nothing was
                 the same without Faileas. Eayst was dying slowly. All she had left was Sugan, and she
                 didn't want to lose her too.

                 <P>It was a day like any other. Sugan completed her chores and odd jobs. It was time for
                 her to go home. But instead, she decided to play with her friends for awhile. Sugan
                 came home late, and found her mother lying on the floor, dead. On the walls, written
                 in Eayst's blood, a message declared, "Bertoxxulous calls for you!" Sugan stormed
                 out of her home, determined to find her father, sure that he was the man responsible
                 for this crime. Hot tempered, but not stupid, she enlisted the help of her Paladin savior.
                 He took her in, and brought her to the Temple of Karana. Her training began that day.</P>

                 Now Faileas is well on his way to becoming all that the High Priests need. A
                 warrior-leader able to command the Dark Arts. He is more than a soldier. He is more
                 than a necromancer. He is a Shadow Knight, with more power than even they realize.
                 They hope to control him. He has other plans.

                 <P>So ends this story; for now. As with any good tale, this one will continue to evolve and
                 change over time. And it will come to a resolving end, sometime. I, for one, am glad
                 that this chapter is over. After speaking his name, I feel uneasy. So I will be off. Any
                 donation you are willing to give, will be collected at this time. Thank you for your ears,
                 and be careful.</P>
                 "Devils do exist. Farewell."

                 <P>You feel a bit eerie as the young bard finishes her story, and look around to see that
                 others are doing the same. Something about her words seemed to have triggered a
                 response from the darkness outside. 'Perhaps the shadows crept inside to listen to the
                 tale of their master', you think brashly. Then you shake your head, chuckling at your
                 own foolishness. But upon glancing up, you see the young bard looking right at you... 
                 She gives you a haunted smile and nods, silently.</P></DIV></TD>
