                      The Children of blood

                      <P>He held Sugan tightly as she drifted slowly to sleep in his strong arms lulled by
                      his soft tunes of passion. He could never describe how he felt in that moment
                      feeling her soft warm breath against his chest.
                      Kinor guarded the door faithfully, in fear for the Lady’s life after a dark vision.
                      He listened to the soft footsteps of the guards pass outside the safe haven of
                      the guildhalls as he himself felt the dream like pulls of the netherlands.</P>

                      “Jamier! Wake up!” he groggily wiped his eyes to see himself standing in the
                      dark forboding hallways of the forbidden castle of mistmoore. The creatures of
                      death lurked to and fro seeming to ignore his presence in the unholy place.
                      Before him stood a ghostly image he never met. His heart pounded with a
                      sense of fear, yet he was too much of a warrior to show it. “Why have you
                      brought me here?” …”Be silent young Paladin and follow” her vioce stuck a
                      chord of malice within the deepest reaches of his soul.

                      <P>Her irridencent ghostly robes floated down the hallways, and as quickly as she
                      appeared she vanished. Jamier stood in the hallway, lost in the depths of evil.
                      He heard the wails and screams of countless tormented souls in the distance.
                      Cautiously he stepped forward. He heard the sounds of shuffleing. Like a deck
                      of cards in a poker game. Soft was the sound at first. But suddenly it echoed
                      with an earth shattering sound withing the halls. With a thud he felt something
                      drop to his plated boot. He looked down to see a frayed deck or Tarot card.
                      Not much unlike those he had seen used by the fortune tellers in the Oasis of
                      marr.</P>

                      Jamier knelt down to pick up the deck, with a flash of light the deck
                      disappeared only leaving a few cards remaining. Taking a deep breath as if to
                      reassure his own courage he looked at them. There were no pictures on the
                      cards , only each card had a name written in the ancient almost forgotten
                      language of the Tier’dal. The Lovers, The Magician, The Tower, The hanged
                      man, The Fool. Gently he pulled the Lovers card and was faced with every
                      carnal temptation. His desires and visions became for a moment a reality. He
                      watched as the card burst into flame leaving a charred mark on the palm of his
                      gauntlet. He looked deeply at the ashes and mark that was left. Only to see the
                      symbol of twins etched within the remains.

                      <P>Jamier forced himself to walk forward. Stopping at a door. Distracted from the
                      moans and screams coming from the other side. He saw a Woman there, much
                      like the painting of Silveril in the guildhalls. She was chained to the bed,
                      wrapped in the arms of ecstacy of the fabled Paladin Stormangel
                      who loved her. The sounds became louder almost deafening him. ‘M’lady!”
                      He screamed. He reached to free her, but she was gone. The once wealthy
                      room laid vacant with only the whisper of winds and leaves blowing across the
                      floor. The leaves parted leaving a picture of her, her heart exposed and a card
                      with the Three of Swords laying across it.</P>

                      A sense of overwhelming fear gripped Jamier as her turned for the door and
                      found himself standing in a new room. A gentle breeze blew across his face as
                      suddenly the room was filled with song dance and laughter. From the top of
                      the stairwell there stood Sugan dressed like a queen. The beautiful soft white
                      gowns of a virgin waiting to be married. He reached his hand for her, only to
                      see her grab the hand of another. Canelon, the high elven Paladin whom she
                      loved so much. Jamier turn to the paladin only to face a skeleton standing in
                      the once lusterous clothes. The skeleton crumbled to ashes leaving only the
                      Card of Death. Jamier pulled his hand back in discust. The sound of the party
                      faded leaving the shadows of 3 spirits. 

                      <P>Jamier stood in awe at the sights of Sigma, Tau and Tarlyn as the Shamans
                      Cattiebrie and Ralnia described them. He watched as the spirits swirled
                      around creating a misty blue light. He saw Ralnia and cattiebrie emerge from
                      the magical cloud holding each other hands tightly. He moved towrds them, to
                      touch them. But instead they kept on walking. There totems continuing to
                      guard them from the evils withing this accursed hell. Suddenly Ralnia stopped
                      and pulled a card from her pouch . She held it in her hand as she softly blew
                      against it. It floated like a feather before Jamier. “the Herophant” he said softly
                      under his breath looking at the card. Then there was nothing but blackness.</P>

                      Suddenly he saw a doorway into another hall…it creeked opne hauntingly, he
                      tries to pass but was blocked by 9 staves. With all his strength he tried to pull
                      against them, but they would not budge.He looked beyond the staves and saw
                      an alter. Sugan was kneeling in front of it crying. The staves disolved letting him
                      pass. He reached for her hand only to be left with emptiness and a single card.
                      The picture was a single staff wrapped in vines of ivy. The ace.

                      <P>Jamier began to sweat, feeling feverish in the fear of the moment. Every hair on
                      the nape of his neck stood up as he felt the eyes of a beast watching him from
                      the shadows. The beast came forward bearing its teeth. Biting and lashing hard
                      at the dark elf. Jamier screemed as the claws sank into his flesh creating a
                      seering burning poisoness pain. He realed back to draw his blade, only to find
                      himself weaponless. The beast stood there snarling at him. Across the breast of
                      the 7 headed monstrocity that took the shape of a Hydra was written the word
                      “Judgement”. Jamier stood in silence awaiting his death. But it never came.</P>

                      Jamier braced himself stepping forward , only to find himself faced with the
                      decaying corpse of silverann. Hey was being held and stroked like a cherished
                      pet by Envy. He looked at Jamier pleedingly at his imprisonment. In his hand
                      he held a Glowing orb. He reached out offering the orb to Jamier. Hesitantly
                      Jamier took it. It too disolved into a card. The Moon. Within its pictures ever
                      changing images of the shadows.

                      <P>Jamier closed his eyes murmering words of prayer, to be released from this
                      hell. He only experienced the sensation of his Nostrils being filled with the
                      scent of decay and death carried upon scallding winds that coursed through his
                      hair. He looked down to see the beautiful alibaster floors shape and shift to
                      sulferous lavarock. The screams of tormented souls now pierced his heart as
                      he looked up and saw a battlefield flowing in a river of blood. Among the
                      corpses were children playing, laughing and singing. He heart sank with the
                      haunted moment.</P>

                      He followed a path with was before him, leading him up the steep lava flowing
                      mountain.
                      He came to the top to where he saw them. Ralnia, Sorcere, Sugan , Faileas,
                      Cattiebrie, Kinor, Laraden, Malgorm, Laele, Malcron, Darain, Silveril,
                      Canelon, and Envy. They all stood there like children. Each covered in patches
                      of dried blood. Ghostly and staring at something that seemed to overshadow
                      them all.
                      <P>Jamier looked up to see an alter with a symbol of the Twins erected high from
                      the base.
                      He stepped back in fear. Almost losing control as he saw the lovers Crucified
                      to it. Their lifes blood dripping into the rivers of lava and blood that the
                      children played in.</P>

                      “Jamier! Wake up!”
                      <P>Jamier opened his eyes to look into the soft green ones of Sugan.</P>

                      “Are we all children of blood?” he asked in a soft voice Quivering with fear.
                      Sugan looked upon him without understanding.
                      <P>Jamier took her hand to kiss the Palm...

                      only to stop as he saw within it a scar shaped like the sign of the Twins.</P></DIV></TD>
