                      ‘The absence of sensation is only truly understood when sensation again
                      arrives,’ Laele wrote in her journal, the black ink scratching itself indelibly into
                      the parchment pages, ‘though, admittedly, few alive really know what this
                      statement means. We all go through this thing called Life, trapped in these
                      cages we call our bodies.’
<BR><BR>
                      ‘They say that even time will one day come to an end,’ she wrote,
                      remembering her rebirth into this body, even as sweat began to form on her
                      dark brow at the memory of those haunting days...
<BR><BR>
                      **
                      Laele floated, not knowing, not feeling, in a place that was removed from time.
                      There was no hunger, no thirst and no pain. She was not aware that she
                      existed, and as such, had no feelings relating to her current state.
<BR><BR>
                      How long she had floated did not matter. How long she would still float was of
                      no matter either. She had no thought, no dreams, no nightmares. Nothing. It
                      went on that way for some timeless spanse that seemed like moments.
<BR><BR>
                      But, all things must come to an end, even Death.
<BR><BR>
                      The removal of Laele’s eons-long imprisonment, surprisingly, began with a soft
                      touch rather than an explosion.
<BR><BR>
                      Like the layers of taste within fine wines or arterial blood, the soul that brushed
                      against hers sparked a sensation of separation from the tepid fog that
                      surrounded her like some ethereal womb. She became aware of her Self, and
                      as the thing that touched her wrapped itself around her like a fist, she felt pain
                      for the first time in eons.
<BR><BR>
                      It was an intoxicating sensation.
<BR><BR>
                      The fist was of the Avatar of her soul-sworn God, Innoruuk, the God of Hate,
                      calling her from the Spirit Realm and back into the God’s Service.
<BR><BR>
                      Her memories of her past life flooded her with all the pain of Life. She had
                      been the Quenar Dalharil (4th daughter) of the Dark Elf House Fay-Branche
                      prior to her death. The Dark-Elves called themselves the Drow in those days,
                      and worshipped the dark and beloved Spider Goddess, Lloth.
<BR><BR>
                      It was Laele’s avaricious nature that gave Innoruuk a hold over her when he
                      promised her that she would one day be the leader of her House if she swore,
                      upon her soul, to serve him and not the Spider Queen. Wanting to be Matron
                      more than life itself, she swore her allegiance.
<BR><BR>
                      Innoruuk’s promise was perfect in it’s cruelty. Within the week, there was a
                      huge Royal House war, and her House was annihilated. Laele, spared only
                      because she was on an errand for her Matron, returned to find her House in
                      ruins, and her life threatened by the bounty-hunters in Rilauven.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele fled, sobbing at her part in the betrayal of her House and swearing her
                      promises of vengeance on the God that had betrayed her. Innoruuk’s laughter
                      followed her maddeningly within her head. Only Malcron, her beloved
                      Gargoyle pet kept her eating and drinking as she went mad in the cavernous
                      wilds of the Underdark.
<BR><BR>
                      The ancient Drow Vampire that found her later was a joke in itself. It took her,
                      to the point of death with blood-loss, then laughingly cut at it’s own wrist to
                      feed her. She knew he had been sent by Innoruuk to further humiliate her, but
                      even so, her need to survive won out. Hungry beyond anything she had known
                      before, she latched her mouth onto the wound, sucking with all the power in
                      her weakened body.
<BR><BR>
                      The Vampire let her only get a taste… then laughingly shoved her back onto
                      the ground, hard enough to knock the wind out of her. "Live the Unlife if you
                      can, Waela (fool)."
<BR><BR>
                      It took her a few days of agonizing pain to die completely, and then a few
                      more for the blood-hunger to drive her completely mad. Her life as a Vampire
                      was short-lived as the blood-rich prey in the Caverns of Rilauven were very
                      scarce: when she attacked the guard post at one of the Gates to Rilauven, she
                      was killed. Death from that point was a relief, the soft, mindless floating…
<BR><BR>
                      Until, some mindless point after, the Avatar of Innoruuk captured her again.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele was dragged to awareness and flesh in a breath… just breath enough to
                      scream as he sliced her bare thigh with a dagger to gain her attention. She
                      found herself naked, chained to a black marble slab with shackles on her
                      ankles and wrists. Wild-eyed, she turned to look at her tormentor, and saw
                      Hate. Her screams of pain died stillborn in her throat.
<BR><BR>
                      "Ah, Laele," he said with a soft smile, reaching out a hand to brush her cheek
                      with tenderness. His voice was terrifying with power, the voice of a God. She
                      felt the voice filling her, seducing her from within. "I see in those lovely crimson
                      eyes that you remember your promise to serve me." He smiled, leaning close,
                      like a lover.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele, knowing that before her stood the God that had destroyed her House,
                      remembered for the merest fraction of an instant the promises of vengeance
                      she had sworn in her previous life.
<BR><BR>
                      He began to laugh, reading her thoughts easily. With a quick flick of his wrist,
                      he sliced open the soft, dark skin of her throat. She froze in disbelief as she
                      watched her blood jet out of the wound with her heartbeats. It sprayed his fine
                      robes and face with a red mist as he laughed and laughed. Her life began to
                      leave her once again.
<BR><BR>
                      His healing spells caught her at the far edge of dying. She returned to
                      consciousness grudgingly, wanting the still-remembered oblivion that she had
                      left. He healed her to consciousness, but the dying still left her weakened.
                      "Every time you remember those promises, I will kill you again." he said,
                      licking her blood from his fingers and smiling. "Do you understand me?" She
                      nodded, sobbing silently. The Avatar of Hate smiled at her with the pride of a
                      parent. "Oh, I am so glad!" he said, then stroked her cheek again. "We both
                      know that this can continue indefinitely. Death stroke, healing, death stroke,
                      healing, until we both forget how many times we had to punish you to teach
                      you! We wouldn’t want that, would we?" His voice trailed off in a kind of
                      sex-fed growl as his soft hands began to rove slowly over her naked flesh with
                      a power and skill that she could not deny.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele shook her head, sobbing silently, realizing he was totally mad and totally
                      omnipotent… and the soul-shaming realization that above it all, she wanted
                      this… that this was what she had been waiting for. 
<BR><BR>
                      Her training, in that dark, candle-lit room took a slow, glorious eternity. The
                      bloody tortures he put her body through became exciting. The lessons in dark
                      magic and weapons was fascinating…
<BR><BR>
                      But, it was in the sexual arena that Laele’s true talents emerged, and
                      incongruously, the Avatar of Hate was her teacher at the art of seduction. He
                      taught her that she needed to use ALL of her talents to bring Hate to the new
                      world they were placing her in. She was an eager pupil.
<BR><BR>
                      He was as cruel as the Avatar of Hate would be in his teaching, though. He
                      teased her mercilessly, with his mouth, his fingers and his tongue, bringing her
                      to the whimpering edge of orgasm, but never letting her find release. She
                      begged him for it, but he only laughed at her. She wept for it, but he only hurt
                      her for being weak enough to cry.
<BR><BR>
                      She learned to suffer in silence, smelling her own musk on her naked body and
                      on his mouth as he kissed her deeply. Her lust grew in power and focus as she
                      waited. She swore that one day, He would give her release, even if it meant
                      her death to do so.
<BR><BR>
                      He tortured her until he ripped from her soul any vestige of loyalty to Lloth,
                      ordering her pant his name in pain and pleasure until ‘Innoruuk’ was all she
                      could think of, all she could feel, except for the ache of sexual need that
                      resided in her, always.
<BR><BR>
                      When she was especially brilliant, he brought her ‘pets’ to play with, and
                      would turn himself invisible to watch her as she seduced and fed upon them.
                      Laele, in her pride at her physical arts, fancied that she saw lust in the eyes of
                      the God as he looked at her, every once in a while.
<BR><BR>
                      At last the day came when she was honed to her skill as a weapon. She could
                      outfight all that he brought to her, and his golems as well. He had taught her to
                      find pain an aphrodisiac, which he had tested with experiments too horrific to
                      mention.
<BR><BR>
                      "Tomorrow is your final test, Waela." The Avatar told her, standing over her as
                      she kneeled before him, head bowed. "If you pass this test, Innoruuk may just
                      grant you the right to wander this new world called Tunare."
<BR><BR>
                      "The test, Master?" she asked from her stiff, respectful pose.
<BR><BR>
                      She heard him laugh from directly before her, and looked again at the toes of
                      his black boots. His finger under her chin, instead of a knee or a kick was a
                      surprise. "If you can seduce me, Waela, then all of your training will be done."
                      He growled at her with a kind of hunger. He stroked her cheek, his eyes
                      burning, then took a step back. "Sleep well until next we meet, Laele." He
                      teleported away.
<BR><BR>
                      She felt her heart begin to pound as she curled up on her beloved marble slab
                      and closed her eyes. At last, the task for what she had been trained. She fell
                      into a restless sleep, eager to start the seduction and find her own release.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele awoke at the feeling of pebbles under her spine.
<BR><BR>
                      She sat bolt upright, knowing that she was no longer in her safe little chamber.
                      Malcron sat not far away, on a pile of silken clothing. 
<BR><BR>
                      ‘Well, that was strange.’ He said within her head, scratching at his jaw with a
                      hind-foot. ‘I had this dream that we were teleported here, and you met with
                      the Avatar of Hate… Sheesh! Was he a sick bastard or what?! He was worse
                      than any of the other Vamps you met in the Underdark.’ Malcron paused.
                      ‘And speaking of the Underdark, where are we? This is nowhere I have ever
                      been before…’
<BR><BR>
                      Innoruuk's mind-voice curled around hers, drowning out Malcron's voice.
                      "Welcome to Tunare, Matron. Let the games begin." That was all he said, then
                      began to laugh. 
<BR><BR>
                      Laele began to scream with anger and pain, knowing that the sexual and blood
                      hunger the God had placed in her would never leave until she pleased him
                      enough to send his Avatar to her again… or until she found a mortal being to
                      fulfill this gnawing ache within.
<BR><BR>
                      She was Matron of a House that had not existed in eons, that was not even a
                      memory in the world of the Dark Elves. All hail the Matron...
<BR><BR>
                      Yes, he had kept his promise. She kept screaming.
<BR><BR>
                      It was almost laughable.
