          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The function of the council will involve leading
          discussions on guild issues such as: the passage of laws, the appointment of officers, the distribution
          of items, and, if need be, the trial of members. The house would be the link between the regular members
          and the council. They would participate the debates of guild issues and do their best to
          express the feelings of the regular members before the council. The regular members have a part too since
          their opinion is equally valid.

          &nbsp;</font></p>
          <p>

                 <font face="Arial" size="2">When we hold meetings Aion will serve as speaker and
                 will maintain order. The person who has the floor would have permission to speak. Only
          the council and officers should participate to avoid confusion and they
                 will be asked to be
                 discerning and orderly. We willl keep the meetings open house to regular members, but ask that
          they refrain from speaking. Than after it's been discussed,&nbsp; regular members will
                  have a chance
          to express their opinions within a set time (5 min limit). They will have only one 5 minute
          period then it&nbsp;will go to whomever has something to share. Then after all is said,
                 the council will either
          vote then and there, or recess the issue and have further discussion within the council.&nbsp;</font>
          <p>

                 <font face="Arial" size="2"> Then however the
          vote turns out will be how it is decided.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thus
          far, the High Council is comprised of:</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">Turindal<br>
          Denithor<br>
          Odomok<br>
          Katalina<br>
          Beladdian</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">We need one more member
          to complete the High Council.&nbsp; Details of how that member will be
          decided will be coming soon.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">This
          plan is still in early stages, and is being posted to let members
          share their opinions on its progress.&nbsp; The is still more to be
          put here, but I will have to wait for the next update.</font>
