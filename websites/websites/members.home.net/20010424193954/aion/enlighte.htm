        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It came to pass
        some years later that a small group of <a href="erud.htm"> Erudites discovered the lost art
        of Necromancy</a>. They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For
        the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They
        engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had
        loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very
        significant difference &#150; they did not use swords and bows, but rather
        magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost,
        great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics
        were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions
        of Odus. In one final battle, great mystic energies were released and an
        immense hole leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created.
        Into the sides of this chasm the heretics built their own city which
        they called Paineel. And while both sides still seethed with anger and
        hatred towards one another, their fear of what the last battle had
        wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus began the Age of
        Turmoil, the current age of Norrath.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leaving a small network of spies behind them, Erud and the above
mentioned discontents sailed west and landed upon the barren coast
of Odus Island. They soon established Erudin, a city almost entirely
within a towering castle inhabited by scribes and scholars called High
Men. Within the castle walls they gathered and analyzed reports,
captured books or scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their spies. Soon many “Erudites” — wizards, sorcerers, and
enchanters — occupied the great halls of Erudin, growing immensely
in both power and knowledge.&nbsp;

Some years later, a small group of Erudites discovered the lost art of
necromancy and were branded heretics. For the first time in hundreds
of years, the Erudites knew and engaged in civil war.
But war among the Erudites held one significant difference. In place
of swords and bows, they used magic. Lives by the hundreds were
lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the
heretics were forced to flee Erudin and regroup in the southern
regions of Odus. The great arcane energies released in the final battle
of the war opened an immense hole in the earth, leading to depths
unknown. Along the sides of this chasm, the heretics built Paineel,
their city of refuge.
