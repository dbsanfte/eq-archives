        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Brell
        Serilis was </font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">the
        first child of The Nameless after Veeshan to come to Norrath</font><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">,
        and from his Plane of Underfoot, a dark realm of vast caves and endless
        tunnels, he quietly created a magical portal to a cavern deep in the
        belly of Norrath. Through this portal the Duke of Underfoot seeded the
        depths of Norrath with all manner of creatures. Brell then returned
        home, sealing his portal within a labyrinthine chamber of mystical
        Living Stone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And
        when the other gods came to Norrath, Brell Serilis approached each of
        them, and after some time convinced them to meet as one to discuss the
        fate of the world. The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The Oceanlord
        were in attendance, and Rallos Zek, the warlord, was also there, yet in
        mistrust kept his distance. Brell, carefully avoiding all queries as to
        the origins of his information, told of Veeshan's discovery of the new
        and potentially powerful world in which she had deposited her brood.
        Words befit of the King of Thieves poured forth from Brell's lips and he
        proposed that they accept an alliance of sorts, to which all save Rallos
        Zek agreed, ignorant of the fact that Brell had already released some of
        his creations into the Underfoot of this new world. The planet that
        would be called Norrath was divvied up between these beings of power for
        the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen in check. Each would create a race
        of beings to watch over Norrath and keep a vigilant eye on the schemes
        of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the planet and created the
        Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of Norrath</font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Fizzlethorpe
        Bristlebane and Cazic-Thule came next to Norrath, and Brell met them,
        concocting a second pact with these latter gods, wishing another excuse
        to create more peoples into the world. Rallos Zek again watched from
        afar, determined to add to his creation as well, and this time Brell
        convinced the Warlord to join the pact, assuring him that it was indeed
        an appropriate time to fulfill his desires. Deep in the earth did Brell
        return to create the gnomes, resembling dwarves to some extent, yet more
        wiry and gnarled, consumed with tinkering with devices more so than
        their cousins.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#FFFFFF">Followers
        of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a waste of space.
        They find true happiness in the caves, caverns and tunnels that
        perforate the belly of Norrath. But this is one of few points that all
        followers of Brell can agree upon. There are many different factions who
        all worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins claim he is their
        father much to the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim who know that the
        Dwarves are the true children of Serilis. But the vicious Gnolls of
        Split Paw disagree entirely. For was it not Brell who sculpted them out
        of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one form
        or another can be found nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of
        Norrath.</font></p>
        <font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="2"><i>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Chalice of Conquest</font></p>
        </i>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Chalice of Conquest was delivered to the
        Church of Underfoot from Brell Serellis himself. It is said whoever
        drinks from the chalice is assured victory in battle. It is also said
        that only good-natured creatures can safely drink from it and only a
        state of comatose is assured to any evil creature that dares to sip from
        it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Candle of Bravery is a ceremonial piece and
        is lit when one sips from the Chalice of Conquest. Priestess Ghalea was
        the keeper of the candle, which has since been lost.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Dru Razbind used to be a respected Paladin of
        the Church of Underfoot, until he failed to complete a very important
        task for Lord Datur Nightseer, who then striped Dru of his Cape of
        Underfoot, without which he can no longer enter Kaladim.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Dru Razbind was ordered by Lord Datur Nightseer
        to carry the Chalice of Conquest to a noble band of Paladins within the
        mountains of Rathe. While there, the entire camp was overtaken by a band
        of orcs. During the battle there was a strange occurrence. A large fray
        raged. Brave, valiant paladins fought vile green-skinned Orcs and while
        this happened the Chalice of Conquest was stolen away from the camp.
        After the Orcs were defeated, a blue Orc was seen running towards the
        horizon. The chalice was lost and all respect for Dru Razbind.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The orc who stole the Chalice was Klunga, who
        not knowing the true nature of the sacred cup drank from it and died. An
        acount of these events where found in a note written by an exhiled orc
        Legionnaire. It read:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Dis is a notis of the death of Klunga~ He
        tryd to reedeam himsef by stealig a Dwarv cup~ When he drunk from cup at
        lake he died~ We drug his body back to Calldrin~ We burnd bodi in fire
        pit here~ We bury cup here~ We killd gnome castor here~ We tink he knows
        sumtink~ Den all is gud~&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Dru Razbind still holds the Chalice Case, but
        has been exhiled by the Paladins of Underfoot for his failure to protect
        the sacred relic.</font></font></td>
