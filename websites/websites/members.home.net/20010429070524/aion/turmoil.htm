        MAIL ROUTE<br>
        <br>
        FIRIONA VIE, Kunark. February 1, 3178--<br>
        <br>
        Today, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining
        communication across Norrath announced that they have established a mail
        route to the newly discovered continent of Kunark, located across the
        ocean, south and east of Antonica. The new route will carry mail from
        Port Faydwer to the Elven outpost of Firiona Vie, which will serve as
        main port-of-entry and battle staging grounds for adventurers arriving
        in the new lands.<br>
        <br>
        The outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King
        Tearis Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his
        daughter of the same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now
        known to be named the Iksar. The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth,
        once-Lord and High Paladin of Tunare, to establish the outpost on Kunark
        and return his daughter to him, lest Veredeth's life be forfeited for
        failure. &quot;I cannot allow those vile creatures to keep my daughter
        and only heir to the Koada`Dal throne from fulfilling her destiny,&quot;
        says King Tearis Thex. &quot;Galeth Veredeth had best not fail me.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        A high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will
        not be outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power. The
        source said, &quot;We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped
        princess is just that. If the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted
        playthings think that they can wander the new lands unchecked, they are
        quite mistaken.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Many adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that
        is not without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently
        slaughtered upon their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined
        ship in the Oasis of Marr. They evidently were not aware that the ship
        would arrive at a new port, firmly controlled by Neriak and their
        brutish muscle from Oggok and Grobb.<br>
        <br>
        Druidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena
        present throughout the new lands. &quot;The land appears to have been
        ravaged by some viscous magical storms at one time,&quot; said one
        follower of Karana. &quot;Some magics that we have come to count on just
        do not work.&quot; This phenomenon was apparently noticed to an extreme
        in the vicinity of a mountain peak rumored to be inhabited by followers
        of Veeshan. &quot;Only through divine intervention did I escape that
        place with my life.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        The League of Antonican Bards' representative in Kunark met with Galeth
        Veredeth, Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via. &quot;It is my sincerest
        hope that many adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest
        to return the Princess to her home,&quot; says Veredeth. &quot;Though
        the dangers in these new lands are formidable, I have no doubt that many
        will come, if for nothing else than to reap the spoils.&quot;</font>
