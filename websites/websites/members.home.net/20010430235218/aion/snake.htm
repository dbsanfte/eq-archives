        </b><i>The History of The Iskar and Kunark</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There were five tribes of Iksar that rose
        from the Shissar Empire, and they each founded kingdoms in Kunark; three
        were extinguished years later by the <i>Kunzar</i> tribe, which is the
        tribe the current Iksar are descended from.&nbsp; One extinct tribe is
        the <i>Kylong</i>: a mountain-dwelling tribe known for striving for
        esoteric knowledge.&nbsp; They had a vast library of ancient magical
        tomes acquired from the Shissar sorcerers, and strove to understand and
        make use of the rituals documented within them.&nbsp; When the <i>Kunzar
        </i>armies marched upon the <i>Kylong</i>, the three greatest Kylong
        mystics shattered the Medallion of Kylong, a holy relic of their tribe,
        and fled their mountain homes to prevent the <i>Kunzar</i> from
        reassembling the medallion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">1. Genesis of Fist and Tail&nbsp;<br>

The Swifttail Caste, Fists and Tails of Cabilis&nbsp;</font>
</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
It was in dawning of the Sebilisian Empire that the art of fist and tail was forged. In the beginning, the pugilists of the great tribes were nothing more than warriors without weapons. Soon we would be forged into weapons.
Grandmaster Tynn was the father of our disciplines. He came to the empire from an unknown tribe. Some say he was a ronin who wandered the worlds of Norrath where he formed the basis of the city of Sebilis with no rebirth. He entered to form a caste which did not exist. He was quickly challenged by the warlords. He spoke his words and they did not listen. He knew the only way to make them understand was to challenge their finest in The Gauntlet. He called for four of the finest warlords and allowed them arms. The warlords agreed, thinking his challenge as easy task.
Grandmaster Tynn quickly dispatched of the warlords with nothing more than fist and tail. He fought in a way never displayed. His victory earned him much respect and Emperor Sathir soon commanded him to form the Court of Pain and raise an army of monks. Tynn formed the Swifttail Caste.
Soon the way of fist and tail had hundreds in it's ranks, climbing the rungs. Tynn showed them they were not warriors, but monks.
They would don shackles as testament to the Age of Snake when the Iksar were a race enslaved. Inner strength and harmony were taught. The Swifttail were born.
The Swifttail were disbanded during the End Days. It was not till the rise of the new empire under Emperor Vekin did the caste reform. Grandmaster Glox, a former disciple of Tynn, came to New Sebilis to rebuild the Court of Pain. In honor of Tynn, all masters now drape themselves in a robe like he wore.&nbsp;</font>

2. Before Green&nbsp;</font>
</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
This is known as the Age of the Snake. The snake race known as Shissar, slithered upon Kunark. The Iksar had yet to unite. Our people had yet to learn the Black Arts and the ways of Fist and Tail. Divided, the Iksar were enslaved by the snakes. In the centuries before the Green, the Iksar were slaves of the Shissar. They ruled from the ancient city of Chelsith which rest deep within the land now known as The Overthere. From here would sprout much evil. The Iksar were tortured like Frogs and suffered at the hands of the Shissar. The Iksar who showed genius were to help the snakes in their dark rites. These few were the seeds of rebellion. The Iksar began to plot a revolt, but a greater force would strike first.
The Shissar were an arrogant race. The power bestowed by the gods was not enough. They made pacts with other gods and demigods. They found the rifts of time and space and used them to gather magic items once held by the guardians of the planes. The Shissar's disloyalty and blasphemous pride would bring the wrath of the gods upon them. No power could stop the force to come. A green cloud formed in the skies above Kunark. The could began to descend upon the land. From it's green core, the face of death began to form. It was of no god they knew of. It opened it's giant maw and spoke in tongues unknown. From the mouth of death rushed forth a green mist. The Shissar shaman began to cast spells in hopes of shielding their city and the necromancers began to assault the mist with great weapons. All were futile. The mist rushed forth. The first snakes to be swallowed by the mist had their scales and flesh rot and fall from their bones. Horrid screams of suffering could be heard from within the mist. A river of flesh and blood flowed. The Iksar stood and gazed upon the gristle that was once the Shissar. With the Green Death came the liberation of the Iksar.
The season is now 0 A.G, After Green.&nbsp;</font>

3. Talon Southpaw&nbsp;</font>
</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
Talon Southpaw was the fastest pugilist ever to walk within the Court of Pain. His speed rivaled that of the great Grandmaster Tynn. He could often be found within the local taverns demonstrating the awesome speed of his fist.
Talon Southpaw came to rebirth within this caste. Although quick with fist and tail, the speed of his left arm was not to come to blossom for a couple decades past his rebirth. It was to follow his captivity by the accursed Samak.
Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn, Talon went on a wandering retreat into the dangerous outlands of Kunark. He was not seen from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his return to Cabilis he told of his captivity within an ancient city of Iksar now claimed by the Samak. He told of intense torture. He survived the ordeal. He escaped from the claws of the Samak with numerous scars which proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars were never to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he never removed. The scars underneath were for no lizards eyes. his great perseverance gave him an inner strength no other monk could lay claim to.
He now possessed incredible, almost blinding speed with his left arm. He could tap a foes arm with his left and strike with as if having a third arm! He was indeed a paragon of the Swifttails. All the empire under respected or feared him. None would spar him outside of the taverns. with grog comes stupidity.
Upon his death in Kurn, Grandmaster Tynn removed his hands in a private ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to gaze upon Talon's body. The fists were then sealed in a canopic which would stay within the Tower of Kurn. His body was dusted. This is his tale as told by
        Rinmark.&nbsp;</font>

4. Venril The Chief&nbsp;</font>
</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
Venril Sathir of the Kunzar&nbsp;<br>
The greatest lizard to walk upon the land was Venril Sathir of the Kunzar tribe. All that is known of his youth was that he was a member of the ancient Kunzar Tribe. This was during the time of division among the tribes of the Iksar. He was said to have never been a mere broodling. He was forever a master of combat.
Venril would soon slay his father and take his rightful place as chief of the Kunzar Tribe. He led the Kunzar on many expeditions into the ruins and wilds of Kunark. He sought knowledge and weapons.
In his late youth, he find the hidden library of the necromancer, Kotiz. He would come to open a large book which opened into a small room. Climbing into the book he finds a floating book. The Unholy Writ of War is it's title. Made of Iksar skins and containing great knowledge of combat. Venril becomes the books master.
Venril soon shows signs of dark knowledge. He begins to wield the forces of the dark circle and his knowledge of combat tactics becomes supreme. He trains his army new tactics and even raises the bones of the fallen to fight yet again for their master. His army grows and marches to all corners of Kunark.
Venril Sathir's army is now unstoppable. He shall soon plot the union of the entire Iksar nation. He no longer wishes to be just Chief, but rather, Emperor. Under his direction the four remaining tribe states of Iksar shall unite and a new age shall dawn.

</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
This is the time of the scattered and defeated Iksar empire. The great dragon, Trakanon and his allies of scale have left the empire in rubble and our people are divided yet again. the once grand city of Sebilis is claimed by the one who descimated it.
The remaining Iksar are scattered among the outlands of Kunark. Their places of refuge are now the dwellings of dark denizens. In the wilds, a few castes come to unite. One of these are the remnants of the Crusaders of Greenmist. They are lead by a powerful shadowknight named Nok Nilok.
The army of shadowknights number in the hundreds. Within their ranks are a few mystics and legionnaires. The tribe names itself after their leader, they are to be named, The Crusaders of Rok Nilok and they shall purge the lands of Kunark.
The Crusaders burn across the Dreadlands and death comes quickly to those who dare stand in their way. They slay many giants and many goblins. There shall be no prisoners of slaves. The empire shall be rebuilt by the hands of the Iksar. All other shall perish.
Kamors Castle is the first major objective of the Crusaders. It has now been taken over by goblin clans. The Goblins soon find themselves under siege. for twenty days they hold ground until the Crusaders choose to assault as a band of goblin deserters flee. A swift battle ensues and the castle is reclaimed.
The Crusaders now set their sights on the city of Cabilis. While the march is designed, Rok Nilok discovers something very evil. Nothing is known of his discoveries. No record exists of it's evil. All that is known is that Rok Nilok made a pact and soon shall suffer for it.
During the battle for Cabilis, a strange rain falls which shrinks them to the size of dolls and their heads are set aflame. Nilok's head burns red. And the goblins squash the would be emperor and his minions.</font>
