              The Ancient Order of Guardians was created to Protect and Serve the citizens of Norrath.<BR>
              We accomplish this mission by following three basic principles. These principles are<BR>
              Courage, Charity, and Education.<BR>
            </DIV>
            <DIV CLASS="parastyle3">

            </DIV>
            <DIV CLASS="parastyle4">
              Courage<SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle1"> - We must have the courage to protect those who are unable to protect<BR>
              themselves.  This can be accomplished in many ways, and is not limited to physically<BR>
              defending someone.  For example: Standing up for someone who is being harassed by<BR>
              others or verbally attacked without just cause.<BR>
              </SPAN>
            </DIV>

              <BR>
            </DIV>
            <DIV CLASS="parastyle5">
              Charity<SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle1"> - Helping others whom are in need.  It is often said that charity begins at home,<BR>
              and this is true in our guild.  We all help each other. If a guild mate is in need of a sword,<BR>
              and I have two, it is my duty to give my extra sword to him. If I need a helmet, and my<BR>
              guild mate is a Master Blacksmith, it is my guild mates obligation to make me a helmet.<BR>
              However, that is not to say that all is free. Everyone should remember that charity comes<BR>
              from the heart, and that we do not take advantage of each other.  Nobody is expected to<BR>
              just give something to a guild mate because he WANTS it.  We give it because he NEEDS<BR>
              it.  Also remember that Charity is a road that travels two ways. If you never give, don't<BR>
              expect to receive.<BR>
              </SPAN>
            </DIV>
            <DIV CLASS="parastyle2">
              Charity also takes place outside the guild. By helping the other citizens of Norrath in their<BR>
              times of need, we set the example.  They may remember our kindness and pass it along to<BR>
              others. They may even join us in our mission!<BR>

            <DIV CLASS="parastyle6">
              Education<SPAN CLASS="iltextstyle1"> - This is possibly one of the easiest of our principles to follow, but one of the<BR>
              most overlooked. This is simply passing on your knowledge to others. It can be as simple<BR>
              as giving directions to a traveler, or as involved as teaching a language. Take the time to<BR>
              answer a new citizen's questions.  Remember how it felt when you asked a question and<BR>
              nobody answered.  Most of all remember to pass your knowledge on to your guild mates.<BR>
