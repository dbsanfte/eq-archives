        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last of the
        old races to decline was the empire of the <a href="tunare.htm">Elves</a>. The Elddar Forest
        spread across the entire southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Cities and
        villages built high into the trees housed thousands of Wood Elves, and
        the marble cities of the High Elves were built in the forest's clearings
        and meadows, their white towers and spires climbing out of the forest,
        higher than the tallest tree. But then came the last curse of the gods,
        as <a href="solusek.htm"> Solusek Ro, Lord of Flame</a>, arched the spine of the serpent mountains,
        bringing heat from the burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran
        dry, it rained less each year, and while the great elven druids fought
        long and hard, using their powerful magic to combat the change, they
        could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert,
        and eventually even great Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced
        to flee Tunaria, leaving much of their greatness behind. Thus began <a href="lost.htm"> the
        Lost Age</a>.</font></p>

        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Age of Blood
        According to Vanusk of Kunark</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the dust settled, the last of the gods came to Norrath. These were
twin deities Mithaniel Marr, God of Valor, and his sister Erollisi,
Goddess of Love. Their creatures, the Barbarians, proved a hardy race
and settled the cold and rugged northlands near the ruins of the
Giants’ empire. As the Barbarians spread out across the lands — in
dispute with each other and any other race encountered — a tiny
movement toward enlightened thinking was sparked by the Twins
Marr and began slowly to grow. And so, even amidst desolation and
war, there was hope.
This enlightened order of Barbarians became the fathers and mothers
of the Human race. Their Combine Empire spread throughout the
known world, but then died even more quickly than it grew, and for
reasons still unknown. While they are the ancestors of every Human
on Norrath, and their relics and ruins still litter lands from Odus to
Faydwer, little history of their great empire remains.
