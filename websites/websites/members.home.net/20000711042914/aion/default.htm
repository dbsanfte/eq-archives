        <p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><i>&quot;It is said that outside of space
        and time an entity known only as the Nameless exists, and that this
        being created all that there is and was and will be. It is also written
        in ancient texts that from His mind sprang not only the universe and its
        countless suns and worlds, but also a myriad of sentient, powerful, yet
        finite creatures whom one such as a man, or elf, or dwarf, would call a
        god.&quot;</i>
        </p>
        <p>That is all that is known of the Nameless. No other record or annul
        speaks of his actions or deeds. We know of the finite existence of our
        many &quot;gods&quot;, and much of their history (yet not all) and try
        to find reasoning behind their actions, but, alas, cannot. All that we
        know is that which The Nameless wants us to know. All that we are is
        what The Nameless wants us to be. Without The Nameless, there would be
        nothing. It was his creations that first planted life upon Norrath, and
        that beget the world, as we know it. The Nameless is the one True God.
        Those that follow are merely minions of his greatness, each representing
        one facet of what The Nameless is.</p>
        <p>That is the basis behind Biblion, a new guild, and indeed, a new
        religion, in Everquest, on The Rathe server.</p>
