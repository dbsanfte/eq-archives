<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I would 
    like to welcome the wizards Crosslink and Vangor to the Arcane Knights. I 
    must say that the recent attention our guild has been getting has been an 
    much needed encouragement. I need you members to become active. E-mail Alek 
    and I with suggestions and ideas. That is how you will get promoted. If I 
    see you are original and are much more valuable to me as an assistant, I will 
    use you. Alek has his own news section and he is in charge of accepting guild 
    applications. Those who are promoted can expect the same kind of responsibilities 
    to be given to them. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I would 
    also like to address another issue. I believe that we could have a lot more 
    communication if many of you would go out and get either <a href="http://www.download.com/pc/software/0,332,0-19877-g,1000.html?bt.icq..cat37.g19877">ICQ</a> 
    or <a href="http://www.aol.com/aim/imreg_download_template?pageset=aol&amp;promo=73010">AOL 
    Instant Messenger.</a> I would really like to get to know you all better, 
    and while e-mail is great, ICQ is even better. If you have a reason why you 
    do not use ICQ or AOL, or you prefer a different program, let me know by e-mail. 
    Here are the direct links to download sites for both programs:</font></p>

<p align="left" class="annoucement"><font color="#FFFFFF">The Dark Elf controversy</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I see 
    that my decision to prohibit the Dark Elf from joining the Arcane Knights 
    is being questioned, and I believe that your reasons for concern are good 
    ones. I will attempt to clarify my concerns and the way I feel about the issue. 
    The Dark Elves are an incredibly gifted race, no doubt. I personally have 
    no feelings of hatred against them whatsoever. I have no doubt that among 
    such race there are many fine citizens, many who are noble and who deserve 
    the rights that we all enjoy in Norrath. However, as it has been said before, 
    the actions of few may have consequences for many. If the Dark Elves have 
    proven one thing in their history, it is that they cannot be trusted. They 
    have long since been considered evil, dishonest, and disloyal. They have misused 
    the powers of the arcane for the purpose of evil. This may all be coming to 
    an end now. I have met Dark Elves who I would be pleased to call my brother, 
    and I would love to let into my guild. However, as a leader sometimes decisions 
    have to be made that you do not always want to make. I have to look at what 
    is good for the whole, and what is fair. It is hard for me to put aside years 
    of dishonesty and wickedness and allow them into my guild. The Arcane Knights 
    stands for what is pure, just, and right. What place does an "evil race" have 
    in a guild like that? Nevertheless, I am willing to allow the Dark Elves in 
    if that is the wish of our guild members. Their entrance will not be as simple 
    as it is for other races, and they will be required to complete a "test" before 
    we will allow them in. I am a very open minded individual. I thought that 
    my decision to exclude Dark Elves would be the wishes of those in my guild 
    and be unquestioned. I now see that it may not be as I foresaw. I would like 
    to know how other members fell. You are a part of this guild, and you should 
    be allowed to express your feelings freely. <a href="mailto:eq_serro@hotmail.com">Let 
    me know</a>, and then I will make my decision. <br>

    recently came in contact with the webmaster for the web page, <a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/rathe.htm">Rathe 
    Rhapsody</a>. She inquired me as to whether or not I would like to have my 
    guild listed on his page. I had no doubt that I would want this, so I informed 
    her that I would appreciate the attention. Not only did she add our guild 
    to her guild list, but she posted the e-mail that led her to the Arcane Knights 
    on the main page! Hopefully with this, many other magic experts will discover 
    our guild and decide to join. </font></p>

  to popular demand, I have chosen to make the door to the Arcane Knights a bit 
  wider. I am opening it to ALL races (except for Dark Elfs). With this new expansion, 
  I expect to see a rapid increase in our size. The decision to do this came when 
  I realized how much interest our guild had, but people were unable to join because 
  of their race. I knew that I had to put an end to that. I want all peoples to 
  be able to experience the benefits of the Arcane Knights. </font></p>

<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><i><font size="2">Greetings 
    all. I'm sure most of you know me by now. If not, my name is Alek Tanoth and 
    I am of the Wizard class currently standing at the 8th level. I have not seem 
    much action from anyone else other than myself and Guild Master Serro Deimos. 
    This must change. We cannot have a guild consisting of just two active members. 
    If at all possible I would like it if all of you could post a message or send 
    me an E-mail indicating what times you are usually logged on. I am working 
    on getting an ICQ number, so hopefully you can communicate to me that way 
    also. After this, I would like to coordinate some sort of meeting that will 
    be convient for everyone. We are also in desperate need of new recruits. If 
    nothing else... just post the website address somewhere. Talk to friends, 
    group members, or anyone you make contact with about this guild. I don't know 
    about you, but I think it would be pretty exciting to actually hit the 10 
    member mark and be recognized as an official guild. That is all for now... 
    thank you for your time.</font></i></font></p>

  promotions. I need one more Lieutenant, and anyone will be able to recieve it 
  if they prove themself worthy. I look forward to the days ahead. The future 
  of the Arcane Knights gets a little brighter everyday. I will provide a little 
  information on our first even soon. It will not be restricted to only our guild 
  members, but more of an event to promote our guild. Members will most deffinately 
  be able to participate, but will also be expected to offer their services in 
  order to help the event run smoothly. Once Alek and I have worked out some details, 
  I will let you all know what the event is, and when it will be held. Please
