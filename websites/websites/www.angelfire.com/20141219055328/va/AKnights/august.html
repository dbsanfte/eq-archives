<p> <b><i>Monday, August 30</i></b></p>
<p class="headline">New constitution now in effect</p>
<p><font size="3">As many of you may have realized, as of now, the new constitution 
  is in effect which is what we are going to stick with. If it is changed, we 
  will have to use the methods of legislation that are set forth in the new constitution. 
  The change was made to do 3 things:</font> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="3">- Make clear I am a democratic leader, and not a dictator<br>
    - To make more officer positions so more members would have chance to be promoted<br>
    - To setup methods for us to follow for legislation and trials</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above we now have several available officer positions which we 
  need to fill. We need member from each class to serve as a representative on 
  the Council of Elders, and I am did not officially limit the number of Sages 
  that can be on the College of Sages, but 4 or 5 should be sufficient. How do 
  you become an officer? Here are the key things I look for in an officer:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1. Active member who shows enthusiasm toward the guild by participating in 
    guild conversations and post on message board regularly, and recruiting new 
    members.</p>
  <p>2. Member is constantly offering suggestions to myself or others as to how 
    to better the guild, or in activities we may have.</p>
  <p>3. Has shown that they will obey and follow the <i>Code of Conduct </i>no 
    matter the circumstances. </p>
  <p>4. Most importantly member displays characteristics of leadership and responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I plan on making a promotion or two at the next meeting so you will ALL want 
  to be there to see if you will be chosen to serve the guild in a greater capacity. 
  Some or you more than deserve a promotion. I will announce when the next meeting 
  will be later. It will either be on a Thursday or Friday in EverQuest chat (which 
  you access by clicking the button that says &quot;Chat&quot; at the bottom of 
  the server select screen) . Hope to see you all then. </p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">As always, it seems that in Verant's attempt 
  to fix a problem in EQ, they created a MUCH, MUCH bigger one. Last night, I 
  logged on to find that our guild had been deleted. I did not have tags over 
  my head, and could not invite individuals to the guild. I petitioned a GM and 
  they started the guild over. Problem is, EVERYONE has to be reinvented. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">When you are in EQ look for Snydar or myself. 
  I do plan on making honorary officers who will be able to invite people, but 
  will not announce them now because I have not even invited any of the ones I 
  have in mind.</font></p>

    will be using /guildsay.)</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">WE WILL STILL HAVE THE MEETING ON THURSDAY. 
  As a matter of fact, it is more important that you attend now then ever before. 
  We will be sure to have at least one officer at the locations that I have previously 
  listed. If you have not been added back as of Thursday night, try to get to 
  one of the listed locations, or at least get within the zone they are in.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">Both Snydar and I are working to get everything

  I would like to have a meeting. To discuss the new constitution, click the link

<hr>
<h3 align="left"><i>Monday, August 16</i></h3>
<p align="left" class="headline">Some changes</p>
<p align="left">As many of you may know, I am back in business. I have a working 
  modem, and it is business as usual for me once again. While I was on my little 
  &quot;vacation&quot; I was introduced to a new program, Guildboss. It is a guild 
  management program that will allow me to keep track of ALL aspects of the guild. 
  It has made me think of some new ideas, and made me reconsider some old ones. 
  For instance, our dues system is far to complicated. I want to change it to 
  a flat rate for everyone. Higher levels would be expected to give more, but 
  not required to. If you are wondering what money is used for I am in the process 
  of working out a loan system where the guild will loan guild members money for 
  items (assuming that members promises to either donate the item once they receive 
  something better, or pay back the money). Also, if Verant ever gets around to 
  adding the ability to buy real estate, it will be used for that purpose.</p>
<p align="left">Also, we will now have a new &quot;check in&quot; system. This 
  will help us weed out the active, and inactive members. With each check in, 
  members will update the info that needs to be updated (level, e-mail, ICQ, ect.). 
  Every member would be required to check in once a month, but I recommend you 
  update at least every level or so. That way members no what level you are at. 
  It will be a very simple process and usually require just you typing your name 
  and level unless some other info changes. </p>
<p align="left"><b>In summary, here are the immediate changes:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>- A new set due of 3PP that every player must pay every month (earth time). 
    Member between level 1 and 4 will not be required to pay. Members under level 
    8 can pay every other month. After 8, it is mandatory to all including all 
    Officers and Guildmaster. Consequences of not paying will depend on the level 
    of the member and the circumstances. Members who do not pay will not be removed 
    from the guild, but may be restricted from certain activities, benefits, ect. 
    HOWEVER, repeated, deliberate failures to pay may result in ejection from 
    the guild. NOTE- For all of you who worry I take the money you give me and 
    use it for myself, I don't. I have a separate character I never play that 
    holds on to ALL of the guilds moneys and items.</i></p>
  <p><i>- A new check in system that characters will use to show their presence 
    in the guild, and to update their info. Every member will be expected to check 
    in at least once a month. If a member does not check in for a period of 3 
    months, they may risk ejection from the guild. </i></p>
  <p><i>- No member will ever be removed without PLENTY of warning and time to 
    respond. I do understand that real life commitments do exist, and promise 
    to never remove a member without hearing their side first. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Another thing that I plan of doing soon (I know I have said this 
  a thousand times) is making some changes to the constitution. Many of you deserve 
  promotion, and I need to make places for you to be promoted to. </p>
<p align="left">Well, that about does it for this date. If you look around the 
  other pages that relate to the changes mentioned above should correspond to 
  what I have said. </p>
<p align="left">As always I would love to hear your comments as to the changes. 
  Either e-mail me, or post your opinion on the message board. If there is a problem 
  with any of the changes, I will make changes accordingly. Hope to see you all 
  in Norrath soon.</p>

<p align="left"> 
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Hello Brothers and Sisters,</i></p>
  <p><i>There are a few things I wish to go over. First of which it has been a 
    while since we had a meeting. Seeing how Aslan is going out of town on Friday 
    I believe we could hold it on Thursday, Aug 12, at 10pm EST. The place will 
    be in Freeport outside the desert gate next to the tents. You don't have to 
    be there, but this brings up my second subject, the College. Before Serro 
    left we had plans for a College of sorts to first off teach the fellow citizens 
    of Norrath languages, and we could expand from there. I would like to see 
    all who can at those tents on Thursday for language lessons. We don't know 
    what the demand would be on certain languages so it would be good to have 
    more than one person speaking each. I would also like to know what languages 
    you speak. I will try to make up for the ones we are missing. I speak (excellent) 
    Barbarian, Elvish, Dwarvish, Thieves Cant, Old Erudian, Elder Elvish, Giant 
    Tongue (combine), Kolbold, Elder Dragon. I would appreichiate if you could 
    also list the languages you know.</i></p>
  <p><i>Second I would like to do a guild hunt on Saturday night. I would like 
    to know who would be interested and what level they are, so a good site could 
    be chosen. In the guild hunt everything looted is given to the guild treasury. 
    Thus far it looks like Everfrost/Permafrost is a good place to do this. </i></p>
  <p><i>And lastly a quest. A long and drawn out quest I will start on meeting 
    night. This is open to all levels. You must be willing to travel. Stipulations 
    will be put on modes of transport, I will disscuss this on Thursday. It will 
    take several days to complete this quest, but don't fret the rewards shall 
    be well worth it (I hope =)). It will up to you all to either share in the 
    quest together or compete for the prize. though I will find out Thursday which 
    it is so I can make the prize to match (one item can't be split several ways).

  <p><i>That is all I have to say please respond with languages and if you are 
    interested in the hunt. Also if you are interested in participating in the 
    hunt.</i></p>
  <p><i>Thanks for listening to me babble, </i></p>

<p align="left" class="headline"><font size="4" class="headline">Small update 
  and hello</font></p>
<p align="left">First off, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude toward 
  both Balduk and Keldrick for there kindness and generosity. I never expected 
  to recieve such an offer from a guild member, and cannot tell you how shocked, 
  as well as flattered, I was by your offers.</p>
<p> I would also like to say I am glad to see that the guild has done so much 
  in my absence. Here is an update from Balduk about an event from the weekend: 
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Hello Brothers and Sisters,</i></p>
  <p><i>Just a quick message to tell you of the guild help party we had on last 
    saturday. The party going trough the zones to help other people and make our 
    name known to Norrath was a success.</i></p>
  <p><i>We started around 13:30 EST on saturday and started offering our services 
    in West Karana. Immediatly after our first announcement of our presence and 
    purpose our first clients started to appear and were amazed at the number 
    of buffs they could see on their screen :). We stayed in North Karana for 
    an hour or so and then moved to East Karana where we were also greatly appreciated. 
    We even go Hurrays in the shout mode. In order to have a bit of fun we also 
    killed the named cyclop Broon in East Karana. Our next stop was Runnyeye entrance. 
    Of course we also went inside after a while to offer our services. Sister 
    Lorana shrunk our whole party which was really fun. We then went trough Runnyeye 
    to Misty thicket. Again it was a success with people coming again and again 
    for our help. We also distributed free food and drikns to those in need. Next 
    stop was Rivervale where we stopped a while to relax before going on to West 
    Freeport to offer our services. I also received 5-6 inquiries about people 
    wanting to know more about our guild and wishing to join us. All in all a 
    really great fun was had by all of us.</i></p>
  <p><i>I wish to thanks the brothers and sisters present without whom this event 
    wouldnt have been the success it was: Sister Lorana, Brother Lawbringer, Brother 
    Cdor, Brother Gshoske and brother Starlan. I hope I didnt forget anybody. 
    Thanks all, it was great fun.</i></p>
  <p><i>Brother Balduk Swiftmind.<br>
    Arcane Knights. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I wish to thank both Aslan and Snydar who always step in and lead 
  the guild well when I am absent. I hope to be back in the game by the end of 
  this week, or the beginning of next week. I am quite homesick for Norrath and 
  miss the all of my new found friends I have there. Hope to see you all there 
  soon.</p>
