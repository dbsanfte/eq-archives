<p align="left"><b><i><font size="4">Wednesday, June 30</font></i></b></p>
<p align="left" class="headline">New way of meeting and a big event to start planning</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#3366CC"><b>12:00 PM EST</b></font></p>
<p align="left"> As many of you may have noticed, sometimes our meetings can be 
  a little slow moving and empty. I think we can easily blame that on the distractions 
  that EQ provides while we are trying to talk.</p>
<p align="left">In order to remedy this, and make the guild closer, I have came 
  up with a new way of us meeting. We are going to try it out this week. When 
  you log onto the server screen, most of you have probably noticed the chat button 
  at the bottom. I am going to be making our own chat room in EQ chat for us to 
  have a meeting. It will have a password, which I will send to you by e-mail. 
</p>
<p align="left">Many of you may be thinking, &quot;What about meeting in game?!?&quot; 
  Fear not. Here is what I envision. Our chats in EQ chat will be OOC chats about 
  the guilds, ideas and things like that. It will also be a chance for us to get 
  to know each other better PERSONALLY (which I feel will make our guild stronger). 
</p>
<p align="left">We will still have in game meetings, but they will be for pure 
  fun and role-playing. I feel that this is going to be better. Our meetings will 
  be shorter (I will try to keep them to no longer than 30 minutes), and you don't 
  have to log onto EQ to be at a meeting. This is a trial thing. Once we meet, 
  e-mail me and tell me what you think of it. So, here is all the info about the 
  meeting:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>DAY: Friday, July 2nd<br>
    TIME: 11:30 PM EST<br>
    LOCATION: EverQue</i><i>st chat room, &quot;Arcane Knights&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another thing that I have been thinking about is an in game college started 
  by us. Now that sounds impossible when you think of it as colleges as WE know 
  them, but that is not what I have in mind. Essentially we will name the college, 
  make it's home page within our home page, and will only have classes when we 
  announce them. We can probably get them announced on the EverQuest home page 
  even!! </p>
<p>This will be a big topic at the meeting on Friday. I have several ideas about 
  it that I would like to share with you, and give you a chance to share what 
  you think. Until then...</p>

<p class="headline">New member and looking ahead</p>
<p><b><font color="#3366CC">11:20 AM EST</font></b></p>
<p>I would like to first off welcome our new member Dargon! I am glad to see that 
  the guild continues to grow, even in my absence. Also I wanted to publicly thank 
  both Aslan and Snydar on the fine job that they have been doing. </p>
<p>This vacation has done a world of good for me. My creativity had just about 
  been burnt out, and this week I have been hit with MANY new ideas and directions 
  I would like our guild to head. One idea, I think, will get us on <a href="http:www.eqvault.com">EQ 
  Vault</a>, but I am not sure. I will discuss all these things later at our next 
  guild meeting (or at least some of them). I will see you all in the next few 
  days. Until then, good luck to you all.</p>

<p class="headline">Summary of the meeting </p>
<p><b><font color="#3366CC">3:00 AM EST</font></b></p>
<p>As was announced, the Arcane Knights met last night at 11:00 PM. Thanks to 
  guild chat, all members were able to interact and discuss in a way that had 
  never been experienced in our guild before. Many made the journey to Queynos, 
  while others decided to play it safe and stay where they were. Nevertheless, 
  it was one of the most successfully meetings of the Arcane Knights in its history. 
  For those of you who did not attend, here is a summary of what happened there:</p>
<dl> 
  <ol>
    <li>Snydar was promoted to Second Lieutenant</li>
    <li>The Research division was started and Snydar was appointed head of magician 
      research, and Crystala was appointed head of enchanter research.</li>
    <li>Changes in our constitution were discussed. All agreed to a change that 
      would get rid of majors, and replace them with elders. Each class would 
      have an Elder which would server as the head of that class.</li>
    <li>We discussed allowing other classes in and decided on letting Shaman enter 
      the Arcane Knights.</li>
  </ol>
</dl>
<p><br>
  We did have an excellent meeting, and I hope these do continue. I will be on 
  vacation next week, so it will be up to Aslan and Snydar to arrange and hold 
  the meeting (if they chose to do so). Good luck to you all, and I will see you 
  in Norrath!</p>

<p align="left"><b>First off, I would like to welcome Balduk to the guild. Balduk

</p>
<p align="left">I have signed us up for a mailing list at <a href="http://www.onelist.com">www.onelist.com</a>. 
  This will allow the guild to have one e-mail address to write to, and when they 
  do, all who are signed up on the list will get the message. It is a great service. 
  I believe you will all like it. Just go to their web page and get signed up

<p align="left"><b><font color="#3366CC">11:05 AM EST</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Unless you have been asleep for the past two days, 
  I am sure you all know that we are now official. In order for you to get your 
  tags, and gain access to guild chat, you must be in the same zone as Aslan or 
  myself. Both of us are able to add members to the roster. Once you have been 
  added YOU MAY NOT BE ANONYMOUS (unless you are just role-playing). If you are 
  anon your tags will NOT show. With role-playing, it says you are anon, but the 
  tags still show (probably one of the reasons the made the switch). I know we 
  have members scattered all over. If any of you to get to the Freeport area, 
  it would really help me out. I am currently there hunting in the Dessert of 
  Ro (good EXP). If you get to Freeport, give me a tell and I will come and add 
  you. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Now, about the meeting on Saturday, I regret to 
  inform you all that real life has once again had to take priority (ooc- I have 
  a girlfriend who will just not accept an &quot;EverQuest meeting&quot; as an 
  excuse). <b>In order to make it up, we will have one tonight at 11 PM EST and 
  at the 11 PM EST on Sunday. </b>The location will be at the tents out in the 
  dessert in front of Freeport. If you can get to Freeport, we can get you to 
  the tents. Also if we can get any of you who have not been added to the roster, 
  added, it will not matter where you are. (However, I would still like for all 
  to meet in person at meetings. Defeats whole purpose of guild if we never see 
  each other) From now on, we will not have a set meeting. Just keep visiting 
  the web page, and I will tell the time at some point during the week. . It is 
  going to bounce around between Saturday and Friday evenings mainly, so you can 
  have some kind of idea when they will be. Also be sure to check the <a href="meetings.html">meetings 
  page</a> for times and topics of the next meeting.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">One more thing, I want to personally welcome Starlan 
  to the guild, and apologize to Crystala for having her name misspelled on the 
  roster.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As many of you are aware we have entered the second stage of 
  guild approval which is name and charter approval. All though this may seem 
  like the easy part, I hear it isn't. Verant is REALLY strict about names, and 
  if any other guild has been formed and named the Arcane Knights, we will have 
  to come up with a new name. I certainly hope that is not the case with us. I 
  am confident that we will have no problems. Anyway, for those of you who did 
  not receive the e-mail, or just wish to read the beautiful words again, here 
  is what Verant said:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="3"><i>Your guild, Arcane Knights, has moved onto the second phase 
    of the guild approval process. The second phase is name and charter approval. 
    You should receive additional correspondence within the next 48 hours. <br>
    <a href="mailto:eqguilds@verant.com">eqguilds@verant.com </a></i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">I have sent and e-mail to Verant asking why our 
  guild application to be registered has not been dealt with yet. As soon as I 
  get a reply from Verant, I will post the entire e-mail word for word on the 
  web page, but for now, all we can do is wait. I am on the edge waiting to hear 
  what they have to say. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Now, about the new meeting time. I was thinking 
  that about a meeting around 11PM (EST) on Saturdays would be good. That way 
  I could more than likely be there most of the time. Next time I will try to 
  send someone a list of things to discuss so that the meeting can go on with 
  my absence. I want to know what you all think about</font> <font size="3"><b>Saturdays@11PM 
  EST?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Just post your thoughts on the message board. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">It has been a long time since I have made an update because 
  I have been spending a lot of time in the game building my character. I apologize 
  for my absence at the meeting tonight also. I am going to have to change the 
  time that we meet. Again, e-mail me with the times that would be best for you.<br>
  <br>
  I wish that I could tell you why I have not heard from Verant. I am almost positive 
  that they received enough e-mail's to make us official. I am going to e-mail 
  them and ask them what is wrong, encase we did something wrong. I will let you 
  know as soon as I know something. Also I want to encourage you to continue recruiting 
  new members. I want us to continue to grow. I know that it would be nice to 
  have high level people, but I am fine with the lower level characters also. 
  High level people are more likely to be in a guild already, and we need to grab 
  the newbies before some one else does. I want to wish everyone good luck in 
  there adventures, and again apologize for my absence tonight. </font></p>
