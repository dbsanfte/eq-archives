  </font></B><font color="#3366cc"><font size="1">(12:54 AM EST)</font></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><i>Greetings everyone, </i></p>
  <p><i>Sunday, December 19th will be our Christmas party. It will be held in the 
    Tox Forest outside of Erudin. The place was chosen because its relatively 
    empty and there aren't the dangers of other places. Hopefully we will have 
    the Arcane Knights Airline up and running to aid in getting everyone there. 
    It will be at 3pm EST, 12pm PST and there will be gift exchange in a Chinese 
    Christmas.</i></p>
  <p><i> I will explain the gift process. Everyone draws a number. The person 
    who gets the lowest number is first. He chooses a present from someone and 
    opens it (trade window). he announces what it is and then the next person 
    goes. He has a choice. Take a gift from someone else and open it or take the 
    gift that the first person opened. If he takes it from the first person, the 
    first person get to choose another gift. You may not take back the gift that 
    is taken from you. This continues till all the gifts are handed out. </i></p>
  <p><i>So everyone who comes bring something, anything that you may feel someone 
    would enjoy having. There will be a little variation in the process do to 
    Lore items seeing how you can have only one. And please no No Drop items =P 
    </i></p>
  <p><i>If we get the ingredients we will get some Chocolate Cake made by Lorana. 
    I will supply the beverages. I hope to see you all there.</i></p>
  <p><i> Good Journeys and Happy Hunting, </i></p>

  <p><i> What: Guild Fair for all Norrath Residents and Rathe Guilds <br>
    When: Sunday, December 5th at 9:00 PM EST (8pm CST, 7pm MST, 6pm PST)<br>

  <p><i> Have you always wondered about all those guilds out there? Ever wondered 
    how difficult it would be to become a member but were afraid to ask? Now is 
    your chance. </i>
  <p><i> There are many great guilds out there and many players that are unaware 
    how to call on these guilds for either help or membership. The Druid Council 
    is sponsoring a Guild Fair where all guilds can come together and either recruit 
    new members or just make themselves known. We are asking for all Rathe Guilds 
    to attend and during the fair will be asked to announce their charter, membership 
    requirements, web address and perhaps share some of their activities. If a 
    guild would like to sponsor a newbie event or a contest of sorts, this would 
    be very welcome. Our first Guild Fair will be in Qeynos Hills at the Cottage. 
    Our follow up fairs over the next month will be in East Commons, Misty Thicket 
    and Greater Fey. </i>
