The First EverQuest Portrait Artist!<br>
<font size=3>Creating Custom Made Portraits Since Beta<br>
For the Players on Zebuxuruk<p>

<FONT SIZE=3  FACE=arial>
Portraits are perfect for webpages, printouts, and wallpaper.  What a great way to display your character! My graphic adaptations are embedded with the Digimarc Watermark. I do not discriminate on the basis of race, class, or guild tag ;-P
<p>
You value your time and items as do I.  I endeavor to create for you a unique work of art that expresses the spirit of your character's persona. These treasures will be a cherished keepsake of your time in EverQuest.
<p>
To commission a portrait is not an easy task. You must be on the <b>Zebuxoruk Server</b>, as am I.<p>
<blockquote>

At this time, trying to balance RL and game playing, I am doing only special commission sets and guild portraits.<p>

<p>&nbsp;<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=2 color="#C0FFC0">Special Commission Portrait Set is 15k plat</font><font size=2>: includes a wallpaper in either 800x600 or 1024x768, a reduced version of your portrait for message boards, and the portrait itself. <p>

<p>
</font>
<font size=2>
<blockquote>Special Comission portraits are larger, contain more detailed elements, and action shots.  Examples of past Special Commission Portraits are <a href="./eqi/naughtnice.jpg">Naughty and Nice</a>, <a href="./eqi/snaggle.jpg">Snaggle's</a>,  <a href="./eqi/moonlighte.jpg">Moonlighte</a>, and <a href="./eqi/drakna.jpg">Drakna</a> to name a few.<p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><b><font size=2 color="#C0FFC0">Guild Portrait Set is 3k plat per member pictured, minimum 10 people. </font><font size=2>: includes a wallpaper in either 800x600 or 1024x768 to distribute to your members for home/office or (Also makes nice iron-ons for guild T-Shirts), a reduced version of your portrait in a special sig, and the portrait itself. Guild themes and suggestions are welcome.<p>

<font color="#C0FFC0">To order a portrait:</font><br>
 <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Email me the following:</a><p>
<blockquote>
Whether you wish a special commission set or a guild portrait<br>
Your char name/race/class:  ie Baladar/Dwarf Cleric<br>
Your time zone and time found on game so we can make an appointment: ie "5pm EST to 10pm EST M-F, and Weekends after 8am EST"<br>
Whether you wish 800x600 or 1072x768 wallpaper<br>
Your idea and vision...<p>
<i><font color="#C0FFC0">A note about Cancellations:</i></font> If you must cancel an appointment, please give me at least 24 hours notice in email. Cancelled appointments without this much notice means I have wasted time that could have been spent in game with friends or in RL (it does not make for a happy artist).  When you set up a time days before and you *Know* when/where it is, a /tell of  "oh sorry I'm deep inside [insert zone here]" is NOT ok. I do understand that RL things happen to prevent one from being in game, and in these cases I will be glad to reschedule for when we can both next meet.

Teromil won a special commission portrait set as a prize at the EQ Fanfaire in San Diego. It was delightful meeting him in "RL" and speaking with him on what he would like for his portrait.<p>
