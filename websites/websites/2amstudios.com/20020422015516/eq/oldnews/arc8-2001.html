<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">A Rant From Mareth</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, September 28, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>From <a href="http://pub92.ezboard.com/ffinalsanctuaryfrm1" target="new window">Mareth</a>:<br><br><b>Its 5am</b><br><br>And I should be sleeping. Verant however is busy making horses in the new expansion. And zones like kerra isle still need fixed. Kerra isle is a waste of space. They could have put nude halfling hookers there and noone would ever know.<br><br>I ponder to think how cool expansion will be in those 3 zones that will be playable. The other 80 new zones will look real cool, have a billion ways to kill you and most definitely have that dumbass that was in KC tonight pulling to zone. "TRAIN TO ZONE!" Ok I want all you newbies to get something straight: 3 mobs is NOT a train its a PULL. Trains are something that will most likely wipe out the people at zone and then go outside to see if they can finish off anyone else they might have missed. THATS a train.<br><br>My god and you idiots that are in my way...look dude yer a monk. FD when I pull past you. Its not hard. Why yes I realize I'm a monk. i realize you only pull singles. I however think singles are boring and I AM actively trying at the moment to destroy my group. WHY? BECAUSE ITS FUN THATS WHY. So get the @#%$ outta the way or its not my problem you die to 5 mobs. I don't want to hear you whine. Well actually I do. I'm going to record it and then play it at a goth gathering so I can watch them all commit mass suicide. Yes your whining is THAT bad.<br><br>Its not KC as a zone. Its the people. I pulled singles (purely by accident I assure you...I still want to kill my group) all last night. KC is rather warm and fluffy when you think about it. Pulls are easy, mobs have jack @#%$ for hps. Ok now read what I just said. Now if you disagree with either of those things get your @#%$ level 43 ass out of that zone. I'd rather get my anus attacked by some exotic killer bees than group you. Well unless you are funny. That makes up for it.<br><br>Want to know another thing? Everyone who hasn't been to a zone yet please do NOT give me your impressions of it. I don't care. See thats why I don't give out my impressions of zones unless asked. And its real simple:<br><br>"dude whats VP like?"<br>"Hell if I know"<br><br>See??? Noone wants to see this:<br>"Whats it like in ST?"<br>"Well its got giant hampsters that rampage on you and fluffy kitties that deathtouch if you don't pet them. Thats what I heard anyway."<br><br>Oh and I warn you idiots NOT to steal my pulls as they are inc. Its purely for your own safety. And yes I'm laughing my head off when that single you think I pulled is actually 3 + more inc. Again, single pulls are for uber mobs, girlfriends, or for when you are lacking something like a cleric.<br><br>And GOOD GOD if I get another monk coming up to me, inspecting me, asking me my stats AND THEN acting as if they are all superior because they have 3 more ac points I'm going to stab myself in the eye with a pencil. Look dude I do NOT care about your stats, your gear, your face, your race OR your 30 other halfling warrior twink accounts. Why does everyone think I'm in competition with them? I don't care! I like my stuff, I like my race, I like my face. Well ok I could do with a leather thong of DOOM(TM) but hey nobody's perfect.<br><br>Do ya'll realize that a level 45 sk/pallie/warrior/rogue or anything is just a BAD idea for a tank? Me too.<br><br>I'm gonna go lick a car battery now. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">New Scam</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, September 20, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>Please be aware there is a new email scam. The person asks you to read an EQ Manual Supplement and provides an attachment. This attachment is not a .doc or a .txt, and will most likely give the sender a backdoor to your EQ passwords and information.<br><br>Please delete the file and do NOT open it.<br><br><br>Raene</p></blockquote>
