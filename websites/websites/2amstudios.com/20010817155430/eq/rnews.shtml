<p><strong><font color="#98D698">Group Maker Utility</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, August 16, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i> From Annwyl</i><br><br>Hey all!<br><br>Some friends of mine, you may know them as the original Calis/Dolgan from KEG, Ankhorahil from Champions of Norrath on The Rathe, Camyen, and Garm have been working on a Group Maker utility for Everquest. The utility is designed to be way more useful and functional than anything else out there right now.<br><br>This is what the website says about it...<br><br>Well, the main thing that people will find useful about this program is the "Auto Group" feature. Basically, this will allow you to choose a template for a raid i.e. a Hate Raid Template. Then all the people you have set up to go on the raid will be filled into the groups automatically based on group parameters. The groups will be as "balanced" as possible. We will include templates for a few things to get everyone started. Eventually, though, we hope that you guys will start experimenting with your own templates and share them with others. <br><br>Other features will include the ability to see who on your raid is linkdead, AFK, etc. (To use this type of feature, you will need another machine on your network, since you can't alt-tab in EQ). You will also be able to search according to any parameter. I.e. if a piece of rogue armor drops, you will be able to instantly get a list of all the rogues in the zone.<br><br>There are several other features that we feel will be extremely useful. We are also open to any suggestions you guys have for future releases. Just post your thoughts on the forum.  You can email the creators with questions/comments/suggestions/bugs at staff@llamaherder.com.  Also, feel free to post in the forums linked on the website!<br><br>It is downloadable from their website at <a href="http://www.llamaherder.com">www.llamaherder.com</a>. So please download it and give it a look, use it, test it, try and break it, and give feedback to the guys. Hope you like it!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#98D698">Elmo Factory</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Sunday, August 12, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i>From Dari:</i><br><br>A new employee is hired at the Tickle Me Elmo factory. The personnel manager explains her duties and tells her to report to work promptly at 8:00 AM. <br><br>The next day at 8:45 AM, there's a knock at the personnel manager's door. The assembly line foreman comes in and starts ranting about this new employee. He says she is incredibly slow and the whole line is backing up. <br><br>The foreman takes the personnel manager down to the factory floor to show him the problem. Sure enough, Elmos are backed up all over the place. At the end of the line is the new employee. She has a roll of material used for the Elmos and a big bag of marbles. They both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles and starts sewing the little package between Elmo's legs. The personnel manager starts laughing hysterically. <br><br>After several minutes, he pulls himself together, walks over to the woman and says, "I'm sorry, I guess you misunderstood me yesterday. Your job is to give Elmo two test tickles."<br><br><br><br></p></blockquote>
