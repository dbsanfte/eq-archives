<blockquote><p><center><img src="./eqi/wedding1.jpg"></center><p>
This past Sunday the denizens of Hate Plane were evicted in preparation for the nuptials of Chesse Defenestratrix and Bearjangles Shardic, of the <a href="http://www.mfh.net/eq/eqhome.html" target="new window">Muppets From Hell</a> guild, (Emef'Aitch). Clerics of Innoruuk invited to perform the ceremony declined, stating they'd rather die than perform such unholy matrimony. Muppets were only too happy to oblige. Chesse is taking Bearjangles' surname, much to the relief of reporters and to the sorrow of broken window fixers. Married in RL as well as game now, we give our brightest blessings and worst puns to the happy couple.<p>
Their wedding photo can be seen <a href="./eqi/chessbear.jpg" target="new window">here</a>.

With what will probably my last portrait for a long time, I have posted <a href="./portraits.htm">my self-portrait.</a> The druid robe I wear does not exist except in my heart, for robes are currently unwearable by my race.

From time to time I find a screenshot that just begs to have a caption or thoughts put to it. I may set up a page with these, as it lets me have some creativity without the time involved with portraits. In this one, the frog was actually on the bed when I took the screenshot.<p>

I'd like to apologize for lack of updates to the Rhapsody. I am an elementary school teacher in RL, and the school year has started up again. Recently I've been at work till 7 or 8 in the evening and had little time for EQ except weekends. This lack of time has also impacted my updates here.
