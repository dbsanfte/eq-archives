I rolled on down to the store yesterday and purchased No One Lives Forever. The game recieved very good reviews and so I thought i'd give it a shot. Its very good. Imagine Deus Ex thats funny instead of serious. Imagine yer driving a hot chick around instead of some buffed cyberpunk dewd. Imagine you get to shoot people and have them roll down the steps after they get hit. The graphics are a little screwy, and the models are so so but the humor makes up for it. I popped a cap in this dude's monkey and immedately failed the level due to "unacceptable simaian casualties". I had to reload the level 4 more times due to being unable NOT to fill the monkey full of lead each time I got to him.<br><br>I won't give any more of it away. <br><br>So after I got done playing NOLF, I did my normal surfing:<br><a href="http://gucomics.everlore.com/">http://gucomics.everlore.com/</a><br>www.pvponline.com<br>Little bit of porn searching (my holy grail)<br>Resisted the urge to venture to whineplay and see whats shakin.<br><br>So then I logged on to EQ and thats where my real adventure began:<br>First off I logged in to EW and was refreshing my own buffs as this one dude sends me a tell. "Hey can I get a res?" "Uhh no" "Why not? I can drag my body to you" "Dude I'm not a cleric" "57 Dark elf Luminary right? If you don't want to do it just say so." "I can't" "I can pay" "Uhh no I can't cast that spell" "When you med up then?" "I'M NOT A CLERIC" "Whatever"<br><br>Charming newbies. The other day I had some noob rogue ask me how long I camped for my spear. "Fairly long" "Can I have it?" "Its no drop"<br>"Where did you get it?" "Quest" "Think I could do the quest?" "Probably if your faction is good enough" "Where do I find info on that quest?" "EQlizer. Its under SHAMAN EPIC QUEST"<br><br>Something that just popped in my brain: Beware of carrying around TOO much money. This one human at FP bank about a week or so ago was standing on the shelf at the bank. He turns around, looks at me, steps off shelf and dies. I laughed so hard I thought I would start coughing up bits of lung.<br><br>Or there was the time in Gfey when this newbie came up to me and<br>DEMANDED sow. Just as I was thinking "should I warn him about that...". A orc pawn walked up and smacked him into unconsiousness. As he died I was thinking "boy some days karma just kicks you in the face".<br><br>So anyway what was I talking about? Oh ya the things that make me feel<br>good about playing EQ. Like zoning into Karnor and finding a Xenth corpse. <br><br>Things like SLR's who actually believe people think they are really chicks. <br><br>Eci players who keep asking me in shouts wtf an SLR really is. <br><br>Calling someone a PAB and having them not really know if they've been<br>insulted. <br><br>Convincing the entire EW zone that you are killing snow bunnies to get<br>the rare "vorpal bunny" to spawn. <br><br>Chasing newbies in qeynos in bearform. <br><br>Watching Marcys proclaim that Snubbles isn't really gay. <br><br>Watching KEG chat degenerate yet again into porn, britney spears, and<br>/cyber. <br><br>Proclaiming that Duvlin/Draven is a Vulcan that hasn't come in peace. <br><br>Getting everyone in zone to ask Deemoness about her "bunny". <br><br>Waiting for the cleric to go OOM and then daring the puller to pull a train ("Cmon wussy, there's nothing I can't handle...bet you can't train ME out of here!").<br><br>Watching Jerrica or Megwedariel get from point A to point B anywhere in Norrath. (Little background info: Jerrica got lost in Field of Bone and had to be summoned to where we were. She's only like level 55 or so. :P)<br><br>Seeing a cleric stand up too late to save a tank. Tank dies, cleric shrugs and sits down.<br><br>Wondering if Sanctume is asleep at the wheel again or playing another 6 hour gems game :P<br></font color></p></font></font></blockquote>

"But Mareth, I live in Utah!" Ok fine, do me a favor and NEVER get behind the friggin wheel of a car ever ever again. I could boost up a spider monkey on methadone and have approximately the same results as someone from Utah behind the wheel. Why are all these people in Utah? Simple. They do that crap in California, they get shot. They do that shit in Idaho, we send them to that place on the "Deliverance" river (can't get there from here...). <br><br>      Ok so I'm a little mad. BOY OH BOY do I have shit to rant about. Thing is I just got done driving for 16 hours so my mind is somewhere between "mmmm, coca-puffs" and "mmmm, drool". I was thinking about some things on the way home tho. Ryna and I were discussing why KEG decided to have a raid in Vegas of all places (very close to Utah...I swear all them people from Utah were watching me...fuqin homos). I then remembered a few rejected places that were suggested for the KEG raid:<br><br>KEG RAID: Elk City! (Rejected. Noone knows wtf this is)<br>KEG RAID: UTAH! (see above)<br>KEG RAID: Pruduoe (sp? I'm tired, stfu with yer spelling corrections) Prudo Bay, Alaska (Rejected. Not enough dog-sleds)<br>KEG RAID: San Francisco (Rejected. Dangerously close to where snubbles lives. Fuqer showed up anyhow)<br><br>      So anyhow, it was a good time. Noone but Ryna would join me on my quest for the Holy Grail (read: Porn) however. Talk about not showing up for a raid. I completed my quest and got the experience however. And some nifty little pamphlets amoung other things. VEGAS KICKS ASS.<br>                           <br>      Oh anyhow where was I? Oh ya. Porn. Err wait. No. Ahh. I was discussing how Utah needs to be the new site for us to test Nuclear weapons. I already said that? Oh well it needed said again. Oh and if yer from Utah no offense but yer driving sucks. No. It does. Seek help. Help as in, NOT DISABLING YOUR FUQING BLINKERS WHEN YOU BUY THE CAR.<br><br>      Err I'm better now. What has Verant did this week? Hell if I know. Someone send me the down and dirty (not porn, I got enough thank you...oh and if you are the dirty bastard who signed my hotmail up for soft porn I'd like to send you a big fat /rude. Send me some goddamn good stuff for christ's sake...that soft stuff just serves to piss me off). Err Send me the down and dirty on what I missed as for patches, splits, movelogs, politics, and general shit to rant about because I'm going to go pass out now and dream of driving on Utah roads with a loaded backseat full of large and shiny guns.

If you use the command before it is opened, your request will not be captured by the log. So if you have already executed the move log, you will need to do it again during the proper window. Here is a copy of my recent post about this:<br><br>We will be opening a new server and moving characters from the E'ci and The Rathe severs to this new server upon the request of the customer. If you choose to move your characters to the new server, please be aware that all of our characters on the old server will be moved to the new server.<br><br>To request to have your characters moved to the new server, all you need to do is type "/movelog yes" into the chat window while playing a character on that server during the time that the move log is open.<br><br>We will be opening the move log for these two servers on Friday, March 16th, 2001 at 6:00 pm. PST (which is Saturday morning at 2:00 am GMT). We will be closing the move log on Sunday, March 18th, 2001 at 11:59 pm PST (7:59 am on Monday the 19th GMT). The new, yet unnamed, server should be opened some time during the week of March 19th. We'll announce the exact date as soon as we can.<br><br>There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing to move your characters to the new server. The most important thing to keep in mind is that character corpses will not be moved with the characters. So it is important to make certain that you have looted all of the corpses that you want to loot before the characters are moved.<br><br>Also, characters names are unique on the new server. Because characters will be moving from two separate servers onto the new one, there may be cases where two characters with the same name are created on the new server. Because character names must be unique, one of the two characters will be chosen at random and have an 'x' added to the end of their name. If you find that one of your characters has had an 'x' tacked onto their name after the move and you would rather have a new name, please contact your GM by using the /petition function. The GM will help you to change the name of your character.<br><br>Guild structures do not follow the characters to the new server. We will be unable to reestablish guilds until at least a week has passed after the split. On any day after the new server has been up for eight days, the guild leader can /petition for a GM to help them reestablish the guild. Please do not petition for this before seven days have passed, we will not be able to set up your guild before then.<br><br>We will not be moving characters back to the old server, so make certain that you want to move your characters before you type "/movelog yes". And we will not be moving characters for those that fail to execute the movelog command during the stated window of opportunity. <br><br>                     Alan</i></p></font></font></blockquote>
