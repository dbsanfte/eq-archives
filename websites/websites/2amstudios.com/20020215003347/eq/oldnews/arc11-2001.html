<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">A Rant From Mareth</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Sunday, December 30, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>You Christmas spirit people are full of it. It as in shit.<br><br>The town I live in is where everyone comes from the more rural towns to shop for the holidays (along with school and other seasonal need shopping). Here's my question: Why the HELL does everyone suddenly become a jackass during the holidays? I mean jesus. I feel I should warn everyone however: I'm a jackass year round....I got more experience at this than you do so expect me to piss you off even more if you wanna start something.<br><br>For example: I was pulling into Blockbuster video the other day. This lady and I were going at the same time to two parking spots side by side. No problem. Well since I stopped and waited and she *didn't* go I assumed the dumb skank was letting me go. So I went. And she and her<br>"gee-I-need-clubbed-like-a-baby-seal" children stared at me like I just chopped up thier dog and ate it in front of them. So as I walked by I showed her my favorite finger.<br><br>Know what? I hate happy people. I mean happy as in no-reason-to-be-happy, happy people. They irritate me. I always get: "Gee man yer so angry all the time" or "Dude who pissed in your cheerios?". The answer is me. I *LIKE* being angry. It stops people from chatting to me about wether code red or regular mt dew is better at 8am. That early, if you are speaking to me in a *perky* type of way it had better be because one of your appendages is soaked with burning napalm and you'd like assistance.<br><br>Even in Everquest I get that. They are always like hi and I'm like dude I hate you and stuff. Happy-for-no-good-reason people are dumb. A friend of mine bailed on a group telling them his cat was on fire and that he had to leave (NOT log off mind you). He later got a tell asking if his cat was ok. God I hope that was sarcasm and not honest worry.<br><br>If one more person tells me to get into the christmas spirit I'm going to shove my yuletide foot up thier butt. I don't mind xmas actually...I like the gift giving and stuff (I'd like it even more if I got what I wanted year after year :P). Its like they think they don't have to act nice all year *except* on christmas. I got news for ya...I'm nice to you until yer not nice to me all year round. It works<br>great. I don't need no goofy holiday to tell me that. <br><br>I tried to tell Santa I wanted a Realdoll this year but he still hasn't lifted the restraining order. Can anyone help me out by taking up a collection or something? :P</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">A Rant From Mareth...</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Saturday, December 8, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>Ok its bad enough that I'm in Ecommons.<br><br>Its bad enough I have to listen to: /auction selling stacks of batwings for 4billion pp a stack! They are sold for 3cp each the next zone over. Try NOT being the zillionth noob to figure out that not everyone realizes this and you can exploit people. Fucker.<br><br>See I've been sitting there the past week or so (see my auctions on cop board and inferno or whatever that board is that the inferno is under)....dude if you can't afford what I'm selling its cool, trust me. But PLEASE do not fucking stick some rusty short sword in my trade window and say something to the effect of: "oh ya? well what about if I throw in THIS???". Throwing in that only ensures that you will get a free kick in the nuts extra to go along with your free crotch soccer game I'll give ya.<br><br>Or my favorite. I'm selling shit WAY under price cause I hate that damn zone and want it to go fast. Someone offers me something that maxes out at about what I'm selling my stuff on rebate for. "They are the same value!" Look dick I told you nicely 4 times I didn't need/want whatever you offered. Now I'm just gonna say its not anywhere near a fair trade to me. And no I don't need your imbued snotsack, no matter how much you play it up. <br><br>This is the best: "Giving sow for donations at tunnel entrance!" Mareth shouts "Giving sow for free at shady" <br><br>Then the tells start. Look. I don't care about you. I'm honestly doing it to make your day worse. Really. Besides when you have to pay per cast on yer sow spell come talk to me. I've made some kickass friends since this game was released by NOT charging for spells. (*cough* /bind *cough*) Take a clue, I'm giving them away free. Dick.<br><br>Oh and so I get bored and decide to search luclin. No problemo. I get stuck in Sans Serif or some shit. I shout for 45 min while I look for the other zone as to WHERE THE HELL IS IT? Not in those words. Not a single person answered me.<br><br>See if I warn them before I pull anytime soon. Excuse me, watch out for the *CRUNCH* ....nevermind.<br><br>The high point of my night was when Slaander came up on his chanter and turned me into a Imp. Dude. You ain't lived till you've beat the shit outta shady as an imp. <br><br>Or seen Aly bald. Either way... </p></blockquote>
