<blockquote>
I've been an avid online RPG player since 1996 when Sierra came out with <a href="http://www.realmserver.com/">TheRealm</a>.
 I was known there as Jaella and started creating fan art with altered game pics and portraits.<p>
When <a href="http://http://everquest.station.sony.com/">EverQuest</a> came out in 1999 I never looked back to TheRealm.
 I began doing player commissioned pics for in-game "platinum", again with altered screenshot art. My work and galleries can be seen <a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/portraits.htm">here</a>. Recently I've branched out from using game art, to creating "EQDollz": a pixelated gal or guy with base bodies I create, and hand drawn armor based upon your game character. I have over 6 years of experience creating player art from online games and utilize several different programs to achieve the effects that I want, though my favorite is Paint Shop Pro by JASC. Here's a peek at my <a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/dollz/images/office.jpg">office</a>.
<p>
In "Real Life"  I enjoy going to Renaissance Festivals with friends, spending time with my husband and friends, as well as playing Everquest.  I have a Bachelor's degree in Art, and a Master's in Education. While in my undergraduate studies, I explored black and white photography. My undergrad thesis researched the history of collage and proposed future of manipulated imagery. What would the implications be of the digital age with technological advances in different media?<p>

I've lived in St.Louis, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia. I've traveled to Japan where I was an exchange student. I try to keep my spoken Japanese skills from deteriorating. I've taught Kindergarten and Fifth Grade, but take the most pleasure in creating art.<p>

Every day I'm thankful for the talents I have, and the delight and joy I can bring to someone with my work. By venturing into EQDollz, I feel as though I'm seeing an idea I've daydreamed about come to fruition. I hope you enjoy viewing the work as much as I do creating it.
