Portraits are perfect for webpages, printouts, and wallpaper.  What a great way to display your character! My graphic adaptations are embedded with the Digimarc Watermark. 
<p>
You value your time and money as do I.  I endeavor to create for you a unique work of art that expresses the spirit of your character's persona. These treasures will be a cherished keepsake of your time in EverQuest.
<p>
To commission a portrait is not an easy task. You must be on the <b>Rathe Server</b>, as am I.<p>
<b>Pricing is as follows:<br></b>
Level 29 or below: 200plat<br>
Level 30 to 39: 300plat<br>
Level 40 to 50: 400 plat<p>
Couples portrait:  add 150 plat to above prices, based on highest level in the portrait. <font size=-1>(i.e. level 35 and level 28 in couples portrait would be base 300 plus 150 plat for 450 total price)</font> <p>
Items of interest are also considered in trade instead of plat.<p>
Twinkies in Rubicite, Oracle robes or Metallic robes will be charged 500 plat.<br>
<font size=-1>(Yes laughed my arse off when I saw a dark elf in a robe of Oracles running to the guards from a black bear!)</font><p>
GMs are free of charge as they help us all. (hehe and they couldn't give me a thing anyway!)<p>

<p>
 I welcome ideas for your character to materialize your vision. However, if your wishes involve larger format and specific, detailed elements, you are really asking for a <a href="./scp.htm">Special Commission Portrait</a> such as Kathia du Lac, and Mt. Rumplemoore. Despite rumors to the contrary, there are things impossible for me to bring about in pixels, but I will do my best.<p>
<a href="mailto:jraene@hotmail.com">Email me</A> to make an appointment. <p>


<p>
If you wish to provide a link to these pages, just drop me a line to let me know. However, if you wish to publish a portrait on your site, get permission from me and from the player in the portrait. My permission not required for guild sites regarding a member's portrait.<p>

If you wish to see my gallery of Realm Portraits, where I was known as Jaella, you may go <a href="http://www.public.usit.net/nrspears/portraits.html">here</A>.  Since Raene is now my main character, the portraits are signed by her, and no longer signed as Jaella.  Please update your links.
