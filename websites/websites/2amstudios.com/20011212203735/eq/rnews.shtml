<p><strong><font color="#98D698">A Rant From Mareth...</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Saturday, December 8, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>Ok its bad enough that I'm in Ecommons.<br><br>Its bad enough I have to listen to: /auction selling stacks of batwings for 4billion pp a stack! They are sold for 3cp each the next zone over. Try NOT being the zillionth noob to figure out that not everyone realizes this and you can exploit people. Fucker.<br><br>See I've been sitting there the past week or so (see my auctions on cop board and inferno or whatever that board is that the inferno is under)....dude if you can't afford what I'm selling its cool, trust me. But PLEASE do not fucking stick some rusty short sword in my trade window and say something to the effect of: "oh ya? well what about if I throw in THIS???". Throwing in that only ensures that you will get a free kick in the nuts extra to go along with your free crotch soccer game I'll give ya.<br><br>Or my favorite. I'm selling shit WAY under price cause I hate that damn zone and want it to go fast. Someone offers me something that maxes out at about what I'm selling my stuff on rebate for. "They are the same value!" Look dick I told you nicely 4 times I didn't need/want whatever you offered. Now I'm just gonna say its not anywhere near a fair trade to me. And no I don't need your imbued snotsack, no matter how much you play it up. <br><br>This is the best: "Giving sow for donations at tunnel entrance!" Mareth shouts "Giving sow for free at shady" <br><br>Then the tells start. Look. I don't care about you. I'm honestly doing it to make your day worse. Really. Besides when you have to pay per cast on yer sow spell come talk to me. I've made some kickass friends since this game was released by NOT charging for spells. (*cough* /bind *cough*) Take a clue, I'm giving them away free. Dick.<br><br>Oh and so I get bored and decide to search luclin. No problemo. I get stuck in Sans Serif or some shit. I shout for 45 min while I look for the other zone as to WHERE THE HELL IS IT? Not in those words. Not a single person answered me.<br><br>See if I warn them before I pull anytime soon. Excuse me, watch out for the *CRUNCH* ....nevermind.<br><br>The high point of my night was when Slaander came up on his chanter and turned me into a Imp. Dude. You ain't lived till you've beat the shit outta shady as an imp. <br><br>Or seen Aly bald. Either way... </p></blockquote>

I've said it so many times, I can quote it in my sleep.<br><br>What boggles my mind is the fact that NONE of you strange ones actually listen to me! I'm talking to YOU, you pointy eared strange ones! <br><br>How DARE you use your demonic magics to harm my people?! As Prexus lives, you cold-hearted land walkers will feel the wrath of the OTHMIR!

Not ALL of the puny strange ones in your pitiful Kunark outpost died immediately. Many of them pleaded with our warriors in a most undignified manner. They told us much about you "elves", far more then we wanted to know.<br><br>So, go ahead, vile elves! Pray to your blasted Tunare wench!

<p><strong><font color="#98D698">Othmir Ravage Norrath!</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, November 28, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i>From Falqour, <a href="www.sofeq.com">Spirit of Fire Guild</a></i><br><br><br><center><img src="http://www.sofeq.com/othmirwar.jpg"><br><font=verdana size=4><I>No one is safe!</I></center><br><br>In what could easily be described as the most odd event ever to transpire upon our beautiful homeland of Norrath, the Othmir, the once peaceful otter people who thrive on the beaches of Cobalt Scar, proceeded to venture forth from their seashell homes and lay waste to several Elven settlements, killing many.<br><br>The picture above was taken by a badly injured Half-Elf who barely escaped the destruction of Firona Vie, an outpost in the lands of Kunark.<br><br>According to eyewitnesses, the enraged otters swarmed the docks of the outpost, apparently having swam all the way from their Velious home. They quickly swept through the outpost, murdering Elf and Non-Elf alike.<br><br>Among the survivors was Wella Fargin, who worked as a teller at the outpost's bank. "When I first saw them coming, I was thinking, 'oh, how cute!'", said Fargin, "but when one of the funny-looking creatures bit the head off of a gnome who was trading with me, it was at that point I decided I should run."<br><br>Investigators who arrived in the Cobalt Scar region shortly after the attacks occurred were unable to locate any trace of the Othmir homes. Investigators decided to question a few of the dragons that patrol the area around the Othmir Cove. One Wyvern mentioned that the Othmir deserted their settlement nearly two weeks ago. When asked why, one drake reportedly said, "Long have we feared the coming of this day. The Druid mortals who delight in torturing the young Othmir have indeed brought this apocalypse down upon themselves, and perhaps the entire Elven race." The drake continued, "We've feared the awesome might of the ancient Othmir for millennia, indeed, they hold the power of the Gods. They won't stop until every last one of you manlings has paid the price for your unbridled arrogance."<br><br>Security in and around Greater Faydark is expected to increase dramatically in the next few days.<br><br>In response to the claims of Druid poachers inciting this particular disaster, both Tunare and Karana were sought out for comments, but both declined to speak on specifics, stating only that the actions of their followers do not necessarily reflect the opinions or doctrines set forth by either of the deities.<br> </p></blockquote>
