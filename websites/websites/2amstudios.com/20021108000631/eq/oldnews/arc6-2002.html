Your potted plants stay alive.<br><br>2. Having sex in a twin-sized bed is absurd.<br><br>3. You keep more food than beer in the fridge.<br><br>4. 6:00 AM is when you get up, not when you go to sleep.<br><br>5. You hear your favorite song on an elevator.<br><br>6. You carry an umbrella. You watch the Weather Channel.<br><br>7. Your friends marry and divorce instead of hookup and breakup.<br><br>8. You go from 130 days of vacation time to 7.<br><br>9. Jeans and a sweater no longer qualify as 'dressed up'.<br><br>10. You're the one calling the police because those darn kids next door don't know how to turn down the stereo.<br><br>11. Older relatives feel comfortable telling sex jokes around you.<br><br>12. You don't know what time Taco Bell closes anymore.<br><br>13. Your car insurance goes down and your car payments go up.<br><br>14. You feed your dog Science Diet instead of McDonald's.<br><br>15. Sleeping on the couch makes your back hurt.<br><br>16. You no longer take naps from noon to 6 p.m.<br><br>17. Dinner and a movie - The whole date instead of the beginning of one.<br><br>18. MTV News is no longer your primary source for information.<br><br>19. You go to the drugstore for Ibuprofen and antacids, not condoms and pregnancy test kits.<br><br>20. A $4.00 bottle of wine is no longer 'pretty good stuff,'<br><br>21. You actually eat breakfast foods at breakfast time.<br><br>22. Grocery lists are longer than macaroni & cheese, diet Pepsi & Ho-Ho's.<br><br>23. "I just can't drink the way I used to" replaces "I'm never going to drink that much again."<br><br>24. Over 90% of the time you spend in front of a computer is for real work.<br><br>25. You don't drink at home to save money before going to a bar. </p></blockquote>
