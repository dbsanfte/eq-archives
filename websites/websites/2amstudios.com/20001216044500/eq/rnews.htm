Just last night I was screwing off as I am wont to do and logged in my necro to fear to BS with my friends in DOH. Up logging in and talking to Kinek I found that they'd been there almost 4 hours with basically 20 to 30 things top to kill because someone had come in there the night or day before to farm repops from the DBN raid.
<p>
 After another 4 hours the gorgons finally popped (about 8PM EST) and then it was a bit more time before they said screw it and left the zone due to the hassle of having to wait on repops. 
<p>
About the time they were leaving Grimjackk (sp?) logged in and after talking to one of the DOH people it was relayed to me that they were "lucky they even had 90% of the zone to kill" from his party of people farming the repops.
<p>
After more talking to the person in DOH it was basically relayed to me that it was Doomvortex (necro) /
Grimjackk (monk) / Spartix (unknown class) / Crazie and at least one or two others who are going into
fear and farming repops and screwing EVERYONE out of the shots at gear because they themselves can't get invited to planes runs on their own (imagine that)
<p>
 I could be 100% wrong on this except when TD was in fear 2 days beforehand they had the same problem (spawn time was totally screwed up) and they were having to wait on spawn to occur because "some group was in here earlier farming repops until we got in here" and the people in that group were the same ones I mentioned earlier who I saw myself as well as I spoke to a few of the TD people who said the people had not been invited on the raid.  
<p>
Guildstatus on each of them that I did showed no guild attachments.
<p>
Either we as a community have to make sure this crap doesn't happen more to the people who are involved or simply send the damn plane FFA so that the bigger guilds have the authority / power to zone in and stop this bullshit from occurring.

Take a deep breath, put those flamethrowers away please I don't have my fire resist gear with me =P

There were 4 different options available to all of us for the planes.
<p>
a) status quo
<p>
A lot of people aren't happy with status quo atm. For whatever reasons. Everybody pays their 10$ to Verant a month, and the ones who aren't happy are entitled to their say as well. Status quo for some, is not an option right now. I think for most of us. From my time as calendar admin, and the /tells I received in game, the majority of them weren't from uber guilds who were unhappy with what was going on in the planes. Nobody is in agreeance on anything at the moment. We can't  even agree on the smallest rules in regards to the planes.
<p>
b) Absolute FFA.
<p>
There are guilds in favour of wiping the calendar, taking it down, and going FFA right now. KEG is not one of them. Anybody who knows me, and what I have tried to do with this Calendar in terms of rules and fairness knows I am totally against absolute FFA. We *all* lose. And setting up a Calendar precluding certain guilds from posting, and other guilds being in FFA mode won't work either. We all know, Verant does *not* support any Calendar system of any kind. There will be nothing stopping guilds from zoning in on days others have booked on a Calendar. Nor do they support any one guild *owning* a zone, such as "first come first serve" FFA system. FFA will mean anybody can zone in at anytime with any amount of people to set up shop. We all don't want this  headache. 
<p>
c) Patch day FFA.
<p>
This I am also against. The same guilds will be killing the Gods over and over, preventing some of the younger guilds from getting their feet wet learning how to kill the Gods and Dragons in the planes. Much of the God killing would be to obtain epic quest items by the guilds able to kill them.
<p>
d) Epic quest rotation in the Calendar. This is what I proposed. Epic quest mob rotation on patch days. This consists of going in and helping a guild that *needs help* on patch days to clear the planes, kill the Gods, and let them keep all loot dropped in the plane. The rotation guild would loot only epic quest mob drops. The younger guild, gets a full clearing of a plane (which doesnt happen often), all God/Dragon loot, and out of the plane at a decent hour. Everybody still has their posting rights on the Calendar, including KEG/CIW/BOTS. This is to help prevent Gods from sitting up for days, half cleared planes with armour going to waste, and epic quest mobs getting killed. The "Epic Quest Rotation Calendar" is open for other people to join, there needs to be *some* sort of guideline to joining a rotation such as this or anybody can join.
<p>
I am open to any suggestions. Take the intiative and make some, blindly flaming with criticism gets us nowhere fast.
<p>
How would you change this proposal? What would you add or take away from it? To me it's a win/win situation. With the bonus of helping guilds who aren't killing the Gods, kill them.

Reposted from the above link:<font color="#C0FFC0"><blockquote><p>


A meeting took place last night between representatives of Brotherhood of the Spider, Clan Icewind
and Knights of Eternal Good. The representatives were mIstabone, Fitten, Jerrica, Snaggle, Qwai and
Aegirson.
<p>
Problem: our single largest problem are the epic mobs. We don’t need more plane dates as we really
 don’t need that much more plane armor. As a result we decided to experiment with a new system. 
<p>
1. Current Calendar stays, minor change for Sky. Same rules still apply as before except for Sky; only KEG/CIW/BOTS and maybe others will be able to reserve on Friday. The idea here, is that those guilds will get thru isle 1 to 4 or 5 that day and therefore allowing other to reserve on Saturday for isle 1 thru 3. Aegirson, Jerrica and a BOTS representative yet undetermined will jointly administer the calendar.
<p>
2. Creation of a 2nd calendar. This is a epic mob looting right calendar to which access will only be allowed by CIW/KEG/BOTS for now. Access to this calendar by other guilds will be granted upon proof of clearance of isle 5 in the plane of Sky. What do epic mob looting rights mean? This mean that on your normal reserved date, if an epic mob is up, a guild that is scheduled on the 2nd calendar may well show up in the plane and help you clear to that mob. They will have a claim to the epic loot. This also means that the epic loot claimers will not loot any other loot – this includes armor drops and other godly loot (bloodfire etc). Why only CIW/KEG/BOTS ? It is because we believe we don’t see anyone else defeating Kunark dragons and therefore the chance to complete an FA quest. Nothing worse than the idea of an FA component sitting in a bank of a player that will never finish the quest. 
<p>
3. 2nd calendar rules. Guilds that have an epic mob schedules will not give up their epic mob for another – including Venril Sathir and Trakkanon. Epic plane mobs will not be let open. More rules will be announced at a later time.
<p>
4. This is a test. This is a test. We do expect many to whine and bitch, and honestly, we don’t care. If epic mobs are kill stealed, if in-game resistance is met, Brotherhood of the Spider, Knight of Eternal Good and Clan Icewind will go full FFA on planes. Since we are not crazy, we will wipe the calendar clean and use it for letting each other of our intentions. You can expect this system to be in place by Halloween.
<p>
This is our last atempt to avoind full FFA in planes.

This past Sunday the denizens of Hate Plane were evicted in preparation for the nuptials of Chesse Defenestratrix and Bearjangles Shardic, of the <a href="http://www.mfh.net/eq/eqhome.html" target="new window">Muppets From Hell</a> guild, (Emef'Aitch). Clerics of Innoruuk invited to perform the ceremony declined, stating they'd rather die than perform such unholy matrimony. Muppets were only too happy to oblige. Chesse is taking Bearjangles' surname, much to the relief of reporters and to the sorrow of broken window fixers. Married in RL as well as game now, we give our brightest blessings and worst puns to the happy couple.<p>
