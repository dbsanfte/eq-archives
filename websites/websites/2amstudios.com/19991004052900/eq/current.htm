Greetings, I am Jaella LampLighter, daughter of Jaelshaya.
<p>

My mother Jaelshaya  was a follower of  Quellious the Tranquil. My father, Jahdiel, left my mother to  persue his ill-gotten necromantic magics.  Mother would not speak much of him.  
<p>

After the Ch'ta, she often sat at the docks of Qeynos fishing.  She spoke of the Peace of Quellious to any that would listen,  and prayed for new direction in her life.  She was overjoyed to discover her pregnancy.  I am named Jaella, meaning Divine, for I was her light and her life. 
<p>

I remember well those docks of my childhood, the sand between my toes, the stink of fish and brine, the sound of the water waves, the exotic people coming and going.  I often did errands for my mother, running for more bait and  selling the fish to local vendors (I sucked in my cheeks pitifully to try to get a better price).  We never begged tho.  My mother had a pride that lit her eyes with fire when I once suggested it.

When the time of Kelth'rn came, Mother took me to Erudin and I saw my ancestral home for the first time. I would not have to bear the stigma that had forced her to Qeynos.  <p>

<p>

 I was old enough now she told me, to decide on my lifepath. As I gawked at the beautiful men and women of my race (too long was I used to human visages) she directed me to the marble temples and guilds and societies that make up professional life in Erudin.  We stayed at the inn day after day and each new day I was given the opportunity to speak with different priests, paladins, enchanters, magicians, and wizards.  The weekend was spent at the great library  pouring over scrolls and books.  At the end of the sevenday I was asked to choose.
<p>

What was I to say?  All that was familiar to me was the life I had seen in my mother.  I too chose Quellious and the life of a cleric in Her service. <p>

While it is true that Followers of Quellious seek peace, I am not a strict pacifist. I will fight fiercely to defend myself and those I care about. <p>

I seek an inner peace. I wish to know all there is to know about myself and the world around me. I thirst for  knowledge of my true self and strive to help others  attain enlightenment. It is through the sharing of this  knowledge that I believe universal peace can be obtained.  I have a nomadic spirit, constantly seeking what there is to know and hoping to find myself along the way.<p>

What of my father?  My Spirit Father is the sea, dangerous yet bountifully giving; protective of its own. That physical entity named Jahdiel that caused my mother's life pain I care not about. It is common rumor that he and others of his dark magic ilk exist in the city of  Paineel, in The Hole.<p>
