When I was young, I ventured to Antonica to see what I could see. I encountered other races and other beliefs.  I found druids, not too disimilar from myself, who had never heard of Tunare. They told me of the wisdom of Karana.  There can be no harvest without the storms that bring rain.  Without the forest fire, new growth cannot occur.  There can be no life without death, no light without dark. Everything has a balance to it.<p>

So it goes with nature. Some say we are protectors of nature, not killing bears and the like. I say we are protectors of that Balance that is nature. Too many bears or wolves is no better for the commonlands and its people than no bears or wolves. Tunare, mother of all, looks after so many concerns...is it any wonder that nature gets lost in there. I have no quarrel with the Beloved One, but I have sought out  Karana the RainKeeper to learn more.<p>
War comes soon to our lands...we hear the drum beat at night. Friends have chosen sides. Not war against the orcs or the goblins or any unnatural thing, but against each other!!  How can this be? Friends choosing either light or night, vowing to wreck the other and become dominant. This is all futile though.  A fight I will not join.<p>
One cannot have day without night. Are there not 2 sides to a copper? This war is merely a balancing process as surely as a storm in fall. Neither side can dominate, for each cannot exist without the other. What is daylight without shade? Or deepest night without a light in the distance. Good cannot exist without Evil.  Evil cannot exist without Good. They define each other. Take away one and the other loses it's meaning.<p>
Karana has shown me the truth of it.  After the war is over and people have died for their beliefs, after the Gods and Goddesses have walked among us and mayhap died among us...we will get up, people and Gods, and brush ourselves off. Our wounds will be healed and both sides with feel better for the Catharsis. Neither will be eliminated, for that is against nature.
