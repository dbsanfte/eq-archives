The First EverQuest Portrait Artist!<br>
<font size=3>Creating Custom Made Portraits Since Beta<br>
For the Players on Zebuxuruk<p></font>

<FONT SIZE=3  FACE=arial>
Portraits are perfect for webpages, printouts, and wallpaper.  What a great way to display your character! My graphic adaptations are embedded with the Digimarc Watermark. I do not discriminate on the basis of race, class, or guild tag ;-P
<p>
You value your time and items as do I.  I endeavor to create for you a unique work of art that expresses the spirit of your character's persona. These treasures will be a cherished keepsake of your time in EverQuest.
<p>
To commission a portrait is not an easy task. You must be on the <b>Zebuxoruk Server</b>, as am I.<p>
<blockquote>



<font color="ffffff">There are 3 package options. Message Board Pic, Special Commission Set, and Guild Portrait Set.</font color>


<p>&nbsp;<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=2 color="#D19937">Message Board pic is 4k plat</font><font size=2>: Standard size is 140 x 160 pixels. Can include your guild logo.  I email you your message board pic, and you put it on your own webspace. For 6k extra I will host your pic for 6 months on my website (total 10k).<p>

Examples:<br>
 <img src="http://ldnews.kyid.net/images/members/ruca.jpg" width="140" height="160">&nbsp;<img src="http://ldnews.kyid.net/images/members/azaule.jpg" width="140" height="160">&nbsp;<img src="http://ldnews.kyid.net/images/members/aanya.jpg" width="140" height="160">&nbsp;<img src="http://2amstudios.com/eq/msgpics/kamille.jpg" width="140" height="160">&nbsp;

I do not host your reduced version on my website.<p>

<p>
</font>
<font size=2><blockquote>
Special Comission portraits are larger, contain more detailed elements, and action shots.  Examples of past Special Commission Portraits are <a href="./eqi/naughtnice.jpg">Naughty and Nice</a>, <a href="./eqi/ploogie.jpg">Ploogie</a>,  <a href="./eqi/moonlighte.jpg">Moonlighte</a>, and <a href="./eqi/valenya.jpg">Valenya</a> to name a few.<p></blockquote>

<font color="#D19937">To order a portrait:</font><br>
 <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Email me the following:</a><p>
<blockquote>
Whether you wish a Message Board Pic, Special Commission Set,  or a Guild Portrait<br>
Your char name/race/class:  ie Baladar/Dwarf Cleric<br>
Your time zone and time found on game so we can make an appointment: ie "5pm EST to 10pm EST M-F, and Weekends after 8am EST"<br>
Whether you wish 800x600 or 1072x768 wallpaper<br>
Your idea and vision...<p>
<i><font color="#D19937">A note about Cancellations:</i></font> If you must cancel an appointment, please give me at least 24 hours notice in email. Cancelled appointments without this much notice means I have wasted time that could have been spent in game with friends or in RL (it does not make for a happy artist).  When you set up a time days before and you *Know* when/where it is, a /tell of  "oh sorry I'm deep inside [insert zone here]" is NOT ok. I do understand that RL things happen to prevent one from being in game, and in these cases I will be glad to reschedule for when we can both next meet.
