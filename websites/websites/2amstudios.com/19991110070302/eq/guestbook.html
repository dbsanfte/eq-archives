<b>I love this game.  I played for about an hour or so and was not satisfied with any of the characters I created.  I was about to give up for the night when I created a gnome magician.  Ak'anon and it's inhabitants changed my whole perspective about the game both literally and figuratively.  I love it.  I now play Enika on Povar server as a wizard.  </b><br>
