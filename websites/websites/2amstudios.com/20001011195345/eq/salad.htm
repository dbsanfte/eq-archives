Saladarsif<p>

Written by Opafaf Darkenroot</b>
</center><p>
The low lit room filled with smoke, the remnants of yet another attempt
at research.  The spell had not succeeded, but that did not deter the
wizard. He had scrolls to make and not much time to finish his task.
Once again, he was needed throughout the world.  Again, the arcane
master combined the necessary components, this time taking care not
spill a drop as he had last time. Just one mistake in concentration had
cost him those expensive components moments before.  This time the spell
is successful. 
<p>
He scribes the spell and tucks it neatly into his pack,
ready to be handed out to a chance passerby or perhaps someone in need.
 Gathering his gear about himself, Saladarsif Ceasareo prepared himself
for his journey back to the lands of the wood elves, the Greater
Faydark. With a slight hand movement and a muttered canto, the wizard
faded into a shimmering pool of light, leaving his workshop again to
it's silence.  
<p>
Halfway across the world, moments later, a hum fills the
air near the four great spires of the Faydark wizard portal.  Salad (as
his friends often call him) stepped forth from another pool of light,
the twin to the one that had been in his workshop only moments before.
Slipping on his magical Journeyman's boots, he raced toward the Lesser
Faydark forest and his ultimate destination, Mistmoore Castle.
<p>
 Mistmoore in notorious for its vampires and vampire initiates.  A haven
of ancient magic, undead, and evil. Today Salad was to help his good
friends Gergely, Wyrrm, and whomever else might stop by in need of
assistance.  The task at hand was to hunt down the castle's servants and
liberate them for a certain dark-elf only known as the Avenging
Caitiff.  
<p>
The Caitiff was the offspring of these ill-fated people. They
were doomed to live life as vampires and wished them free.  In return
for freeing them and showing proof by returning to him the fangs of his
dead parents, he would reward the bearer of said teeth with a blade of
pure electrum.  Salad was here to do just that for his friends.  His
friends had tried on previous attempts but had proved ill- equipped to
deal with the magic that both vampires wielded. Salad was here to
provide the necessary magical force, while his friends provided him
bodily protection.
<p>
 Entering the castle grounds, Salad soon found Gergely and Wyrrm waiting
for him.  They were sitting in the early afternoon sun sharpening their
blades, dreaming of helping the Caitiff avenge his parents.  The idea of
that Electrum bladed Wakizashi was also a great motivator to the two
heroes.  The hellos were quick and the plan laid out.  They would rely
on stealth this day. Previous assaults on the castle had included
liberating many more vampires from their tortured state. Today would be
a fairly stealthy operation. Get in and get out without disturbing too
many residents.  
<p>
The legends were true after all. If you were not
careful you would have the legions of hell unleashed upon your party and
nothing short of a miracle would save you.  Salad made it possible for
the small party to see invisible objects to track one another during
their insertion.  The ranger camouflaged himself and Salad cast
invisibility upon the Warrior and himself.  Quietly they picked their
way through the outer courtyards and to the castle gates.
<p>
 Just inside the castle, the invisibility on the warrior dropped
suddenly in front of a stone gargoyle.  It sprang to life and attacked
the surprised halfling.  Jumping back, the stout warrior drew his swords
and prepared to defend himself.  Hearing the ringing of steel on metal,
a nearby Usher from an adjacent corridor came to investigate. Seeing the
intruded, she snarled in anger and rushed the little man.  Salad and
Wyrrm dropped back to help their friend.  
<p>
Salad rooted the Usher in
place before she could lay her hands upon his throat.  Wyrrm snared the
Gargoyle so that it could not run for others and the trio set about
eliminating the stone menace.  In short order, the abomination lay in
chunks of rubble at their feet.  The deathly Usher watched in
frustration and seethed with anger at the three heroes.  All thoughts of
calling out an alarm fled her mind as she focused on killing the
intruders.  The adventurers prepared themselves and soon the magical
root wore off. The usher came at the wizard first. After all, it was he
who had immobilized her for so long. She would eliminate him and then
the others.  Her anger had clouded her judgement however, as she soon
fell into the same trap as the Gargoyle had.  Soon she lay in the
rubble, breathing her last.  
<p>
The Ranger called upon Tunare and healed
the trio before they once again masked themselves in shadows.
 The rest of the insertion went much smoother.  Past the Music hall,
through a hall of ever- watching eyes set in stone they crept.  Past the
kitchen door and down the hallway into the area of the servants
quarters.  Scouting out the hallways, Wyrrm told the other two that they
had a clear path to the room in which the Maid slept.  The three of them
slid down the hallway and entered her room.  Directing the other two to
handle the gargoyle, Salad prepared his strongest spell.  
<p>
At the silent
count of three, the heroes leapt from the shadows. The Ranger snared the
gargoyle that stood by the maid's bed as a guardian. Gergely and Wyrrm
tore at it's iron hide with steel of their own.  The Maid heard Salad's
incantation and woke with a start, preparing her own in counter attack.
The Ice Comet hit the tortured woman square in the chest, freezing her
to the bone.  Her our counter attack hit Salad and he convulsed as a
shock of force gripped him. Wyrrm, seeing the fight turn somewhat ugly,
snared the fleeing maid to hinder her escape and jumped to help Salad.
She turned on him and struck him with her arcane powers as well.
Gergely held the gargoyle's attention and Wyrrm confronted the Maid as
Salad readied one more spell. Another incantation and the Maid screamed
in terror as the flesh was rent from her body. She slumped to the
ground, breathing no more.  
<p>
Gergely felled the iron watchman and the
trio slumped to the ground in exhaustion.  After a considerable rest and
much recovery, Wyrrm picked himself up and set about the grisly task of
post-mortem dentistry.  Pulling out his dagger, he removed two elongated
fangs from the maid's mouth as proof of the deed.  He removed the wreath
of nightshade hung about her neck and said a prayer for the departed.
<p>
 So far their infiltration had gone unnoticed. It was not yet night and
the full castle was not yet awake.  Once again the threesome faded into
the shadows and crept down the hall toward the bedroom of the Caitiff's
father. Strangely this room had no guardian. The Butler slept alone.
Wyrrm pulled out his dagger and crept forward, hovering over the bed,
poised to strike the heart of the vampire and make it quick. As he
struck, the Butler's eyes snapped open and stared into Wyrrm's.
Glancing at the blade now buried hilt deep in his chest, the Butler
laughed and grasped the Ranger's hand tightly.  As he quickly rose,
Wyrrm saw death within the eyes of the Butler. With his free hand the
Butler touched Wyrrm's chest and magic poured forth.  The force blew the
ranger across the room, slamming him into the dresser.  It shattered
beneath his weight and Wyrrm slumped to the floor. Pulling the dagger
from his chest as if an annoying toy, he advanced on the warrior and the
chanting wizard.  He threw the dagger at Salad clumsily, embedding it in
the wizard's leg.  The Butler then backhanded Gergely with his fist and
knocked him back as well.  Gergely stumbled and reeled with the blow,
but it would take more than that to stop the halfling warrior.  He
lunged to face the undead man and placed himself between the wizard and
the butler.  
<p>
Salad had been caught off guard with the knife piercing his
leg, but he regained his concentration and continued his incantation.
As the little warrior moved between the wizard and his target, Salad let
fly with yet another magical Ice comet.  The force blew the Butler
across the room, landing him next to the unconscious Ranger.  The
warrior launched himself at the fallen butler as Salad prepared another
magical assault.  
<p>
Gergely was too slow, however and the Butler rolled
out of the way.  He stood and kicked the small warrior in the gut,
doubling Gergely over in pain.  He lashed out again and caught the
halfling on the chin with his boot.  A murderous rage filled his eyes
and he became intent on the short warrior.   He would kill him and be
done with these intruders.  Just as he was to land the last murderous
blow, Salad completed another spell and once again knocked the Butler
against the far wall.  The Butler had forgotten the wizard in his lust
for halfling blood and it was his undoing.
<p>
 Extracting the dagger from his leg, Salad laboriously removed the fangs
from the inert Butler.  Gergely bandaged Wyrrm's wounds quickly and drug
him near the wizard.  Gergely and Salad propped each other up as Salad
chanted the words that would return them to the forest of the Faydark.
There would be no need to sneak out of the castle. Getting in was hard.
Getting out was a matter of words.
<p>

 Once back in the safety of civilized lands the threesome planned their
next outing.  They needed to prove to the Caitiff that the deed was
done.  It would result in a blade each for the warrior and ranger.  It
was something they could not have done without the help of Saladarsif.
They would rest and recover, then they would report to the Caitiff.
Salad left the two recovering in an Inn in Kelthin and made his way back
to his workshop.  He was needed elsewhere soon, and he must rejuvenate
while he had time.
<p>
/ooc Saladarsif is currently a member of Order of Light and has helped
that guild and its members immensely over the past eight or nine
months.  He is generous and helpful with others as well.  He's a good
friend. I'd consider him an unsung hero :)
