<b><font color="E5B275">Who is Raene?</b></font><p>
Raene is a 54th Wanderer on the Rathe Server in the game called EverQuest. She has found her home with the <a href="http://www.mfh.net" target="new window">Emef'Aitch</a> family (MFH aka Muppets from Hell).  Her hobby is making "portraits" of people's characters. The person behind Raene is a thirty-something wife with no kids. She has a Bachelor's Degree in Art with emphasis on photography and image manipulation and  Master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction.  She teaches 5th grade.

<b><font color="E5B275">How does she do those pics??</b></font><p>
This is probably one of the most frequently asked questions in my email box. Simply put, I use anything and everything I can to make the pics look the way I want. I would scan in macaroni if I thought it would make the texture I need. Art is like cooking...while there is a method (mix this, heat that, pour here) it's as instinctual as knowing what spices will create the desired taste combination...there is no set recipe.  Art is cooking from the heart. Composition and techniques and effects combined with colors, will bubble and steam in a skillet of visual taste and texture.<p>

I work hard at what I do, and others on the Rathe do as well. Aegirson is an extremely talented animated gif artist in <a href="http://www.djburt.com/eq/" target="new window">Clan Icewind</a>.  Thornwalker in <a href="http://www.requiemofsouls.com/" target="new window">Requiem of Souls</a> makes wonderful websites and logos. Daney Fairheart in RoS and  <a href="http://www.netfyre.com/cof/portraits.htm" target="new window">Joan</a> (Anastasya Griffontamer) of Council of Friends are excellent.  Every artist that I see getting into this has their own style, their own flair. There is no "Best" in art when it comes down to what people like. It's all subjective.

<b><font color="E5B275">C'mon...at least tell me what paint program you use</b></font><p>
Come to <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/bnorrathsstudio" target="new window">Norrath's Studio</a> and introduce yourself, your art, and ask for comments and critiques of your work :)
