<blockquote><p>
Who was the last person that really ticked you off? What did they do and say? You remember...I bet you do.<p>

Now who was the last person to give you a rez? To transport you halfway across Norrath for free? To help you get your corpse when you thought all was lost? To lend an encouraging word or item or buff to you?<p>

A lot of times it is easier to remember those that makes us mad or belittle us than to remember the ones that do good. Often we take for granted too much the kindness of others. We think "He's a cleric...Rezing people is what he's supposed to do" or "She's a wizard, of course she'll drop everything and teleport me" or "He's a necromancer...let's see that new corpse recovery spell".
<p>
In this new year, and indeed new millenium, I would ask you to remember the people that have done good by you. Show your appreciation for them, whether in words, plat, food, or spell components. Tell their guildmaster about the noble deeds and giving spirit or post your thanks on their guild board.<p>

<a href="mailto:boon@pcsonline.com">Brennos Oakkeep</a> has 2 lists of people on Rathe, a beware and a favored. He gets the most letters for the beware list of people that have done wrong. 
<a href="http://www.pcsonline.com/users/boon/druid.html" target="new window">www.pcsonline.com/users/boon/druid.html</a><p>

If you feel so inclined, write him and tell him of the people that have you have received kindness from, nominate them for the favored list. Good deeds beget good feelings, which in turn can produce more good deeds.<p>

*grin*  Ok enough tree-hugging hippiness for one day.<p>

From Aymen Tadat:<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">

The December raffle was a fantastic success!  The grand prize of 684 PP was won by a cleric, Bradon.  He was /roleplaying, so I couldn't tell his level, only that he conned green to me at 35.  In any case, a complete listing of winners appears on our website at <a href="http://www.eq-event.com/bro" target="new window">www.eq-event.com/bro</a>, along with their winning numbers.  This event will become a regular event on the server, and it will be administrated by Fenaniel Rhal.  
<p>
The list of winners notwithstanding, we can't guarantee that the Blood Ruby Order will always be able to supply such a wide array of prizes for players.  In fact, I can guarantee it because I have changed servers and will not be seen very much on The Rathe any more, and most of my guildmates have moved with me (look me up on Lanys T'Vil - same name).  Therefore, the long term success of this raffle will depend on the generosity of all the other guilds and players on the server for donations of items to give away as secondary prizes to those who don't win the grand prize.
<p>
Please contact Fenaniel in game, or leave a message on the guild message board at www.eq-event.com/bro.  Please use the raffle message thread.

From Priest Liam Toh:<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">
<p>
Friends from all around Norrath gathered Saturday evening to honor the 
memory of Kathia du Lac, who was killed by Zatozia the Torturess at 
Innoruuk's biding in the recent war.
<p>
The memorial service was touching, as everyone gathered around the altar at 
the entrance to the Temple of Marr where our sister's body rested, each 
holding a torch and speaking with their hearts about their memories of the 
departed.
<p>
After most had left, many of Kathia's closest friends, and Kathia's mother 
Mélisandre and sister Gwenyvere gathered at Jade's Inn. There, a foul 
apparition came to disturb the mourning crowd. Zatozia the Torturess dared 
appear to taunt everyone, and to threaten to rip everyone's soul away to 
have them suffer the same terrible fate. She invoked the dark Shadows of 
Innoruuk upon the Temple of Marr, and then thunder was heard raging across 
the skies. Our prayers to the gods of Light were answered though, and the 
Temple of Marr withstood the attack. Out of frustration, and to show her 
powers, Zatozia summoned the soul of Kathia from the Plane of Hate and 
tortured her for everyone to see, then sent her back to Innoruuk's realm. 
She then cursed the du Lac family, saying she would personally exterminate 
them all and after that, every last follower of light. Zatozia then floated 
high above in the air, over the Temple of Marr, as a final sign of defiance 
before returning to the Plane of Hate.

From Priest Liam Toh:<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">
As most of you are already aware, the great war that was fought in the last 
weeks ended with the defeat of the Army of the Dark when Innoruuk returned 
to his Plane.
<p>
But Innoruuk's defeat came with a bitter price - before leaving, he ordered 
his High Priestress Zatozia the Torturess to tear apart the soul of Dame 
Kathia du Lac, paladin of Mithaniel Marr, and to send the pieces into 
oblivion.
<p>
At the suggestion of Sir Quinne Polaris and his Order, a memorial service 
shall be held in honor of our sister Kathia, today, Saturday the 18th of 
december, at 11 pm est (8 pm pst), outside the Temple of Marr in North 
Freeport.

May the Truth of the Lightbearer touch all your souls.

From Brennos Oakkeep:<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">
What: Guild Fair for all Norrath Residents and Rathe Guilds<br>
When: Sunday, December 19th at 9:00 PM EST<br>
Where: East Commons in the Tunnel to Ro near Shady Swashbuckler<br>
<p>
Have you always wondered about all those guilds out there? Ever wondered how
difficult it would be to become a member but were afraid to ask? Now is your
chance.
<p>
There are many great guilds out there and many players that are unaware how
to call on these guilds for either help or membership. The Druid Council is
sponsoring a Guild Fair where all guilds can come together and either
recruit new members or just make themselves known. We are asking for all
Rathe Guilds to attend and during the fair will be asked to announce their
charter, membership requirements, web address and perhaps share some of
their activities. If a guild would like to sponsor a newbie event or a
contest of sorts, this would be very welcome. Our first Guild Fair was in
Qeynos Hills and was a great success. This one will be in the Tunnel to Ro
so that the dark races can attend without concern. Our follow up fairs over
the next month will be in Misty Thicket and Greater Fey.

</center><FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial color="fffff3"><b>Insider Info on Upcoming Patch (from net)</b></font><br><font size=-1>posted 12/16/99</font size><FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial><br>
As Seen on the KEG Message Board, Posted by Lewick 12/9/99<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">

Picked this up from the wire... 
<p>
As you know, there is a scheduled change to Paw coming in which a new patch will be installed
for Everquest. I have obtained insider information on the new proposed game changes: 
<p>
WEATHER 

Weather-related haze and reduction of visibility has been increased. A new gnome tinkering
item has been introduced: fog lights, which will increase visibility by 5% except when being
chased by anything undead, in which case, visibility will be reduced by 5%. 
<p>
Dropped items now have a 25% chance of being swept away during rain storms, excluding rusty
 weapons and foraged grubs, which will now litter the landscape for an extra 20 minutes when
 dropped. 
<p>
 A new NPC "Noah" will wander around Norrath, most often in South Karana, looking to round up
two of each creature. 
<p>
PETS 
<p>
 Necro pets have been modified. They will still do the same amount of damage in melee, but will
                            now give "the finger" to any monk passing by. This behavior can be toggled via the "/pet
                            humble" or "/pet arrogant" commands. 
<p>
                            Pets no longer disappear when zoning, however they pretend they don't know you and
                            immediately befriend the nearest NPC with an abundance of non-summoned food. 
<p>
                            New pet commands: /pet sit, /pet SIT (all caps), /pet goddamit SIT!! 
<p>
                            NPC BEHAVIOR / AI 
<p>
                            If you accidently give the wrong combination of items to an NPC or the right items to the wrong
                            NPC, the NPC will laugh hideously at you and immediately run to the nearest merchant to sell
                            these items, at which point there will be no way to re-acquire the misgiven items. 
<p>
                            Pathfinding has been improved in zones such as Mistmoore, Everfrost and Permafrost. Mobs no
                            longer "appear then disappear, then appear" right in front of you. Now they simply appear in
                            front of you without any prior visible evidence of their existence. 
<p>
                            Mobs will no longer be able to hit/target thru walls & doors - instead in select zones, walls and
                            doors will be considered autonomous NPCs which can deal damage similar to other monsters in
                            the area. 
<p>

                            DYING 
<p>
                            When dying, you will no longer lose experience. Instead, you will have a random number of
                            personal effects disappear (both from your person and the bank). 
<p>
                            The cleric revive spell will teleport you to your body as well as a nearby property insurance
                            agent (GM) who will then tell you you're out of luck if you think you can get any lost items
                            back. The cleric ressurrect spell does the same thing but gives you a few animated items which
                            disappear when you log. 
<p>

                            SPELLS 
<p>
                            New Druid Spells: Ring of Desktop (29th), Circle of Desktop (34th) - Immediately teleports you
                            to the Windows 98 desktop, thereby aborting Everquest; in-game action similar to going
                            link-dead. Circle of Desktop has the same results but affects the entire party. Succor: Desktop
                            was decidedly left out as it took three times more time than required to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL
                            which caused the same effect. 
<p>
                            New Shaman Spells: Spirit of GM (Allows you to run faster than SoW in opposite direction when
                            asked for assistance) 
<p>
                            New Enchanter Spells: Clarify (automatically makes excuses to other mage classes as to why
                            you can't cast Clarity on them) 
<p>
                            SKILLS 
<p>
                            A new skill has been introduced: "slacking" - Humans, Ogres and Trolls begin with a bonus to
                            this skill of 35. It is available to all races. 
                            "Slackers" - experts in this field will be able to manufacture new game items: television,
                            la-z-boy recliner, cheetos, remote control - all of which improve hp regeneration while adding
                            to encumberance. 
<p>
                            Another new skill: "pimping" is available to all classes except Shamen, Enchanters & Druids.
                            Experts in this skill will be able to force others around them to cast Sprit of the Wolf on them at
                            will. Masters of this skill may force druids to teleport them far out of their way while thinking
                            you're doing them a favor. 
<p>
                            Another new skill: "whining" available to all classes but melee classes start with 50 skill points,
                            monks start with 60. Masters of this skill have the ability to root GMs for extended periods of
                            time. 
<p>
                            EMOTES 
<p>
                            The following new emotes are available with accompanying animation and special effects: 
<p>
                            /macarena immediately start dancing <br>
                            /hurl expunges pieces of food in immediate vicinity (sometimes the former may case others
                            around to perform the latter) <br>
                            /rap you begin bragging of your wealth <br>
                            /gangsta rap same as above but you also swing your weapon <br>
<p>

                            NEW COMMANDS 
<p>
                            /youdied? feins linkdead status when a party member dies and you're a healer <br>
                            /oom covertly casts heal and SoW on yourself, and points you in the direction of the nearest
                            zone, while telling party you are OOM <br>
                            /commend file a compliment/commendation on a local GM (untested) <br>

                            /guild emancipate Removes guild status from <br>
                            (without his knowledge) until he reaches a high-enough level where he posesses good spells
                            and items <br>

                            /pimpfilter ignores any say/guild/shout/ooc comments which contain the words "tp" or "sow" <p>


                            NEW QUEST ITEMS

<p>

                            MOBS / MONSTERS 
<p>
                            New class of monsters can be found at Castle Mistmoore and Unrest - it seems they
                            mysteriously appeared in the wake of large numbers of deaths due to trains. This class of mob
                            is called "Lawyer". Here is a breakdown of the sub-classes:

From Turindal Erland:<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">
   Hi. This is Turindal. <p>
Some of you may know me. Well I wanted to respond to Daia's
   commentary on the imbalance of EQ. And I mean this with the utmost respect.
   I understand your beef's about what has happened to certain spawns and the economy
   in EQ. The spawn for ruby stopped on my turn after 10 hours of camping it. So I know 
   the frustrations it has made (at least for alittle while). But hey life goes on. I don't need
   the item to enjoy the game. But I would certainly never cry out to Verant to take it from
   those who have worked hard and earned it. No matter how much it sucked for me.
   I mean ask yourself. Isn't wanting some one elses item taken away because you can't 
   get it, either not easily or at all, a bit on the greedy and self-centered side? I camped my
   guise before the patch, and I wouldn't appreciate it much if all my effort went to waste
   like camping 10 hours for a spawn to stop.
  <p>
   If you can count on one thing is this. That there will always be imbalance in a game like 
   this. And in some ways, I feel that is Verants vision to some extent. But hey there is 
   imbalance in real life too. There's always somebody more clever or stronger or wealthier
   or physically more attractive. So why should it be diffrent in a role playing game where
   everyone is different from the other. 
  <p>
   I know it's hard when you think in a have and have-not kind of mentality, and that it's hard 
   to come by money and items in this game ( I didn't start seeing much "reward" until I 
   started reaching higher levels ). Think of this though. There is great value in gaining friends
   and building relationships with others. Would you not agree, that everyone is truely rich
   who have many friends? 
  <p>
   Well I might be saying too much here. What I'm trying to get at is maybe if you look to 
   having fun with others and just enjoying the roleplay, instead of wanting that item or 
   wanting to be equal to that person, that you'll get the true "reward" out of this game.
   I truely hope you get what you are looking for though, and wish you luck =)
  <p>
  
  Be well and may the light <br>
  of Mithaniel shine upon you<br>

Just would like to reword something since I'm not sure I was quoted
accurately. To say that it was poorly planned on the "part of the
organizers" wasn't what I meant. It was more like it was just a tad
unorganized due to event coordinators being on at different times etc.,
making it harder to have everyone on the same page.
<p>
There was alot of unbridled enthusiasm..and you have to remember that this
was the first time that this was ever attemtped on this server.
<p>
Kudos to Quinne, Kathia , Katinka and Damali for their time, effort and
creativity they gave to make this work....I was merely a player in the plan.
<p>
I cannot speak for Kathia or Quinne, Damali or Katinka, but as for myself, I
can say that this is something that will be addressed in the coming year.
This was a great tool to learn from, and I think that those who took part
had a great time!

From Contributing Reporter Eclet:<blockquote><p>

This is just a little diddy I wrote after listening to
Chris Rock's No Sex while waiting 40 minutes for the
Orge SK to spawn in the befallen, only to be killed by
various undead critters.<p>
-------------
<p>
Ladies and Gentlemen of the Norrathian Class of 1999,<br>
I have one piece of advice for you. <br>
No matter what a cleric tells you, <br>
there is no good loot in the befallen.  <br>
Oh, there's death in the befallen, <br>
but you don't want death, you want loot. <br>
And there's no good loot in the befallen.<br>
<p>
Don't go to GM events that are highly publicized. <br>
Sure, they may be fun and all that, <br>
but think back to all the other big GM events. <br>
You're gonna lag and the zones gonna crash.<br>
<p>
If a wood elf female tells you she's a female, <br>
and talks like a male.  She's a pubescent teenage boy.<br>
If a wood elf female tells you she's a female,<br>
and talks like a female;  she's a pubescent teenage boy...<br>
that spends entirely too much time in third person view.
<p>
Young Gnomish Men, if you're truckin' through Oasis<br>
and a sand giant steps on your head...let it slide. <br>
Sure, they may wear funny hats,<br>
but they only have a (1) in sense of humor.
<p>
SOULFIRE.  Ain't nothing wrong with that!
<p>
No matter what you think of what I'm sayin', <br>
remember this one thing-<br>
There is no good loot in befallen.
<p>
(background)No loot in the befallen. <br>
No loot in the befallen.  No loot in the befallen.<br>
There's absolutely, positively, no loot in the befallen.
<p>
If a newbie begs for an item that he shouldn't know about,<br>
he has a level 50 magician. <br>
A real newbie is to dumb to know what a Paw of Opalla is.
<p>
If a necro has a Dragoon dirk, he'll probably stab you with it.<br>
If a rogue has a Dragoon dirk, he'll act nice,<br>
then backstab you with it.
<p>
Here's a horoscope for everyone: <br>
Clerics!  Ya gonna die.<br>
Necros!  Your pets gonna die, then you're gonna follow. <br>
Warriors!  Ya gonna go linkdead. <br>
Bards!  Ya gonna run the hell away.<br>
Druids!  Ya gonna die kiting.
<p>
Some of the things I've said may not apply to you (ahem-Asheron's Call),<br>
some may offend you,<br>
but no matter who you are,<br>
you must remember this one thing: <br>
There is no good loot in the befallen.

Found the following on EQVault, and didn't know till the end who had written it. Had to go back and reread it again. She voices the same feelings I've had over and over regarding economy and spawn and camping issues. And to those of you that think I can get anything I want in game, you're fooling yourselves. Yes at higher levels plat is meaningless when people only trade for items. When you have a 1 in 6 chance on a random roll for an item you've camped for hours.  I'm not a merchant and never have been. Previously I'd rather give items and plat to friends and guildmates that can use it on their characters than trade it away  for something I can use. I hate asking for things for myself, because somehow  (insert Dr. Evil finger-quotation marks here) that's "bad", it's being "greedy". I used to think that in time it would all come back to me. I gave and gave and gave. What goes around is supposed to come around. I was patient.  So I thought "someday" I'll have a manastone, or "someday" I'll be able to camp for a guise of the deceiver. Now Verant stops items from dropping or changes it in a way to ensure it will be useless to my character. Economic values on items skyrocket since there will never be any more. So what is next? Do I give up what I believe in and just start looking out for A#1? Is that what this game will boil down to in the end?<p>

On the Removal of Items <br>
The subject of item removal came up recently on the official EQ forums. Gordon Wrinn, aka Abashi,
responded to one of these posts. Here's the original post (be warned, it is lengthy), followed by
Abashi's response: 
<p>
          <blockquote>                 Dear Abashi (or JSmedley, Aradune, whichever will read this at some point :) 

                           I am writing having read through all the rants, and raves and redundant arguments about a
                           number of things. Most of it, frankly, is written in such a manner that if I were you I'd
                           disregard it, too. Frankly, the level of disrespect at times is overwhelming and disappointing. 
<p>
                           But at least a couple of points are valid, however stridently made. And I am writing now to
                           reiterate the one that I personally feel has the most negative impact on the *long term future*
                           of the game, in the hope that you will step back from the rantings and ravings and think
                           seriously about this issue. Some will no doubt argue this is beating a dead horse, and it may
                           well be to the extent that it addresses something already addressed by others. But you have
                           not responded to it yet, and I am hoping that a thoughtful response will be forthcoming, so
                           that those of us who are adults with real lives and real commitments who are nonetheless
                           enthralled by your product can understand. 
<p>
                           The question I put to you, which others have also, is this: 
<p>
                           What is the theory justifying removal of items from the game in the name of "game
                           imbalance" but allowing those items to remain in the game for those who have already
                           obtained the item? And what do you anticipate to be the long-term impact on the game
                           because of those changes? This is, of course, a question that many people have ranted and
                           raved about several times on this board. But I am not going to rant. I just would like to know
                           the answer, please, if there is one. The reason this matters to me is this. Currently, my
                           highest and most beloved character is a level 30 cleric. Not an accomplishment to sneeze at,
                           to be sure. I have two other characters that I play for variety's sake, a level 11 enchantress
                           and a level 9 shaman. But my cleric has been, for the most part, my genuine EQ alter-ego. 
<p>
                           She has not powerleveled, choosing instead to play conservatively. This means fighting blues
                           where others want reds. She has not camped particularly wealthy mobs for hours, never
                           allowing other players a chance at the spawn. I spend my time making friends. Healing and
                           buffing players in need. Binding the unbinded on demand, asking for nothing in return.
                           Handing out food and drink to the hungry and thirsty, without ever asking for more than the
                           smile of a player. I try to play in role, much of the time, as this is a RPG and I do believe that
                           roleplaying enhances the game for me. 
<p>
                           And I have died. A lot, as have others. Over and over. Most rant and rave. Historically, I have
                           just smiled, even now when I am currently in what is affectionately known as "Hell Level 1". In
                           the past, I smiled because I figured this is Norrathian life, and in the end the rewards
                           outweigh the penalties. 
<p>
                           But, as my writing of my Journeyman Boot saga showed others, the rewards for those of us
                           who play in a manner consistent with a "vision" for Everquest, as opposed to in a manner
                           consistent with Quake, are few. And they are certainly not the material rewards earned by
                           those who forego roleplay and being good EQ citizens in favor of behaviors ranging from kiting
                           reds for powerleveling purposes to kill-stealing to item farming. 
<p>
                           This was a difficult thing to swallow when I was a lower level player, as I tend to be a happy,
                           friendly, "can't we just all get along sort". Yet I swallowed it. Because I could always remind
                           myself that in time, I too would have the rewards when they were due me, if I just worked
                           hard. So I didn't get rubicite at level 20. I didn't even have bronze at 20. But I figured I'd have
                           the "piece de resistance" someday, maybe at level 25-35 when the natural course of my
                           avatar's life lead me to Cazic Thule, maybe later. But at least I'd have it. The same was true
                           of the manastone, and the Box of Abu-Kar, which I have longed for ever since my relatively
                           weak Erudite cleric realized that wearing a full set of bronze armor would make her sluggish
                           and unable to best aid her party. I never fretted about *when* I would have those items
                           relative to others, because I knew I would have them, someday. And that was reward in itself
                           for all the other things that made Everquest joyous for me. 
<p>
                           Of course, as we all know, that is no longer the case. The theory was that these types of
                           items were overpowered or unbalancing. The spawning of these items ceased, sometimes
                           with notice, sometimes without. Now, I certainly would never question your determination that
                           this was needed. I am a veteran of another online game and understand conceptually how
                           this could be, however much I was personally crushed by the loss of the spawn. 
<p>
                           But I am at a loss to understand how, if those things are true, allowing what already exists to
                           remain in game does not unbalance the game. I would take the position, based on what I
                           have seen in Saturday auctions in the Commonlands and on various message boards, that
                           all that has happened is that the previous, profound unbalance in rewards that already
                           existed between greedy merchants/powerlevelers/killstealers/item farmers/campers and
                           normal players such as myself. 
<p>
                           I realize that the goal was to shift these items into those more practical and appropriate for
                           Verant's vision of the game. And I respect vision, above all things. But I respectfully submit
                           that the continuing removal of spawns for items without removing the existing items only
                           further serves to divide the Everquest population into the haves and the have nots. And I
                           would submit to you that this type of player division and resentment, for whatever reason, is
                           unhealthy for the game *in the long term*. 
<p>
                           Simply put, those who do not already have "valuable things" have very little, if any hope of
                           acquiring them without immersing ourselves 24 hours a day into the game to the detriment of
                           home, family and employment. Yet we obviously cannot do that. We have jobs, real lives,
                           children, responsibilities and a sense of morality that neither allow us to be in the game 24-7
                           nor allow us to rip off players or violate the rights of others when we are in the game as
                           justification for our personal desires for items or levels. 
<p>
                           Others have eloquently described how this is so, so I will not repeat their myriad stories. This
                           is because money is king, in Everquest, (assuming of course that you can even acquire
                           things for money, since as many have described high levels who operate under an "I got mine
                           get yours" mentality determine whether or not an item will be sold and usually elect for
                           trades, instead). Yet money is very difficult to acquire in the sums demanded by both the
                           game design and the player market, unless you are going to engage in the same types of
                           unhealthy, spawn-hogging play that others have described. 
<p>
                           For example, the replacement for the Box of Abu-Kar, my personal beloved item, is several
                           *thousand* platinum. Now, with all due respect, I do not have and cannot ever fathom having
                           that much money. I'm a cleric. We are always broke, particularly if we are doing our job and
                           casting Symbol on our parties as we are supposed to. I have about 400 platinum in the bank,
                           a sum that I would be proud of if I could actually buy something level-appropriate for my
                           character from the NPCs or other players with it. As it is, I have a choice between trying to
                           spend most of it on Journeyman Boots (342 platinum I believe) or a piece of cleric armor (not
                           an option for me, with the hundreds of hours needed to camp various rare spawns and pieces
                           and then having to spend a couple hundred platinum to acquire enchanted platinum bars per
                           quest item) or foregoing my spells and helping others financially all in the hopes of someday,
                           maybe being fortunate enough to save enough for Verant's replacement for the Box. 
<p>
                           The cleric quests (and others like it) are another example. They cost thousands of platinum,
                           if one is to attempt to do the entire thing or if one cannot for reasons of time buy various
                           pieces. I know that the economy was broken to the extent that high level players considered
                           platinum valueless. But the scale has tipped too far the other way, and it is depressing and
                           discouraging to those of us who want to "stop and smell the roses" of Everquest. I am not
                           advocating that you penalize those who by good fortune, obsession, hook or crook managed
                           to acquire their own personal rewards. Rather, I am hoping that someone will look at this
                           situation with a long-term view before making further, similar changes to the game. 
<p>
                           As folks can confirm, I do not write on the boards often. Rarely, in fact. I wrote about my
                           Journeyman Boot experience. I wrote about the infamous Magman saga. I wrote about my
                           dismay at the Cleric Armor camping situation and how it essentially means I will never be
                           able to acquire that particular reward. But that's been pretty much been it since April. I am
                           hoping that the fact that I do not just pipe up every time something changes gives me just a
                           little credibility that you might, for their inability to cogently yet calmly make arguments, find
                           lacking in others when they continuously complain about everything you do. 
<p>
                           I will conclude by saying that it is a short-sighted mistake to make game changes based
                           primarily upon what you see with the highest level players who race through the game
                           hell-bent without considering your vision and acquired/did things you did not fathom would
                           occur for a long time. Please do not continue to disregard those of us who did not do the
                           same, without asking yourself who we are. Frankly, I believe from my Everquest and Realm
                           experiences that we are the adults, the ones in our 30's and 40's and 50's, the ones with
                           responsibilities including paying the bills for Everquest subscriptions for our teenagers and
                           ourselves. We are less likely, or unlikely to be item farmers or kill stealers (although of
                           course there are always notable exceptions). We can never compete with the powergamers,
                           and I suspect most of us would not want to if we could honestly feel that we too were
                           rewarded for our more human, more humane, more communal ways of playing this game. 
<p>
                           Most of us will always be the tortoises to the level/acquire at any cost hares. But in our
                           relatively slowpoke way of enjoying the game, we also tend to be older, wiser, and much
                           more likely to stay loyal when the "novelty" has worn off than than our younger, more
                           self-focused "level/acquire as quick as possible because then I'll *win*" players. It is those of
                           us who do not play for those reasons, I think, who in the end will keep the product alive for
                           years instead of months. I think looking at the Everquest defections over the last few months
                           on these boards, and reading these people's historical writings before their departure often
                           supports that viewpoint. Given this, It is my hope that you will consider the needs for reward
                           and motivation of people like myself more overtly in determining how best to handle the
                           problems you see in the game in the future. 
<p>

The response:<p><blockquote>
                           We learned that except in the cases of extreme imbalance, we shouldnt take away
                           items people have already earned. You mentioned below how you were looking
                           forward to getting some items, and are now upset that you no longer have the chance
                           to obtain them. I understand that, but imagine if you one day logged in and found an
                           item that you worked for gone or no longer usable. 
<p>
                           Its really a question of the scope of the imbalance. We tried twice before to
                           remove/modify items that people already had in game, and realized shortly afterwards
                           that that was a mistake. In short, these items are imbalancing enough that they had to
                           be removed. They were not imbalancing enough to justify removing them from
                           thousands of people who had already earned them.

From Contributing Reporter Eclet:<blockquote><p>

Army of Light vs. Army of Dark:  Did it work?
If you've spent any time wondering around Western
Antonica on the Rathe over the last couple of weeks,
chances are, you heard of the "war".  The war between
the Armies of Light and Dark that is.  I spent some
some researching it and questioning some of the people
involved to see if it was a well done guild event, or
just plain chaos.<p>

I had first read about the war at EQ stratics, and to
be honest, I was a bit cynical at first.  My opinion
was that GM events were planned well, but the system
would never agree with them, and that Guild events
weren't as well planned and didn't effect many.  After
visiting Order of Polaris's web site and reading up on
it, my doubts were pressed aside....a little.  I liked
the whole idea but the only part that struck me weird
were the rules.  All normal events need rules, but
this is no normal event, this is a PvP war event. 
When's the last time you saw rules in a war?
<p>
I asked around East and West Commonlands, Kithicor,
Rivervale, North Ro, and Neriak for people's opinions
on the war.  Most people seemed to like it overall,
that it brought alot of guilds together into one
event.  The only glaring problem that stood out to me
after talking to a good amount of people was that some
of the higher ups might have been Role-playing a
little too much (if you know what I mean) and that the
subordinates weren't abiding by the rules.  Also there
was too much downtime because of complaining.
<p>
I went straight to Karas on the Army of Light for his
opinions on the war.  Overall, he said he enjoyed it
and it was fun to see so many guild together in one
event.  He thought that the biggest problem was the
lack of planning on the part of the organizers and
that there was some internal problems with both
guilds.  He said these would be remedied before the
next one.  So I asked him about the next upcoming
event.  He said he didn't know much, but Kathia will
be posting about it on the Order of Polaris's guild
site at http://orderofpolaris.webprovider.com/ .  I
also asked him about the rules, and if he thought that
rules would be hard to enforce during a war.  He
agreed, and just mentioned that these will be remedied
before the next one.
<p>
So, I guess we'll have to wait until OoP's next event.
 We'll keep you posted here.<p>

From Brennos Oakkeep<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">
Hail All, a quick reminder and an update: 
<p>
What: Guild Fair for all Norrath Residents and Rathe Guilds - Sponsered by the Druid Council <br>
When: Sunday, December 12th at 9:00 PM EST (8pm CST, 7pm MST, 6pm PST) (we will do the next on in the AM) <br>
Where: East Commons at the Tunnel, near Shady Swashbuckler. We may move to the newbie area in West Freeport if the chatter is too loud. 
<p>
Have you always wondered about all those guilds out there? Ever wondered how difficult it would be to become a member but were afraid to ask? Now is your chance. Maybe you just want to get to know more of your neighbors? Now is your chance! <p>

There are many great guilds out there and many players that are unaware how to call on these guilds for either help or membership. The Druid Council is sponsoring a Guild Fair where all guilds can come together and either recruit new members or just make themselves known. We are asking for all Rathe Guilds to attend and during the fair will be asked to announce their charter, membership requirements, web address and perhaps share some of their activities. If a guild would like to sponsor a newbie event or a contest of sorts, this would be very welcome. Our follow up fairs over the next month will be in Misty Thicket and Greater Fay. 
<p>
Guild Representatives should be ready to provide these things, please either have them macro'd or be ready to type it quickly: <p>
Your guild's charter, <br>
Whether or not you are actively recruiting, <br>
How you recruit (quests and such), <br>
Any Guild web links, <br>
And any newbie events you might wish to hold for publicity and PR. <br>

<blockquote><p>
My friend likes to read his two young sons fairy tales at night.
Having a deep-rooted sense of humor, he often ad-libs parts of the stories
for fun.
<p>
One day his youngest son was sitting in his first grade class as the
teacher was reading the story of the Three Little Pigs.
<p>
She came to the part of the story where the first pig was trying to
acquire building materials for his home. She said "...And so the pig
went up to the man with a wheelbarrow full of straw and said "Pardon me
sir, but might I have some of that straw to build my house with?"
<p>
Then the teacher asked the class "And what do you think that man
said?" and my friend's son raised his hand and said "I know! I know! He
said 'Holy Shit!! A talking pig!'"
<p>
The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes.

From Brennos Oakkeep:<blockquote><p><font color="#C0FFC0">


Our first Guild Fair in Qeynos Hills went well. We had representatives from
many guilds there. New members were recruited, newbie events were held and
much fun was had by all. There is always some delay in these things as the
speakers must take the time to convey their thoughts, but things got rolling
pretty well. Everyone presented their charter, recruitment policies and
presented their web address too if they had one. I will be adding links to
these from the Druid Council's Web Page this week.
<p>
To encouraging worldwide respect and civility the Druid Council asked that
all guilds assist by blacklisting those on the Druid Council's Beware list,
just as most responsible Druids already do. It is a shame to see people
behaving as jerks in Norrath and only through our combined pressures can we
hope to effect some change.
<p>
Our next Guild Fair will be at the Ro Tunnel in West Commons next Sunday at
9:00 PM EST, and we hope it is an even bigger success.

We would like to announce the creation of a new guild on the Rathe server.  <font color="ffffff">Equites Justitium</font> (Latin for Knights of Justice) is a guild for those who follow the path of good and enjoy helping others.   If you like healing or buffing other players, bailing them out of tight spots, being assistance to lower-level characters, and otherwise being helpful, and don't killsteal, call names, or otherwise antagonize other players, you are the type of person we're looking for.  At this point we're pretty informal and don't have sections or divisions.  Since we're a new guild, members who join early can help shape the personality of the guild, so now's your chance to be in on the ground floor!

(a huge pillar of water skyrockets hundreds of feet into the air from the 
depths of the seas.  Atop this great raging altar of water stands one lone, 
incredibly noble figure that speaks with a calming voice as vast as the 
oceans)
<p>
Followers of the light...I call you to arms.  The time has come to unify all 
of the factions of light into the greatest army ever known to man.
<p>
Our mission?  To rip the souls of our fallen brethren from the suffocating 
grasp of Innoruk and return them to the loving arms of the gods of the 
light.  In order to accomplish this task, we must first recover the "Book of 
Turmoil", which is heavily guarded and  carried by the Avatar of Hate 
herself, Kathia Angst'Shatten, The Fallen One.
<p>
I have faith in each and every one of you.  You are the strong, the 
chosen...we shall sing victory.  I have seen what the future holds, my 
children...and the future is a bright one.
<p>
Together we shall call upon the oceans to rise up and wash away the filth 
from the land of Norrath, leaving only the righteous to tread upon her 
fruitful planes.
<p>
Beware, pawns of deciet and hate...you will be brought to trial before the 
Avatars of the Light.  The innocent will be saved...the guilty will be 
severly punished.
<p>
ooc: I will also be in the East Commons this evening, along with my 
counterpart, Kathia, for questions you may have regarding this event, or to 
be added to the rosters/guilds of the army of your choice.  Thus far, the 
response for this event has been tremendous!  Get in on it while you still 
can, for one the war begins, we cannot add any new participants.

OOC :  This is part of a continuing storyline on our server. We invite all 
who would join the Army of Innoruuk or the Army of Light to contact its 
officers tonight. They are only temporary guilds, created for the purpose of  allowing PvP between the two Armies. As soon as the guilds are created, we  will begin to assign guildtags. You may contact any of the officers of the guilds, or Kathia for the Army of Innoruuk, and Damali for the Army of  Light. I cannot speak for the Army of Light, but I personally will be in the  Eastern Commonlands near Freeport to hand out the guildtags for the dark  side.
