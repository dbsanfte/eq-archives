<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">Everquest Hacking</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, August 31, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>Posted at <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134335724_hacker31m.html">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134335724_hacker31m.html</a>  Thanks to Adon for this!<br><i><br>Hacking of Web game EverQuest linked to local teen <br><br>By Mike Carter<br>Seattle Times staff reporter<br><br>Federal agents have seized 10 computers and other computer gear from the home of a Snoqualmie teen suspected of hacking into Sony's extremely popular online game "EverQuest." <br><br>The hacking would have given him access to personal information on hundreds of thousands of players and Sony employees. <br><br>Agents also say the hacker, who was 17 at the time, was able to access the home computer of the company's vice president of product development, Brad McQuaid, and downloaded documents for an as-yet-unreleased version of the popular role-playing fantasy game. <br><br>Sony, which declined comment on the investigation, says the game is played by as many as 400,000 people worldwide and reaps more than $50 million a year in revenue.<br><br>No arrests have been made, and no charges have been filed, said Deborah Hartman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego, where Sony Online is based. <br><br>A search warrant filed recently in U.S. District Court in Seattle shows that FBI computer-crime agents seized 10 computers and dozens of computer drives and disks from the home two weeks ago. Agents are also investigating a Mobile, Ala., man over the intrusions. <br><br>The warrant says the U.S. Attorney's Office suspects the men of crimes that could put them in federal prison for up to five years. <br><br>Last October, authorities say, the men broke into one of the 40 servers Sony Online uses to operate the game and gained access to a powerful "superuser" account. <br><br>Through that account, they gained access to the private accounts of Sony employees, a password-protected messaging board and "all other customer accounts."<br><br>"Access to these accounts gives the superuser an individual's name, date of birth, work and home telephone numbers, Internet protocol address and other information," including home addresses, according to an affidavit filed with the warrant.<br><br>Moreover, superuser status also "enables the user to have complete administrative controls over the game, including the suspension, banning and unbanning of accounts." <br><br>Sony Online officials told agents several accounts were tampered with during this time period, including one belonging to the Alabama suspect. <br><br>The hacking provided the intruder with information that allowed him to surreptitiously access the home computers of McQuaid — an icon among Internet gaming enthusiasts and the producer of "EverQuest," considered the most popular online role-playing game ever — and two Sony "game masters," responsible for the operation of "EverQuest," the affidavit says.<br><br>In McQuaid's computer, the hacker copied a voluminous file containing the blueprint for the release of the game's next version, "EverQuest2," scheduled for release next year. Other personal and proprietary information was also accessed. <br><br>For reasons unexplained, the hacker sent all of the proprietary files that were hacked to a Sony executive, "making it evident that (he) had illegally obtained the files." Until then, Sony Online Entertainment was unaware of the extent of the intrusion. <br><br>Sony Online had experienced a series of security problems they now attribute to the two suspects.<br><br>A private, password-protected "guide board," used by "EverQuest" operators to communicate with one another, was posted on HackerQuest, an Internet bulletin board frequented by game players. <br><br>Later, a Sony game master, Alan Crosby, was contacted anonymously through a private e-mail system by one of the hackers. <br><br>Sony Online officials were able to trace the contact to the teenager in Snoqualmie. <br><br>Mike Carter can be reached at 206-464-3706 or<br>mcarter@seattletimes.com. </i><br><br></p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">Stonebrunt</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Wednesday, August 29, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><center><img src="http://2amstudios.com/eq/eqi/catvillage.jpg"></center><br><br><i>As Posted by Cronar 8/10/01 on the Crossroads board</i>:<br><br>Hi everyone,<br>I wanted to pass a little info on the new zone, Stonebrunt, so that everyone will be ready for it when it goes live shortly.<br><br>To reach Stonebrunt, you must pass through paineel, then warrens to get there. The enterance is in the warrens zone behind and slightly to the right of the cavebatlord area.<br><br>If you are a good race, and low level, be extremely cautious of going here. There are live and undead baddies who can make life unfun here. Best bet is to get regular invis/sow and run like hell to get to warrens. The aggro radius on the "green" Paineel newbie field skellys is pretty low. If you aren't familiar with warrens, download a good <a href="http://eqmaps.com/m2/warrens3.gif" target="new window">map</a>, as the zone can be a little confusing.<br><br>Onto the good stuff.<br>-the zone has things that give exp anywhere from level 14-50 or so.<br>-the zone is about the size of lake of ill omen.<br>-faction boosts for killing kobalds, +heretics +erud guards -kobalds<br>-faction for killing Kejekans, -kejekan -erudite paladins(in otherwords, bad for any good race)<br><br>As an evil erudite sk, i was natural dubious to the Kejekans. While that is good as they wouldn't hunt me down, there isn't any natural way to raise this faction that i have found yet.<br><br>As a good race, you can raise faction in a few ways.<br>1.talk to one of the head kitties and he gives you a bag to get heretic heads. Combine four heads and turn in.<br>2.another kitty gives you a quest to collect many things both from mob and possible forage/ground spawn.<br>3.find one of the child kitty's dice from a named kobald.<br>4.find and kill the head stonebrunt kobald and turn in his head.<br><br>There is the potential for some serious smithing to be done in this zone. You need to collect one of each spiritling stone, as well as shadow stuff from frozen towers, and the smith kitty will help you unleash the power of the spiritling stones so that you can smith them into weapons and armor. Very unknown, hopefully not broken, and potentially very nice. The smithing vendor sells several types of weapon molds, mostly range slot items.<br><br>In Kejekan town, there is a forge, an oven and a pottery wheel all located near one another. This would be good if you have trashed your Thurgadin faction. As for fighting, the entire zone is outdoors, and is somewhat a kiters dream.<br><br>The initial area is donimated by kobalds and some leapords. Level for the beginning area is 14-25ish. Loot seems to be typical warrens junk, with the occasional bluewicker, which is a step up from green wicker, wearable by all leather capable classes. <br><br>A little furthur in, the difficulty of the mobs steps up considerably. I would say for the low lying mountain areas, 25-35 to be safe. In the highest elevations, the difficulty increases big time. I have talked to people who have barely escaped death at level 40 from some pandas, apes and tigers. <br><br>There seems to be about 5-6 named mobs in the zone, with the most difficult being Old Ghostback the ape, the named kobald amongst others. Old ghostback is barely soloable by a level 55, and is green at that level, so no loot will drop.<br><br>Oh btw, the loot is warrens coded, so if it is too green and has magic/lore drops, it won't drop for you.<br><br>Other potential loot for the zone that i have heard, is a set of decent monk armor, a wicked dagger from the named huuuuge snake, and other items.<br><br>Overall stonebrunt is a pretty well thought out zone. In a single zone you experiance just about every possible terrain and climate. Aggro is different, as an indif con ape will assist against you if you fight an animal of any type. Kejekan will aggro on any kobald (which can be a good camp clear method if you are solo).<br><br>There is the potential for two or more zones off stonebrunt. One is the Barren coast, another is Vasty deep, and a potential unnamed dungeon below the kejekan town in the mine. <br>                         <br>One other thing of note, the pathing is still majorly fooked up. The mobs tend to form conga lines and path straight into the vasty deep.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">Wedding in Sky</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Saturday, August 25, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i>From Belin</i><br><br>Greetings friends on Zebuxurok!<br><br>We are happy to announce the joining of Belin The Reaver and Kharpern Valkyria in marriage on Sunday, September the Second.<br><br>The wedding ceremony will be held in the Plane of Sky starting at three P.M. Eastern Standard Time. Ports will be going up to Sky from the West Commons wizard portal starting at one P.M. Eastern Standard Time and continuing on until just a few minutes before three P.M. Once the ceremony begins, no more ports will be provided.<br><br>All friends of the bride or groom are welcome to attend. Due to the nature of the Plane, only those level fourty-six and above will be able to make the journey.<br><br>Following the ceremony, twenty four of our friends will continue the celebration by clearing each island one at a time until either time or obstacle prevents us from continuing.<br><br>Thirteen of the twenty four we are opening up for any of our friends to attend, no matter the guild affiliation or unguilded. We will determine who goes by random roll before the wedding ceremony begins. The pre-requisites are that you must be available the entire day, so we can raid until we all decide to call things to a halt, and you must also bring with you enough Disease resist gear to raise your resist to 60 DR unbuffed. The following class spots are available:<br><br>2 Any class, any level<br>1 Melee class (Monk, SK, Pally, Ranger, Warrior, Rogue)<br>1 Bard<br>3 Clerics<br>1 Mage (Malosini capable - Level 58+)<br>1 Enchanter<br>1 Necromancer (New Summon Corpse capable, Level 57+ or Robe effect)<br>1 Ranger<br>1 Paladin<br>1 Shaman<br><br>These same twenty-four people will continue from island to island until we all die a horrible, unrecoverable death.  In the case of total and complete wipeout, we ask everyone to bring 100 platinum pieces to pay for your portion of the stone to port back up and the coffin to summon your new, mangled corpse.<br><br>We're both looking forward to seeing all of you there.<br><br>-Belin Fyr`Sjel<br>-Kharpern Valkyria</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">Group Maker Utility</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Thursday, August 16, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i> From Annwyl</i><br><br>Hey all!<br><br>Some friends of mine, you may know them as the original Calis/Dolgan from KEG, Ankhorahil from Champions of Norrath on The Rathe, Camyen, and Garm have been working on a Group Maker utility for Everquest. The utility is designed to be way more useful and functional than anything else out there right now.<br><br>This is what the website says about it...<br><br>Well, the main thing that people will find useful about this program is the "Auto Group" feature. Basically, this will allow you to choose a template for a raid i.e. a Hate Raid Template. Then all the people you have set up to go on the raid will be filled into the groups automatically based on group parameters. The groups will be as "balanced" as possible. We will include templates for a few things to get everyone started. Eventually, though, we hope that you guys will start experimenting with your own templates and share them with others. <br><br>Other features will include the ability to see who on your raid is linkdead, AFK, etc. (To use this type of feature, you will need another machine on your network, since you can't alt-tab in EQ). You will also be able to search according to any parameter. I.e. if a piece of rogue armor drops, you will be able to instantly get a list of all the rogues in the zone.<br><br>There are several other features that we feel will be extremely useful. We are also open to any suggestions you guys have for future releases. Just post your thoughts on the forum.  You can email the creators with questions/comments/suggestions/bugs at staff@llamaherder.com.  Also, feel free to post in the forums linked on the website!<br><br>It is downloadable from their website at <a href="http://www.llamaherder.com">www.llamaherder.com</a>. So please download it and give it a look, use it, test it, try and break it, and give feedback to the guys. Hope you like it!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">Elmo Factory</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Sunday, August 12, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i>From Dari:</i><br><br>A new employee is hired at the Tickle Me Elmo factory. The personnel manager explains her duties and tells her to report to work promptly at 8:00 AM. <br><br>The next day at 8:45 AM, there's a knock at the personnel manager's door. The assembly line foreman comes in and starts ranting about this new employee. He says she is incredibly slow and the whole line is backing up. <br><br>The foreman takes the personnel manager down to the factory floor to show him the problem. Sure enough, Elmos are backed up all over the place. At the end of the line is the new employee. She has a roll of material used for the Elmos and a big bag of marbles. They both watch as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles and starts sewing the little package between Elmo's legs. The personnel manager starts laughing hysterically. <br><br>After several minutes, he pulls himself together, walks over to the woman and says, "I'm sorry, I guess you misunderstood me yesterday. Your job is to give Elmo two test tickles."<br><br><br><br></p></blockquote>
