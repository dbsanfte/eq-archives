<b>Sorry to say this, but i think you're screwing people out of their plat in the game. Yes their getting something that they can keep out side of the game, but 15k plat isn't worth the portraits i've seen. You're using layers, in game screenshots, and photoshop filters. Doing that is nothing special and any person with half a brain and some patience can make the same thing easily.</b><br>

<b>I was expectly to see actual artwork. This stuff looks a like photoshop job using Verants artwork. What they did was art, what your doing is nothing more than compositing, bevel and embossing every piece of type you use, and using a ton of layers with applied filters and some drop shadow/glow on them. Composition wise, a few pieces looked nice. What's really interesting is that people want this done for them. I'd like to try the same thing and maybe take it alittle further such as a mix of screenshot examples composited with actual genuine artwork. I can also model out character's in 3-d using 3d Studio Max. I'll check back on this sign book to see the replies this post will get. (positive and negative, I'm sure) Nice compositing though!</b><br>
