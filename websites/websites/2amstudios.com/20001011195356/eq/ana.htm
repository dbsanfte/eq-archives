Good day friends, come sit and have one of Sulo's finest brews.  I'm here 
today to speak kindly of one of the most important people to me in this world 
known as Norrath.  I was but a young ranger, still angry over the ways of the 
world, and of the slaying of my father at the hands of the bandits of West 
Karana.  Seeking out to find and execute some of the local rogues hiding out 
in the sewers of Qeynos, I made first contact with the first officer of a 
band of adventurers known as the Noble Warriors of Norrath.  She was a proud 
warrior named Joan Loveblade, one of the fiercest warriors known to the land 
at the time.  We spoke for quite a while, and when she was done she gave the 
final go ahead, and I became one of the NWN.  This was the beginning of our 
friendship.
<p>
Not too long after I was much matured, able to fight many times better than 
before, and able to go past the plains of the Karana out to the greater parts 
of the world.  I met up with Joan on occasion to say hello, and to possibly 
share a battle or a story.  When I first saw her I was in awe, she was in the 
loveliest armor I ever did see, dressed in blackened chain wielding one of 
the biggest swords I ever saw.  She was kindhearted yet bold, stopping to 
save a young monk from doom by a wandering orc, then sparing a few gold so 
the young martial artist could get something to eat.
<p>
Over time however, our band of adventures began to grow unsettled, I myself 
took leave for a period of time in order to explore the world more, Joan left 
entirely to seek out adventure, and others began to search out their own 
destiny.  The whole time I was separated from Joan I never forgot to say 
hello, as she was quite kind in my eyes and I thought her a good person.  We 
would not see each other regularly for a long time, as we were both on our 
own paths.
<p>
The next time I saw her I was rejoined with my former band, being promoted to 
one of the head officers of the guild and partly in charge of recruitment of 
new members.  Joan took on another form, becoming that of a paladin, in order 
to fight the evil throughout the land.  She was once again looking like a 
mighty knight, wielding the best weapons I ever laid eyes on.  I greeted her 
warmly, chatting with her about old times, just holding pleasant conversation.
<p>
One day she contacted me asking me for an audience in east commons, since I 
was in the area not doing anything in particular I agreed and began to head 
over.  When I approached her she had with her a set of Rubicite Pants, 
possibly the shiniest red I ever saw.  I complimented her on such a fine 
piece of armor and asked her what assistance was required on my part.  
<p>
That was when she gave me the first of many armor upgrades, the Rubicate 
pants that to this day I still wear.  Before I met up with Joan, I was donned 
in Banded Mail wielding a Fine Steel Long sword and a Dragoon Dirk.  I held a 
grant total of 40 Platinum pieces to my name, and was struggling to survive.  
She taught me to fight, taught me when and how to protect another, and when 
to flee.  I was a young yet loyal novice in this world.  She took me under 
her care and helped me to become the hunter I am today.  For that I'm forever 
in her debt.
<p>
A year later nothing much has changed, I'm still young in relative terms, I 
still have much to learn but I'm growing, and I'm still loyal to my finest 
friend.  Joan has taken on the life of a caster of all things, imagine the 
toughest woman I ever met a robe-wearing finger-waver.  She is good at what 
she does though, and when we are together I don't think anything can stand in 
our way.  I don't think I will ever be able to repay the kindness she has 
shown to me, so I shall continue to help her spread kindness to those 
deserving across the land.  Good day friends, it is time for me to return to 
the shadows of the forest.....<p><center>
