<td tr valign=top></center><FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial>I left my home continent of Faydwer, pulled across the ocean by the promise of a festival. Races I had only heard whispers about attended that night. Creatures huge! Called ogres and trolls.  And these dark elves…one asked me if I was edible!  *grins*  I think that was a compliment. Much drinking was involved.  I remember the effects of alcohol at the wedding I attended and decided I wanted to keep my vision that evening.  I was able to barter for a snakeskin jerkin there… a wonder to this patchwork druidess.

The festival itself was in a tunnel… I thought that odd, as home D'tnikklin festivals were out in the open where the sky and earth and trees are praised and sung to and about.  It was hard not to feel closed in by the earthen walls…by the mass of strange people, and the huge monsters attending.  I understood the need to not have the celebration in Freeport…none of these evil creatures would last a second.  Not that the city was a better choice. I dislike all "cities" as such. They close you in, but this one felt like a maze…the kind children put deck mice into and bet on.

I hunted with a group briefly in oasis of marr…we stayed near the border, but with a paladin, monk, cleric, bard, and druid, we were a well-formed group of  11th year trainees…killed a deepwater caiman too. Learned much in the way of experience, but kept the backpacks light.  Hunted in East and West commons.  Saved a man from mauling by puma, only to have pumas attack me ever after.  Got attacked by a Griffin shortly after making lvl 12…I became trail rations, needless to say.  Later my party was attacked by a kodiak…I had healed the barbarian warrior so much that the bear turned on me! Me! A Druid! Hmmph.  I hunted North Ro with friends, chasing dune tarantulas and orcs, hiding from towering sand giants in the distance… it was all very…different.  
<p>
A lot of people with odd ways of looking at things.  Humans must be under the mistaken notion that druids can change gender appearance.  Not till I came to the freeport area had I ever been asked if I was really female…they had exaggerated conceptions of our powers.  
<p>
Everywhere you went there were people. Humans in my group couldn't see at night.  How did they survive if they couldn't tell a griffin was behind them?  I warned my party members… the mighty barbarian scurried up the hill faster than a gully spider, and the human wizard had to ask for new leggings, as he'd soiled his.
<p>
Tunare gave me a restless wandering spirit…one day  I ran and ran and ran…found myself in Kithicor woods..very dark, almost like Greater Faydark but sinister. After a few missteps, a human and a barabarian were able to give me directions to a place called Rivervale.  
<p>
Rivervale!  The sound rolled off my tongue like dewdrops and sunrise.  The inhabitants were called "Halflings".  Short like gnomes, but more likeable.  Almost outdoor-loving dwarves.  This town…was it a town?  Yes it had buildings together, but most homes were under hills.  The "walls" were hillside.  It had a Druid Guild!  What was not to like?
<p>
A kind barbarian shaman named Mareth bound me to the town. I am spending my days collecting warbeads, and building my wealth so as to afford spells in 2 more levels.  I hope to find people to explore the gorge with.  I have heard tales of tremendous battles, but have not tried them myself.
<p>
It was here in Rivervale I learned the art of becoming like a tree…a high point for any druid.  Useful in meditation times, I also found interesting applications for battle. 
<p>
I find myself growing impatient…frustrated at the lack of "growth" I am experiencing.  How will I ever learn Spirit of the Wolf? I do not seem to grow in my studies at all. Perhaps if I meditate the answer will come….
