<b>Sceran Stormwind</b><p>
by Wrynn Tohtori<p>

</center>
I ask ya ta excuse the roughness o' this tale, 'cause I be a cleric and have not the bard's quick-witted tongue, but it be heart-felt in its tellin'.  I'm here ta tell ya folks abouts the gentlegnome wizard Sceran Stormwind o' the Order o' the White Lion.  He be a hero ta me.
  <p>
    I met Sceran when we was both youngin' peeps in our mid-teens. He was introduced by a friend and after a few hunts he took up ta huntin' regular with us.  "Us" bein a group o' friends that eventally formed the Order o' the White Lion.  Sceran be a Foundin' Father.  Even as a youngin' he be showin' the stripes o' leadership.  Twas important to Sceran that no member o' the Lions be scrappin' with other guilds or other guilds be havin' a reason ta scrap back.  He's brought many worthy fighters ta our ranks and became our Diplomat ta the Paladins Templar, our guild allies.  It twas a unianmous decision ta elect Sceran as both our Guild Champion and Second in Command ta our Guildmaster, Fenigan Wake.  He has helped with many a guild function like the trainin' o' the guild in sactioned duelin' compititions, makin' up packs ta give ta the newbies ta git them a good start on life, and got several o' us that was under the lvl limit inta a expediton of Kunark. He ensured we had a group and were looked after proper.
  <p>
    He be generous as well as civic minded.  There be many a peep in our guild as well as some outside it that has benifitted from knowin' Sceran.  He gifts things ta his friends that he could sell ta git goddies fer himself or ta pay fer his tinkerin' skill.  Which any Gnome will tell ya is bloody expensive.  He even gives away the toys he tinkers.  His generous nature has earned him the nickname of Unkie Sceran within the guild.  But above and beyond that material, Sceran is a loyal friend who would and has laid down his life fer others.  Many is the times he's blasted nobs and drawn them off me and onta himself so that I could cast healin'.  When I died in Paw, and the only way down ta me was ta jump down this cliff, that be a dangerous jump to soft sided wizzies, he came ta my aid no quetions asked.  Luckly he dinna have to jump, but he was willin'.<center>

    Last of all is me personal favorite of all Sceran's acts o' herosim is when he provided the fireworks at the weddin' of me and Sirroco.  It seems the Deputies in Rivervale took some exception to his castin' within' the city limits.  There be very few out there who would die entertainin' weddin' guests.  I've never had a truer friend.
  <p>
    Just so's ya folks don't think I be speakin' o' a myth, a Gnome too good ta be true, I assure you that when he finds out I told ya all this tale he's gonna string me up from the nearest tree by my furry big toes.  That is if he can catch me [grin].
