<b>Ranjin(or whatever the name of who was ranting about art), I think you overreacted just a tad. She isnt charging RL cash or anything, she is charging game money for a game favor. It's no different than charging for a port. Free market is called *free* for a reason ya know, and you don't have to buy it. Further, comparing Verant's character models to Van Gough is absolutely the stupidest thing I've ever heard! <br>
<br>
""OMG, you mr druid, are STEALING verants spell! You charge 20pp for that port to commons? OMG! You didnt design that spell! Verant's designers did. Easy to read spell icons make your accomplishment so trivial. All you do is wait for enough mana then push a button! OMG, you've got some nerve charging me for a port. People who charge for ports in RL are called uhhhh, taxi drivers! You are no different than a taxi driver, you dirty porting druid!""<br>
<br>
See how you sound? At least that's how you sound to me... You may have spent many years becoming some incredible artist, but I suggest you go back to school to learn how to remove the stick from your righteous ass.<br>

<b>You're stealing Verant's art. You are not an artist, and you should be ashamed to call yourself so. I studied art for many years, there's a massive history and dedication toward it - and so I have some idea what art is, though will probably never be a true artist. While there are some geniunely talented people who can use various paint packages, applications such as PSP allow even the most inexperienced user to produce your results. Layers, filters and light flares are all effective at creating your effects.<br>
<br>
If you could draw something original, from scratch.. just create something original.. make it beautiful, make it tell a story.. I would think better of what you're doing here. I bet you can't draw, paint, sculpt of these things.<br>
<br>
A screenshot does most of the work, you just then do your little bits to STEAL it. Why don't you take away a Van Gogh, add a light flare to that and call it your own? Better yet make money for your own gain... I pity you, and those who you decieve.<br>
<br>
People who do this with real life art are called theives, phoneys and fakes, and you should be considered no differently.<br>
<br>
Luclin is so beautiful compared to many games, the artists are so talented... I can see you're already starting to pillage their work. Where do you get off?</b><br>

<b>Cool stuff, great idea. I wish I started playing long ago so I could have done it :). <br>
<br>
BTW - Elrond, yes, it is easy to do this stuff, for some. Some people can't learn windows no matter how hard they try. They just view it as something extremely foreign and horribly difficult. I think these are very impressive and they use some advanced techniques. They also take a lot of time to make them look seemless. It takes more than experimenting to learn how to do that, it takes time. Most of the people who pay dont have the time to do it, or Photoshop. Not everyone downloads their software. </b><br>

<b>I will comment one time and one time only on remarks such as the one below. I am a "gal" not a "guy". No one twists anyone else's arm to email me asking for a portrait or a message board pic.  Not everyone has the time nor the inclination to learn a new paint program. Many people would rather spend that time in game adventuring, trading, fighting. Over a year ago I started a message board to help teach others how to do altered screenshot art.  If you, Elrond, are "egostical" enough (*grin*) to post remarks like these on my site,  give your real email address rather than just your IP.

<b>Sorry to say this, but i think you're screwing people out of their plat in the game. Yes their getting something that they can keep out side of the game, but 15k plat isn't worth the portraits i've seen. You're using layers, in game screenshots, and photoshop filters. Doing that is nothing special and any person with half a brain and some patience can make the same thing easily.</b><br>

<b>I was expectly to see actual artwork. This stuff looks a like photoshop job using Verants artwork. What they did was art, what your doing is nothing more than compositing, bevel and embossing every piece of type you use, and using a ton of layers with applied filters and some drop shadow/glow on them. Composition wise, a few pieces looked nice. What's really interesting is that people want this done for them. I'd like to try the same thing and maybe take it alittle further such as a mix of screenshot examples composited with actual genuine artwork. I can also model out character's in 3-d using 3d Studio Max. I'll check back on this sign book to see the replies this post will get. (positive and negative, I'm sure) Nice compositing though!</b><br>

<b>Raene, your work is excellent!  I am so excited about you doing a portrait of Fantome and I (however, it may not be Korbell -- I'm thinking perhaps Cliquot, she's my druid).  I'll start working on ideas so you have something to run with.  Take care.  Hugs!</b><br>
