<td tr valign=top></center><FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial>The words of our  Druidic Master echoed in my ears.  I was far from drowning a village, I thought.  I could barely kill centurions on my own.<p>
Orcs had been a blight on our people since before I could remember. Da was always running back for more, the blood on his sword and tunic still fresh. Left Ma to take care of the tavern most days...and nights.<p>
I saw how her spirit lacked feeding and she slowly paled away to nothingness. I determined that sad day at her Kl'pla that I'd not meet the same fate as tamely. I'd rather go out kicking and screaming defending my homeland from all that was unnatural.<p>
