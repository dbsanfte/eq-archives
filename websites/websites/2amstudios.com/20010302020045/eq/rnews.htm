For too long now there have been no news updates to this site. Real Life has been one of the factors, as I have not the time to scan websites for tidbits and post them here.  Only one news infobit came in recently and that was from Brennos...thank you for remembering me.
<p>
My portraits site is still updated from time to time as I get commissions. 
<p>
Everquest has grown enormously since I found it in beta almost 2 years ago. The Rathe server has grown overlarge. We are the only original server that has yet to be split. Remarkably they say this is due to the fact that "everyone" gets along so well. 
<p>
I guess until I get a LOT more time, or unless something dramatic happens, this will be the last news update for some time.
<p>
See you at Baltimore FanFaire.
