<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">The COP Olympics</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Tuesday, February 19, 2002 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>From Revith:<br><br>Attention, citizens of Norrath! The Crusaders of Plilo are going to host an Olympic competition. Now, as we follow the Way of the One True Gnome, these events will differ slightly from what you all thing of as "normal" events. The main point will be death. LOTS of death. After all, the Way of Plilo is not for the faint of heart.<br><br>Now, in deference to the nature of the competition, and as a size limit, only those level 55 or higher will be allowed to compete. In addtion, we will only accept the first 100 non-COP applicants. Sorry, guys. <br><br>Now, on to the events. Exact rules will be announced later, but they will include: <b>No invisibility, no speed song/buffs, no DA song</b>.<br><br>The Marathon<br>A race from the docks in Iceclad to the entrance to the Temple of Veeshan.<br><br>The Swim<br>A race through Kedge Keep, same rules as above. We suggest acquiring some form of enduring breath, as its unlikely you can hold your breath for a half hour.<br><br>The Steeple Chase<br><br>A race up the ice-crusted slopes of Velketors Labyrinth. Exact destination still under discussion.<br><br>The Long Jump<br>High Hold Keep, anyone?<br><br>The Relay Race<br>Exact route to be determined, but will possibly include additional challenges such as COP monk induced trains.<br><br><br>Events under consideration, allowing game physics and equipment acquisition:<br><br>Dorf Soccer<br>The Arena. A shrunken dwarf. Lots of Chetari Wardstaves and a boon of the garou. Two teams. 'Nuff said.<br><br><br>Applications and suggestions for events and/or offers of help shall be sent to <a href="mailto:revith@hotmail.com">Revith@hotmail.com</a>. <br>Good luck, olympians. </p></blockquote>
