<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">Requiem of Souls Disbands</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, May 17, 2002 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>Full story at <a href="http://www.eqros.com/ros/main">http://www.eqros.com/ros/main</a><br><br>"Some, furious, say we had no right to disband the guild...that it was a guild that belonged to the members, not the officers or the guildleader. I feel that this is not an accusation I can address, other than to say...we did what we thought was best, and we know that it is painful. As the last remaining Guildleader of one of the three guilds that formed Requiem of Souls (Yes, I was the guildleader of Soulstriker Clan) that continued to be a part of the governing process, I refused to leave the name of Requiem of Souls behind me. Pantingo was the guildleader, and it was he who made the final decision to delete Requiem of Souls, but let there be no mistake that I was the first to suggest it. I will honestly say that I hope those of you who wish to blame for this decision blame me, as is appropriate, and I do not ask for or want forgiveness. "<br><br>--Arafain</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#D9C7AD">A Rant from Mareth</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Tuesday, May 14, 2002 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>As posted at: <a href="http://pub21.ezboard.com/fflamecentralfrm1.showMessage?topicID=451.topic">http://pub21.ezboard.com/fflamecentralfrm1.showMessage?topicID=451.topic</a><br><br><br>Ok god dammit, I want to know which moron in Hollywood thought of that jackass Pop Tarts commercial. You know the one. All the kids (10 to like 13 years old) all standing around at a "party" eating pop tarts.<br><br>Seeing things like this makes my eyes bleed. First off I can tell you why the hell they are all eating pop tarts. They are all so hopped up on pot that they make me during chemotherapy look like an officer for D.A.R.E.<br><br>See this kinda crap pisses me off. Why not a commercial that says "pop tarts kick ass" or something that actually has to do with the goddamn pop tarts in the first place? Why the utter mindbleeding bullshit with the pre-pubecent(sp?) jackholes that drive me to violence? I like the M&M's commercials. They are funny, you see too bigass M&M's right there walking and talking, and sometimes someone even eats an M&M candy. In the pop tart commercial? Oh they are eating them all right. I just didn't notice that right away. I was too busy wondering which of the 4 punk doped up kids I wanted to punch first.<br><br>The fruit roll ups commercials aren't much better. While I'm watching DBZ, if two of them come on, I'm usually wondering how to back my car over my head by then. These kids don't have the mental capacity to understand yogurt, let alone what is going on in a cartoon so why the hell do I have to endure thier insipid commercials?<br><br>God forbid anyone accidentally changes the channel to Nick, or Disney. When this happens I'm usually pondering suicide using something sharp or acidic.<br><br>See Disney is the worst. So is thier offspring, the same company that made that fucking horse animated movie. I can't remember (nor do I want to) the name of it right now. A movie about a horse. Ok. A movie about a horse that can't be tamed. I know a good name for that movie. Not "Spirit". A perfect name would be "Glue". Its all about goddamn cuteness anyhow. This isn't a movie about some Emu or hairless cat. Its about a horse. And horses are cuter than those two. Hence it will do decently and probably come out with a sequel that will go directly to video in time for my son to come of age to fucking want one. By that time I'll be hunting for the producers.<br><br>Pop tarts at a party indeed. Unless they are laced with crack, I just can't fucking see it. No matter the age group involved. What kind of dipshit would say "Mom, we need 3 dozen pop tarts for the party to be a success!"<br>And if he did, his mom would probably commit him for being retarded. "I'm sorry Billy but you are such a pot head we had to commit you to this hospital. For the love of god, you were asking for pop tarts as the mainstay of your party."<br><br>This just goes to show that midgets are the only thing that won't be corrupted by disney. Austin Powers has seen to that. </p></blockquote>
