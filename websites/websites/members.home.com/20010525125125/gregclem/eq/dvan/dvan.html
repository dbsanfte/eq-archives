When   he was a baby he was dotted on and both parents made sure they spent plenty   of time with him. All was good, except one little problem on one insignificant   day.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>  He fell out of the crib.<br>  </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Normally   this would be a minor thing, he'd be hurt, he'd cry, his parents would make   it better, like any good parents. The problem was twofold though. A passing   druid had cast SoW on the baby Dvan to amuse him, and his crib was by one of   the railings in Kelethin. So when he fell out of the crib, he FELL out of the   crib.<br>  </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Somehow   his spirit was able to return, probably by intervension from Tunare herself.   His parents vowed to never let such a thing happen again, to protect him, and   give him anything he ever wanted. Basically to spoil him rotten.<br>  </font></p><p align="left"><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dvan   never did turn rotten. He did get different ideas in his head then other wood   elves as he grew up, but none of them bad. He also got along with High Elves   as well as the Wood Elves so had several friends to amuse as he grew up. It   was a happy life.<br>  </font></p><p><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As he grew   up, his parents tried to find a career path that was right for him. They tried   Druid, Bard, even Ranger or Warrior. He never wanted to be any of those. He   always wanted to be a.. Wood Wizard!<br>  <br>  Teleporting from place to place! As he runs around the great forests of Greater   Faydark!<br>  The Fire!<br>  The Root!<br>  The ever useful Gate!<br>  The Damage Shield!<br>  The Area of Effect Spell!<br>  With his best spells memorized!<br>  <br>  And he'd sing! Sing! Sing!<br>  </font></p><blockquote>   <p><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>    Oh, I'm a wood wizard, and I'm okay,<br>    I sleep all night and I hunt all day. <br>    <br>    <i>Wood Elves:</i> He's a wood wizard, and he's okay,<br>    He sleeps all night and he hunts all day.<br>    <br>    I cut down orcs, I forage my lunch,<br>    I go to the lava-try.<br>    On Wednesdays I go shoppin'<br>    And have buttered muffins for tea.<br>    <br>    <i>Wood Elves:</i> He cuts down orcs, he forages his lunch,<br>    He goes to the lava-try.<br>    On Wednesdays 'e goes shoppin'<br>    And has buttered muffins for tea.<br>    <br>    Oh, I'm a wood wizard, and I'm okay,<br>    I sleep all night and I hunt all day.<br>    <br>    I cut down gnolls, I skip and jump,<br>    I like to press wild flowers.<br>    I put on women's raw silk robes,<br>    And hang around in bars.<br>    <br>    <i>Wood Elves:</i> He cuts down gnolls, he skips and jumps,<br>    He likes to press wild flowers.<br>    He puts on women's raw silk robes<br>    And hangs around....
