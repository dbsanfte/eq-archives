      I have seen a lot of references to good bards and bad bards. I like to
      think i play my bard well and would qualify as one of the &quot;good
      bards&quot;, but I don't want to be some newbie bard building up a bad
      reputation for himself.<br>
      What exactly will make a bard a bad bard or a good bard?<br>
      My bard is currently working on level 12 and has spent about 95% of his
      time grouping ( I love grouping) so I don't have a lot of solo experience.
      I am in mainly patchwork armor with a ringmail coat. I have a shield and a
      minotaur axe. I try not to tank a lot, but alot of the groups I end up in
      don't have a lot of tanking ability, but if we have a better tank, i try
      not to get in front of the bad guys. : )<br>
      Regardless of whether I am the main tank or just supplemental damage I typically
      twist anthem, hymn, and the whistling warsong (if lag allows to twist all
      3). I will substitute elemental rhythms for the warsong if fighting
      castors. If we need faster healing i will switch to the lute.<br>
      If anyone has an Constructive Criticism I would greatly appreciate hearing
      it. Thanks.</font><!--mstheme--></font></td>

      actually a damn good one. It's past that when the real tanks pull ahead.
      I'd imagine you listen to too many jaded idiots like that Liquidated guy.
      Enjoy being the tank while you can and get bronze/banded armor =)<br>
      <br>
      The bottom line to being a &quot;good bard&quot; is to do what you are
      doing, being concerned with not being &quot;bad.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Many on this board say a good bard needs to twist x,y,and z in a,b and c
      during j,k, and l. That's BS The most important thing is that you play the
      songs that you are able during the times they are most important.<br>
      <br>
      To wit:<br>
      <br>
      On a Nag raid there were 4 bards including myself. Our jobs in each of the
      4 tank groups (3 tanks 2 clerics and a bard) was to provide as much
      protection as to prevent getting feared and lavaed to death.<br>
      <br>
      My personal (and guild's) choice is to play both elemental and guardian rhythms
      while using the mistmoore drum. This brings my personal fire resist to 155
      and my magic to over 255 (no special equipment) with the rest of the party
      at a similar level. Needless to say if I'm able to stay connected my group
      never gets feared and takes minimal damage from the breath.<br>
      <br>
      During the fight I noticed another level 50 bard swinging his yaks and
      playing tunes like chant of frost... completely oblivious to his real role
      in the scheme. Yeah he had a high power system that let him twist songs in
      that Lag bath but they were the wrong songs!!!!<br>
      <br>
      Another lower level bard I'd never had the pleasure of meeting before then
      could only manage one song. When I asked her what she played, it was
      elemental on the drums....The right song!!!! of the one song she could
      keep up it was the very best she could have used.<br>
      <br>
      Now tell me who the better bard was.<br>
      <br>
      So long as you realize that you are more powerful than your own skills,
      that your real power is in making others stronger, you'll be a damn good
      bard.<br>
      <br>
      Cheers!<br>
