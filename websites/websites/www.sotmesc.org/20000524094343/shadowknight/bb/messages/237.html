NOw I just recently ventured out with my first SK. But I have found my pet very usefull. He does end up dieing a lot but his braver should be applauded. Many a time he has saved me running time when our kill takes off on the get-away. Not to mention he allows me to avoid potentially fatal attacks. Of course at this time I am only going up against smaller foe. He does add just a few more hits in there helping me drop the opponent faster.<p>And maybe it is me being a female.. but he looks aweful cute with a little sheild and sword! =) What a fashion statement!<p>Dreamia (the GhostMaiden)<br>Lvl 10 SK<br>Lanys<br>
