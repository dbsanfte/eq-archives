<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an Officially
recognized guild on the Rathe for those of all alignments. Our job is to clear the lands
of Norrath of all things that would hold back our advancement. We work with the ethic of
teamwork, and that good can be found in even the most evil of people. This is why we don't
have an alignment requirement. +PvP is allowed for those who wish. We are accepting
applications for guild members, applicants are required to group with current members and
be sponsored by at least one member. This will be verified with the sponsor. Help us
become the best!</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;<strong>How to Join:</strong> (<font size="1">updated 01-22-2003</font>)
</p>
<font FACE="Arial Unicode MS">

<p>The Champions of Norrath are a family of people that have come together to form a
unique group of people that extend across the face of Norrath. Joining our family is not
difficult but it gives us a chance to get to know you and for you to get to know us.</font></p>
<font FACE="Arial Unicode MS">

<p>The first thing that is necessary is for you to group with our members. This should
take place over a period of perhaps a couple weeks. In that time our members will be
evaluating you, getting to know you, and you-them. This is important because potential
members aren&#146;t joining just a guild; they're joining a family. This time should be
spent making sure that we are the right place for you.</p>

<p>After grouping with our members, you may be granted temporary status. Temporary status
has no set time period. As of late it has been averaging one month&#146;s time. Permanent
membership will be offered at monthly guild meetings. </p>

<p>Before the next monthly guild meeting, Karas and his officers will vote on your status.
You can either be given Full Membership at this time, you can be kept on Temporary Status,
or you can be denied membership. Permanent membership will be offered at monthly guild
meetings.</p>

<p>I thank you for your patience and interest in joining our family.</font></p>
