rules are to be adhered to by every member of the Champions of Norrath. Any indiscretion
of said rules would be grounds for tribunal by the senior members of council. An

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Upon entering a
    known creature spawn location, any existing &quot;campers&quot; or &quot;campers&quot;
    that arrive will be asked about rotating &quot;kills&quot;. This is done to prevent
    &quot;kill stealing&quot;.</span></font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">When engaging an
    NPC currently in combat with another player, you may not loot the corpse until the combat
    is over and you have been granted permission by the player who originally engaged the NPC.
    This is to prevent the appearance of &quot;kill stealing&quot;, as game delays will often
    give false information as to the status of the combat leading to accidental competition
    for the same NPC, or leading you to believe you are saving someone who is not actually in
    danger </span></font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><p style="mso-list: skip"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">If there is a dispute with non-members about
    a kill, screen capture the text. Handle the situation in a calm, honorable manner. No
    matter what language they use, keep yours clean.&nbsp; </span></font></p>

    unsolvable, do a &quot;/who champions all&quot; to see what officers are online. Notify
    them immediately and let them take over the situation. </span></font></p>
  </li>
  <li><p style="mso-list: skip"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">NO RETALIATION will be tolerated! If you

<ol TYPE="a">
  <li><font face="Arial">Guild Event<br>
    </font></li>
  <p><font face="Arial">CoN currently has an official alliance with Days of Dour, and a loot
  table is being followed for internal distribution and order. It is based on classes and
  drops, with rare drops (breast plates etc) being on a separate table. For example, in
  Fear, CoN may be up for the following first: Ranger, Paladin, Druid, and DoD would have
  Shadow Knight, Necromancer, Wizard. After CoN gets the first ranger drop, then DoD would
  be up for the next drop and so on.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Internal distribution will be determined once it&#146;s assessed who
  is in need of what item, and what order.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">Special items such as God drops etc are also on a separate table and
  will be dealt with accordingly.</font></p>
  <li><font face="Arial">As a guest</font></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial">When any member of CoN is a guest of another group or guild that is
  in the planes, it is imperative that discussions of loot outside of basic inquiry
  (&quot;what is a X?&quot; etc) be kept to a minimum. Loot will be distributed by the
  inviting guild as they see fit. The invite should be used as a learning experience or for
  fun&#133;nothing more.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>

<font SIZE="2">

<p><font face="Arial">II. Loot in regular groups</font></p>
</font>

<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2"><p><font face="Arial">If there is a group consisting solely of CoN members,
  then loot will be distributed on a &quot;need first&quot; basis. If there are more than 1
  persons that need the item, then those persons can determine there and then if they wish
  to roll, or to let one take the item with the understanding that the other will have
  priority over the next person on next drop.</font></p>
  <p></font><font face="Arial" SIZE="2">If no member of the party has a direct need of the
  item, it can be distributed either by agreement or /random amongst all party members. It
  is</font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff" face="Arial"> r</font><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">ecommended
  that loot be distributed to guild members in need of said item before it is auctioned or
  traded but this is by no means required. It is understood that members may occasionally
  want to trade or sell items for their personal benefit.</font><font SIZE="2"></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In mixed groups on a non CoN function (by which it&#146;s understood
  that non CoN functions are random pick up groups), items will be dealt with by the group
  leader. If the group leader is a CoN, then the best course of action would be to have any
  &quot;need&quot; items rolled upon by any group members that can use.</font></font></p>

    is Champion of Norrath behavior, and recognizing the individual may also become a good
