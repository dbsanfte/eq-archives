That's gotta hurt.<br><br><center><i><font color=green>A few nights ago in Kael, Remlap decided to lead a caravan into the dark deep dephts of Kael (lol not really). Anyway, while waiting for Remmy to finish explaining his uber strat for taking down the Coldain Ring mobs, Lemilee got a little bored. Well we have to say that CoN was quick to exploit the latest and greatest VI bug from the last patch having to do with focus items. Little did Lemilee know that by wearing the newly conjured uber focus items that things would get a bit heavy. Since she'd heard that many spells had been tested already with the new focus items, she thought she'd try out 'Wake of Karana' in an in-door zone just to see what happened. BAD IDEA! Instead of rain/snow, GIANTS came raining down with unending fury. Nicely intact Mr. Asturn there looked more like a footprint after Rap caught a quick screenie. Needless to say we spent the next 2 hours doing CR! GG FOCUS ITEMS!</center></i></font><br>

Just goes to show you if we were all cool we'd be using 1024 or above anyway. But for the people with 10 inch monitors, I'm getting around to you :)<li>Just a reminder that our montly guild meeting is TONIGHT in North Karana @ 10PM EST/9PM CST<li>Also, I felt the need to give tribute to Druids today since this leaf blowing web page is bout the closest I'll come to my epic for a few months (lol). No it won't be on the web page forever. I'll probably change it to floating gnome heads or something that will tickle your belly. I'll surprise you<br><br>

It took awhile to get enough people last night for the Remlap ring slaughter, but grats to him on nearly completing his 9th Coldain Ring. Only one more big kill left!<li>Also a late grats to the ToV'ers from Tuesday evening. Thanks for putting up with the whole server patch thing and getting things promptly under way. Grats to all who got drops.<li>Thanks to Karas for posting these wonderful pics of CoN guild get togethers as well as group pictures from the years past Fan Faires.<br><br>

<font size=2 color=blue><b>March 19, 2002</b></font><BR><br><li>CoN had mixed feelings about the ToV raid last night. Was it lag? Was it Carin's obvious infatuation with Rapunzara's posterior? Was it the fact that someone had too many beans for dinner? Or was it just plain bad luck? Check out these sweet pics sent in by Takishiro and Pokee, both hilarious. The first one speaks for itself. Can we say ToV slaughter?! The second one is a story in its self!<br><br><center><i><font color=green>Supposedly the drake, knowing he was just about to get put 6 feet under, had to cleverly resort to some other method of attacking to up his odds. It looks like it worked. The drake quickly whipped his tail around feeling for the underarm of the closest attacker (who just happened to be Derek). It found its spot and began tickling Derek with all its might. Throwing Derek off guard, it caused him to begin laughing hysterically, sideswiping his blade into Rapunzara rather than the drake! Reeling from the surprising blow, Raps body jerked forward leaving her hunched over in pain, unable to move. Peering out of the corner of his eye, Carin couldn't help but notice the recent beauty before his eyes. Carin gasped! DAMN THATS GORGEOUS! Ammon in his jealous love (?) dashed to save Rapunzara from Dereks tickle histeria. Or was it to also catch a quick peek before the inevitable slaughter? Hrmm.. How will we ever really know! ;)</i></center><br><br></font>
