<p>* BLACKSMITHING GUIDE * <br>
***********************<br>
So, you wish to learn the skills of a Master Blacksmith, impress your friends with <br>
your shiny new armor you made and make a bundle of plats off selling, eh? This may <br>
sound very rewarding, but the road to this is long and arduous! Before you read on, <br>
be aware that on average, it takes around 150pp to get good enough to make banded <br>
armor. Read on if you wish... <br>
Opinions may vary, but I am going to tell you how I mastered Smithing. <br>
<br>
NOTE!!!! Never stack components in the forge. This has to be the most annoying cause of <br>
failure and is a question I get asked a lot. If you get a strange failure message, <br>
make sure you didn't stack your components! <br>
<br>
Beginning Smithing (SKILL 1-27) <br>
I scrounged up rusty weapons wherever I could find them (fishing, hunting, buying, <br>
and sharpening other player&#146;s weapons for free). Sharpening stones only cost 3cp in <br>
North Freeport, so this was fairly painless. To sharpen weapons, place the rusty <br>
weapon and 1 sharpening stone in the forge and click combine. I think around skill <br>
23-24, I got trivial with some weapons. You must then only sharpen Scimitars, <br>
Long Swords and Battle Axes to get improves. I got trivial on these at 27, so I <br>
moved onto the next phase... <br>
<br>
Apprentice Smithing (SKILL 27-35) <br>
This is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome phase at its best! At this phase, you will be <br>
doing scalers (files). To make scalers, combine 1 metal bit, 1 scaler mold, <br>
and 1 flask of water. To make a metal bit, put 2 chunks (the stackable ones) <br>
of ore and 1 flask of water (make sure the water is NOT summoned!) and hit <br>
combine. Do this over and over and over! If you succeed on the scalers you will <br>
get a container lid mold (still don't know why!) and a file. You can actually <br>
break even at this phase if you succeed regularly. Make scalers til you hit 35. <br>
I then switched to Lantern Casings. I made lanterns from 35 to 55 or so, at which <br>
point they became trivial as well. <br>
<br>
Journeyman Smithing (SKILL 55-65) <br>
This is a phase where each person kind of goes his or her own way. We will be <br>
making skewers here. Skewers can take you all the way up to 115 skill. Skewers <br>
require 1 metal bit, 1 flask of water and 1 skewer mold. Cost per skewer attempt <br>
is 2-3gp. Don't be discouraged if you fail alot, you can still get improves on <br>
failures! <br>
<br>
Expert Smithing (SKILL 65-80) <br>
Continue to make skewers at this point. I have tried banded pieces and the problem <br>
is that failures are very expensive. You need two pieces of metal (~1-2pp each, and <br>
a mold (~2gp-2pp each), so you can be set back quite a large amount on 5 failures. <br>
<br>
Master Smithing (SKILL 80+) <br>
Start raking in the plats. As you get higher and higher you will notice certain <br>
banded items no longer give you skill, eventually resulting in the need to make <br>
mostly tunics, leggings, and cloaks. <br>
<br>
TIPS<br>
==================================<br>
Here's some other things I have found over the past few weeks that I wanted to <br>
pass on. I have no way of verifying these tips quantitatively. I can only speak <br>
from experience. I may be totally wrong. <br>
<br>
..Get the books. Books are goooood.. <br>
==================================<br>
I have heard that if you keep the smithing books in your inventory, you will gain <br>
skill faster and fail less often. I can only speak from experience when I say this <br>
SEEMS to be the case. I fail much less often and gain skill quicker when I have <br>
them on my person while at the forge. It doesn't hurt. Try it. <br>
<br>
..Get +INT items.. <br>
==================================<br>
I got a +INT ring from our esteemed Kitty some time ago, and it has helped my skill <br>
increases. Any +INT stuff you can find is good. If you can get your INT over a number <br>
evenly divisible by 5, all the better. I have heard this helps. <br>
<br>
..Buy in Bulk.. <br>
==================================<br>
I tend to go on smithing jags, where i make a TON of things at the same time. Doing <br>
this has led me to believe that I have better luck the longer I stand at the forge. <br>
In other words, I get more skill increases after I have made 20 of something than <br>
after I've made 10. This may be just me ...who knows. Note that this is all AT THE <br>
SAME time. Buy a lot of bags. I will generally make 60-80 metal bits (ugh), then <br>
go to east freeport and buy 100 water or so and 30-40 molds. Then I go to town! <br>
<br>
..Take off the Grotesque Mask.. <br>
==================================<br>
... before buying supplies. Doh! <br>
