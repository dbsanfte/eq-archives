                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the begining was only of the superhuman races,
                    Barbarians, Euridites, Dwarves, and Elves. The only thing making this world corrupt was
                    the evil god Graphitalodar the god of death, his sinister plans and wreched army of
                    skeletons and rotting corpses.<br>
                    Barbarians were one of the most respected race for their strength and bravery, they were
                    very nomatic, for these reasons the god of death hated them and made many attempts to
                    destroy them but his undead army and evil sorcerers always failed.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a tale of a young man who had his calling as a warrior to
                    defend the world from death, here is the tale.....<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a cold day like always on the plain, the barbarians had
                    set their camp between three hills which gave them protection from any wind or attack.
                    Beowoulf, a young lad strong and agile was hunting foxes and gophers, he tredded slowly
                    across the crunchy snow and stared at the fox as the fox was eating a small bird. Beowoulf
                    had two rawhyde belts across his chest creating a V shape and a polar bear loin cloth with
                    a sheath and a 5 inch dagger inside.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew his dagger and jumped for the fox, the fox jolted and
                    jumped and darted left to right and did tricks as though he was mocking him for his slower
                    legs and movement. Furious, Beowoulf threw his dagger just as the fox was jumping to his
                    small hole in the ground and got him in the back. He skinned the fox and had a smile of
                    vitory on his face.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beowoulf was carrying the many hides from that day to the camp,
                    his grandmother had promised to make him boots of fine leather and fur lining them if he
                    supplyed the hides.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was bouncing over the small snow banks he saw a
                    charriot pulled by four polar bears the man inside had a giant axe smeared in blood and
                    wore a round metal plate chest it looked as thick as his whole hand. The man had black
                    hair and his mucles were big and dirty from fights. He made it back to the town and saw
                    the man with the carriage talking to the others, his expression was fear and excitment. He
                    waved his arms about signaling something very large and the village started suiting for
                    war and the wemon took shelter.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beowoulf entered his mothers small bamboo hut and asked what was wrong,
                    she said with panic in her that a monster was comming the Tulac, She said it was a snowman
                    the size of 100 men and was going to attack the village. Tears streamed from her eyes and
                    beowoulf said &quot;I will help protect the village!&quot; and with that he ran from the
                    hut with her mother crying and screaming for him to come back. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He perched himself upon a falled tree that acted like a bridge above
                    the entrance to the camp. The entrance of the camp was between hills creating a V shaped
                    small ravine.<br>
                    He squinted his eyes and waited, he was getting cold after 4 hours of whatch. Then he
                    heard a rummble and a roar, he froze in his tracks and he felt his muscles tighten. The
                    monster came crashing through the entrance, Beowoulf held onto the fallen tree as the
                    monster passed right underneath him. The moster was very tall and his head hit the log and
                    beowoulf fell from the log onto the ground with a loud &quot;Pumf!&quot;.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw the monster grab a whole hut and threw off the roof and looked
                    inside and whent on. The village warrior told the men to &quot;Get him!&quot; and they
                    threw their spears and flailed their swords but the monster tore threw them like nothing
                    was there. Beowoulf knew he must fight or die with the rest if them so he drew his dagger
                    and looked at the monster as it tore open another hut. He knew he could not kill it with
                    his dagger so he decided to make a plan, he took a long peice if vine and strung it
                    between two stumps in the ground and he took another peice and coiled it around this wire
                    and he did this again and again untill the wire was as big as hid head. The wire was
                    placed about 30 feet from the fallen tree that was now on the ground since the monster had
                    hit it, he carved a branch that aimed twards the sky so it was sharp as a spear. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men had fallen back and Beowoulf walked up to the monster and
                    stabbed it in the foot the monster roared in pain and looked at the running boy in hatred,
                    Beowoulf ran to the trap and jumped over the wire and crawled over the giant log and kept
                    running then stoped and made a face at the monster. The monster ran twards him and hit the
                    tripline with a snapping noise the monster came down on the spike. The spike drove through
                    his chest and the monster let his final gasp for air and with a sigh retired from life.</small></strong></font></p>
