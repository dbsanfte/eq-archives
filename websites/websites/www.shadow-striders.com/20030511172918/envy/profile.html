This Teir'Dal terror came to Qeynos with intentions of destroying the Wind Riders while also putting the arrogant Faileas in his place, for the glory of Innoruuk. The plan backfired however, and the proud Envy became instead Lord Faileas' slave. Her Dark Knight code of honor guaranteed her compliance with his wishes. To this day, she and Malgorm have differences of opinion on the subject of honor, which Faileas watches with clear amusement.<BR>
Envy's done the Shadow Striders' name justice; her resume includes murder, attempted assassinations, blackmail, seduction, enslavement, and general harassment of almost any Wind Rider she sees.<BR>
