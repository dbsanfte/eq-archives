Sounds of life envelope surefall glade. This is everyday life. The
Rangers are practicing their archery skills, and Laraden begins his
training as a Druid. He was so excited when he was told he'd be taught.
He rushed to his mother and father who were very proud of their son.
After his first day of lessons he told them all about it. He told them
how he was able to walk up to a bear and feed it from his hands, and how
he played with a wolf cub while it's mother was watching, amused.
Laraden had found his place, or so he thought.
A year later, he excelled at his teaching, only wishing to
please his parents. That same pup that he played with was now an adult
and running around the hills near Qeynos. He visited with his friends
the bears and wolves often, and always had a tastey treat for the young
ones. By now he had learned how to turn his skin to wood and to heal
small amounts of damage. Skills which he loved to show off to his
friends who were still working on healing scratches. Then the Blood Moon
came. It's called the Blood moon because that's the night when all of
the dead rose and attacked whatever they could find. This night the
undead swarmed Surefall. The brave rangers, druids, and some warriors,
paladins and clerics from Qeynos fought long and hard against the horde.
Much blood was spilled. Laraden could hear the fighting from inside. He
wanted to help but was affraid. He looked outside often to try and see
his parents, but could never see them from where he was. His only relief
was he could hear his father shouting commands once in a while and his
mother casting. But he couldn't stand staying in his home while his
parents were fighting the undead. He wanted to help. So he grabbed a
club off the ground and ran to the battle. What he saw horrified him.
Mangled and torn bodies lay across the ground. He couldn't tell which
ones were dead or which ones were waiting for prey. He stepped catiously
through the remains. He looked around but saw no one. Not even his
parents. He wandered down the tunnel out stepping past more bodies as he
went. He was crying by now. He had recognized a lot of the people on the
ground. His teacher for one. A cousin. A friend. All dead. Then he
approuched the opening of the tunnle to outside, and he was releaved to
see his parents still standing. They had managed to push the undead out
of Surefall but were doing badly now. There wasn't much left to the
horde. A skeleton broke off from the group and wandered in Laraden's
direction. Laraden looked at the skeleton frozen in fear. He barely
muttered and cried for help, but wasn't heard. The skeleton stumbled to him
and struck him across the face, laughing. Laraden wondered why the
skeleton laughed, and defended himself. He fought with all his heart but
he wasn't good enough yet. The skeleton had a clear advantage. He had
lost his club and the skeleton still had it's rusty blade. He closed his
eyes and waited for death. Then he felt someone grab him then a rush of
blood all over him. He looked up to see who it was. His father had taken
the blade for him, and stumbled to the ground. The Skeleton then
exploded as his mother finished a spell. She ran to her husbands side
and tried desperately to heal him. Laraden looked on in horror as his
father bled to death before his eyes. She looked at Laraden, and in a
look they both knew he was gone. She walked back to the battle to avenge
her husband and father of her son. With her rage they pushed back the
horde. The next day they buried their dead. At the funeral, pictures of
his father's death plauged Laraden's mind. The only thing he could do
was curse to himself. He looked at the faces of all those around. He saw
the pain battle caused. In the crowd he saw a young girl, a wood elf. He
had seen her in during teachings. She was higher in skill than Laraden
so they didn't spend much time together. She was being given advanced
training by the elders. She was as heart broken as he was. She had lost
someone too. But who. The only other elf he knew in surefall was his
teacher. After the funeral he went to talk to her. They spoke for hours,
much time spent crying. He was trying to comfort her. And she did the
same.............(To be continued....maybe *LOL*)
