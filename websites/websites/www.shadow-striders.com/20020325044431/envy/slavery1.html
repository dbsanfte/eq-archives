<P><B>Slavery I</B>
<P>After losing most of her pride and all of her freedom to Faileas in a brash fight, Envy ran into the wilderness with shame. This was only temporary. Honour aside, the young knight's wounds were too great for her to survive there. She found a necromancer that evening by the name of Tovax Vmarr, and offered him money to help her to the Bloodsabers' temple. Although disgusted by the dark elf, he snatched her money and did as asked. Envy had no idea where to find Faileas again, but planned to pay the humans of the temple to restore her and give information on his whereabouts. 
<P>But when she arrived two great armoured men took her roughly by the arms, and despite her wounds, drug her to a room and tossed her in. She landed hard on the stone floor as the door slammed shut. Quietly panting and bleeding there, Envy tried to think of a reason behind the outrage. When nothing came, she boosted herself up on the lone table in the room, careful not to knock over the dim candle that was placed there. The dark elf slicked back her wet, stained red hair. Then she noticed a presence... and as if on cue that he was discovered, Faileas smiled. The flickering light glinted off his perfect teeth. He stepped halfway out of the dark corner.
<P>"You are late." He mocked, "Do not displease me like this again."
<P>Envy grumbled quite audibly in her native tongue, and leaned heavily on the table to stay upright. In a flash, Faileas kicked in one of the table legs, sending it and Envy crashing to the floor. It made a terrible splintering noise; the candle toppled beside her head and winked out. She looked up in pain to see the Shadow circle to the other side angrily.
<P>"Never insult me, Teir'Dal!!" Faileas yelled. A strand of hair fell in his face and he brushed it back, staring at her through narrow eyes.
<P>By the gods, how can he see? Envy thought insanely, A mere human-
<P>Tossing back part of his cloak, Faileas reached down and picked her up by an arm. Envy's vision blurred to near unconsciousness with the sudden lift, and for a moment her full weight was on him. She expected to feel the ground again, but instead he steadied and guided her around the ruined table. As they neared the wall where Faileas had hidden before, he reared back and shoved her towards it. She braced for the impact and slammed into… nothing. Envy opened her eyes and heard Faileas laugh as he stepped into the secret passage behind her.
<P>The Teir'Dal had few objections as Faileas placed his hand on the back of her neck and pushed her down the slanted corridor. Truth was, she had lost a dangerous amount of blood. Death at this point was not a bad option, however. Her only thoughts other than that were all vengeful plans to overthrow his power, in case she lived. Envy also did her damnest to remember the path they were taking.
