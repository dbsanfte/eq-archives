                      From his perch on the cave wall above, Malcron, gargoyle familiar to Laele,
                      watched as his mistress's limp form was dragged, by the guards who had cut
                      her down, to it's final rest. Moments before, Malcron's being had been little
                      more than an extention of Laele's will. A physical embodiment of the spell
                      Laele had used to summon and bind a familiar to her. Now, with the death of
                      the one who had bound him, Malcron was experiencing an unfamiliar, alien,
                      and not all together welcomed thing.... Self awareness. 
<BR><BR>
                      How many years had Malcron served Laele as her bodyguard and companion,
                      dutiful and, in some strange way, proud. Now his mistress, the center of his
                      poorly scouted universe, lay dead below him. A most unusual feeling washed
                      over Malcron, and his granite body shook with silent tremors. He had seen
                      Laele do this.. What was it?... Crying? yes, that was it... Malcron was crying!
<BR><BR>
                      Muscles rippled, and powerful claws, hard as diamond, etched furrows into
                      the stone wall as Malcron worked himself into a mad fury at his loss. What
                      terrible irony that he could never experience how powwerful was his love for
                      Laele until he had lost her... and lost her fully!
<BR><BR>
                      The fury build to unknown heights, and Malcron prepared himself for a final
                      assault upon the waiting guards, not caring that the guards were waiting and
                      ready. Wings black as night spread, the spiked tips quivering in anticipation of
                      rending the guards below. 
<BR><BR>
                      Suddenly, Malcron felt a presence behind him on the rock shelf. Whirling in
                      fury, Malcron lept upon the invader, only to be stopped, suddenly and
                      completely, by little more than the smallest gesture of his target. Mind blinded
                      by rage and madness, Malcron fought against his bonds refusing to give in.
                      Minutes drew by as Malcron struggled uselessly, the figure of his captor staring
                      down on the scene below, Malcron all but forgotten by it.
<BR><BR>
                      Finaly, Malcron's blind rage ebbed, and he was able to take in his situation.
                      With newfound caution Malcron looked to his captor, but even the gargoyles
                      keen vision was unable to pierce the darkness that surrounded the form.
<BR><BR>
                      Suddenly, as if on cue, the form turned around, and Malcron was pierced by a
                      fear he had never experienced. Malcron's newfound intelligence slipped away
                      and he whimpered in total panic, as the figures laid eyes upon him. The eyes,
                      searing pits of hatred, seemed to burn through him. In that moment, Malcron
                      knew what it was to be helpless.
<BR><BR>
                      An eternity passed as those eyes swept over Malcron's body, staring deep into
                      his newfound soul. Ever so slowly, the spark that was Malcron's self came
                      back to life, feeding off the twin orbs of hatred before him. "L....Lord
                      Innoruuk?", Malcron whispered. For, indeed that is who stood before him. His
                      senses back, Malcron now remmebered when he had last seen the god.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele, proud and powerful, was no longer content to be but a pawn of her
                      household. Lacking any other means of fulfilling her wish, she had sold herself
                      into a pact with a new god, Innoruuk. Lord Innoruuk had promised wealth,
                      power, and much, much more. All Laele had given up was her soul...
<BR><BR>
                      Innoruuk, the Dark Lord of Hate, stood now before Malcron, his face
                      indecernable, but his eyes full of fire. "MALCRON", came the booming voice
                      in his head, "YOUR MISTRESS'S TIME IS NOT YET UP!" 
<BR><BR>
                      Malcron, who had watched as the guards, well versed in what they fought, had
                      taken his mistresses head from it's shoulders, an act which sealed even her
                      doom, was unable to voice words of his disbelief in the face of that stare.
<BR><BR>
                      A deafening rumble split Malcron's skull as Innoruuk laughed. "Come, pet...
                      Learn what I have to offer...."
