                      An adventure was declared by the Lady Atta Kindhearted of the Tiny
                      Daggers. I had recently left their ranks, but they wanted me along, for old
                      times sake. “A Grand adventure into the land of the frogloks! ”She declared to
                      me with a flourish. 
<BR><BR>
                      “Oh? And just what did you have in mind my lady?” I said warily. Atta was
                      not prone to being flighty, but she did sometimes forget that adventures require
                      a little more planning than just running off at the drop of a rock.
<BR><BR>
                      “Well, I was wanting to take you and the rest of the magic users there that had
                      not yet been there. My husband Miscreant and I would be there to guard you,
                      so don’t worry about that. The Frogloks are known for their woven armor, but
                      they are stubborn in giving it. Usually you have to kill them to get it. Not like
                      that is a bad thing…” She grinned almost evilly, an unusual sight on her face.
<BR><BR>
                      “When are we to go my lady? After all, it is hard to gather all of the mages
                      together in one place at one time. Especially if you expect to nail you
                      husband’s feet to the ground for more than five minutes.” I told her, and just to
                      ephasise my point, I called the shadows to move me just behind her.
<BR><BR>
                      “Very funny Talisson. It is a good thing your brother is not as much of a
                      prankster as you are.” She sighed. “ there are ways that I can talk him into this,
                      I know that he has been busy, but I think that it is very important for us to do
                      this. After all, The mages that are newer to the craft need this kind of
                      experience. They need to see what is out there in the world, and see that
                      Kelethin and Felwithe are not the end-all be-all of Norrath. I know that there
                      are a few that have even ventured over to Freeport and to the Oasis of Marr,
                      but there are greater dangers than that, and I think they need to see that.” 
<BR><BR>
                      “Very true my lady” I agreed, “ I will be there for you. I will do my best, but
                      my skills are still limited. I have a lot to learn.”
<BR><BR>
                      “Thank you Talisson, this is a trip you shall not forget” She smiled, and with
                      that she was gone. 
<BR><BR>
                      I sat down next to one of the guards below Kelethin. It had been a long day,
                      and I still had to wait for my brother so that we could go hunting. I looked
                      around seeing all of the familiar sights, the Priest of Discord standing there
                      watching everything with a keen eye. The guards of Kelethin and Faydwer
                      wandering around making sure that peace was maintained in the land.
                      Suddenly a shout caught my attention. “I will NOT be a part of you anymore,
                      Malgorm!” the human shouted in the face of a mage. “ I am tired of your ways!
                      I do not wish to be your slave!” He shouted and stomped. He looked as
                      though the only thing that kept him from striking the mage were the guards that
                      had taken interest in the scene.
<BR><BR>
                      “Ahh, but you are a slave you little fool” Malgorm said quietly. “You are a
                      slave in your own mind, because you will not accept the truth. A slave, just like
                      the rest of the people that you see around you. The Shadow Striders have
                      tried to free your mind.” Malgorm said, looking impatient
<BR><BR>
                      “It is NOT THE TRUTH!” The enraged human shouted. “I will not believe
                      that, nor will I follow it or you any longer!” He stood there seething, waiting for
                      an excuse to attack the mage standing before him. One of the guards
                      snickered, and nudged another. They were waiting for the mage to make a
                      move, so they could have an excuse to jump him. 
<BR><BR>
                      “It is the TRUTH! And I shall have nothing more to do with you” Malgorm
                      shouted suddenly turning into a fury of hatred “And you, my friend,” he
                      sneered the word, “ are ‘free’ from the Shadow Striders, but remember this:
                      You shall always be a prisoner, a slave. My Lord Bertoxxulous will have you
                      kneel before him whether you are alive or dead!” Malgorn cast a spell, and the
                      human looked stunned. “Now, go, slave, before I strike you down where you
                      stand!”
<BR><BR>
                      I stood up and conjured a skeleton to travel with. After seeing this, I was not
                      sure about how the events of this journey would play out. A guard looked at
                      me warily and said “ Don’t take that thing up in the city, or we’ll kill you for it.
                      Got that?” He spat in the skeletons direction. “Filthy necromancers.” He
                      muttered under his breath.
<BR><BR>
                      I ignored him and turned away. “Hail there, friend!” Malgorm said as he turned
                      ans saw me standing with my skeleton. “Always good to meet a follower of
                      Bertoxxulous.” He grinned evilly.
<BR><BR>
                      “Greetings,” I said looking surprised. “It is not often that I meet a human that
                      follows my Lord. “ I said, eyeing him closely. There were many that would try
                      to deceive a follower of Bertoxxulous, and I did nto know if this was one of
                      them. “As a matter of fact, my brother Veederann and I are trying to gather a
                      few of His followers. Both he and I are trying to start a guild, ‘The Sons of
                      Bertoxxulous’” I told him, and watched his face to see his reaction.
<BR><BR>
                      “Excellent!” He said, looking delighted. “I belong to the Shadow Striders, who
                      also follow our Lord. They would be pleased to meet you.” He smiled an evil
                      smile, and continued. “I have had many experiences all stemming from our
                      Lord, going all the way back to my birth. I would be happy to share the story
                      with you, but let us depart from these slaves.” He said and gestured out into
                      the forest. 
<BR><BR>
                      “That would be wonderful! I will have to inform my brother where I am, but I
                      would love to hear what you have to say.” And with that I strode forward,
                      searching for a spot where we could sit and the human called Malgorm
                      Azzothoth could tell me the story of his life and service to Bertoxxulous…
