                      Laraden landed hard after gating away from Sugan. he laid on the ground
                      breathing hard. He stood up and ran for the hidden tunnels under
                      Freeport. As he got in he began to speak to himself. "N..no.." he said
                      as he fell to the ground trying to fight something. "I...i will fight
                      you...", he continued as darkness began to swirl around his body, "I am
                      no shadow." This he said before he blacked out......
<BR><BR>
                      He was in Surefall Glade again. He looked around confused, but
                      he felt he was home again. The he saw her. Charity. She was a Wood Elf
                      of supreme beauty. Laraden cared for her a lot. She walked over to him
                      and rubbed him gently on the face. "Glad you are back, Love.", she said
                      as she kissed him. He was dreaming. He knew she had died. She was the
                      daughter of his teacher. he had died along side Laraden's father in the
                      battle outside Surefall. After the funeral for the heroes, Laraden and
                      Charity met and tried to heal each other the only way they could...Love.
                      "I'm leaving for Faydwer today. I wish you could come too.", she said
                      with sadness. Laraden wished he could have gone too. He knew what was
                      going to happen. This dream plauged him for years. She gave him one last
                      kiss before leaving with tears in her eyes. This was the last time
                      Laraden saw her alive. Weeks past and Laraden grew very worried. She
                      should have contacted him by now. One eve he couldn't stand it anymore,
                      and he ran off into the night to search for his love. He searched day
                      and night, for months. He could not find her. Then a few years later, he
                      was fighting Gnolls their home of Splitpaw. He had just killed one and
                      was resting briefly when he saw something that shattered his heart. The
                      gnoll he had just killed was wearing the ring he'd given Charity as a
                      symbol of undieing love.
<BR><BR>
                      Laraden woke up at this point. He still felt as he did before, in
                      control. He fought off the evil somehow. Maybe the dream did it. He
                      stood up and went about his business, but was in fear that the evil
                      would try again. He let his emotions get the best of him. He was afraid
                      of what he was becoming. Many times he had been taken over by the act.
                      He first wanted to kill Malgorm, for revenge. But the events of the past
                      began to eat away at his sanity. the only thing that has been saving him
                      is the pain of memories. Memories of his lost love.
