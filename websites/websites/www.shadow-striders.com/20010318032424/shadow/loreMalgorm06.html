                      <B>The Oasis</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Deep in the desert land of North Ro, Malgorm had found water and a beauty
                      beyond his imagination. He had gone there to be alone and find out what
                      was going on inside him. As he searched the horizon memories of the past
                      returned, far beyond his life here. Memories of lives long ago that brought
                      him knowledge of what he, Azzothoth, was. Malgorm was no being created
                      from magick, only his body was. His spirit was ancient demon.
<BR><BR>
                      He turned back to the pool, reached down and pulled the water to his
                      mouth; sickened that his physical body needed water. Just as he needed
                      Stormangell and Envy at his side. What was the feeling? For the first time
                      he understood the pain he put Envy though.. and the pain she had put so
                      many others though.. and how he had hurt so many with his evil. A single
                      tear fell from Malgorm's eye.
<BR><BR>
                      "Nooooooo!!" He turned with the rage of a god and blasted down a wild cat of
                      the oasis, a puma. But the death brought him nothing. Then he heard a
                      female's voice. "Why did you do that?" it asked.
<BR><BR>
                      The wizard turned to see a lovely woman. The anger upon her face was so
                      beautiful- her eyes, the fire behind them was stronger than anything he had
                      ever seen. He lost his rage like that. "My lady I am sorry, I did not mean to
                      hurt it. My power some times gets the best of me.. perhaps I could make it
                      up to you?" That day he fought besides her, ridding the oasis of the orcs
                      that plagued it. He was drawn to her by a power stronger then Bertoxxulous.
                      Something that took hold of the soul he didn't have. That new hunger was
                      Terina.
<BR><BR>
                      <B>Vengeance</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Envy kept her promise and lured Silverann to the sewers. There Malgorm
                      was hidden with his magick. Upon the boy's arrival Malgorm blasted him
                      with the power of his hell fire. The child's pain was much; he screamed but
                      did not flinch like a child taking a beating. Malgorm taunted him. "What
                      does it feel like to be so close to death Silverann? You chose not to accept
                      the gifts of the curse. You chose not to accept me." With that, more hell fire
                      bathed Silverann.
<BR><BR>
                      "Foolish child. I am your father, not Faileas.. and if Storm wants to stand
                      against me then you will die. I gave him the power to be strong and he
                      repays me like this!! And you.. you chose not to accept me. Well, you will
                      accept my power or you will enslave your brother. Do you hear me child?!"
<BR><BR>
                      As Silverann sat on the edge of death Malgorm felt the pain he was causing
                      his son. The pain ate at him while he heard the words of the hunger: "You
                      are my slave, Azzothoth." That night Malgorm went back to the oasis in
                      hopes of finding Terina. His thoughts were riddled with confusion. How could
                      he follow the will of the plague and finish what he was to do with her here?
                      He may be able to kill his sons and Envy, but how could he kill something
                      so strong.. so beautiful.. so perfect? She had no weaknesses; the will of a
                      goddess. Then a memory of the past entered his mind she was no longer a
                      stranger.. Bertoxxulous had tricked Malgorm into serving his will. If he was
                      just that, a slave, a soulless beast, then how could Bertoxxulous just leave
                      him like he was before? Malgorm's pained words echo into the darkness, "I
                      will never hurt her, Bertoxxulous!! I will never destroy this world with her
                      here, do you hear me?! I will destroy you first…"
<BR><BR>
                      <B>The Storm</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm spent much time with Terina. He began to ignore the Shadow
                      Striders and their plans. He hid from all of them in the oasis with his Terina;
                      she cloaked him from all the evil. He could not bear to tell her who and what
                      he was so he simply hid with her. Then fear struck Malgorm for the first
                      time. Coming over the hill was Lord Faileas, looking menacing with his dark
                      plated armor and Magical blade. At his side walked a dark wolf- his son
                      Stormangell. Why he returned Malgorm cared not, he just did not want
                      Terina to find out who he was. The fear froze him. Lord Faileas looked
                      suspiciously at Malgorm and asked who she was. Malgorm stood
                      speechless, but Lord Faileas listened as Terina spoke. In those few words
                      Lord Faileas knew all. He looked at Malgorm and noticed the love and fear
                      he knew Malgorm felt. He was not the soulless monster that killed and
                      corrupted. Lord Faileas fought beside them and said nothing; he just
                      watched Malgorm's actions. How he flinched when Terina was hurt. Lord
                      Faileas left that day without a word to Malgorm, but the wizard knew that his
                      love was intolerable.
