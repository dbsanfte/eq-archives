								<B>History:</B> Dying and wounded she lay, this pathetic human was ready to die and i had
the power to keep her alive...
<BR><BR>
 A little mental efforts and she was healed, i dont know why i did that, 
something inside me told me i had to...even though the ways of my upbringing 
were not the same.  They told me to heal only those that are worthy to the 
cause of hate, to the cause of innoruuk...and for a time i did just that.
<BR><BR>
 My past is just a faded blurr now, i dont remember many details of before 
i joined the Wind Riders, i can now assume i was a murderer, what else do i 
have the potential for?  Why would i feel so much anger toward all of my 
acquaintances?  I was trained not only to take pain away from others, but 
also to endure it...and endure it i have, maybe too much, so much that I've 
gone soft...maybe i just can't take this anymore.
<BR><BR>
 In my young adulthood, as i trained with the clergy I risked my life to 
help save the life of my friend, a friend who was innocent. When I 
discovered that a friend of hers was to betray and murder her, then acted 
upon it, i killed to prevent it, saved her life..even though she did not 
realize it.  She thought that her friend was murdered.  I, trained forever 
in the ways of hate, saved the life of another whom i did not even 
know...and from what I did know, she was a former enemy of the clergy 
itself.  But I felt a sense of justice upon me, and prevented a wrong.  
There was something wrong...the only ones who knew of this betrayal were me, 
and the other who had organized the crime to murder my friend.
<BR><BR>
 This deed made me question my soul and my beliefs.  I then turned to 
following the ways of light, the ways of good and justice.  And what did 
this bring?  Well for a time it brought fulfillment, but then it also made 
me realize the light is careless, and ignorant, quick to judge.  
Really...what was it all for?
<BR><BR>
 I joined the Wind Riders for a time, and was banished when she saw me, the 
same woman whom i saved the life of, she was a Wind Rider then also...but 
she saw me as a murderer.  Being new to them, I lost everything, it was my 
word against hers.  How could a newly guilded Tier'Dal cleric defend his 
word against one who was among their ranks for so long?  As you may think, 
yes, I was branded a killer quite immediately.  The only proof I had was 
from the one who organized the murder I had prevented so long ago...Envy 
T'Druis herself.
<BR><BR>
 The truth, I thought, the truth will save my soul, Envy will give them the 
truth, tell them i was innocent, fine, I was willing to endure the price she 
requested for this.  The price was a bond, I was to be a slave forever as a 
failed searvant of hate, and a failed lightwalker.  My life was nothing 
anyways.
<BR><BR>
 *laughs bitterly* and for a small deed *chuckles* I am now given more than 
i had ever dreamed.  Respect. All for one easy little deed I was to perform 
for her (and to my amusement, made all the Wind Riders look like fools for 
trusting me a second time.  Funny, none of them even shed a tear of concern 
when I was captured by the dark mistress...knowing full well of my 
innocence...).  I owe Envy my life...either that or I want to take her 
life...yes thats it...no.
<BR><BR>
 I have had enough of standards and expectations, it has only brought ruin 
to my life.  You see now, the time for light and shadow is over. This is 
about me.  With my new found freedom, I do what I want, when I want.  I do 
what I feel.  My current goals in life (whatever they happen to be, whenever 
they happen to be..) seem to fit in nicely with the motives Shadow Striders, 
I am grateful to be a part of them.  I've not felt such a rush of pure power 
when Envy gave me my freedom, and my respect.  Religion, philosophy...I 
assure you its all quite meaningless.  We all die, and then get sent into 
that wonderful pit of non-existance...the gods know this, they see us as 
pawns of a chessboard, ready to be discarded at any time. It is all for 
nothing.  Why should I plague my mind with guilt and conscience, when I can 
serve myself, and revel in the pleasures of life as I see fit?
<BR><BR>
 And in my recent travels, I meet my alluring companion, Leiah. An old 
friend of my adolescence *smirks.*  She Brings my unfulfilled lust to 
satisfaction.  I've a bond with this necromancer, Leiah.  She fills a hole 
in my soul, I would protect her and defend her with my life.  I would kill 
anyone, even an innocent in her name, happily.
<BR><BR>
 As it now stands, I am Avari.  Just Avari.  I live my life, I die.  That 
is all.  I just take what I can, do what I can, and enjoy it before I 
dissapear from existence.
<BR><BR>
In Death,
<BR><BR>
Avari<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> When I first met him, he was weak with the love of light. Appearantly, Envy managed to turn him into a deceitful, backstabbing, and cruel Teir'Dal. As he should be.<BR><BR>
								<B>Envy's View:</B> I misjudged him for a while as being an incurable lightwalker, I mean, after all I'd done to
								him he still insisted on being a Wind Rider. It wasn't until he lost all hope as a slave that his true faith emerged.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> I can't give up on Avari, even though his betrayal hurt tremendously. He's been brainwashed.<BR><BR>
