                      A man in a blue robe lounged against a palm tree on the sands of North Ro.
                      His bearded face appeared to be that of a man in his mid-twenties, although
                      lines of worry and misery made him seem older. His eyes were strange - they
                      appeared to be steel grey in color, and so devoid of animation that it made him
                      appear lifeless. He regarded a bottle he held of some cheap swill with
                      undisguised disgust, but drank deeply of it anyway. The aftertaste was bitter.
<BR><BR>
                      "It is not my place to complain." He spoke to a floating, uncaring sword and
                      shield. He imagined it to feign a nod. "My punishment is just."
<BR><BR>
                      "Ho, weary traveler," a booming, cheery voice called. "You appear to be of
                      dour spirits." A smiling giant of a man strode into view, clad in shiny platemail.
                      A broad grin decorated his mustached face, and he wore a shield decorated
                      with the sigil of Rodcet Nife. "I am Gregoran, Paladin of The Prime Healer!
                      How do you fare?"
<BR><BR>
                      The blue robed man directed a gaze with scarcely-concealed annoyance
                      upwards. "I am dying and no one cares."
<BR><BR>
                      A hearty chuckle sprang forth from the paladin. "Not so, my foolish friend! A
                      paladin of Rodcet Nife (bless his name) cares for all! Who are you, and why
                      do you believe you suffer from misfortune?"
<BR><BR>
                      The blue robed man sighed. "I am Nebiros. I am drunk, in an attempt to forget
                      that I have failed utterly, and suffering for it." Nebiros reflected that he was
                      slurring slightly, and couldn't seem to remember his spells very well. He
                      believed the easing of pain was worth it.
<BR><BR>
                      "Failed, Good Nebiros? Should your cause be just, I would be happy to
                      undertake whatever quest you were unable to complete. With the guidance of
                      Rodcet Nife(bless his name), I am able to succeed where countless
                      unbelievers have failed!" At this, Gregoran laughed merrily, and swiped the
                      bottle from Nebiros' hand. "First, you should know that drinking will only
                      make your problems worse." He grinned, then drank the bottle dry. "Ah, no
                      more beer to tempt you. That was awful stuff." He laughed again. "Now, what
                      was your little quest?"
<BR><BR>
                      Nebiros showed no annoyance at the overbearing paladin. He drunkenly
                      scratched his head, then said, "I was a writer. My works were designed to
                      chronicle the great deeds of heroes, analyze histories for my master, and write
                      scholarly works for the edification of my peers." He sighed. "However, I have
                      had a case of writer's block."
<BR><BR>
                      The paladin appeared perplexed, his visions of slaying dragons rapidly
                      vanishing. "Writer's block, eh? Aha! The cure to your problem stands before
                      you!" He puffed up his plate-covered chest. "-I- am a great hero! You may
                      chronicle my deeds!"
<BR><BR>
                      Nebiros sighed. "Only if you support my master's guiding premise."
<BR><BR>
                      "Oh?" Gregoran asked. "What premise is that... and moreover, who -is- your
                      master?"
<BR><BR>
                      The drunken enchanter shifted uncomfortably. "Well, he isn't my master any
                      longer, so I am not fit to speak his name. But our guiding premise was that
                      certain negative emotions inspired creativity and action."
<BR><BR>
                      The paladin appeared puzzled. "Huh?"
<BR><BR>
                      The enchanter shook his head. "Hate makes you strong." He detested using
                      such a simplistic view of such elegant theories.
<BR><BR>
                      "Ha! That's not true! Servants of Hate are destroyed wherever they rear their
                      ugly heads! Should paladins of Rodcet Nife (bless his name) encounter the foul
                      servants of Innoruuk, we have always triumphed! Hate makes you weak, my
                      friend," the paladin smiled condescendingly, patting Nebiros on the head for
                      good measure.
<BR><BR>
                      "Then explain Mistmoore." Nebiros stated, flatly.
<BR><BR>
                      "I beg your pardon?" Gregoran was puzzled again.
<BR><BR>
                      "Mistmoore is a citadel of Hatred placed on the doorstep of those who honor
                      deities of Love, Light, and Justice. Why does it thrive?"
<BR><BR>
                      "W-well, I imagine that the elves and dwarves simply don't have the gumption
                      to drive out the foul servants of Innoruuk. Not to mention," he grinned, "they
                      do not serve Rodcet Nife (bless his name)."
<BR><BR>
                      "Very well. Explain Blackburrow, then. It is a stone's throw away from a
                      temple of Rodcet Nife, and a source of nocturnal marauders who would
                      threaten the lives and health of all in Qeynos. For that matter, why haven't you
                      dealt with the bloodsabres?"
<BR><BR>
                      "Well, I... that is, uh... we simply haven't gotten around to it, I suppose. We're
                      too busy dealing with any who threaten the sacred fish in the Temple of Life."
<BR><BR>
                      "I see."
<BR><BR>
                      "Ah!" The paladin beamed with sudden realization. "You can't take credit for
                      those, because the Blood Sabres are servants of Bertoxxulous, not Innoruuk."
                      He grinned in triumph. 
<BR><BR>
                      "I agree. However, I ask you to simply examine history. The civilization that
                      shows the greatest ability to endure war and hardship has proven itself to be
                      that of the Teir'Dal."
<BR><BR>
                      "Prove it," the paladin huffed.
<BR><BR>
                      "Very well. Despite continuous infighting, the borders of Neriak remain secure.
                      In addition, Neriak is the only city which shows the signs of developing into an
                      empire - you are aware of its Ambassador in Crushbone? All other Empires
                      founded on other virtues have been destroyed."
<BR><BR>
                      "What other Empires?" Gregoran challenged.
<BR><BR>
                      "The Combine Empire was destroyed at its height for challenging dragons. Had
                      it been founded on Hate, and had centuries of factious infighting, it would have
                      simply disbanded for a few generations and then reformed stronger than
                      before. Erudin, the so-called city of wisdom, had barely uncovered a few
                      magical secrets from the Teir'Dal when they became sufficiently unhinged to
                      engage in massive civil war. The war itself was not necessarily a bad idea - the
                      fact they never recovered from it, however, shows their inability to endure."
                      Nebiros waved a hand dismissively. "I covered all this in my 'A study of
                      Miragul's origins'."
<BR><BR>
                      "I have never heard of such a work," the paladin challenged.
<BR><BR>
                      "I'd be very surprised if you had. It has never been read by anyone on
                      Norrath. I believe it still resides in my mast..." he sighed, the continued, "my
                      previous master's study."
<BR><BR>
                      The paladin wiped his brow, frustrated and annoyed. "Who are you,
                      enchanter? Who is this master of yours?" He began to notice he was wobbling.
<BR><BR>
                      "Oh, very good. The poison has finally taken effect. I was getting bored talking
                      to you." The paladin collapsed, and Nebiros regarded his twitching body with
                      disinterest. He had seen no need to warn the paladin that he was interrupting
                      him while he was struggling to build an immunity to Gorgon's blood.
