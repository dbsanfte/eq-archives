									<LI><B>How do I join the Shadow Striders?</B>
									<BR>
									You must fill out our application. Keep in mind we are role playing guild, and your acceptance is dependant on your ability to role play your character well. Fill out that "History Section" in character or as a story about your character. All out of character comments belong in the "Additional Comments" section.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>Who are the Wind Riders?</B>
									<BR>
									The Wind Riders is the sister guild to the Shadow Striders. Both were created with the other in mind. They play the role of our enemies. Most Wind Riders are out of character friends, so any hostility is to be kept in character!<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>What server does the guild exist on?</B>
									<BR>
									Tunare, and only Tunare.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>Do I have to roleplay?</B>
									<BR>
									Yes. It is the founding principle of our guilds. We play for the sake of our story, not for the power of level. It is appropriate to keep out of character comments labeled in Guild Chat; one means is placing "ooc" in front of them.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>Who is Faileas?</B>
									<BR>
									Faileas is the creator of the Shadow Striders as they exist today. He is a human shadow knight, cursed by bloodline to follow Bertoxxulous.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>Who is Sugan?</B>
									<BR>
									Sugan is Faileas' twin sister. She has managed to escape the rule of Bertoxxulous, and has become a paladin of Karana. She is the leader of the Wind Riders.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>Who is Envy?</B>
									<BR>
									Envy is Faileas' Teir'Dal apprentice. At one time she challenged Faileas' power, and lost in an honorable duel. She has been by his side ever since, waiting for the time when she may defeat him in honorable combat.
									<I>Envy is currently leading the Shadow Striders.</I><BR><BR>
									<LI><B>What is the curse?</B>
									<BR>
									Faileas and Sugan belong to the Imshee'Cro family. History claims that an ancestor of theirs sold his soul to Bertoxxulous for the resurrection of his lover. The family bloodline has been cursed to follow the Plaguebringer ever since, most becoming necromancers of great power. This is the curse of Imshee'Cro.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>What is my role in the story?</B>
									<BR>
									That is partially up to you. You create your character, you play that character. We ask that you stay away from being part of the Imshee'Cro family because then it dilutes the story. We like variety. If you present us with an interesting character, and the oportunity arises, your role could become very large. So the answer is twofold, play your character well and give us a little freedom to "GM" the story. Also, if you have any great ideas about future events/subplots, tell us. We will consider all possiblities.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>What about PvP/PKing?</B>
									<BR>
									PvP is kept to duels, guildwars, and some arena events. We prefer to keep it in a controlled environment. Duels are to be honorable, with no outside involvement, and the combatants near equal level. Guildwars are not a free licence to PK mindlessly into a bloodbath. The guildwars usually have rules, with set in character goals. Arena events happen very rarely. Arena areas do not give any member of our guild free PKing rights.
									And of course, regardless of how the technical rules change/have changed, no one is permitted to loot fallen opponents corpses.<BR>
									Exceptions: If, for story reasons, characters agree to participate in an "unfair duel" it is admissable.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>What about multiple characters?</B>
									<BR>
									You are permitted to have as many characters as you like in the Wind Riders <I>and</I> the Shadow Striders. All characters will be judged individually in every respect; ie: You may not be "married" to two characters belonging to the same player. (Unless of course, polygamy is an evilly roleplayed trait) Rules for joining alt characters can be found in the Members section. Alternately, you may have characters in other guilds.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>Why is there a Mailing List and a Message Board?</B>
									<BR>
									The Mailing list is our primary means of conveying news, plans, and stories. It was later requested that there be a constant forum online for people to post messages to each other, auction or list items for sale, etc. Again, it's requested that ooc comments are labelled.<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>Can I convert a character of mine from another RPG I've played?</B>
									<BR>
									Yes, but truly only in name and mannerisms. EverQuest is a different world, with its own lore and history. (i.e. the Teir'Dal are not the Drow in EQ)<BR><BR>
									<LI><B>I don't see Dark Elf, High Elf, or Wood Elf on the application as a character race. Why?</B>
									<BR>
									We have opted to call these races by their 'proper' names in EQ. Meaning, that in the lore of the game, the Dark Elves are known as the Teir'Dal, the Wood Elves are known as the Feir'Dal, and the High Elves are known as the Koada'Dal. Until we learn more, the Half Elves are still Half Elves.<BR><BR>
