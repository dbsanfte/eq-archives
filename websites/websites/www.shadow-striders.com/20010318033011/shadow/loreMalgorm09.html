                      <B>The Shadows unite</B>
<BR><BR>
                      The dark halls of Najena stood silent; the only signs of life being summoned
                      guards of Najena herself. The fierce elementals enslaved to serve the
                      powerful sorceress stood silent over the entrance to her lair. All that could
                      be seen was the glint of steel from the shadows, and the creatures
                      vanishing in the same magick that summoned them. 
<BR><BR>
                      Stepping out of the darkness was a large towering man, the markings of his
                      native land printed across his face. A handsome specimen, armored in dark
                      chain that mimicked the night; he smirked and made a motion with his
                      hand. Next from the shadows came a being in flowing dark robes with dark
                      red hair, and eyes of an angry god. This man stood silently by the first,
                      taking in the dismal surroundings with a smile. 
<BR><BR>
                      Suddenly beside him erupted a fury of blades that spun with precise death;
                      an undead slave of Najena rose from it's grave and fell just as quickly. Over
                      it's still corpse stood the third. A dark elf. His face was one of no emotion or
                      reaction; a cold serpent of shadows. The robed figure nodded, and the three
                      men marched down the halls without concern of life or death. 
<BR><BR>
                      Making their way down the main hall, they came to an opening that
                      appeared to be a temple entrance or throne room. The towering shadow of a
                      man stopped and looked at the robed wizard without a word. The wizard
                      narrowed his eyes at the sight before them and spoke in a dark voice,
                      almost unworldly in it's tone. 
<BR><BR>
                      "Is she so arrogant, Feden, to leave herself this open to attack?" Malgorm
                      asked with distaste. 
<BR><BR>
                      Feden gave another smirk, "Are we so arrogant as to walk right in there?" 
<BR><BR>
                      Just as his words are spoken, the sound of blades are heard swirling
                      against the hide of some kind of tentacled terror. The creature slammed
                      Malgorm against the wall with force, whether it was magickal or merely the
                      strength of the thing was lost to the him. Blasts of magick from all directions
                      then pounded against the three men and the sounds of elementals echoed
                      the halls. They gathered themselves back to back for the fight. 
<BR><BR>
                      The dark elf Maladan only looked on with disgust. "A Teir'Dal in the lead
                      would not have fallen for such a trap." he muttered. His words fell empty to
                      the wind as the three men were caught up in the dance of battle. Feden's
                      blades darted in and out of the bodies of the casters, Maladan spun a fury of
                      disgust for life with ease, and Malgorm summoned a circle of force that
                      knocked the creatures back. The battle raged on for several minutes, and at
                      the end the men stood with dead bodies piled high and blood that soaked
                      the floor. Leaning against a wall after a second of reflection, Feden only
                      smirked again. 
<BR><BR>
                      "That was fun" he growled, giving a twisted laugh. Once again, Maladan
                      grew cold and with out expression. Malgorm entered his dark meditations. 
<BR><BR>
                      Raising up like a dark storm, Malgorm spoke the arcane words and
                      vanished. "I will return. I go to see what traps await us." he whispered from
                      the air. Malgorm entered the dark tunnel that lead deeper into the fortress.
                      He could see more casters awaiting them, and crept forward into the
                      shadows. But with his last step the floor supporting him became an illusion
                      and he fell into a dark cell. 
<BR><BR>
                      Immediately the wizard checked his options, and the importance of Feden's
                      rogueish skills came to his forethoughts. Malgorm trusted the man as little
                      as he possibly could, and Feden was the only "corrupted" Wind Rider that
                      he even remotely trusted at all. Malgorm had once gone so far as to point
                      out the man's talent to Lord Faileas when he was deciding who would lead
                      the dark stabbing blades of the Shadow Striders' Soldiers. 
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm pulled his thoughts back to the problem at hand. He had no Feden
                      to open this cell door. The wizard stepped into the shadows of magick,
                      hoping to appear on the other side of the cell, but to his shock the bars
                      stopped him. A magick Najena had placed on them, no doubt. Could Najena
                      have captured the demon? he thought. Not he… 
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm screamed in rage. "I will have the tome, Najena! You will tell me
                      where it is, or face the rage of the great healer of Bertoxxulous." As he the
                      words were uttered, an undead servant pulled itself from the ashes of death
                      and opened a door for the dark robed wizard. It then smashed to bits against
                      the wall. Malgorm only smiled, the light of great evil upon his face. Perhaps
                      Najena had not heard his words, Malgorm thought, but Bertoxxulous had.
                      With a word of magick he returned to the entrance of the fortress to find
                      Feden alone. 
<BR><BR>
                      "Where is Maladan?" the wizard asked. Feden smiled with enjoyment. "He
                      scouts the top floors, but I have found the way…" he said, motioning for
                      Malgorm to follow. Feden stopped at a wall, and then stepped though it.
                      Malgorm had seen walls like this in many places of sorcery and was not
                      shocked to find one here. They both entered under the protection of magick,
                      making their way down a tunnel, where the torturous experiments of casters
                      upon the helpless souls that had found themselves here could be heard. 
<BR><BR>
                      Upon opening a door, two dark necromancers suddenly released evil curses
                      and turned lose an undead creature of Guk upon them. It was a froglike
                      humanoid, and to Malgorm's pleasant surprise it's innards drug upon the
                      ground as it ran forward to engage Feden in mortal battle. Malgorm's eyes
                      filled with power and rage, and in a burst of unholy power the hell fire poured
                      forth from his hands; cleansing the necromancers of life quickly. Feden cut
                      down the undead creature and tossed a key to Malgorm. They heard the
                      pounding feet of the many ogre guards heading in their direction. Both men
                      hit the shadows and fled to entrance. Standing there when they arrived was
                      Maladan, again with out emotion. "The top floors are clear." he stated, blood
                      dripping from his blades. The charging guards then poured forth from the
                      tunnels, and it was clear that the three men could not take the whole
                      fortress alone. Malgorm glared with rage. He gathered himself into the
                      shadows, knowing the key was all he needed to have, and the tome would
                      be his. Najena had the first clue to it's whereabouts, and he would soon
                      return with the shadows gathered about him to show Najena his army. 
<BR><BR>
                      <B>Lord of Shadows Summons</B>
<BR><BR>
                      A calling from the great Lord Faileas was rare. Malgorm always sensed
                      when his Lord was in danger or needed him, and he was there even before
                      the great Lord could call to him. Not this day. He had not sensed that Lord
                      Faileas was in trouble, but could hear his will and need for him. Malgorm
                      had not spent much time with the Lord since the war; and thought that Lord
                      Faileas was growing aloof. The wizard knew Faileas was to meet with his
                      sister this day in the plains of South Karana. He wasn't happy with this, but
                      who was he to question the man Bertoxxulous had chosen to lend mortals
                      to his will? 
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm found that he would rather kill than even speak with most mortals,
                      and on his order the Shadow Striders would be cleansed of any who spoke
                      a word against the demon. For even those in the guild that merely drew his
                      attention could find the mental whippings of madness that Malgorm liked to
                      tortured so many with. But these whippings made those who survived
                      strong. His slave was a masterpiece of this; the druid had grown to become
                      one of the vilest of villains. A true mockery of Tunare and Karana. 
<BR><BR>
                      With a word of magick, Malgorm stood over the dark Lord of Shadows and
                      found with disgust many of the Wind Riders present also. Sugan looked up
                      and saw him with a glint of shock. To Malgorm's surprise Silveril was there,
                      standing strong and stern with an expression of hatred for the demon.
                      Malgorm knew that the dark Lord had called him to see Silveril, as he was
                      just as shocked as the wizard. Malgorm had battled with Silveril's spirit
                      during the war and with trickery of magick had sent her back to her prison.
                      Silverann stood to protect Lord Faileas in case they were to attack, and now
                      with Malgorm there the dark Lord was insured safety from the masses. A
                      few shallow threats came from Sugan to the demon but to him they where
                      feeble. His strength had become supernatural. He was not sure he could
                      take the whole lot of them, but Malgorm knew he wouldn't think twice about
                      trying if the chance were to arise. 
<BR><BR>
                      Lord Faileas said nothing in reply to the threats. He walked away with a
                      shadow of majestic honor. 
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm motioned to his son; in the past few moons Silverann had grown to
                      great power and had given in to the curse. His evil was impressing the
                      demon. But Silverann just stood and watched as his mother Silveril slid her
                      finger down the side of her magical axe. He seemed afraid of her. The boy
                      stammered a few words about his brother and froze in fear. A rage and
                      power beyond compare swelled in the demon. 
<BR><BR>
                      "How dare you, weakling…" Malgorm growled, "It is not your mother you
                      should fear child. But I see you are not worthy to stand by me. You are not
                      my son, you are hers- You are to weak to stand beside me." 
<BR><BR>
                      In stifled outrage, the barbarian Clanaugh spoke words of comfort to the boy,
                      and threatened the wizard. Malgorm only gleamed a smile of evil; what a fool
                      the man was to draw the attention of this demon. His lovely wife Lillaie had
                      already made that mistake… Malgorm had not needed to attend their
                      wedding for he was in her mind, and had placed a nice wedding gift there. It
                      plagued her dreams on a nightly basis. Malgorm wondered if she'd told the
                      barbarian of the dreams yet, but doubted it. Clanaugh wouldn't have been so
                      outspoken if he'd known, for now Malgorm was sure to make them worsen
                      for the outburst. The wizard vanished from sight in a few words, having
                      stayed only to give Lord Faileas safety from his enemies.
