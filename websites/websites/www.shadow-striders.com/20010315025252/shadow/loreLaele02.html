                      Laele teleported back to her room without warning. Malcron, perched atop
                      the stately marble threshold to her chambers, gave a startled growl and readied
                      himself for battle. She had caught him napping again.
<BR><BR>
                      "Some type of guard you are, my dear." she thought to him, a smile in her
                      mind-voice. "Now I know why I must put magical wards on these doors also."
<BR><BR>
                      She moved her white mane of hair from one shoulder and summoned him
                      down.
<BR><BR>
                      "You are late." he thought back simply. "What did you bring me?" His long,
                      bat-like wings unfurled. He took a small jump from the edge of the carved
                      marble and glided to her shoulder. Tiny icy claws scrabbled on the mantle over
                      her bronze armor, his cool tail wrapping around her neck for balance.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele reached a hand up to scratch behind his ear, smiling slightly. Malcron
                      was her oldest companion and confidante. He was a gargoyle whom she had
                      summoned as a youngster when she had been first learning the rites of binding
                      and control. They had become friends, and when her previous house had
                      fallen, he had helped her to survive. Malcron stood under two feet tall, with a
                      vaguely feline look, save for the long fangs and the two curling horns that
                      sprouted from his temples. His body was small but powerful, made of the
                      smoothest gray stone the color of charcoal.
<BR><BR>
                      "It was a busy evening!" she thought to him. "I joined a new Guild. It is called
                      the Shadow Striders, and is led by that handsome pale one I was telling you
                      about, Faileas...." She sent her memories of her joining the group to Malcron in
                      a burst of information. "They seem to have similar aims to mine." She shrugged,
                      making Malcron tighten his tail around her neck as he fought for balance. "As
                      long as my studies can continue here with their aid and approval, I will be
                      pleased."
<BR><BR>
                      She dismissed the wards on her chamber doors with a wave. The large dark
                      doors opened silently to her rooms, and she walked in, Malcron on her
                      shoulder.
<BR><BR>
                      "I am a little concerned about one of the members, though... a magicker named
                      Malgorm..." She thought, her lip sneering unconciously. "He said I amused him
                      with my desires."
<BR><BR>
                      Malcron laughed his gravelly laugh. "Be not overly concerned. From what you
                      and I have heard of him, he is not in control of his desires, either."
<BR><BR>
                      Laele smiled. "Perhaps..." Her smile grew cruel. "I don't like being called
                      amusing."
<BR><BR>
                      Just as the rest of the ruined house, her rooms were made of black marble,
                      veined with crimson red. Laele had chosen this room in the otherwise
                      abandoned ruin as her own, with the deliberate quality she used when she
                      hunted. 
<BR><BR>
                      It had been the room of the Matron of the Dark Elf house that had been
                      destroyed in one of the Neriak House battles. It was one of the few rooms in
                      the building that still had all it’s walls. Neriak’s Royal House feuds were
                      bloody and well-known. Laele’s own House had fallen eons before, in her
                      own far-distant land, Rilavuen in the Underdark. Having no House of her own
                      on this world, when word came through Neriak that this House had fallen, she
                      had known where she wanted to reside.
<BR><BR>
                      Here, in a place haunted with the souls of her enemies, no snooping people
                      would come to bother her as she did her experiments... unless she invited
                      them.
<BR><BR>
                      The house was a jewel in comparison to her other options; the inns in Neriak
                      often housed the Pale Ones, the Trolls and the Ogres and the smell of those
                      three races never seemed to leave the sheets, in her opinion. That, and the
                      scent of their blood and skin within the air of the Inns; it made her vaguely
                      uneasy… blood did that to her.
<BR><BR>
                      Much better to stay with the ghosts of the dead Dark Elven house, and her
                      companion, Malcron, and to laugh at the ghosts as they bemoaned their
                      torment at her residing there. 
<BR><BR>
                      The style of the architecture in the mostly-ruined building was high ceilinged,
                      regal and stately, rather than the ostentatious "palaces" many of the lesser
                      houses opted for. The house did not cry out for attention with gaudy fervor... it
                      demanded attention by its very silence.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele had decorated the Matron's chambers sparsely after she had moved in
                      and removed the dust. The antechamber she stood in now was where she
                      conducted her studies. A large slab of black marble sat in the center of the
                      room, well-used shackles bolted to its sides. Wicked instruments of pain and
                      torture hung, shining with lethal beauty, from the walls, between her
                      bookcases. Sketches of the inner workings of the human body were scattered
                      on many surfaces, most stained with drops of blood and other fluids.
<BR><BR>
                      She loved to work on Paladins.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele frowned and approached the marble slab. "Malcron, will you look at
                      that!" she thought to him angrily. "Wael Rothe! I told him to scrub this surface
                      down! There is still blood in the cracks of the marble!" Laele paused for a
                      moment, the dark light of crimson growing in her gaze as a slow smile grew on
                      her lips. 
<BR><BR>
                      "Hmmm... he IS rather attractive for a slave." She said, tapping her lower lip
                      with a long finger as she thought. Laele had purchased the Dark Elf slave at
                      one of Neriak’s slave auctions. This one, however long he lived working as her
                      servant, was paying off some gambling debts through indentured servitude. She
                      had liked the way his eyes flashed when she ordered him around, like he was
                      going to try and resist her… she had paid much higher than his debt to take
                      him into her house as a personal slave after seeing that delicious spark of will.
<BR><BR>
                      "Malcron, I think it’s time to start training that slave who is the boss around
                      here… I'll have to punish him. Remind me to do that later." She caressed the
                      cold surface of the marble and the iron of the shackles with a fondness that
                      bespoke often use.
<BR><BR>
                      Malcron’s mind voice, cool, and vaguely sounding like gravel, laughed in her
                      head. "Only if I get to watch. He’s going to be a fun one."
<BR><BR>
                      Laele laughed with her gargoyle pet, and opened the door to her bedchamber.
                      The room was as she had left it, though the sheets had been changed and
                      cleaned.. (‘At least the Wael Rothe had been able to do that much,’ she
                      thought to herself.) The bloodstains her previous bed-time companion had left
                      in the bedsheets had had to be removed. It was not possible for her to sleep
                      well with the scent of his blood around her. It made her too... restless.
<BR><BR>
                      Malcron's icy fingers gave the point of her ear a sharp tug. "Stop thinking like
                      that." he thought to her. "I'm hungry."
<BR><BR>
                      Laele, trained to be the Quenar Dalharil of the lost house, would have killed
                      any male talking to her in such a tone... but from Malcron, it was somehow
                      endearing. The red in her eyes slowly faded. "Later, Milove. I have some
                      business to take care of first."
<BR><BR>
                      Laele’s bedroom was round in shape, her previous house’s sigil glowing in red
                      phosphorescence along the top of the walls and on all her furniture. She had
                      enjoyed casting those spells to make all of Matron’s items her own, and to
                      hear the Matron's lost soul scream in impotent rage around her as Laele
                      marked her territory.
<BR><BR>
                      Her large canopied bed sat against the far wall, the door to the bathroom to
                      the left, her armoire and divan off to the right. It was to the armoire she
                      walked, unlocking the spell-wards with another wave. 
<BR><BR>
                      Laele pulled out a crimson gown, one she had had made for her recently from
                      the softest spider silk. At one of Malcron’s urgings, she had had it dyed with
                      the juice of the blood-flowers that grew only in soil soaked with blood.
                      (Malcron had said it would bring out the color in her red lips, and it did.) It
                      was cut to accent her form, and was decorated with bands of black and royal
                      blue for her dead house’s colors.
<BR><BR>
                      She told Malcron to perch elsewhere and he flew off with an impatient sigh.
<BR><BR>
                      She removed her bronze armor and placed it on the armor tree in the corner of
                      the room. Her under robes fell to the floor in a soft heap. She stepped out
                      lightly, reveling in the feel of the cool air on her naked skin. She lifted the new
                      gown and pulled it over her head, letting the silk caress her bare curves
                      deliciously.
<BR><BR>
                      Yes, this would be a good gown for hunting her evening’s prey… much better
                      than the armor she could not feel her victim's body heat through.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele laced the dress up tightly around her tiny waist, and looked in her mirror.
                      She smiled softly, her eyes glowing crimson in the darkness as she looked over
                      herself with satisfaction. She stood straight and tall and gave thanks to her
                      Dark God for her beauty.
<BR><BR>
                      She took out a cloak and hung it over her shoulders... Malcron would rip the
                      thin silk to shreds if she let him sit there for long. 
<BR><BR>
                      "Malcron, it's time to go." He gave another impatient sigh and flew over to
                      perch on her shoulder. "Careful of the silk." she growled, unnecessarily.
<BR><BR>
                      "Where are we off to now, Laele?" he asked as he landed daintily.
<BR><BR>
                      "I need to pay a visit to Coalgrey... remember him? He's the one who liked
                      to..."
<BR><BR>
                      "...I remember the evening well, Laele!" Malcron interrupted before her
                      thoughts got too graphic. "I was stuck outside in the study all night,
                      remember?!"
<BR><BR>
                      "Oh, yes." She thought back, unable to resist replaying some of the images of
                      that bloody orgiastic evening for her own pleasure. "Well, anyway, he has been
                      busy away from the city, and I just heard he had returned..." she smiled
                      wickedly, showing her pearly fangs. "He should be at the Inn about now. I
                      thought we'd drop in and pay him a visit."
<BR><BR>
                      Malcron sighed again. "Ah, so I should plan on sleeping in the study
                      again,huh?"
<BR><BR>
                      Laele laughed darkly, feeling her body heat up with anticipation of the evening
                      ahead. "If we don't keep you up with all the noise, Beloved, feel free to sleep!"
<BR><BR>
                      Still laughing, she reset the wards and teleported off to find CoalGrey.
