								<B>History:</B> Envy T'Druis was raised a noble in the city of Neriak, her training to
								become a Dark Knight beginning very early, as so many others. House
								T'Druis was a rather new bloodline comparably, yet none the less
								prominent. Not much is known about her family, aside from lingering
								rumors that Envy once had a brother.<BR><BR>
								After several uneventful affairs, one of the young Shadow Knight's lovers
								spoke of a human male in the far off city of Qeynos. This human, it
								seemed, was drawing great attention with his evil deeds. His name was
								Faileas Imshee'Cro. Feeling somehow drawn, Envy decided to set off for
								Qeynos to meet this man... and then put him in his place: serving her.
								She and her current mate, the Enchantress Hateful, travelled long and
								carefully. Their arrival was quite disruptive, as the zealous Dark Knight
								roused hate in everyone she met, especially Wind Riders. All a part of
								Envy's plan, a challenge to this arrogant Faileas and his claim to evil.
								Unfortunately for Hateful, she was informed that her lover no longer
								needed nor desired her company... and was abandoned.<BR><BR>
								Envy found Faileas at last, and mocked his attempts at darkness. A duel
								was initiated, with the stakes being enslavement. Faileas was
								underestimated, and bested the Teir'Dal with ease... to her astonishment.
								With goals fallen to either Death or Vengeance, Envy's honour forced her
								to spitefully accept her loss. And thus, Lord Faileas began his army.
								In those days, Envy took great delight in torture and seduction of Light
								walkers. Alone, she was a nightmare. Together with Faileas, they were
								Wind Rider hell. She slowly brought them to their knees or to her side,
								whichever was more fun at the time.<BR><BR>
								A myriad of stories branch off from when Malgorm was introduced into
								her care, and when Envy met Canelon, and Silverann was discovered,
								and Sugan was kidnapped into evil... but those are for another place.
								It was found in time, that Envy possessed a special amulet that she
								incorperated into her favourite weapons. This jewel happened to be the
								one Faileas discarded long ago, when he found he still contained the
								curse. He noticed this amulet when Envy first appeared in Qeynos, and
								knew her destiny held some great purpose. For this reason was she
								spared in that fateful duel.<BR><BR>
								To this day, Lady Envy remains as an apprentice to the Shadow Lord
								Faileas. She serves Innoruuk and the Shadow Striders with unwavering
								precision, but her true goals will only reveal themselves at her will, in
								time.<BR><BR>
								<B>Sugan's View:</B> Of all the Striders, she is the one I am most concerned with. She has put herself in
								a position of great power, and has no fear of abusing it. Envy even carries my brother's amulet. How she
								got it is not known, but it worries me. She must be stopped.<BR><BR>
								<B>Faileas' View:</B> The first of my loyal. It took some 'twisting' of her
								arm, but she finally bowed to her master. Envy is very important to my plans.
								Her skills in both combat and magic are impressive. But her ultimate tool is her
								use of words and lust. She has ruined more men's lives with her seductive words than can be counted.
								Not something I could ever do, so I leave that to her. Envy has a way of making others
								bend to the will of hate.<BR>
								Another thing of interest is her amulet. Or should I say MY amulet. Years ago I
								threw that thing away. Fate brought that amulet back to me, through her. She will
								most likely play a large role in future events, if her past importance is of any indication.<BR><BR>
