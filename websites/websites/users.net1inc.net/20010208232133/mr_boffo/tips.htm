name="masterpotter">*Raise pottery to master in 4 hours*</a></strong></font><br>
  <br>
  <font SIZE="2" face="Times New Roman">The following is my account of how, despite 
  my INT of only 67, I brought my Pottery skill from 0 to Master in just under 
  4 hours.&nbsp; With a higher INT score, your time could be much shorter.<br>
  <br>
  Before I get started... Pottery was nerfed long ago.&nbsp; Too many people complained 
  that the potters were able to sell their finished goods to the vendors at a 
  price higher than the cost of the components required to make the finished goods.&nbsp; 
  So, if you're looking for an easy way to make money, this is the wrong way.&nbsp; 
  I was not particularly careful about trying to save money, and I'd say the venture 
  cost me about 40pp total. &nbsp; Some of the steps involved are wasteful in 
  that you're intentionally destroying perfectly good components, BUT the return 
  in increased skill points along the way is worth it.&nbsp; I've heard of some 
  people doing it with as little as 10-15pp, BUT those guides were written back 
  before Pottery was nerfed, so they were able to sell their goods to buy more 
  supplies.<br>
  <br>
  First and foremost, doing this in Halas is the key.&nbsp; All the necessary 
  components are within about 30 seconds of each other, all in a single zone. 
  This is not to say that you can't use the same method of training Pottery in 
  other cities, but, for example, in Freeport, the sketches are available in North 
  Freeport, but the clay and firing sheets you will need are two zones away in 
  East Commons.&nbsp; You may say &quot;Dang, Halas is a long way away!&quot;&nbsp; 
  Trust me, to do this right, it's worth the run to Halas. &nbsp; I'd say that 
  if it takes you longer than 45 minutes to get to Halas, you're going the wrong 
  way.&nbsp; If you can afford a teleport to West Karana that helps immensely 
  if you're currently somewhere east of there, say Greater Faydark.<br>
  <br>
  Here are the /locations within Halas of the people and places you'll be dealing 
  with:<br>
  <br>
  Banker: Kevon McTarnigal, located at (200,120).<br>
  Water/Food: Dok, located in Dok's Cigars at (215,270).<br>
  Basic Sketches: Skoni, located at the dock at (5,-35).<br>
  Clay/Firing-Sheets/Vial-Sketches: Merin, located in Dok's Cigars at (250,275).<br>
  Pottery Wheel: inside the Golden Torch at (185,385).<br>
  Kiln: behind the Golden Torch at (177,433).<br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the Rogue's Guild, should you need it, is located behind the Banker's 
  building.&nbsp; I forgot to write down their names, but there are two Barbarian 
  Rogues standing under a gazebo behind the building that Kevon McTarnigal, the 
  Banker, is in. &nbsp; There is a door on his right (your left, facing him).&nbsp; 
  Go through that door and you'll see the gazebo.<br>
  <br>
  The first thing you're going to do is put everything in the bank, and fill your 
  inventory with backpacks.&nbsp; Buy a 20-stack of rations (or other food), and 
  two 20-stacks of &quot;flask of water&quot;.&nbsp; Now, go buy all the &quot;small 
  block of clay&quot; that you can hold.&nbsp; Don't worry, they're light.<br>
  <br>
  Head over to the pottery wheel.&nbsp; Before you start, remember this, drill 
  it into your brain... EVERY operation of the pottery wheel requires one flask 
  of water.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what you are making, or converting, everything 
  requires one flask of water. <br>
  <br>
  You're going to start by simply converting clay blocks back and forth.&nbsp; 
  This part of the operation causes you to waste blocks of clay, but they're cheap 
  and the skill points start to climb quite steadily and quickly, as this is the 
  easiest operation of all.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  1: Click on the pottery wheel, up will pop the Pottery Wheel window. <br>
  2: Open up a backpack.&nbsp; Drag the two windows side-by-side over close to 
  your water, making it a short move from the backpack and the water over to the 
  Pottery Wheel.<br>
  3: Place 3 small blocks of clay and a flask of water in the Pottery Wheel, and 
  click Combine.&nbsp; <br>
  4: If it works, &quot;You have increased your skill in Pottery! (1)&quot;, you 
  will now have a &quot;block of clay&quot;, medium-size.&nbsp; (It doesn't say 
  medium, but it is.) &nbsp; Put that block of clay back in your backpack, but 
  remember where you're putting the &quot;blocks of clay&quot; so you don't get 
  them confused with the &quot;small blocks of clay&quot;.<small><br>
  <br>
  </small>The result is that you've lost two small blocks of clay, but hopefully 
  you've gained one or two skill points in Pottery.&nbsp; Repeat step 3 until 
  you reach about 40 or so in skill.<br>
  <br>
  If you run out of small blocks of clay, start converting the medium ones back 
  to smalls by placing one medium block of clay and one flask of water in the 
  Pottery Wheel and clicking Combine.&nbsp; You'll get back a small block of clay.<br>
  <br>
  One potential way to save some money, though it will cost you a lot in time, 
  is to kill Muddites in Beholder for their clay.&nbsp; The Muddite Minors typically 
  drop one or two blocks of clay of various sizes, and the Muddite Elders drop 
  one to several blocks of clay, blocks of ore, and sometimes blocks of silver, 
  electrum, and more.&nbsp; However, Beholder is a goodly way from Halas, making 
  for a long run just to save a couple platinum in clay.<small><br>
  <br>
  </small>Once you're getting near 40 in skill, start saving up the medium blocks 
  of clay and clearing out the small ones by converting them.&nbsp; In the next 
  step you'll need medium blocks of clay. <small><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="2"><br>
  I don't remember exactly how long it took to reach 40, but I remember at some 
  points thinking, &quot;Wow, I've increased my skill on the last 10 operations 
  in a row!&quot; &nbsp; It doesn't take long.&nbsp; At some point (around 25 
  maybe?) you will start to get messages saying &quot;This task is trivial for 
  someone of your skill.&quot; or something like that.&nbsp; I continued converting 
  clay back and forth simply because it's cheap and my skill was continuing to 
  go up at a good rate.&nbsp; I didn't feel any particular need to rush onto something 
  more expensive with more failures.<br>
  <br>
  For the next stage I recommend making pie tins.&nbsp; Others like small jars 
  and then medium jars.&nbsp; I liked pie tins.&nbsp; I don't have the recipes 
  for the jars memorized, so if you want to do jars you'll have to buy a Book 
  of Basic Pottery and read through it.&nbsp; Additionally, finished jars cannot 
  be put into a backpack, or so I'm told, unlike pie tins, making your work more 
  complicated once you start making bunches of them.&nbsp; (Hint: Stick with pie 
  tins...)<br>
  <br>
  So, you're ready to move onto bigger and better things.&nbsp; Setup your 8 general 
  inventory slots like this: 6 backpacks, one 20-stack of water, and one 20-stack 
  of pie tin sketches.&nbsp; Fill 5 of the backpacks with blocks of clay (the 
  medium ones, called &quot;block of clay&quot;.)&nbsp; The sixth backpack should 
  contain three 20-stacks of water, three 20-stacks of pie tin sketches, one 20-stack 
  of food to eat, and one 20-stack of water (or something) for you to drink.<br>
  <br>
  Keep in mind, you can only have two windows open at once.&nbsp; When your water 
  stack runs out (or the sketches), you'll have to grab a stack from the sixth 
  backpack and place them in the now empty slots in your general inventory.<br>
  <br>
  1: Click on the pottery wheel, up will pop the Pottery Wheel window.<br>
  2: Open up a backpack.&nbsp; Drag the two windows side-by-side over close to 
  your water and sketches, making it a short move from the backpack and the water/sketches 
  over to the Pottery Wheel.<br>
  3: Place two blocks of clay, one pie tin sketch and one flask of water in the 
  Pottery Wheel and click Combine.<br>
  4: If it works, &quot;You have increased your skill in Pottery! (41)&quot;, 
  you will now have an &quot;unfired pie tin&quot;.&nbsp; Put that unfired pie 
  tin back in your backpack (or Destroy it, read on...)<br>
  <br>
  When you've gone through all your inventory, and now have a bunch of unfired 
  pie tins, you have a choice.&nbsp; You can either go buy an equal number of 
  High-Quality Firing Sheets and fire them into Pie Tins ready to be sold to the 
  nearest vendor, or you can simply Destroy them saving the cost of buying the 
  HQ firing sheets and all the failures and wasted money.&nbsp; There are two 
  reasons to simply destroy the unfired pie tins (in fact, I destroyed them before 
  I even put them in my backpacks.)&nbsp; First, you have to buy a High-Quality 
  Firing Sheet for every unfired pie tin.&nbsp; They are not cheap. Given the 
  number of failures on firing that I initially saw, I stopped buying them and 
  started destroying the unfired tins.&nbsp; Second, not once out of the several 
  pie tins that I did actually successfully fire, did I EVER see my skill go up 
  in Pottery.&nbsp; All Pottery skill (apparently) comes from the wheel, and not 
  from the kiln, so why waste time and money on something that's not going to 
  increase your skill?<br>
  <br>
  If you DO want to fire your unfired pie tins, head over to the Kiln.&nbsp; Click 
  on it to open it up, and place one unfired pie tin and one High-Quality Firing 
  Sheet in it. &nbsp; Click Combine.&nbsp; If it works, you'll be presented with 
  a Pie Tin, ready for sale to the nearest vendor for a staggering 1-3 gp, depending 
  on your Charisma. <br>
  <br>
  When I first started making the unfired pie tins, I got a lot of failures.&nbsp; 
  However, I was kind of expecting that.&nbsp; I knew I was there to make any 
  money, only to increase my skill.&nbsp; Even when a Combine failed, very often 
  my skill would still go up anyway.<br>
  <br>
  I continued to make (and destroy) unfired pie tins up to 100.&nbsp; I then went&nbsp; 
  on to try making vials.&nbsp; It took several tries, but eventually successfully 
  made some and successfully fired them as well.&nbsp; Vials require Master skill 
  in Pottery, one small block of clay, one vial sketch, one flask of water, and 
  one skin (NOT ruined). &nbsp; The following is an incomplete list of which skins 
  have been shown to work in the making of poison vials.&nbsp; If you try a skin 
  and it's not one of the skins which will work you will get &quot;Those items 
  did not Combine in those quantities to create anything.&quot;, or something 
  like that.<br>
  <br>
  - Low Quality Bear Skin<br>
  - Low/Med/High Quality Cat Pelt<br>
  - Polar Bear Skin<br>
  - Puma Skin<br>
  - White Wolf Skin<br>
  - Black Wolf Skin<br>
  - Grizzly Bear Skin<br>
  - Zombie Skin<br>
  - BlackBurrow Gnoll Skin<br>
  - Mist Wolf Pelt<br>
  <br>
  If you're going to get serious about making poison vials, you may want to consider 
  going after zombie skins, since they have a huge bonus in being stackable!<br>
  <br>
  So, if you've made it all the way through this message, I hope you find this 
  information useful.&nbsp; If so, please let me know.&nbsp; I'm interested in 
  hearing if other people are able to Master pottery the same way I was. <br>
  <br>
  Epilogue: Once I reached level 20 (and got my &quot;Make Poison&quot; skill), 
  I bought the &quot;Morter and Pestle&quot; and &quot;Suspension&quot; required 
  for making poison and (with a few failures) made several vials of poison.&nbsp; 
  Now that poison has been adjusted slightly, I may give it another try and see 
  how it works in use.</font></small><br>

  A quicker way to make pottery is to just make medium bowls (this is post nerfing 
  of pottery to get rid of profits). You need a medium bowl sketch, 1 water flask, 
  and a block of clay (not small and not large). Combine in the wheel and watch 
  the skills raise. Destroy all bowls you make and do not fire them as you will 
  get no skill increase from firing. With a 67 int and 80 wisdom, I was able to 
  hit 107 skill with slightly over 22 plat in costs and about 2 hours of time 
  expenditure.</small></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font SIZE="2" face="Times New Roman"><small> I did this 
  in freeport with a Halfling Rogue who had not done any of the rogue quests in 
  freeport. All pottery items you need for this method can be found in north freeport. 
  Medium Bowl sketches are in the first door on left after you leave the bank, 
  water is in the next building on the left as you leave bank. Clay can be found 
  at Groflah's Forge (?? not sure if that is the right forge but its one of the 
  ones in north freeport). The pottery wheel is to the right as you enter the 
  marketplace (behind the first row of buildings, next to the little halfling 
  woman that is part of one of the rogues quests). I recently went back and spent 
  just about 4 more plat and less than 1/2 hour of time to take my pottery skill 
  up to 122. Now all I need is some components for making vials :-) <br>

  the Deepwater Harpoon easily*</strong></font><br>
  </a><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="2"><small><br>
  </small>I have *heard* that this was &quot;nerfed&quot;, but haven't tried it 
  in a while, &nbsp; so I can't say for sure. But, a few weeks ago a friend and 
  I found out how to &nbsp; get DeepWater Harpoons (DMG: 18; DLY: 40; STA: +5; 
  WIS: +5) without having to &nbsp; do the long/complicated Erudin Quest.&nbsp; 
  INSTEAD, you can do this:<br>
  <br>
  You must have a Druid for this to work smoothly (two Druids is best). In&nbsp; 
  preperation for this, get a lot of batwings. A stack of 20 should do. Hop on&nbsp; 
  the boat from FreePort to ButcherBlock. Get off at Sister Isle. Have your Druid 
  levitate himself and you, and head towards the island&nbsp; with the Gargoyles 
  and Spectres (its near the island where the Oracle&nbsp; spawns). Be careful, 
  at night Gargoyles spawn (approx. level 20ish), and WILL&nbsp; attack you if 
  you get to close. Once there, have your Druid bind himself to the Gargoyle Island. 
  Once&nbsp; that's done, the Druid most go BACK to Sister Isle and talk to a 
  named Sister&nbsp; of Erollisi (she is alone in a single hut near the docks). 
  Ask her, &quot;Where is&nbsp; Xyrin?&quot;. She'll blab on about something, 
  and also triggers Sentry Xyrin's&nbsp; spawn. Xyrin will spawn on the island 
  where the Druid is bound. Have your&nbsp; Druid gate back. Once your Druid is 
  back, have him get within casting range of the&nbsp; Spectres, have him target 
  a Spectre, and wait.&nbsp; You will target Xyrin, and wait as well.&nbsp; After 
  a while (seems like forever), Xyrin will CHARGE up the hill to the&nbsp; Spectres 
  (she dies if she engages the Spectres BTW) with the intent to kill&nbsp; them. 
  Tell your Druid, &quot;INC&quot; (or something along that lines, just make sure&nbsp; 
  the Druid knows she's coming). At this point the Druid should cast some type&nbsp; 
  of DD (no snare or root) on a Spectre, and run like hell out to the ocean&nbsp; 
  (your Druid should constantly keep Levitate and SoW on himself). Once the Spectres 
  are all clear, run up to where Xyrin is (she should be&nbsp; standing by herself), 
  and pull her to the shore (a bow, or a whack on the&nbsp; head is sufficient). 
  Let her kill you (you can easily have a mule do this).&nbsp; Back to the Druid. 
  Once the Druid knows you have successfully pulled&nbsp; Xyrin, he should immediately 
  gate and camp. Which causes the Spectres to go&nbsp; back to their perches.&nbsp; 
  After ten minutes of being unmolested, Xyrin *poofs* and in her place is&nbsp; 
  a DeepWater Harpoon (NOTE: IT IS DROPPED ON THE GROUND). It may be deemed an 
  exploit by some, but its a damned good way to make&nbsp; money (well, it was 
  until everyone and their dog found out about it on the &nbsp; Tunare Server 
  :P).<br>

<font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000" size="2"> 
<p>1). Cleric &quot;Atone&quot; method: Find a level 34 or higher Cleric. Have 
  him root &amp; blast the mob almost to death and then cast Atone. Atone will 
  wipe the &quot;hate list&quot; (including the damage amounts) from the mobs 
  memory. You finish the almost dead creature off and boom, you get all the EXP. 
  This method also works if you got a high level tank helping, he whips it almost 
  to death, Cleric Atones it, you kill it for the EXP.<br>
  <br>
  2). Enchanter &quot;Mesmerize&quot; method: Find a level 16 or higher Enchanter. 
  Have him root &amp; blast the mob almost to death and then cast Mesmerize. Mesmerize 
  will wipe the &quot;hate list&quot; (including the damage amounts) from the 
  mobs memory. You finish the almost dead creature off and boom, you get all the 
  EXP. This method also works if you got a high level tank helping, he whips it 
  almost to death, Enchanter mesmerizes it, you kill it for the EXP. ** Enchanters 
  also have an AOE Mesmerize to use as well. This method really needs a tank to 
  be effective (Enchanters rock, but are not the greatest DD casters).<br>
  <br>
  3). Tank &quot;Zone&quot; method: Find an appropriate level tank (usually 10 
  levels above the target mobs) and have him pull the mobs to you very close to 
  a zone border. The tank begins beating the mob to death. You make sure that 
  you are beating on the mob during this time so the mob remembers you. When the 
  tank gets the mob almost dead, he zones and you proceed to kill the mob. You 
  get the EXP. The tank can zone back in ASAP in case it gets bad for you and 
  if you have been beating on the mob the entire time, he can usually help you 
  kill it quicker when he zones back. ** This one will take a little practice 
  to determine how dead he needs to make the mob and how much he can &quot;help&quot; 
  when he zones back. </p>
<p>3a). Done with a Necro and a Newbie. Pull to a newbie at the zone and beat 
  the mod down and then load it up with DoT's and then zone. The newbie just needs 
  to hit the mobs once, the DoT's will kill it and the newbie gets all the xp. 
  This requires timing just like the tank zone method, but at least the newbie 
  doesn't have to worry about not being able to kill the mob after the Necro zones. 
  If done right, the DoT's guarantee that the mob will die. Should work with any 
  class that gets DoT's, but Necro's would be best because they have so many stackable 
  DoT's.<br>
  <br>
  4). The EXP quest methods. You know these, if you got plat to burn, you can 
  use them.<br>
  <br>
  Please realize that SOW is helpful in all these cases in case the crap hits 
  the fan. Also know that a combo of the above methods works better than any single 
  method. The perfect powerleveling group involves: <br>
  <br>
  1 Healer (Cleric)<br>
  1 Traveller's Aid (SOW) (Druid or Shaman)<br>
  1 Tank<br>
  1 Newbie needing power levels. <br>

  Trumpy Tonics! So you can buy the nuts then gate back to FP to make them. This 
  saves you the trip to Kaladim to get the nuts converted. They are trivial at 
  135 and the recipe is 1 Kiola Nut and 1 Water.<b><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </b> Now, Groflah Steadirt misses Kaladim and wants his Tumpy Tonics. He spawns 
  in SeaFarer's Roost in East Freeport for sure, and I seem to remember him somewhere 
  else too. To get a "Tumpy Tonic" you have to actually RIDE the boat (you read 
  that right) and get off at Sister Island. Goto the merchant (not the dwarf) 
  and buy as many kiola nuts as you can hold. After getting these I recommend 
  gating to ButcherBlock and running over to Kaladim. If you are one of those 
  mean dwarf killers you need to make a newbie dwarf and give him all of your 
  kiola nuts. Inside Kaladim there is some bar. Tumpy Irontoe is the only NPC 
  in the bar and will make you a Tumpy Tonic if you give him a flask of water 
  (not foraged) and a kiola nut. Do this with all of your kiola nuts and then 
  gate back to FP. If Groflah Steadirt isn't up, just wait, he will be there soon. 
  The factions you get for quest are all positive. </p>
<p>RunDown - Be bound in Seafarer's Roost in Freeport and ride boat to Sister 
  Island. Buy all the Kiola Nuts you can hold and gate to ButcherBlock. Go into 
  Kaladim and convert nuts and water into tonics. Gate back to FP and give to 
  Groflah. Faction is: +CoalitionTradesFolk, +CoalitionTradesFolkIII, +something 
  else. (no bad faction)</p>
<p> This quest is almost worth it for TradesFolk faction!</p>
<p> <b>*Figures of Tonics for exp*</b><br>
  At level 49 it is about 540 tonics to a bubble.<br>
  At level 37 (one bubble down from 38) it took 1240 tonicsto get 3 bubbles into 
  38.<br>
  At level 36 (half a bub from 37) it took 1240 tonics to get to a bubble away 
  from 38.<br>
  At level 34 it is about 320 tonics for 2 and a half bubbles.<br>
  At level 33 it takes 186 to get one bubble.<br>
  At level 26 it is about 112 tonics to a bubble. <br>
  At level 23 480 tonics gets from 1 bubble on lvl 23 to just past 2 bubbles on 
  lvl 24.<br>
</p>
<p><b>(Getting Graflah to Spawn)</b><br>
  Get a newbie paladin, and give the spy note to ALayle in the milita guard house, 
  go directly to Graflah in the forge in north freeport and give the note to him 
  repeatedly 15-20 times (in spirit of the 'peak times' idea, dunno if necessary), 
  he gives the note back to you so this should take about 5 seconds. Camp the 
  newbie paly right there for your next completion of the quest. You should have 
  already gotten all the tonics you can afford. Sit in the bar stacking the tonics 
  in your empty backpacks in groups of 4 (they can be handed to graflah in stacks 
  of 4, but no more) until the dark elf chick spawns away from the bar along the 
  back wall. When it is about 4 PM relog your secondary character to kill her 
  and take the faction hit. My secondary character is a level 14 druid with maxed 
  out INT (don't ask), and I had no problem killing her. Relog and dump your tonics 
  on graflah, cause he will spawn as soon as it's dark. Gate to the island and 
  do it all over again. <br>
