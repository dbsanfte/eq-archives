  contained in this document was not found by myself.&nbsp; Most of it comes from 
  an EQ Spoiler mail list and various message boards.&nbsp; The stats on the items 
  were taken either from <a
href="http://gameznet.com/eq/">EQ'Lizer</a> or <a
href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/index.html">Allakhazam' s</a>.&nbsp; The 
  only credit I take is collecting and formating the information into the html 
  that you see here.&nbsp; The titles in <font color="#0000FF">blue</font><font color="#000000"> 
  are items that I have verified or has been verified by someone I know directly.&nbsp; 
  The rest of the info is most likely correct but may not be.&nbsp;What I need 
  from you guys are images of spawn points, detailed descriptions of how to get 
  to the spawns points from zone lines or easily recognizable structures, and 
  corrections to info that I have here, and new items.&nbsp; If you can help me 
  out with any of this please send it to <a

<p><font size="2">1-6 : Seems that some have been having problems with the site 
  since I added the frames, so for the time being I have changed it back to one 
  page. In the future please send problems to me and not the spoiler list itself. 
  I haven't had much time to update recently because I have been busy with other 
  things, not the least of which is leveling out of a Hell Level. I have lots 
  of information that I have found and is just waiting to be added. Also it seems 
  that noone is gonna send in images of spawn points so that will be updating 
  slowly as I will add them when I take them. The other pages (Faction/ Zone-Gudes/ 
  ect) will be in Limbo till I get around to fixing the layout which should be 
  sometime this weekend. Oh yeah the below links don't work either for now.</font></p>
